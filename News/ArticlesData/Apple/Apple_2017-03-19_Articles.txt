Building on that commentary by TSMC, we learn today from a report from the China Post that TSMC has now stated that they're specifically considering plans for a 3nm chip production plant in the U.S. while also considering another location in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.   TSMC said its plans for the production of chips on the 3nm process will be finalized in the first half of next year and noted that its Chairman Morris Chang (張忠謀) had not ruled out the possibility of investing in the U.S.   The original story broke by the Economic Daily News that claimed that TSMC was planning to invest NT$500 billion (US$16.39 billion) to build a 3nm plant in the U.S. since the electricity supply by Taiwan Power Co., the sole power supplier in the Taiwan, was unstable.   The report further noted that "the Taiwan government was willing to help TSMC secure land in Lujhu in Kaohsiung for a 3nm plant but the company was worried that it would not be able to obtain the environmental impact assessment in time to meet its 2022 start date for the mass production of the advanced chip process.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Fretting about running out of juice will seem quaint, like hand-cranking a car to start it. Speaking of which, I want battery-powered flying cars too. For today, though, many who are weary of dead devices resort to third-party power accessories that make charging more convenient and devices less likely to run dry. A dizzying variety of such charging accessories exists, many designed for users of Apple laptops, tablets, phones and watches. I’ve been trying out a number of these, some of which have proven helpful. I give charging accessories bonus points if they can solve two or more power problems – charging my Apple Watch along with my iPhone, say, or being compatible with multiple charging standards like Lightning, USB-C, and Micro-USB. One of the products even brings a dearly departed Apple charging technology back from the dead! Satechi 60W 6-Port Multi-Port USB Desktop Charging Station -- Like many tech geeks, I’m awash in gadgets needing to be charged. A multi-port charging station makes this chore simpler to handle since I don’t have to wrestle with an assortment of individual chargers, each needing its own AC outlet. I’ve used a number of such charging stations over the years, but with the advent of USB-C, I’ve been on the lookout for an updated power station. Satechi’s $29.99 six-port variant has worked out nicely so far. Available in black or white, the charging station sports four USB-A ports and two USB-C ports, permitting me to charge everything from iOS devices and Bluetooth audio accessories to newer Apple notebooks. I have just a few quibbles. Because it lacks rubber feet, the Satechi charging station slides around awkwardly no matter where I place it. In desperation, I resorted to clamping the Satechi in a vertical notebook stand. It’s also a bit big to take on the road. In addition, Satechi’s charging station emits a low-pitched but persistent hum when plugged into a power outlet and switched on; the hum drove me nuts until I pinpointed the source. I’ve since grown used to it, but if you’re sensitive to noise, it might be a deal-breaker. Nomad Ultra Rugged Cable Series -- When grabbing a charging cord for the road, most iOS users take the one that came with their devices. There is no added cost, and Apple’s Lightning cables are thin and coil well. However, they’re also notoriously prone to fraying or otherwise failing prematurely. I’ve been testing a trio of alternatives from Nomad called Ultra Rugged Cables. Other companies sell such cables, but Nomad has added a few nice twists. All of Nomad’s cables are made of extra-thick wire sheathed in Kevlar and braided ballistic nylon. This makes them durable and tangle-resistant (and looks cool) but adds weight and bulk. In addition to a $29.95 Lightning cable, Nomad sells a $39.95 Battery Cable that incorporates a cylindrical battery and a $39.95 Universal Cable that is three charging cables in one: Lightning, Micro-USB, and USB-C. I focused my testing on the latter two cables. The Battery Cable provides roughly one entire iPhone charge when topped off, and itself charges when it’s plugged into a wall charger or computer via its USB-A prong. The battery is not, however, rated for iPad charging. This is why I sometimes saw a Not Charging message when plugging the cable into an iPad Pro, although trickle charging did occur. An iPad will charge just fine with the cable plugged into a power source, though. You may appreciate the fact that the Battery Cable is 1.5 meters (nearly 5 feet) long, as are its siblings. I find it useful for snaking the cable out of my backpack and into my iPhone with length to spare. Or it may seem like an excessive length. To determine how much charging capacity is left in the battery, you press a little button to make an adjacent light turn on. If the light is white, you have between 30 and 100 percent capacity. If it’s orange, you’ve gone below 30 percent and need to recharge soon. Nomad’s Universal Cable pulls off its three-in-one trick by providing a USB-A to Micro-USB cable, and then adding two adapters or “tips,” attached to the cord via rubber strips, that each fit atop the Micro-USB prong to turn it into a Lightning or USB-C prong. This approach works nicely, though wrestling one adapter into place while keeping the other out of the way can be a bit awkward at times. Charging the 2016 MacBook Pro in my home office was a cinch, with the Universal Cable’s USB-C tip jacked into the notebook and its USB-A end plugged into the Satechi charging station. I’ve also used the Universal Cable to charge my iPhone, my iPad, non-Apple smartphones with USB-C ports, and an array of Micro-USB accessories, such as audio headsets. All three Ultra Rugged Cables include sturdy, stretchy, attached silicone ties for keeping the accessories in tight bundles for transport. They partly make up for how bulky the cords are compared to regular cables. BreakSafe Magnetic USB-C Power Cable -- Many people who have upgraded to recent Apple notebooks with USB-C ports have mourned the loss of MagSafe charging. With that beloved technology, charging prongs engaged with corresponding laptop ports magnetically, and readily disengaged if the laptop was unexpectedly yanked. MagSafe prevented an untold number of damaged Macs due to people tripping over cords. USB-C doesn’t work like that, unfortunately. Its charging prongs fit in more deeply and do not pull out as easily, which can be a problem in the aforementioned yanking scenarios. Griffin thinks it has the answer with its $39.99 BreakSafe Magnetic USB-C Cable. This ingenious product consists of a USB-C to USB-C cable with a detachable tip at one end. That’s the end that goes into a laptop’s USB-C port. Then, if the cable is accidentally pulled, it readily detaches from the tip, leaving only that dongle connected. This is, basically, MagSafe with a new name, BreakSafe. I used the BreakSafe cable with the 2016 MacBook Pro, and it performed splendidly. Though clever, the cable’s two piece design isn’t perfect. To replicate MagSafe functionality fully, you have to leave the tip plugged into the laptop at all times, which is clunkier than an integrated MagSafe port and potentially perilous if the tip catches on something and twists enough to damage the port. You could detach the BreakSafe cable and its tip entirely when you are done working and stash the accessory in your bag for transport. But you have to take care that the tip doesn’t accidentally detach from the cable and disappear. That happened to me twice, but I managed to find the tip each time. One other quibble: the BreakSafe cable, like Nomad’s Ultra Rugged Cables, is bulkier and heavier than Apple’s standard USB-C to USB-C cables, which makes for a bit more of a burden while on the go. Logitech Base -- When Apple unveiled its iPad Pro tablet line, it also introduced the Smart Connector. This port, built into one of the iPad’s long edges, is designed to engage with accessories, such as keyboard cases, for power as well as data transfer. After Apple announced the Smart Connector, many expected a flurry of third-party accessories that would tap into this technology. The expected flood has been more of a trickle. Logitech, though, has been on board with a handful of Smart Connector-compatible gadgets. These include a couple of Create keyboard cases along with an iPad Pro charging stand called the Base. The $99.99 Base, which mimics the look and feel of the iMac’s metal base, holds an iPad Pro erect in landscape orientation, at a slight angle, while linking it to power via a Smart Connector at the bottom. The Base accommodates either a 9.7-inch or a 12.9-inch iPad Pro and, we can hope, future iPad Pro variants. It works as a stand for other iPad models too, but obviously without the charging capability. I found the Base handy for charging an iPad Pro while also working on it via a Bluetooth keyboard. The iPad became a cute little desk workstation, though I found the fixed viewing angle less than ideal. The rest of the time, I’ve kept the iPad on the Base alongside my iMac as a secondary display for monitoring email, news, and social-media feeds. The Base itself gets power via a Lightning port in the back. If you have the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, though, you might want to buy a Lightning to USB-C cable along with Apple’s 29-watt USB-C Power Adapter (see “iPad Pro Charges Faster with MacBook Adapter and New Cable,” 27 April 2016). Belkin Valet Charger Power Pack for Apple Watch + iPhone -- I love to travel but hate the clutter that all of the cords and chargers for my tech gear tends to create. Belkin’s $99.99 Valet Charger Power Pack for Apple Watch + iPhone reduces this clutter by building an Apple Watch charging disk onto a portable battery pack. It lets me leave the crazy long Apple Watch charging cord at home and pack just a Lightning cable for my iPhone. Alas, Belkin’s Valet is far from the standard set by P. G. Wodehouse’s Jeeves. It sports only one USB port, so forget about charging more than one device at once. As battery packs go, it’s kind of puny for the money — you can buy a battery pack with two or more ports, fast-charging capability (which the Valet lacks) and greater charging capacity for half the price. Despite these issues, the Valet suits my needs. It’s compact, unlike other massive battery packs in my collection. Even so, it provides three full iPhone charges or eight Apple Watch charges, not that I can imagine the situation where you’d need a week of Apple Watch charges without being able to get to any other form of power. Three More Accessories -- I want to touch briefly on three other gadgets that have proven useful to me in various scenarios. Nomad’s Car Charger With Battery is just that, a device charger that plugs into a car’s accessory port but also incorporates a battery so it can charge your iPhone once, fully, away from the car. Yet the charger is compact, even more so than Belkin’s Valet. The Nomad charger has two ports, USB-A and USB-C – the latter a nod to the rising number of non-Apple phones and accessories with USB-C ports. But you can charge two iPhones if you have a Lightning to USB-C cable for one of them. This works fine in the car, but the battery does not have enough capacity to top off two such devices. If this product strikes your fancy, grab it now since it has disappeared from Nomad’s site but can still be found at resellers such as Amazon for about $50. Nomad also sells a $19.95 NomadPlus for iPhone accessory that adds a small battery to Apple’s regular iPhone charging plug. The Apple charger and Nomad battery fuse together well, with Apple’s white accessory fitting into a square hole in the black Nomad mini-brick. The battery tops up while the Apple charger is plugged into the wall so that users have auxiliary power for their iPhones when they are away from wall outlets. The third and simplest accessory is a $39.99 Belkin dongle called Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar that transforms an iPhone’s single Lightning port into two Lightning ports. It thus allows for uninterrupted charging while using a set of Lightning EarPods for listening to music — or, in my case, as a journalist, for conducting tons of telephone interviews with my hands free for taking notes on a keyboard while not fretting about running low on juice. Go, Go, Power Gadgets -- So many clever charging accessories exist for Apple devices that this article has scarcely scratched the surface. Such an accessory ecosystem is a good example of how Apple’s intentionally sparse product selection can be augmented by third-party purveyors to spectacular effect. You certainly could make do with the charging equipment that Apple provides for its computers and mobile gear – but why would you want to, with so many other accessories that can make your life easier?   READERS LIKE YOU!

Reply Julio Ojeda-Zapata  2017-03-19 15:59 More stories to come, I'm sure! Reply Tripp Frohlichstein  2017-03-19 14:24 About the first device, you write, "Because it lacks rubber feet, the Satechi charging station slides around awkwardly no matter where I place it. In desperation, I resorted to clamping the Satechi in a vertical notebook stand. It’s also a bit big to take on the road." Try velcro. Works great and is what I use on my bed stand. Reply Julio Ojeda-Zapata  2017-03-19 15:59 Good idea! Reply Bruce Blakely  2017-03-20 15:35 From back in the 30-pin day, my wife has an iPhone charging stand that is also a USB-2 hub (multiple USB ports in base). Still usable with the 30-pin to lightning adapter, but as far as I've been able to tell, no similar device was ever built with lightning built-in (much less USB-3). Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-03-20 20:57 I just picked up a 4-port (2 each 1A; 2 each 2A) charger by SyncWire. It puts out a total of 34watts so you can charge 2 devices that require 10w and 2 that only require 5w at the same time. Of course you can instead charge 5w devices using the 10w ports and since you will only be drawing 1amp from all 4 ports this way, you'll only be consuming just over 20watts. I plan on using it during a 30 day trip this summer to charge my iPhone, my iPad, and my Watch each night. I bought it from Amazon https://tinyurl.com/k7nf8rb Reply Jerry  2017-03-21 06:51 The only alternative charging solution of much interest to Apple's own would be a solution to make use of old MagSafe chargers - still waiting for that. (Bought the MagSafe, but has not used it as it is bulky and too easy breaks away since the cable is so stiff, so not much use there either.)

their own custom apps to rapidly analyze for data policy compliance and security risks News provided by Lookout Mar 20, 2017, 10:00 ET Share this article SAN FRANCISCO, March 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Lookout, the global leader in securing mobility, has expanded its enterprise security solution, Lookout Mobile Endpoint Security, to address the most pressing needs of iOS-centric organizations and accelerate the adoption of secure mobility. Lookout and Apple understand mobile is transforming the way business is done, and as mobile productivity increases, enterprises are developing their own apps to take advantage of this transformation. As a new Apple mobility partner, Lookout is introducing enterprise app review to enable enterprises building their own iOS apps to rapidly analyze them for data policy compliance and security risks. With enterprise app review, custom iOS apps are uploaded into the Lookout Security Cloud for correlation against a 40-million-app database to uncover anomalies before distribution via internal app stores. Many enterprises have unique compliance policies that specify how corporate data should be stored and transmitted, including while in use on mobile devices and in apps. Some mobile apps or public Wi-Fi networks compromise company or industry policies. For example, enterprise apps developed by third parties and distributed through internal app stores may lack sufficient encryption to protect customer or patient data.      "Enterprises must be confident that their data is secure while employees are working anywhere in the world," said Santosh Krishnan, Lookout chief product officer. "This new functionality is addressing mobile compliance as part of our collective mission to help organizations seamlessly embrace mobile productivity in the workplace." In addition to reviewing custom apps, Lookout Mobile Endpoint Security can also review apps downloaded from the App Store. While vetted and approved through Apple's stringent App Store approval process, some apps may automatically send contact or location information to an external server which may directly contradict corporate policy. Plus, with the rise of mobile productivity on the go, employees are frequently connecting to public Wi-Fi networks which could expose corporate data in transit.  Lookout Mobile Endpoint Security extends the built-in security of the iOS platform by leveraging the Lookout Security Cloud to provide enterprises with visibility and protection across network threats and suspicious behaviors for apps that are built in-house and distributed via MDM for iOS. Lookout customers will be able to: Identify risk within in-house built apps: As enterprises develop apps to create mobile workflows that improve productivity among employees or customers, developers will be able to quickly submit apps for review. This review provides immediate data on non-compliant app behaviors, malware, and code vulnerabilities, while also providing visibility into whether an app has unsanctioned or private APIs written into its code. Enable employees to work safely on the go: Lookout secures employee devices and data through an automatic on-device analysis of network connections to defend against attacks and ensure information is being securely transmitted. Take steps towards reaching compliance on mobile: Enterprises now have visibility into apps installed within their employee base that may be out of compliance with corporate security policies and/or industry regulations. Exclusively for iOS, enterprises can see which apps connect to cloud services and those that could potentially violate corporate data policy, such as sharing contact and location information. Lookout will also provide enterprises with insights into whether iOS apps are taking advantage of the newest security features in iOS. Lookout Mobile Endpoint Security is sold through Lookout's Channel Partner Program. For iOS-specific enterprise employees, the Lookout app can be downloaded from the App Store.

The company is also said to be working on other AR products such as digital spectacles that could connect wirelessly to an iPhone and transmit movies, maps and other information to the wearer. Mike Rockwell, former EVP of Products and Technology at Dolby, is running the AR team with key engineers including Fletcher Rothkopf who helped lead the Apple Watch team; Tomlinson Holman who created THX, Cody White, former lead engineer of Amazon's Lumberyard virtual reality platform; Duncan McRoberts, former director of software development at Meta; Yury Petrov, former Oculus researcher; and Avi Bar-Zeev, who worked on HoloLens and Google Earth. Apple wants to bring AR enhancements to the iPhone's camera which could include the ability to change the depth of a photo or even isolate objects. One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person's head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person, much the way Snapchat works. To make these features possible, the iPhone 8 will reportedly gain a 'revolutionary' front camera with 3D sensing capabilities.

Apple could be putting together an augmented reality team Posted Mar 20, 2017 by Romain Dillet (@romaindillet) 0 SHARES Next Story Bixby is Samsung’s new ‘intelligent interface’ for smartphones and beyond Apple could be betting big on augmented reality. According to a new Bloomberg report, the company could be working on augmented reality features for the iPhone and then later for glasses, a new device that you would pair with your smartphone. While the hypothetical pair of glasses is nowhere near ready, it’s still interesting to see what Apple is working on behind the scenes. And it first starts with a team. Mike Rockwell is apparently leading the new augmented reality team. He previously worked for Dolby on new technologies and hardware. Last Spring, Rockwell put together a team of experienced engineers when it comes to augmented reality. According to Bloomberg, members of the team include: Cody White, a former lead Amazon engineer who worked on Amazon’s CryEngine game engine fork Duncan McRoberts, the former director of software development at Meta Yury Petrov, a former Oculus researcher Avi Bar-Zeev, a former Amazon and Microsoft engineer who worked on HoloLens, among other things Various engineers working on special effects for Hollywood blockbusters Hardware and software engineers who were working on other projects at Apple also joined the team. Apple also acquired Metaio and Flyby Media for those projects. Overall, hundreds of engineers could be working on augmented reality right now. All of this sounds cool, but it doesn’t really tell us what Apple has in store for its users. Details are thin on this front in Bloomberg’s report. Apple could start with basic augmented reality features in the Camera app, such as selfie filters and real-time object detection, starting with faces. In other words, you can expect Snapchat-style filters built into iOS soon. While this is not augmented reality per se, the company could also go beyond Portrait Mode by letting you adjust the focus on an image after taking a photo. And that’s about all we know so far. If Apple is serious about augmented reality, there should be something more than this. Bloomberg talks about new augmented reality glasses so you can add virtual data to the world around you, but it sounds like the company itself doesn’t know what it wants to do with the new device yet. As always, take this information with a grain of salt. And let’s see if iOS 11 gives us hints about Apple’s augmented reality bet. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Let’s Talk iOS 179: Not just a virtual or augmented reality The top stories of the week on iDB The best smart scales   skip to main content skip to main menu     New Bloomberg report details Apple’s AR efforts By Christian Zibreg, Mar 20, 2017 Tweet Leave a Comment Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman in a new report Monday offered a deeper insight into Apple’s next big thing—the company’s secretive efforts related to augmented reality (AR) technologies which reportedly include an iPhone-connected digital spectacles that the news organization previously said would launch in 2018. Citing people with knowledge of Apple’s plans, the report states that the company’s built a team combining the strengths of its hardware and software veterans with the expertise of talented outsiders. The group is allegedly being run by former Dolby Laboratories executive Mike Rockwell and includes engineers who worked on Facebook’s Oculus and Microsoft’s HoloLens virtual reality headsets “as well as digital-effects wizards from Hollywood.” Hundreds of engineers are now focused on the project. The report states that the glasses “are a ways off” though some of the aforementioned AR features could show up in the next iPhone sooner. One of the features of Apple’s digital spectacles could allow the user to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later. Another feature would isolate an object in the image, like a person’s head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. Yet another feature in development could add special effects and put virtual objects on a person akin to Snapchat. Apple’s CEO is reportedly “very serious” about AR and has embarked the firm on an ambitious bid to bring the technology to the masses to ensure it “dominates the next generation of gadgetry and keep people wedded to its ecosystem.” Rather than completely enclose the user in virtual worlds, Apple’s digital glasses would overlay images, video and games on the real world like Microsoft’s HoloLens. The accessory would connect to an iPhone like Apple Watch and use its processor to render and show content in augmented reality, including movies, maps and more. Microsoft HoloLens Development Edition. This would consume a lot of power so battery life and availability of AR-enabled apps and games will be crucial. The glasses will require a new operating system from Apple, joining iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS, and maybe even a dedicated chip. Apple’s AR team includes the following experts: Mike Rockwell—Charged with leading Apple’s AR group. Rockwell previously ran Dolby’s hardware and new technologies groups and advised Meta, a small firm that makes $950 AR glasses and counts Dolby as an investor. He reports to Dan Riccio, who’s in charge of the iPhone and iPad hardware engineering groups. Fletcher Rothkopf—Helped lead the team that designed Apple Watch. Tomlinson Holman—Created THX audio popularized by LucasFilm. Cody White—He led Amazon’s Lumberyard virtual reality platform. Duncan McRoberts—Meta’s former director of software development. Yury Petrov—Former Oculus researcher. Avi Bar-Zeev—Worked on Microsoft’s HoloLens and the Google Earth app. Other experts in everything from 3D video production to wearable hardware. iPhone, camera and optical lens engineers. People with experience in sourcing the raw materials for the glasses. The AR team’s lead, Rothkopf, is “a really sharp guy” who could certainly “put a team together that could get an Apple AR project going,” said Jack McCauley, who co-founded and worked at Oculus before it was sold to Facebook in 2015. Apple also opened an office in Wellington, New Zealand and hired away several employees from the special-effects firm Weta Digital that worked on King Kong, Avatar, The Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies and other films. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube Gurman has learned that former Metaio CEO Thomas Alt (Apple bought his firm in 2015) now works on Apple’s strategic deals team which decides which technologies to invest in. Last year, Apple also bought FlyBy Media, an AR startup that lets mobile devices “see” the world around them. “Cook even visited the offices of Magic Leap last summer and displayed interest in the secretive company’s AR technology,” as per Gurman. Apple is working on several AR products, stated Bloomberg. Apple’s boss Tim Cook opined that at some point, we will all “have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day.

By Mark Gurman. Added by Agency Staff on 20 March 2017. Saved under In-depth, Top Tags: Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Oculus, Tim Cook Tweet Tim Cook   Tim Cook has talked up a lot of technologies since becoming Apple’s chief executive in 2011. Driverless cars. Artificial intelligence. Streaming television. But no technology has fired up Cook quite like augmented reality, which overlays images, video and games on the real world. Cook has likened AR’s game-changing potential to that of the smartphone. At some point, he said last year, we will all “have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you.” Investors impatient for Apple’s next breakthrough will be happy to know that Cook is very serious about AR. People with knowledge of the company’s plans say Apple has embarked on an ambitious bid to bring the technology to the masses — an effort Cook and his team see as the best way for the company to dominate the next generation of gadgetry and keep people wedded to its ecosystem. Apple has built a team combining the strengths of its hardware and software veterans with the expertise of talented outsiders, say the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Run by a former Dolby Laboratories executive, the group includes engineers who worked on the Oculus and HoloLens virtual reality headsets sold by Facebook and Microsoft as well as digital-effects wizards from Hollywood. Apple has also acquired several small firms with knowledge of AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality software. Apple is working on several AR products, including digital spectacles that could connect wirelessly to an iPhone and beam content — movies, maps and more — to the wearer. While the glasses are some way off, AR features could show up in the iPhone sooner. Apple declined to comment. It’s an auspicious moment for Apple to move into augmented reality. The global market for AR products will surge 80% to US$165bn by 2024, according to researcher Global Market Insights. But Apple really has no choice, says Gene Munster, a founding partner at Loup Ventures who covered the company for many years as an analyst. Over time, Munster says, AR devices will replace the iPhone. “It’s something they need to do to continue to grow,” he says, “and defend against the shift in how people use hardware.” Augmented reality is the less known cousin of virtual reality. VR gets more attention because it completely immerses users in an artificial world and has an obvious attraction for gamers. So far, however, headsets like the Oculus and HoloLens are niche rather than mainstream products. Apple believes AR will be an easier sell because it’s less intrusive. Referring to VR headsets, Cook last year said he thought few people will want to be “enclosed in something”. Building a successful AR product will be no easy task, even for a company known for slim, sturdy devices. The current crop of AR glasses are either under-powered and flimsy or powerful and overwhelmingly large. Apple, the king of thin and light, will have to leapfrog current products by launching something small and powerful. Adding AR features to the iPhone isn’t a giant leap. Building glasses will be harder. Like the Watch, they’ll probably be tethered to the iPhone. While the smartphone will do the heavy lifting, beaming 3D content to the glasses will consume a lot of power, so prolonging battery life will be crucial. Content is key, too. If Apple’s AR glasses lack useful apps, immersive games and interesting media content, why would someone wear them? The glasses will also require a new operating system and perhaps even a new chip. Finally, Apple will have to source the guts of the gadget cheaply enough to make it affordable for the mass market. When it was developing the Watch, Apple put together a multidisciplinary team drawn from inside and outside the company. It has done much the same with the AR effort. In 2015, Apple recruited Mike Rockwell, who previously ran the hardware and new technologies groups at Dolby, the iconic company known for its audio and video technology. Rockwell also advised Meta, a small firm that makes $950 AR glasses and counts Dolby as an investor. Rockwell now runs the main AR team at Apple, reporting to Dan Riccio, who’s in charge of the iPhone and iPad hardware engineering groups, the people said. “He’s a really sharp guy,” says Jack McCauley, who co-founded and worked at Oculus before it was sold to Facebook in 2015. “He could certainly put a team together that could get an Apple AR project going.” Apple’s iPhone Last spring, in a sign that it’s serious about taking products to market, Apple put some of its best hardware and software people on Rockwell’s team, including Fletcher Rothkopf who helped lead the team that designed the Apple Watch, and Tomlinson Holman, who created THX, the audio standard made popular by LucasFilm. Apple has also recruited people with expertise in everything from 3D video production to wearable hardware. Among them, the people say, are Cody White, former lead engineer of Amazon’s Lumberyard virtual reality platform; Duncan McRoberts, Meta’s former director of software development; Yury Petrov, a former Oculus researcher; and Avi Bar-Zeev, who worked on the HoloLens and Google Earth. Apple has rounded out the team with iPhone, camera and optical lens engineers. There are people with experience in sourcing the raw materials for the glasses. The company has also mined the movie industry’s 3D animation ranks, the people said, opening a Wellington office and luring several employees from Weta Digital, the New Zealand special-effects shop that worked on King Kong, Avatar and other films. Besides hiring people, Apple has been busy making tactical acquisitions. In 2015, the company acquired Metaio, which developed AR software. Former Metaio CEO Thomas Alt now works on Apple’s strategic deals team, which decides which technologies to invest in. Last year, Apple also bought FlyBy Media, which makes AR-related camera software. Cook even visited the offices of Magic Leap last summer and displayed interest in the secretive company’s AR technology, the people say. Magic Leap declined to comment. Hundreds of engineers are now devoted to the cause, including some on the iPhone camera team who are working on AR-related features for the iPhone, according to one of the people. One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person’s head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person, much the way Snapchat works. The iPhone camera features would probably rely on a technology known as depth sensing and use algorithms created by PrimeSense, an Israeli company acquired in 2013. Apple may choose to not roll out these features, but such additions are an up-and-coming trend in the phone business. The AR-enhanced glasses are further down the road, the people say. Getting the product right will be key, of course. Wearables are hard. Apple’s first stab at the category, the Watch, has failed to become a mainstream hit. And no one has forgotten Google Glass, the much-derided headset that bombed in 2014. Still, time and again, Apple has waited for others to go first and then gone on to dominate the market. “To be successful in AR, there is the hardware piece, but you have to do other stuff, too: from maps to social to payments,” Munster says. “Apple is one of the only companies that will be able to pull it off.”  — (c) 2017 NewsCentral Media Reported with assistance from Alex Webb and Mark Bergen Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 77Expert warns SA on too much renewable energy 37ANC mulls plan to end DStv ‘monopoly’ 4Cell C swings to net profit of R540m 2IFC coy on Net1 allegations 2Zuma to lead grants reform Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Apple is working on "digital spectacles" that could connect to an iPhone and beam content like movies and maps, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported on Monday. The Cupertino, Calif.- based company is also working on augmented reality features for the iPhone that are similar to Snapchat, Bloomberg said. To make its augmented reality push, Apple has acquired augmented reality start-ups FlyBy Media and Metaio, and hired major players from Amazon, Facebook's Oculus, Microsoft's HoloLens, and Dolby, Bloomberg said. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple's AR ambitions don't come as a total surprise. Apple patents for augmented reality maps, facial recognition, a headset, and new camera software have surfaced this month alone. Augmented reality, which lets viewers superimpose graphics onto footage of the physical world, has become a mainstream hit with the IPO of Snap. For a deeper look inside Apple's augmented reality plans, see the article at Bloomberg.com.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Firstly, it corroborates with past reports in saying that Apple has a large number of engineers working on AR features and that it will first debut on the iPhone. Hundreds of engineers are now devoted to the cause, including some on the iPhone camera team who are working on AR-related features for the iPhone, according to one of the people. Bloomberg also describes some specific features Apple is exploring, but lacks detail. One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person’s head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person, much the way Snapchat works. However, the report does believe that Apple will be producing AR glasses in the future, despite Google’s failed attempt at them. The AR-enhanced glasses are further down the road, the people say. Getting the product right will be key, of course. Wearables are hard […] The current crop of AR glasses are either under-powered and flimsy or powerful and overwhelmingly large. Apple, the king of thin and light, will have to leapfrog current products by launching something small and powerful. The piece also notes that Apple has recruited some high-profile engineers to work on the project. Run by a former Dolby Laboratories executive, the group includes engineers who worked on the Oculus and HoloLens virtual reality headsets sold by Facebook and Microsoft as well as digital-effects wizards from Hollywood.

By Alistair Charlton March 20, 2017 14:13 GMT Fan-made render shows how augmented reality could work on the next iPhoneGabor Balogh Apple has a team of hundreds of engineers working on a way to bring augmented reality technologies to future iPhones, potentially starting with the 2017 handset, due in September, and including features similar to those of Snapchat. The news, passed to the press by Apple insiders speaking on grounds of anonymity, comes after company boss Tim Cook has repeatedly sung the praises of augmented reality (AR), believing the technology has a more promising future than that of virtual reality (VR). Speaking to the well-connected Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, the unnamed sources said Apple has a team of hundreds of engineers devoted to developing AR technologies, including some who are members of the iPhone camera team and working on AR in conjunction with future versions of the smartphone. The report states: "One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person's head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees." While flipping someone's head over doesn't sound like the most groundbreaking of image manipulation technology, another use of AI by Apple makes more sense. "A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person," the report adds. "Much in the way Snapchat works." It isn't clear if these features will be coming to the next iPhone, which is due to be revealed sometime in September, but they do tally with claims by the reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who said the 2017 iPhone will have a "revolutionary" camera. Bringing Snapchat-style features to the iPhone is a surefire way to win over picture-sharing millennials, and for Apple to get its foot in the AR door. It is being speculated that Apple would use technology inherited during its acquisition of the Israeli company PrimeSense in 2013. To help make its AR dreams a reality Apple has hired numerous engineers from Microsoft's HoloLens team and Oculus, the Facebook-owned manufacturer of the Rift VR headset. Cook said about AR in February 2017: "Most people won't want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can't do that because you get sick from it," he said. "With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance." Looking further ahead, the same Apple insiders say it is working on a pair of AR-enhanced glasses, perhaps similar to Google Glass and the HoloLens, although little is known about this product for now.

We've also posted a series of special reports on the matter. The first was posted in January 2016 covering VR and AR and talked about the team that Apple was building. A team made up of engineers from HoloLens, a top VR researcher from Virginia tech with experience in gaming, sports and 3D user interfaces. A second report was posted in September 2016 titled "Apple's Enthusiasm for Integrating Augmented Reality into Future Devices and Apps is Growing Louder," and third was posted in February 2017 wherein Apple's CEO noted that he regarded augmented reality as big an idea than the smartphone.   Today we're learning that Apple's AR team has since hired Mike Rockwell a key engineer form Dolby who advised Meta who created an AR headset as noted in the video below. He's now the leader on the AR team at Apple under Dan Riccio who's in charge of the iPhone/iPad engineering groups.     Apple's new AR team is now growing rapidly and bringing in yet more top talent such as Tomlinson Holman, who created THX, the audio standard made popular by LucasFilm; Cody White, former lead engineer of Amazon's Lumberyard virtual reality platform; Duncan McRoberts, Meta's former director of software development; Yury Petrov, a former Oculus researcher; and Avi Bar-Zeev, who worked on the HoloLens and Google Earth. Apple has rounded out the team with iPhone, camera and optical lens engineers.   Sources tell Bloomberg that Apple has also mined the movie industry's 3D animation ranks and has opened a Wellington office to lure several employees from Weta Digital, the New Zealand special-effects shop that worked on King Kong, Avatar and other films.   Besides hiring people, Apple has been busy making tactical acquisitions. In 2015, the company acquired Metaio, which developed AR software. Former Metaio CEO Thomas Alt now works on Apple's strategic deals team, which decides which technologies to invest in. Last year, Apple also bought FlyBy Media, which makes AR-related camera software. Cook even visited the offices of Magic Leap last summer and displayed interest in the secretive company's AR technology, the people say. Magic Leap declined to comment.   One of the apps that Apple is apparently working on involves PrimeSense technology which would allow users to take a photo and then at a later time add different levels of 3D depth to it so as to change the focal points of the photo to emphasize different items or people within the photo. A great number of PrimeSense patents could be found in our archives here.   To better understand the future of VR using advanced 3D technologies for film and photography, check out the work being done over at Lytro here. You could also check out photos using Lytro technology. Here's one example. Look at the photo and then click on the second penguin and you'll see the focus of the photo change instantly. In another example, you can see the focus is on a pole with posters on it and with one click of your mouse on the bridge, the focus instantly changes. There are a great number of example you can test out for yourself on that site. It's a very cool capability for photography and its one that Apple is working on. Lastly, you could learn a little more about this story in the latest Bloomberg report here.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / Apple / Apple to bring augmented reality features to the next iPhone Apple to bring augmented reality features to the next iPhone Matthew Wilson 3 days ago Apple, Featured Tech News, Tech News It looks like Apple may be ready to get serious about augmented reality later this year as reports are indicating that the company is preparing a few AR-related features for its next iPhone. According to sources, Apple currently has several hundred engineers dedicated to augmented reality features, some of which are from the iPhone camera team. Tim Cook has been gushing about Augmented Reality technology for quite a while now and this current rumour ties into information we received a few weeks ago, claiming that Apple has 1000 engineers working on Augmented Reality projects over in Israel. This weeks particular report comes from Mark Gurney at Bloomberg, who has a proven track record with Apple leaks. According to his sources, “hundreds of engineers are now devoted” to bringing augmented reality to the next iPhone. One of the features said to be in development is the ability to change the depth of a photograph or depth of specific objects within an image. Another AR-related feature being worked on by the iPhone camera team is the ability to single out specific objects in an image, like a person’s head, and manipulate it by tilting it for example. These are simple applications of augmented reality and likely far from what Tim Cook hopes to get to in the future. This just seems to be Apple dipping its toes in before getting involved with immersive head mounted displays. KitGuru Says: While we knew that Apple was experimenting with augmented reality behind the scenes, I don’t think many people expected the company to dive in on a consumer product so quickly.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Bloomberg: Apple is working on multiple exciting new AR features for the iPhone 8 Image Source: Imran Taylor Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal March 20th, 2017 at 9:33 AM Share Tweet Of all the rumored additions Apple is said to be bringing to the iPhone 8, few are as intriguing as augmented reality. Apple CEO Tim Cook has called AR a “core technology” in interviews, prompting many analysts and journalists to speculate on how Apple might utilize AR functionality in its devices. On Monday, Bloomberg added fuel to that fire with a huge, comprehensive report on Apple’s plans for AR. Don't Miss: Galaxy S8 leaks: The 10 biggest leaks you missed over the weekend Giving credence to earlier reports, Bloomberg’s sources say that Apple has “hundreds of engineers” on the project, some of which previously worked on Facebook’s Oculus Rift and Microsoft’s HoloLens headset. While discrete AR devices are likely at least a year away, we could see several AR features on an iPhone before the end of the year. The report describes a couple of the features that are currently in the works: One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person’s head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person, much the way Snapchat works. […] Apple may choose to not roll out these features, but such additions are an up-and-coming trend in the phone business. As for the AR glasses that Apple is reportedly planning to bring to market, the paper believes that they will have to be tethered to the iPhone, much like the Apple Watch. In order for the glasses to make an impact, they will need to have a respectable battery life and a great deal of content available on day one. Apple has had its hits and misses with hardware over the past several years, but with all the talent it has brought on board and companies it has acquired to bring its AR ambitions to life, it’s clear that Apple expects AR to be a major part of its future. So let’s hope we don’t have another Google Glass on our hands.

That's according to a new report that claims the company is working on augmented reality as its next major product. It will initially come as a feature of the iPhone, the report claims, but eventually make its way onto people's faces. Apple is now on an ambitious bid to bring the technology to the people, according to the report by Bloomberg, and that effort is being led by Tim Cook. It has built a huge team combining hardware and software to create special augmented reality (AR) products.

Those include special glasses that would connect over Bluetooth to an iPhone and send content like films, maps and more to the person wearing them – though that technology is some way off, those same features will come to the iPhone soon. Apple has already released a range of different wearable products in recent years, like the Watch and its AirPods, which put Siri into people's ears as well as working as wireless earphones. Read more New iPad and iPhone models to be released in coming weeks Augmented reality is less famous than the similar virtual reality, and in AR people are less completely immersed and just have technology adding to their vision rather than taking it up entirely. Tim Cook has said that people won't care for virtual reality much, and that instead the company is focused on working on augmented reality. The dream way of doing that is building glasses, according to the Bloomberg report. Those glasses will be tethered to the iPhone, like the Watch, allowing the handset to do the heavy lifting, downloading and provide much of the battery while information is displayed on the glasses. But it will require new software, too, including special apps and an operating system to run on the glasses, as well as a new chip to put inside them. Similar technologies were developed for the Apple Watch, which runs its own apps and using its operating system. Building glasses is a risky strategy. Google famously released its Glass in 2013 – but that became known mostly through mockery, didn't take off and was discontinued by the company in 2015. Apple's response appears to be hiring a huge range of people with expertise across a variety of different industries to make its own glasses. It has hired people who worked on Google and Microsoft's own augmented reailty headsets, according to the report, as well as buying up companies that make similar products. It has also moved people from the team that developed the Apple Watch and other products into its AR team. Apple has also filled out the team with iPhone, camera and optical lens engineers, it said. Some of those have come from the biggest film companies in the world, like those from Weta Digital, the special effects firm that worked on King Kong and Avatar. But before the glasses arrive, similar features are set to the come to the iPhone. Those features might include the ability to take a picture and then focus on different elements of it at a later date, for instance, or allow virtual objects to be placed onto a real picture like on Snapchat.

The U.S. enterprise announced Sunday an additional 3.5 billion yuan ($508 million) investment to build two R&D centers in China's Shanghai and Suzhou. The firm has previously promised to establish two R&D centers in Beijing and Shenzhen. All four R&D centers are scheduled to be completed this year. The move struck a stark contrast to Apple's tepid response to the Korean market. The company has yet to open an Apple Store for consumer service, not to mention an R&D facility here, which led to great inconveniences for Apple product users. "For Apple, it is natural to boost investment in one of the world's largest smartphone markets where iPhones have been increasingly losing steam in recent years," an industry source said. "But Korean consumers would not be happy with such news because there is no Apple Store in Korea." Apple has 40 Apple Stores in China. Despite the iPhone's high popularity here since its debut in 2009, Apple has not yet established one in Korea. The company finally decided to set up one here in Sinsa-dong, southern Seoul, but it remains to be seen when it will open. Without an Apple Store in Korea, the company has provided after-sale services only indirectly through third-party agencies here, inconveniencing consumers. Apple's decision to establish four R&D bases in China came as the company's performance in the country started to dwindle in recent years amid rapid growth of local brands. China's smartphone market grew 9 percent year-on-year last year. But Apple's share in the market has continued to decrease. According to data by global market researcher IDC, Apple has been overtaken by Oppo, Huawei and Vivo in the Chinese smartphone market, with its sales in the fourth quarter last year dropping 12 percent from the previous year. Its market share was 9.6 percent, down 4 percentage points from 13.6 percent in 2015. Oppo, on the other hand, jumped to the top from the fourth spot in 2015, by doubling its market share with 16.8 percent last year. Vivo has also boosted its market share to 14.8 percent, up from 8.2 percent in 2015. Apple is also seeking to boost its localization drive in China by building R&D centers and hiring Chinese workers to regain its share in the local market. Apple CEO Tim Cook visited Beijing to speak at the China Development Forum on Saturday. He urged the Chinese government to open more to foreign companies. "I think it is important that China continues to open itself and widens the door if you will," Cook said. "The reality is countries that are closed, that isolate themselves, are not good for their people." yoonsw@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter [LIVE] Sewol emerges from water after 1073 days Seoul ranks No. 3 among cities with worst air pollution Mobile carriers fined for wooing expats with illegal benefits [LIVE] Sewol seen above water after 1073 days Park could face up to 45 years in prison Park under interrogation over corruption scandal N.

Copyright Getty Images Advertisement Tim Cook has talked up a lot of technologies since becoming Apple Inc.'s chief executive in 2011. Driverless cars. Artificial intelligence. Streaming television. But no technology has fired up Cook quite like augmented reality, which overlays images, video and games on the real world. Cook has likened AR's game-changing potential to that of the smartphone. At some point, he said last year, we will all "have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you." Investors impatient for Apple's next breakthrough will be happy to know that Cook is very serious about AR. People with knowledge of the company's plans say Apple (IW 500/2) has embarked on an ambitious bid to bring the technology to the masses—an effort Cook and his team see as the best way for the company to dominate the next generation of gadgetry and keep people wedded to its ecosystem. Apple has built a team combining the strengths of its hardware and software veterans with the expertise of talented outsiders, say the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Run by a former Dolby Laboratories executive, the group includes engineers who worked on the Oculus and HoloLens virtual reality headsets sold by Facebook and Microsoft as well as digital-effects wizards from Hollywood. Apple has also acquired several small firms with knowledge of AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality software. Popular Now 2016 IW Best Plants Winner: Johnson Controls’ Magic Ingredient is Leadership The 10 Most Innovative Companies in the World Overtime Threshold Ripe for Review, Says Trump Labor Pick As previously reported by Bloomberg, Apple is working on several AR products, including digital spectacles that could connect wirelessly to an iPhone and beam content—movies, maps and more—to the wearer. While the glasses are a ways off, AR features could show up in the iPhone sooner. Apple declined to comment. It's an auspicious moment for Apple to move into augmented reality. The global market for AR products will surge 80% to $165 billion by 2024, according to researcher Global Market Insights. But Apple really has no choice, says Gene Munster, a founding partner at Loup Ventures who covered the company for many years as an analyst. Over time, Munster says, AR devices will replace the iPhone. "It's something they need to do to continue to grow," he says, "and defend against the shift in how people use hardware." AR: The Lesser Known Cousin Augmented reality is the less known cousin of virtual reality. VR gets more attention because it completely immerses users in an artificial world and has an obvious attraction for gamers. So far, however, headsets like the Oculus and HoloLens are niche rather than mainstream products. Apple believes AR will be an easier sell because it's less intrusive. Referring to VR headsets, Cook last year said he thought few people will want to be "enclosed in something." Building a successful AR product will be no easy task, even for a company known for slim, sturdy devices. The current crop of AR glasses are either under-powered and flimsy or powerful and overwhelmingly large. Apple, the king of thin and light, will have to leapfrog current products by launching something small and powerful. Adding AR features to the iPhone isn't a giant leap. Building glasses will be harder. Like the Watch, they'll probably be tethered to the iPhone. While the smartphone will do the heavy lifting, beaming 3D content to the glasses will consume a lot of power, so prolonging battery life will be crucial. Content is key too. If Apple's AR glasses lack useful apps, immersive games and interesting media content, why would someone wear them? The glasses will also require a new operating system and perhaps even a new chip. Finally, Apple will have to source the guts of the gadget cheaply enough to make it affordable for the mass market. Multidisciplinary Team When it was developing the Watch, Apple put together a multidisciplinary team drawn from inside and outside the company. It has done much the same with the AR effort. In 2015, Apple recruited Mike Rockwell, who previously ran the hardware and new technologies groups at Dolby, the iconic company known for its audio and video technology. Rockwell also advised Meta, a small firm that makes $950 AR glasses and counts Dolby as an investor. Rockwell now runs the main AR team at Apple, reporting to Dan Riccio, who's in charge of the iPhone and iPad hardware engineering groups, the people said. "He's a really sharp guy," says Jack McCauley, who co-founded and worked at Oculus before it was sold to Facebook in 2015. "He could certainly put a team together that could get an Apple AR project going." Last spring, in a sign that it's serious about taking products to market, Apple put some of its best hardware and software people on Rockwell's team, including Fletcher Rothkopf who helped lead the team that designed the Apple Watch, and Tomlinson Holman, who created THX, the audio standard made popular by LucasFilm. Apple has also recruited people with expertise in everything from 3D video production to wearable hardware. Among them, the people say: Cody White, former lead engineer of Amazon's Lumberyard virtual reality platform; Duncan McRoberts, Meta's former director of software development; Yury Petrov, a former Oculus researcher; and Avi Bar-Zeev, who worked on the HoloLens and Google Earth. Apple has rounded out the team with iPhone, camera and optical lens engineers. There are people with experience in sourcing the raw materials for the glasses. The company has also mined the movie industry's 3D animation ranks, the people said, opening a Wellington office and luring several employees from Weta Digital, the New Zealand special-effects shop that worked on King Kong, Avatar and other films. Tactical Acquisitions Besides hiring people, Apple has been busy making tactical acquisitions. In 2015, the company acquired Metaio, which developed AR software. Former Metaio CEO Thomas Alt now works on Apple's strategic deals team, which decides which technologies to invest in. Last year, Apple also bought FlyBy Media, which makes AR-related camera software. Cook even visited the offices of Magic Leap last summer and displayed interest in the secretive company's AR technology, the people say. Magic Leap declined to comment. Hundreds of engineers are now devoted to the cause, including some on the iPhone camera team who are working on AR-related features for the iPhone, according to one of the people. One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person's head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person, much the way Snapchat works. The iPhone camera features would probably rely on a technology known as depth sensing and use algorithms created by PrimeSense, an Israeli company acquired in 2013. Apple may choose to not roll out these features, but such additions are an up-and-coming trend in the phone business. The AR-enhanced glasses are further down the road, the people say. Getting the product right will be key, of course. Wearables are hard. Apple's first stab at the category, the Watch, has failed to become a mainstream hit. And no one has forgotten Google Glass, the much-derided headset that bombed in 2014. Still, time and again, Apple has waited for others to go first and then gone on to dominate the market. "To be successful in AR, there is the hardware piece, but you have to do other stuff too: from maps to social to payments," Munster says.

A new Bloomberg report seeks to shed light on both questions. The report echoes earlier ones that Apple has a large number of engineers working on AR features, and that they will be seen first in the iPhone … Anker braided Lightning cables Hundreds of engineers are now devoted to the cause, including some on the iPhone camera team who are working on AR-related features for the iPhone, according to one of the people. The piece describes some of the specific features Apple is exploring, though doesn’t have any great detail. One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person’s head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person, much the way Snapchat works. Bloomberg does, however, believe Apple intends to later make AR glasses, despite Google’s ill-fated attempt to turn smart glasses into a consumer product. This idea was first reported by the same source back in November of last year, with a more recent suggestion that the firm was working with German optics company Carl Zeiss. The AR-enhanced glasses are further down the road, the people say. Getting the product right will be key, of course. Wearables are hard […] The current crop of AR glasses are either under-powered and flimsy or powerful and overwhelmingly large. Apple, the king of thin and light, will have to leapfrog current products by launching something small and powerful.  In addition to the high-profile acquisitions Apple has made in the AR area, the piece points to the high-calibre team the company has recruited for the project. Run by a former Dolby Laboratories executive, the group includes engineers who worked on the Oculus and HoloLens virtual reality headsets sold by Facebook and Microsoft as well as digital-effects wizards from Hollywood. A poll of 9to5Mac readers found that the majority were very excited by the prospects opened up by AR features, while just 5% were dismissive.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady iPhone to be available in Indonesia again after March 31st following Apple’s investments in localized R&D Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Monday, March 20th, 2017, 05:08 Category: iPhone, News, retail You’ll be able to buy an iPhone in Indonesia come the end of the month. Apple is reportedly on track to resume sales of the handset within the country, following a roughly two-year period during which sourcing requirements kept the device off the local market. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus as well as the 6s series will go on sale through six retailers on March 31. In some cases, people should already be able to sign up for pre-orders. iPhone sales were last permitted in Indonesia with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus handsets. Subsequent sourcing regulations —similar to ones in India —then forced the product out, since Apple couldn’t ensure that 30 percent of components were local. Such rules are intended to boost domestic industry. Sales are scheduled to resume due to Apple’s investment in three R&D facilities in the Indonesia capital of Jakarta. Previously, Apple’s R&D plans were uncertain. Apple has begun making a number of global investment as a means of satisfying political ends. Recently, Apple’s efforts to bring manufacturing to India, are believed to be part of a path to opening retail stores in that country. Earlier on Friday, the company announced plans to build two more Chinese research centers — just a day before CEO Tim Cook is set to speak with government officials at an economic forum. Indonesia is an essential market, with over 255 million people and enough middle- and upper-class shoppers to support Apple’s product base. So, good news if you’re over there and need to pick up an iPhone in a pinch. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple quietly extends AppleCare+ policies from 60 days to one year for iPhone purchases Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Monday, March 20th, 2017, 05:12 Category: Apple TV, AppleCare, Hardware, iPhone, News, retail Modern mobile smartphone with broken screen isolated on white background. If you have an AppleCare+ policy, you’re going to like this. Apple has quietly updated its AppleCare+ policy, extending the purchase window for iPhones from 60 days to one year. The change has been confirmed with a support rep, but is not yet showing up on Apple’s official product page for AppleCare+. If you go to Apple’s eligibility tool and input your serial number from the iPhone’s settings panel, you should be able to see a new purchase option so long as you purchased the device within the last year. The change extends to Macs and Apple TV units, but Apple Watch and iPads are still restricted to 60 days following the purchase. Apple lowered the price of iPhone screen repairs from $99 to $29 last September, which helps as well. In the event that your iPhone screen has been cracked, Apple requires a physical inspection to buy the service in-store and a remote diagnostic test if you do so online. If you’ve purchased an AppleCare+ policy with your iPhone and have any feedback to offer about it, please let us know in the comments.

  SOFTPEDIA®   Windows   Drivers   Games   Mac   Android   Linux   News Softpedia > News > Microsoft > Surface FLASH SALE: Bitdefender 2017      50% OFF! Microsoft Goes After Apple Users with Mac to Surface Data Transfer Tool GO Redmond silently releases Mac to Surface Assistant Mar 20, 2017 12:42 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft has silently released a new tool called Mac to Surface Assistant, which is supposed to do exactly what its name suggests: to assist users as they make the switch from Apple’s Mac to Redmond’s own Surface. Microsoft’s Surface lineup itself has often been positioned as a direct competitor to Apple’s MacBooks even though devices like the Surface Pro and the Surface Book are capable of doing a bit more thanks to detachable keyboards and touchscreens, and now the software giant itself is going after customers of rival products. The Mac to Surface Assistant is a solution that’s supposed to make the transition from Mac to Surface as smooth as possible, as it lets users configure exactly what data they wish to transfer when giving up on their Apple laptop for a Microsoft 2-in-1 device. The application was developed as a wizard, so it’s only just a matter of steps until you complete the process, though there’s something that you wouldn’t normally expect from a tool developed by the world’s number one software company. What the Mac to Surface Assistant does is create a ZIP archive with the selected user files, so instead of thousands of items, you only have to transfer a single pack from one device to another. Basic data migration tool This isn’t exactly the most convenient data transfer tool and, at first glance, relying on cloud would be a much better choice given the fact that the transition would be performed automatically. Of course, creating a ZIP archive with your favorite files can also be done manually, but Microsoft hopes that most users would prefer having an application do the whole thing without the need for browsing folders on the local drives. Once the ZIP file is created, users can move it to an external drive, which can then be connected to the Surface and transferred to the local drives with the Surface application. Microsoft hopes that this “easy” data transfer method would convince more users to move from Macs to Surface, though we doubt this is going to happen given the rather basic approach of the app.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (6 Images) #Microsoft#Surface#Apple#Mac subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Mac to Surface Assistant (6 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Loves iPhones: OneDrive App Updated with iMessage Support The 7-Inch Windows 10/Ubuntu Pocket PC Shows Up on Video Microsoft Named One of the Most Ethical Companies in the World Windows XP Installed on an iPhone 7 Because Why Not - Video Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook New Galaxy S8 and S8+ Press Shots Surface, Together with Official Teaser Super Mario Run is Now Officially Available on Android Phones Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Google Updates Duo With Audio-Only Calls, Allo Can Now Share Files Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook Target to Offer Freebies for Galaxy S8 Pre-Orders, Leaked Ad Shows 6 photos    Mac to Surface Assistant New Apps Syncovery: Backup data and synchronize PCs, servers and notebooks by creating customize profiles using this straightforward software utility Starus Excel Recovery: Seamlessly recover spreadsheets that you accidentally deleted or that are lost due to a problematic hard drive using this software solution PEBL Launcher: Launch psychology and neuroscience experiments created with the PEBL programming language with the aid of this intuitive application Lighten PDF Converter: A reliable and easy to use tool that enables you to easily convert batches of PDFs to Word documents, Excel workbooks or PowerPoint presentations PDF Annotator: A lightweight and easy-to-use program meant to help you make annotations on your Portable Document Format files using the mouse or a Tablet PC pen Starus Photo Recovery: A handy and easy to use wizard application that helps you recover lost or deleted image files from your hard drive or flash devices OESIS Endpoint Assessment Tool: Manage and actively monitor installed applications and uninstall security software, such as antivirus and anti-spyware tools by eliminating all leftovers to make room for a new tool Reader comments Replacing Linux with Windows Is Just a Political Decision, Munich IT Chief Says more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Apple Is Working on a Number of AR Features for the Next iPhone GO The new iPhone’s selling point will be AR features Mar 20, 2017 12:21 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  A new report by Bloomberg states that Apple is working on multiple new AR features for its upcoming iPhone. Apparently, Tim Cook is “very serious about AR” and intends to bring the technology to the masses. Apple has built a team to work on new hardware and software that would later result in AR features for the upcoming iPhone, anonymous internal sources stated for Bloomberg. The team is run by a former Dolby Laboratories executive and includes experts who worked on the Oculus and HoloLens virtual headsets released by Facebook and Microsoft. The Cupertino company also bought several small firms that worked on AR hardware, 3D gaming, as well as virtual reality software. Apple is working on a number of AR products The team made up of several experts on augmented-reality won’t be working solely on features for the next iPhone, but also on a number of AR products. Apparently, Apple intends to develop a pair of digital spectacles that would wirelessly connect to an iPhone and stream videos or app content to the wearer. Hundreds of engineers are working on the technology; some of them are solely focusing on AR features for the new iPhone. Apple intends to bring iPhone users the option to take a picture and then change the depth of the entire image or the depth of specific objects. A separate feature would let users isolate a certain object inside images and tilt it 180 degrees. Another AR tool would allow for objects and virtual effects to be placed inside images. This report is in line with the analysis recently made by Ming-Chi Kuo, who predicted that the next iPhone would have an innovative camera augmented with an infrared projector and receiver. However, AR glasses would arrive further down the line, since it would mean that Apple must develop an entirely new product and integrate features that would require extensive testing. #Apple#iPhone#iPhone 8#AR features#AR glasses subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news New iPhone 8 Concept Imagines Siri with Augmented Reality Features Future iPhones to Support 4K Graphics and Advanced AR/VR with PowerVR Graphics Apple Files Patent for Scroll-like iPhone with Retractable Display Apple’s Next iPhone Could Come with AR Features - Report Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook New Galaxy S8 and S8+ Press Shots Surface, Together with Official Teaser Super Mario Run is Now Officially Available on Android Phones Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Google Updates Duo With Audio-Only Calls, Allo Can Now Share Files Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook Target to Offer Freebies for Galaxy S8 Pre-Orders, Leaked Ad Shows    Next iPhone concept with integrated AR features new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Launches Red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Apple filed documents to Federal Communications Commission for a new device By Margi Murphy 20th March 2017, 11:57 am Updated: 20th March 2017, 12:02 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments A NEW Apple device has been revealed, thanks to official documents published by a government body. The technology company got tongues wagging when it submitted an application for a mysterious gadget to the US Federal Communications Commission last year. Federal communications commision 5 Apple filed documents for this mystery device late last year, and they have finally been revealed We’re sorry to disappoint, but turns out it’s not a blueprint for the iPhone 8. The files – including detailed pictures and a user manual – are pretty brief on details, leaving those out of the loop scratching their heads. It appears that the hotly anticipated tech is a smart access system. The documents reveal a smart lock which can be opened using a reader, highlighted below. Federal communications commision 5 Federal communications commision 5 The smart key system is likely to be used in the Park campus opening in April and in Apple’s stores worldwide Federal communications commision 5 According to the files, the device can grant access using a reader which flashes green for entry 5 The brand new Apple HQ is almost finished, and could feature the new devices According to the user manual, the device will flash green and play a sound when access is granted, presumably using an Apple Watch or iPhone as the key. The files detail near-field communication technology, the same kind that allows iPhone and Android owners to pay at the till using a smartphone. Apple have yet to release their own brand of smart home devices, but this new technology could be used in Apple’s brand new campus, an impressive architectural feat in California, US. It’s not clear why the tech company would want to create its own smart locks – when there are plenty on the market. But the super-secretive company may want to make it impossible for hackers to tamper with their systems.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Apple reportedly working on bringing AR features to the iPhone using ex-Microsoft HoloLens talent 1 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ Mar 20, 2017 at 12:48 GMT3 days ago We have known for a while that Apple is working on AR (Augmented Reality) headsets, with the company’s CEO claiming that AR is going to be “huge.” And now, it seems like we might see an augmented reality product from the hardware giant sometime soon. According to Bloomberg, Apple is working on integrating some AR features into the iPhone’s camera. Apple actually built a team for its AR ambitions, and “hundreds of engineers” are reportedly working on bringing the tech to life. What’s more interesting is that the team reportedly includes multiple engineers who worked on the Microsoft HoloLens. Engineers who worked on Facebook’s Oculus Rift are also part of the team, according to Bloomberg: “Apple has built a team combining the strengths of its hardware and software veterans with the expertise of talented outsiders, say the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Run by a former Dolby Laboratories executive, the group includes engineers who worked on the Oculus and HoloLens virtual reality headsets sold by Facebook and Microsoft as well as digital-effects wizards from Hollywood. Apple has also acquired several small firms with knowledge of AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality software.” Apple has also acquired multiple firms who specialize in AR technologies in the past to work on Apple’s upcoming AR products. It’s clear Apple’s AR team is full of bright minds from the industry, and Microsoft’s HoloLens engineers might also help the company’s AR ambitions quite a lot since Microsoft already has an AR headset available for purchase to the public. How Apple will execute its AR plans remains to be seen as it isn’t clear how the company is working on integrating AR features into the iPhone yet. Bloomberg claims that the iPhone’s camera team are working on incorporating the “AR-related” features to the iPhone. The company is apparently working on a feature that would let users place virtual effects and objects in the real world — similar to how Pokemon Go and other apps like Snapchat work. Another feature the iPhone camera team is working on is the ability to change the depth of photographs taken with the iPhone, as well as the depth of specific objects in a picture. The report explains: “One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person’s head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees.” At the moment, it isn’t clear whether we will get to see some of these AR features on the next iPhone, which is set to arrive sometime in September. Apple’s AR headsets should be a lot more interesting, but we likely won’t get to see them anytime soon. Microsoft, on the other hand, reportedly skipped HoloLens v2 and the software giant is now working on a v3 of its popular AR headset — but that won’t arrive until 2019.

Is this Apple's mystery new 'wireless device'? by Catherine Hood 20 March 2017 0 shares Read Comments Image credit: FCC Months of speculation have finally been put to an end, following Apple’s 2016 filing to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) for certification of a mysterious ‘wireless device’. The only clues the original FCC application revealed about the device, identified as model number 'A1844', were that it has Bluetooth Low Energy and NFC connectivity. Apple requested permanent confidentiality on all other details. This led to speculation among Apple fans that it could be fifth-generation Apple TV, or possibly a new AirPort router. Given Apple’s efforts to popularise its smart-home gateway app Apple HomeKit, it could well have been a smart door lock too. Finally, it seems, we have an answer – and it turns out to be none of the above. A manual published by the FCC on Sunday for the mystery device appears to be for a door access system, which BusinessInsider speculates is most likely destined for Apple’s new Apple Park campus opening in April, rather than for consumer use. Image credit: FCC Photos in the manual show a card reader attached to a door assembly, with accompanying instructions that say users have to “present the company provided credential to the reader.” The manual gives a brief outline of how the door system operates, which involves a standard green light and digital sound to indicate approved access, or a red light and a further sound for denied access. Image credit: FCC Disappointingly for all the hopefuls with grand ideas of a shiny new Apple product set to hit the shelves, the evidence does point towards a door access system for badge-carrying Apple Park employees being the most likely destiny for the device. The FFC manual also tempers the excited buzz surrounding two separate filings for certification that Apple has submitted this year. It’s likely that the two devices, with the suspiciously similar model numbers of ‘A1846’ and ‘A1845’, are simply components or iterations of the door access system.

Will we see new iMacs, Mac minis, and Mac Pros? What will the iPhone 8 look like? And are there any new products we don't even know about yet? We gather the rumours and whispers about Apple and make our pedictions for the year ahead. by Martyn Casserly | 21 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents iPhones iPads iPad mini Apple Watch 3 Apple TV Macs Software & services Mergers & acquisitions But don't expect… 2016 was an interesting year for Apple. It saw the introduction of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, albeit controversially without headphone jacks, and a return to the 4-inch form factor in the popular iPhone SE. The MacBook Pro line received its first major revision for a number of years, including the introduction of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Plus there was the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and an apparently Brexit-related unwelcome hike in prices across the board. So, what does 2017 have up its sleeves for Apple fans? Well, here at Macworld we've donned our prognostication hats, investigated every rumour and trend we could find, all to bring you our predictions for 2017. It looks like it could be a big year. Apple predictions for 2017: iPhones 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, so many are expecting Apple to pull out all the stops and release something quite special. iPhone SE 2: Many had anticipated that Apple would upgrade the iPhone SE model to the iPhone SE2 or SEs in March 2017, replacing the existing (and rather popular) SE that was introduced in March 2016. However the iPhone SE was only treated to a bump in storage to 32- and 128GB on 21 March and another update seems unlikely for now. We do still expect a new iPhone SE model at some point in the future, maybe in September or maybe in 2018 (KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has forecast that the iPhone SE 2 won't make an appearance in 2017 at all, on the principle that Apple doesn't want to cannibalise sales of the (higher-margin) iPhone 7). When the new model launches it is likely to keep the existing, classic design, but feature upgraded internals such as the A10 chip found in the current iPhone 7 and a more powerful camera. When? We think September  iPhone 7S or iPhone 8: Apple made a minor update to the iPhone 7 during an Apple Store update on 21 March, adding a Product RED version. Product RED is a charity that attempts to eliminate AIDS in Africa. Part of the proceeds from the new red models of the iPhone 7 will go to the charity. Apple doesn't make it clear how much it donates to the charity, but it does say that since Product RED was founded in 2006, (RED) has generated more than $465 million for the Global Fund, with more than $130 million from Apple alone. On to the new iPhones... There has been much discussion over what the new iPhone will be called. Normally Apple would continue its tick-tock rhythm of a new design one year followed by the S version which upgrades only the internals. But the iPhone 7 featured a minimal change to the design of the 6 and 6S, which leads many to think that Apple is saving the big changes for its 10th Anniversary model - the iPhone 8. Perhaps the biggest expected change to the design of the iPhone 8 is the removal of the Home button to allow an edge-to-edge glass display. But what of Apple ID and the fingerprint sensor? Well, there have been several reports that Apple intends to include technology that allows the screen itself to act as a fingerprint sensor, thus removing the need for a physical button. Alternatively, Apple might use facial recognition instead of/in addition to the fingerprint sensor. Apple reportedly purchased Israeli startup RealFace, which as the name hints specialises in facial recognition technology. This would be a truly remarkable innovation and give iPhone users display sizes on par with many premium Android devices but in a compact format. MacRumours also asserts that Apple is intending to use a flexible OLED display rather than the LCD panels that have appeared on previous iPhones. This could make the devices lighter while also offering more vivid colours and contrasts.   Image created by ConceptsiPhone Another feature often found on Android phones is that of wireless charging, and it looks very likely that this will be included on the iPhone 8. Some rumours even suggest the Apple will include long-range wireless charging, with Bloomberg Business reporting that the company wants to impliment the game changing technology that could charge an iphone from several feet away, and could have it ready for 2017.  The Jet black colour introduced with the iPhone 7 has been very popular, but its tendency to scratch easily is thought to have prompted Apple to return to a glass back and front design for the iPhone 8. There might also be new Deep Blue and Space Black colour options if the reports on various Japanese sites are to be believed.  One interesting idea that's gathering pace is that the new model will include Augmented Reality software, which overlays relevant information on any place or thing that you point the camera at. While we've yet to see proof of this, it would be a very cool addition. So with a new edge-to-edge design, software enabled fingerprint detection, long-range wireless charging, better display, plus the usual internal upgrades, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus really could be a worthy way to mark a decade at the top. Roll on September 2017. For the latest rumours and an in-depth roundup read our iPhone 8 release date rumours article. When? We think September Apple predictions for 2017: iPads New iPad Air: Since there was no new iPad Air in 2015 or 2016 Apple fans were hoping for an update to that model soon. There were some concerns that the 9.7in iPad Pro had displaced the iPad Air line, but those fears were unfounded when Apple announced a new iPad in March 2017. Apple has done away with the Air from it's name, however: what was the iPad Air line is now just the iPad. The iPad is what would have been called the iPad Air 3 and comes with Apple's A9 processor, an update to the A8X processor in the iPad Air 2. This means it has the same chip as the iPhone 6s, but retains the same display and cameras as the Air 2. read more here: New iPad latest. Apple stop using Air in all its product names very soon - as signalled by the 13-inch MacBook Air's tiny update in 2016 and the retirement of the 11-inch version. When? We think 2018 iPad mini: The iPad mini received a minor update in March 2017, gaining more capacity for the same price (£419 for the 128GB Wi-Fi model and £549 for the 128GB Wi-Fi + Cellular). However, this was not the iPad mini 5 anticipated, and given that the iPad mini 4 was last updated in September 2015, it's clear that Apple isn't too focused on its smaller tablets and Apple does state that the most popular tablet size is 9.7in. Perhaps October will see the introduction of an iPad Mini Pro with upgraded components, a new thinner, tougher aluminium chassis, and the inclusion of a Smart Connector to match that of the other iPad Pro devices. Read more about the iPad mini 5: iPad mini 5 new feature rumours When? We think 2018 Apple predictions for 2017: iPad Pro 2 With the 12.9-inch iPad Pro arriving in November 2015, and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016, it's hard to guess the plans for this line. We had hoped for an update to both in spring 2017, but no update was forthcoming. Apple did however introduce a new 9.7in iPad in the iPad Air category (so lacking the Apple Pencil support and featuring a A9 chip rather than the A9X, and £339, rather than £549. Apple may update the iPad Pro models in September or October 2017. Much will depend on how effectively they have dealt with the stagnating iPad sales problem we've observed in the past few earnings calls. One way to stimulate interest could be the introduction of a new size, which is what analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is suggesting. He has stated that Apple will offer three Pros in 2017, but not a Mini as you might think, instead a 9.7-inch, 12.9-inch, and new 10.5-inch variant. He makes sense of this by explaining that the 9.7-inch Pro will be a lower powered version than it's bigger brothers - possibly the existing Pro being kept as the base model and sold at a cheaper price. Kuo's thoughts were published before Apple lauched the new iPad 9.7in, which seems to sit as the lower powered version he predicted. Whether Apple would stop selling the 9.7in iPad Pro remains to be seen - the company has said it is its most popular sized iPad. Other rumours doing the rounds argue that there will be a 10.9-inch version instead of the 10.5-inch one Kuo is backing. This could also feature a design change that eliminates the bezels and makes use of the software fingerprint detection technology that is expected to appear in the iPhone 8. There's no doubt that iPads are in a transitional period at the moment, but Apple seems to be pushing the Pros as the way ahead, so expect some interesting products in March. Read our 12.9-inch iPad Pro review | iPad Pro 2 rumours When? We think October Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Watch 3 Apple released the second generation of its Watch in September of 2016 which added GPS, internal upgrades, and water-proofing to the design. This was accompanied by the WatchOS 3 update that increased performance and functionality for not only the new models but also the original range.   We expect to see Apple announce the third iteration of its Watch in September 2017, hopefully for around the same price as the current models which start at £369, although that is far from certain after the increases we saw at the end of 2016. Apple did offer some new Apple Watch bands in March 2017. These include a new wide stripe Woven Nylon band, standalone Nike Sport Bands and Apple Watch Hermès bands in new colours. There's little in the way of firm evidence suggesting what the Apple Watch 3 will look like, but it's fair to say that you should expect a model that's very similar to the current version. Some experts have postulated that there could be a Watch S release in March of 2017 that would include additional storage space, but this remains a rumour at best. Several news sites have also specualted on the possibilty of a round display, much like the one found on the Moto 360 Android Wear device. It's widely expected that the Watch 3 will include a front facing camera that could be used for selfies or FaceTime calls, as Apple holds a patent for such a device and Watch OS 2 introduced support for FaceTime audio calls. The new model is also likely to feature a Micro-LED display, which would be lighter, thinner, and brighter than the LCD panels currently used.  Another common thought is that Apple will finally introduce 3G or 4G capabilities to the Watch, in order to make it more independent from the iPhone. We're not convinced by this. Apple likes its devices to be closely tied together, and the battery life problems that come with cellular capabilities might make it an unattractive option at this time. It's still early days for the Apple Watch, so we fully expect this to be a quiet evolution rather than revolution. Thinner, lighter, faster and longer battery life is the mantra, and we'd be very happy with that.

We think September Apple predictions for 2017: Apple TV It might have escaped the attention of many people that 2017 actually marks the 10th anniversary of Apple TV. With this in mind some think that Apple could celebrate the occassion with an update to its little black box. Whether this is true or not remains a mystery, as there have been very few credible rumours about any new developments inside the Apple campus. Then there's also the fact that the usual gap between iterations of Apple TV tends to be two or three years. It was curious though that a large section of the recent WWDC event was given to the software updates in tvOS. Maybe something is cooking in the labs after all? We'll keep researching and reporting our findings, so check back regularly. Read more about the Apple TV: Apple TV (2015) review | Best Apple TV apps | Tips for using the new Apple TV Siri Remote | New Apple TV release date rumours When? We think WWDC Apple predictions for 2017: Macs The Mac Pro: The Mac Pro is long overdue a refresh as it hasn't been updated since its launch in 2013. The once futuristic device now looks a little long in the tooth, having been bypassed by generations of Intel chips that never made it into the chassis. Will Apple update the Mac Pro in 2017 or has it given up entirely on this professional Mac workstation? At this point we really don't know. Rumours of release dates and potential upgrades have come and gone, but nothing has appeared. We were hopeful that March 2017 would see new Pros announced, but nothing has materialised yet. We think a WWDC launch in June is possible. Read more about the Mac Pro: Mac Pro release date rumours & specs  | Mac Pro preview  | iMac vs Mac Pro, best pro Mac desktop When? We think WWDC MacBook Air: With the introduction of the 12-inch MacBook and the new, lightweight 13-inch MacBook Pro the writing seems pretty much on the wall for the old MacBook Air. Apple has already retired the 11-inch model in 2016, and once the 12-inch MacBook gets an update in 2017 to hopefully add an additional USB-C port and upgrade the god-awful keyboard, there won't be much room left for the Air brand.   All many of us wanted for the 13-inch model was to get a retina screen and a spec bump, but we suspect that will never happen and the MacBook Air, like the iPad Air, is on the way out. Read more here: New MacBook Air release date, specs & rumours. When? We think never... MacBook Pro: With the MacBook Pro having been released at the end of 2016, we don't expect much to change until very late in 2017. The massive redesign has already caused quite a reaction, so we'd rule out anything significant happening in the next iteration. Instead we think there will most likely be a shift to Kaby Lake chips, which in turn could open up higher RAM options. Other than that all we really want are the prices to come down. Read: MacBook Pro 2017 latest rumours. When? We think October Apple predictions for 2017: 12in Retina MacBook update Apple launched its incredibly thin and light 12in MacBook back in March 2015, and the MacBook's first birthday saw a solid if unspectacular update - various sensible specs boosts, and a rose gold colour option. The third iteration of the 12in MacBook is likely to appear at some point in 2017 - although there was no sign of it when Apple updated some of its products on 21 March. Rumours are thin on the ground right now, but some of the wilder speculation has suggested that the new version might feature a 'Force Touch keyboard' - a keyboard, in other words, that doesn't actually move in response to your key presses, instead simulating presses through haptic feedback just like the Force Touch trackpad. Sounds pretty bizarre - not to mention difficult to use for touch-typing - but that's the sort of thing you tend to hear this far ahead of a launch. We think it's more likely that Apple will install the second generation of its butterfly keyboard that appeared on the new MacBook Pro instead. Read more in our 2017 MacBook rumour round-up. When? We think WWDC Mac mini: Ah Mac Mini, where did it all go wrong? After being hobbled in 2014 by what can barely be considered an upgrade, Apple has left the Mini to fall fallow. Now we don't know whether 2017 will see a resurrection of its fortunes, but all here at Macworld are rooting for the little guy. Read more in our new Mac mini rumours article. When? We think WWDC New iMacs: The iMac range last saw updates in 2015 that moved the high-end models over to Intel's Skylake processors, and the 21.5in models to Broadwell chips. What 2017 holds in store for the range is still uncertain, as Intel's chipsets seem to be slightly out of step with Apple's demands at the moment. No iMac updates were forthcoming on 21 March when Apple updated the iPad, but they may still appear. Bloomberg has reported that new iMacs are on their way, at WWDC we think, but details are as yet unknown as to what upgrades the devices will be running. When? We think WWDC Read more in our new iMac rumours article. Apple predictions for 2017: Mac processor updates Despite Apple's adventures into processor design it's unlikely we'll see the company rolling out its own chips in its desktop and laptop machines unless it can make them fully compatible with the current Intel line-up. Wonderful though it would be to run iOS apps alongside OS X software, Apple would need to give developers several years' notice to update their applications to run on any new architecture, so expect to still be buying Intel-driven machines for at least the next 12 months. Apple predictions for 2017: Force Touch Keyboard A Force Touch keyboard could be in the works, too - as a supplement to the Magic Trackpad 2 - if a recent patent filing is anything to go by. The switchless design would allow Apple to produce even thinner MacBooks, and also to take into account the force with which a key is pressed, which will be a boon for anyone making music on their Mac. In the opposite direction it should allow for haptic feedback, which could possibly be used to signify to vision-impaired users that they're correctly striking a particular key. Apple predictions for 2017: Software & services 'Wireless mystery device' Recent photos reveal a mystery wireless device submitted to the FCC by Apple bearing the model number A1844. The mystery device, of course, caused huge stirs in the Apple community. The application claimed that it was a low-powered device with both Bluetooth and NFC wireless functionality. This led some to believe that it was either going to be a new, smaller Apple TV or possibly even an accessory for Apple Pay, allowing small businesses to accept wireless/Apple Pay payments. However, while we'd all hoped it'd be a cool new Apple device, further investigation seems to suggest that it's nothing more than a badge reader that attaches to a door assembly, most likely for use in Apple's Apple Park HQ opening in April 2017. There's a snap of the wireless device above, but those that want more information can check out the full FCC filing here.  iOS 11 Apple traditionally announces new version of iOS in June, followed by the release in the autumn. So far the only strong rumour about the new operating system is that it will include an improved 'natural-sounding' Siri as Apple works to improve the behaviour and repsonse of its voice interface. Another strong possibility is the inclusion of a Dark Mode with black backgrounds rather than the bright white normally found on iOS, and there's an outside chance that your Contacts could become active in iOS11, meaning you can see when people are available to chat. Read more about the latest rumours in our iOS release date rumours UK article. Plus you can revisit the changes Apple made in iOS 10 by watching the video below. Apple predictions for 2017: macOS X Like iOS 11, the new version of Apple's Mac operating system will be unveiled at WWDC 2017 in June, and then roll out in the autumn. So far there are no real rumours about what Apple will include in the new update. Siri integration was at the centre of the 2016 release, so it's possible that those features will be enhanced and improved upon for the 2017 update. As always, check back regularly and we'll keep you up to date on any new developments. Also check out our OS X 10.13 Rumours page. To refresh your memories on what Apple included in macOS 10.12 Sierra read more here: macOS Sierra new features and release date or watch the discussion video: Apple predictions for 2017: WatchOS 4 WatchOS is developing nicely and in 2017 we expect to see the introduction of Sleep Tracking, which would further bolster the fitness focus of the Apple Watch. No other news as yet, but we'll keep digging In the mean time you could read about the improvements made in watchOS3 here: watchOS 3 new features or listen to our discussion about it. Apple predictions for 2017: tvOS Last and probably least of Apple's four software platforms, tvOS nevertheless got a decent update at WWDC 2016 which we think will probably carry it through 2017. You can read all the gory details in our article New tvOS features, but we also discuss the new features in this video: Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Pay Alongside these headline developments, there will be a whole series of speedbumps along the way as Apple extends and refines its Apple Pay offering. We anticipate that Apple Pay will be accepted in a wider range of headline stores.  Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Music Apple Music - which is now available on Android - will inevitably expand. With 15 million subscribers in 2016 Apple Music made a decent start, but is it good enough to continue this momentum and can it really compete with the likes of Spotify? As for Beats 1, we're not convinced this is making the impact Apple hoped for, but the we probably aren't the target market for it. We'd like to see more radio channels tuned to less trendy music choices. There are also rumours that streaming on Apple Music could be enhanced, with high-resolution better quality audio for that service - up to 96kHz/24-bit, according to a report on Macotakara. Since the 3.5mm headphone jack is limited to CD quality sound this appears to back up the motives for Apple ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7, as the Lighting port can offer HD audio. Apple Music may also prove to be the one thing that keeps the iPod on the shelves in 2017. If you'd asked us what we thought of its chances at the close of 2014, we'd have said 'slim', but 2015 saw Apple deliver the first proper update to the iPod touch in three years, and it's now providing another entry ramp for the firm's £9.99 a month music subscription service. That alone means it makes sense to give it at least 12 months to prove itself. The same can't necessarily be said of the nano and shuffle, which are each available in just one configuration and, without streaming abilities, offer no ongoing revenue source. Apple Music saw a major redesign at WWDC 2016. We discuss the changes in this video: Apple predictions for 2017: Mergers & acquisitions Apple has got quite a lot money, and armchair pundits love to spend the company's money for it. Buy Tesla! Buy GoPro! Buy Sonos! From time to time these suggestion-cum-predictions come true, as with Apple's acqusition of Beats in 2014, but it hardly needs stating that the company isn't in a hurry to divest itself of that cash cushion. Any merger & acqusition activity is likely to be comparatively conservative: rather than going for the big names that crop up in prediction articles like this one, Apple is far more likely to pick up smallish but promising firms on the way up and take their products in house - just as it did with Siri. We do know of a few big deals that Apple has considered recently, though. The Financial Times reports that in May 2016 Apple sat down with Time Warner, one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, and spoke seriously about an acquisition deal. The deal never got beyond the exploratory phase, but this does strongly suggest that Apple is in the market for an acquisition that will give it a foothold in video content - something that would prove valuable in the event that its rumoured TV-streaming service comes to pass. With Time Warner apparently out of the picture, many analysts believe that the next target could be Netflix, but we're still in the realm of the mega-deal, so don't bet your live savings on the deal happening. Apple's Gliimpse acqusition On 22 August 2016 Fast Company reported that Apple had made an intriguing new acquisition: Gliimpse, a startup that enables users to collect and collate personal health data. It's not known at this point how much the acqusition cost Apple, but the company has confirmed the deal, albeit with its usual boilerplate statement that it "buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and generally [does] not discuss [its] purpose or plans". Gliimpse was created in response to the bureaucratic difficulties in the US related to health documentation: the lack of an overarching authority or standardised system makes it exceptionally difficult for patients to access and usefully analyse their own data. And this makes it an obvious fit with Apple's recent health-related announcements. With the launch of HealthKit and CareKit, the company intends to revolutionise the health and medical care sector, and has a track record of providing umbrella services - in music, fitness and mobile software most successfully - that make complex markets easier for consumers to approach. Related fact: one of Gliimpse's founders, Anil Sethi, started his career at Apple in the 1980s. Apple's Turi acquisition At the start of August 2016, Apple acquired a Seattle artificial intelligence company named Turi, according to a report by GeekWire. The site's sources peg the deal at approximately $200m, although both Apple and Turi have declined to comment on the matter. Turi's specialities, artificial intelligence and machine learning, are hot right now and the acquisition represents Apple's way into an increasingly crucial area of the tech sector. Google is big on artificial intelligence, as are Facebook and Amazon, but Apple itself has discussed the subject in numerous recent product launches. iOS's QuickType keyboard uses artificial intelligence to predict what you're trying to type; iOS also uses it to suggest apps it reckons you're likely to use and contacts you'll want to speak to, and the new automated album creation tool in Photos uses deep learning techniques to analyse faces, places and objects and create coherent compositions. watchOS 3's Instant Apps feature is dependent on being able to predict which apps you'll want to use next. But Apple's products are only going to get smarter over the coming years, as Turi's tech is integrated into the portfolio. Apple's Tuplejump acquisition Further to it buying Turi, Apple followed up the next month, September 2016, by buying Tuplejump. Like Turi, it is a machine learning company that allows better data management for businesses. According to TechCrunch, Apple's interest in the acquisition was down to Tuplejump's focus on open source ways of applying machine learning and analytics to big data. This again points to Apple's increasing interest in improving its artificial intelligence products such as Siri.  Apple's $1bn investment in Didi Chuxing After its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launch, Apple invested a huge $1bn in the uber-competitor, Didi Chuxing - a Chinese company that forced Uber out of its local market. The company is valued at $35bn, and with a further $1bn investment from Apple, it seems that there is certain weight behind the movement in China - this came come in a form of advertising of Apple products in China, to Apple-product integration within taxis. Given the boom of the Chinese market, it seems that investors are happy with this move. Apple predictions for 2017: But don't expect… The Apple Car, was the hot rumour of 2016, but now it seems that Apple has scaled back it's ambitions and now thought to see working on a software solution rather than the hardware. The company is said to have had up to 1,000 developers working on the so-called Project Titan, and to have set up various different front companies, including Faraday Futures and Sixty Eight Research. We'd love to see it on the roads in 2017, but industry chatter suggests 2020 is a more likely date. If they're right, it might not be worth holding back on an interim upgrade to your existing run-around next year. And if you were hoping for an actual television set from Apple it's time to give up on that idea too. We won't see an Apple car this year, but you can expect the rumours to continue.

Duan Yongping is convinced Tim Cook didn't have a clue who he was when they first met a couple years ago. The Apple boss probably does now. Duan is the reclusive billionaire who founded Oppo and Vivo, the twin smartphone brands that dealt the world's largest company a stinging defeat in China last year. Once derided as cheap iPhone knockoffs, they leapfrogged the rankings and  shoved Apple Inc. out of the top three in 2016 -- when iPhone shipments fell in China for the first time. They managed to do it because the American smartphone giant didn't adapt to local competition, the entrepreneur told Bloomberg in what he said was his first interview in 10 years. Oppo and Vivo employed tactics Apple was reluctant to match, such as cheaper devices with high-end features, for fear of jeopardizing its winning formula elsewhere, Duan said. "Apple couldn't beat us in China because even they have flaws," the 56-year-old electronics mogul said. "They're maybe too stubborn sometimes. They made a lot of great things, like their operating system, but we surpass them in other areas." That's not to say Duan doesn't appreciate the iPhone maker's global clout. In fact, the billionaire's obsession with his U.S. rival is legion: he's long been a big-time investor in Apple and an unabashed fan of its chief executive officer. "I've met Tim Cook on several occasions. He might not know me but we've chatted a little," Duan said. "I like him a lot." Apple couldn't confirm Duan's meeting with Cook when contacted by Bloomberg. But Duan has blogged incessantly about Apple's products, share price and operations since 2013, when the company was worth half what it is today. He needs "a really big pocket" because he carries four devices, including a heavily-used iPhone. In a 2015 post, he argued Apple's profit should reach $100 billion within five years. Today, Duan won't say when he actually bought in but says much of his overseas wealth remains tied up in the iPhone maker. He even lives in Palo Alto, an easy drive from Apple's new UFO-like headquarters in Cupertino. "Apple is an extraordinary company. It is a model for us to learn from," Duan said. "We don't have the concept of surpassing anyone, the focus instead is to improve ourselves." Oppo's gains against Apple may now earn an even broader following for the billionaire dubbed China's Warren Buffett by local media for his investment acumen. Born in Jiangxi, a birthplace of Mao Zedong's Communist revolution, Duan began his career at a state-run vacuum tube plant before making his name with homegrown electronics. Duan left the factory floor around 1990, when China was just embracing capitalism and opening industries to private investment. He headed to southern China's Guangdong province, then the cradle of liberal reforms, to run a struggling electronics plant. His first product was the "Subor" gaming console with dual-cartridge slots -- a direct shot at Nintendo Co.'s classic Family Computer, known elsewhere as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The 100- to 400-yuan Subor became a hit in the absence of local competitors. Duan even enlisted Kung Fu star Jackie Chan to endorse the device. By 1995, revenue from the Subor exceeded 1 billion yuan. Duan left to set up a new business that year as the operation flourished -- a pattern he would repeat in later years. He christened his second venture Bubugao, literally "rising higher step-by-step." BBK, as the company came to be known, created a popular line of VCD and MP3 players but later also made DVD players for global brands. Subsidiary Bubugao Communication Equipment Co. became one of the country's biggest feature-phone makers around 2000, going head-to-head with Nokia and Motorola. It was the first iPhone in 2007 that paved the way for Oppo and Vivo. While they share a common founder in Duan, the sister brands are fierce competitors, trotting out dueling marketing campaigns in markets from India to Southeast Asia. Their salesmanship philosophy plays well in emerging markets, IDC research manager Kiranjeet Kaur said. "The companies fully understand how to make the best of their people, a specialty they inherited from Duan," said Nicole Peng, a senior director at Canalys. Importantly, they understood their millennial audience. "Many of their managers are young and have been working at the company since graduation." Duan's latest endeavors were, in part, dreamed up in Apple's backyard. By 2001 at the age of 40, Duan had decided to move to California to focus on investment and philanthropy, later installing his family in a mansion he reportedly bought from Cisco Systems Inc. Chairman John Chambers. But the advent of the smartphone forced the entrepreneur out of retirement. By the second half of 2000s, BBK was on the verge of falling apart as sales of its basic devices slowed. The likes of Huawei and Coolpad were making smartphones priced at around 1,000 yuan. That nearly put the company under, Duan recalled. "We were in serious discussions about how to close the company peacefully -- in a way that the employees can leave unhurt and suppliers don't lose money," he said. Those intense brainstorming sessions spawned the two businesses that would go on to embody Duan's greatest success. In 2005, the entrepreneur and his protege Tony Chen decided to create a new company. Dubbed Oppo, it sold music players but ramped up to smartphones in 2011. In 2009, BBK itself created Vivo, headed by another of Duan's disciples, Shen Wei. "Making mobile phones was not my call," said Duan. "But I reckoned we could do well in this market." At first, neither label garnered much attention. The iPhone was captivating users with its revolutionary apps system and elegant interface, while BlackBerrys lorded over the corporate market. But Oppo and Vivo then developed a marketing-blitz approach that relied on local celebrity endorsement and a vast re-sellers' store network across China. They crafted an affordable image that appealed to a millennial crowd, then tricked out their devices with high-end specs. On the surface, Oppo and Vivo phones now routinely surpass the iPhone on measures such as charging speeds, memory and battery life. It paid off. The duo together shipped more than 147 million smartphones in China in 2016, dwarfing Huawei Technologies Co.'s 76.6 million units, Apple's 44.9 million and Xiaomi's 41.5 million, IDC estimates. Oppo and Vivo both doubled their 2015 haul. In the fourth quarter, they were No. 1 and No. 3, respectively -- Huawei was second. Their approach worked particularly well in lower-tier cities, where mid-range phones became a mainstream hit, said Tay Xiaohan, an IDC analyst. Duan's smartphone progeny are also gaining some momentum beyond their home turf. In the fourth quarter, Oppo and Vivo were fourth and fifth in the world, respectively. About a quarter of Oppo's shipments went to markets like India, where it hopes to dig in before Apple establishes a meaningful presence. "Smartphones are an unprecedented opportunity. We forecast at least for the next 10 or 20 years, there's no replacement. But we don't know," Duan said. Cook said on the weekend that Apple doesn't have a specific goal for market share. "The competition is more fierce in China -- not only in this industry, but in many industries," Cook told the China Development Forum in Beijing. "I think that's a credit to a number of local companies that put their energies into making good products." Duan has increasingly kept his distance from the Chinese smartphone makers despite remaining a significant shareholder (he won't say how much). He says he prefers to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy California with his journalist wife and kids. In fact, he attends board meetings but claims to get most of his information on Oppo and Vivo from the internet, to avoid "disturbing them." His rivals have been less considerate. Last October, Xiaomi Corp. co-founder Lei Jun lambasted competitors who build dense store channels in rural areas in pursuit of quick sales. In an interview with China Entrepreneurs Magazine in October, Lei accused such players of using "imbalanced information" to trick buyers into shunning Xiaomi, precipitating its decline from the top spot. "Those who said this were insane," Duan said without naming names. "When someone talks about an information imbalance, deep down they believe consumers are idiots." His most visible passion these days is stock investment, which is why he agreed to pay a then-record $620,100 in 2006 to lunch with Buffett. Quotes from the Sage of Omaha still pepper Duan's blogposts, right alongside tips on golf and Apple. Duan cemented his reputation as a savvy financier in part by digging his friend, Netease Inc. founder William Ding, out of a hole. Ding's internet company tanked to as low as 13 cents after the dot-com bubble burst, then almost became the first U.S.-listed Chinese company to get tossed off the Nasdaq over an auditing issue. Duan came to his friend's aid, buying about 5 percent of Netease with just $2 million in 2002, when the stock price averaged 16 cents. Company filings show he still held just over 4 million shares as of March 2009, but Duan said he sold much of that when Netease hit $40. His other much-studied holding is premium-liquor company Kweichow Moutai Co. He said he bought in at 180 yuan in late 2012. While it nearly halved in 2014, Moutai today trades above 370 yuan. Duan isn't shy about talking up his trades, not least of which is Apple, which remains near a record high despite a rare sales decline in 2016. But looking back on his decades as first entrepreneur then stock-picker, his proudest moments remain rooted in BBK. Though he claims to keep it at arm's length, he admits to worrying about succession and whether the company culture will survive another generation of leaders. And while BBK's Vivo and Duan's own Oppo have done well, there's no certainty in a fast-moving business. Both are starting to ramp up everything from the features on their phones to marketing campaigns: Oppo notably used Barcelona's Mobile World Congress to unveil its most advanced camera technology yet, signaling a new maturity. One thing's for sure, Duan doesn't see himself returning to an active executive, leaving others to deal with the next challenge. "I've made it clear many years ago, I will never make a comeback," he said. "If there's a problem they can't fix, then neither can I."

Reuters/Kim Hong-Ji If latest reports are to be believed, Samsung is developing display panels that are pressure sensitive for both Galaxy Note 8 and S8. It will be reportedly similar to Apple’s Force Touch that featured in iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus are said to pack some of the best specs and features in the smartphone market today. The smartphones will have desktop connectivity, virtual assistant and a button-free front among a plethora of features. Earlier reports had mentioned that the handsets will have a virtual Home button. However, due to manufacturing issues on Synaptics’ part, the fingerprint sensor will be moved to the back. Samsung Display is currently working on OLED Force Touch Panels. This technology will first be adopted by the S8 handsets and then by Samsung Galaxy Note 8, which will take matters to a completely new level. Thus, the Home button in the two devices will be pressure-sensitive. The in-house panels will be used for the devices. The company is separating home button navigation and fingerprint recognition, which many experts believe as a step back, writes Wccftech. Insider sources have claimed that Samsung has showcased its latest technology during MWC 2017 to a select few. According to the Investor, the OLED Force Touch Panels will be highly sensitive and boast a wider range of pressure-sensing levels than previous technologies used in Huawei P9. Once the technology is incorporated in Galaxy S8, Samsung will better the technology further so that it can be incorporated in the Note 8. It will be Samsung’s first mobile device that will feature a complete pressure-sensitive touch screen. Moreover, it will be the first big major Galaxy Note 8 upgrade in two years. The upcoming Note device is expected to be immensely successful as the Galaxy devices will fill the void created by the Note 7 disaster, as they are releasing first. The S8 and S8 Plus devices are rumoured to be revealed in seven different colour options. Moreover, the Note device is expected to be the most powerful device in the market when it hits stores in the latter half of this year. There are numerous rumours about the release date of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Some feel it will be released along with the Galaxy S8 devices this month. Traditionally the Note flagships are unveiled during the IFA trade show every year in early September. But for the past two years, the company has been unveiling its Note devices in August to get ahead of Apple.

Their approach worked particularly well in lower-tier cities, where mid-range phones became a mainstream hit, said Tay Xiaohan, an IDC analyst.  Duan’s smartphone progeny are also gaining some momentum beyond their home turf. In the fourth quarter, Oppo and Vivo were fourth and fifth in the world, respectively. About a quarter of Oppo’s shipments went to markets like India, where it hopes to dig in before Apple establishes a meaningful presence. Duan also owns a “small amount” of Alphabet Inc., whose Android operating software runs Oppo and Vivo devices as it does the majority of the world’s smartphones. “Smartphones are an unprecedented opportunity. We forecast at least for the next 10 or 20 years, there’s no replacement. But we don’t know,” Duan said. Cook said on the weekend that Apple doesn’t have a specific goal for market share. “The competition is more fierce in China -- not only in this industry, but in many industries,” Cook told the China Development Forum in Beijing. “I think that’s a credit to a number of local companies that put their energies into making good products.” Duan has increasingly kept his distance from the Chinese smartphone makers despite remaining a significant shareholder (he won’t say how much). He says he prefers to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy California with his journalist wife and kids. In fact, he attends board meetings but claims to get most of his information on Oppo and Vivo from the internet, to avoid “disturbing them.” His rivals have been less considerate. Last October, Xiaomi Corp. co-founder Lei Jun lambasted competitors who build dense store channels in rural areas in pursuit of quick sales. In an interview with China Entrepreneurs Magazine in October, Lei accused such players of using “imbalanced information” to trick buyers into shunning Xiaomi, precipitating its decline from the top spot. “Those who said this were insane,” Duan said without naming names. “When someone talks about an information imbalance, deep down they believe consumers are idiots.” His most visible passion these days is stock investment, which is why he agreed to pay a then-record $620,100 in 2006 to lunch with Buffett. Quotes from the Sage of Omaha still pepper Duan’s blogposts, right alongside tips on golf and Apple. Duan cemented his reputation as a savvy financier in part by digging his friend, Netease Inc. founder William Ding, out of a hole. Ding’s internet company tanked to as low as 13 cents after the dot-com bubble burst, then almost became the first U.S.-listed Chinese company to get tossed off the Nasdaq over an auditing issue. Duan came to his friend’s aid, buying about 5 percent of Netease with just $2 million in 2002, when the stock price averaged 16 cents. Company filings show he still held just over 4 million shares as of March 2009, but Duan said he sold much of that when Netease hit $40. His other much-studied holding is premium-liquor company Kweichow Moutai Co. He said he bought in at 180 yuan in late 2012. While it nearly halved in 2014, Moutai today trades above 370 yuan. Duan isn’t shy about talking up his trades, not least of which is Apple, which remains near a record high despite a rare sales decline in 2016. But looking back on his decades as first entrepreneur then stock-picker, his proudest moments remain rooted in BBK. Though he claims to keep it at arm’s length, he admits to worrying about succession and whether the company culture will survive another generation of leaders. Management has tossed around the idea of an initial public offering but that wasn’t an urgent consideration, Duan said. And while BBK’s Vivo and Duan’s own Oppo have done well, there’s no certainty in a fast-moving business. Both are starting to ramp up everything from the features on their phones to marketing campaigns: Oppo notably used Barcelona’s Mobile World Congress to unveil its most advanced camera technology yet, signaling a new maturity. One thing’s for sure, Duan doesn’t see himself returning to an active executive, leaving others to deal with the next challenge. “I’ve made it clear many years ago, I will never make a comeback,” he said. “If there’s a problem they can’t fix, then neither can I.” (Updates with BBK’s IPO and Alphabet holding from 21st paragraph.)

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Apple found guilty of price-fixing in Russia, strong-arming its retail partners Apple found guilty of price-fixing in Russia, strong-arming its retail partners By Joel Hruska on March 17, 2017 at 9:15 am Comment Apple has run into trouble with US regulators on several occasions to date, including its attempt to illegally collude with book publishers to manipulate eBook prices. Up until now, the company has never been accused of breaking the law on iPhone prices. Earlier this week, the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service ruled Apple’s Russian subsidiary had illegally ordered its retail partners to sell the iPhone 5s, 5c, iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, and 6s Plus only at its own specified prices. Furthermore, Apple monitored all 16 of its partners and would get in touch with them immediately if it discovered they were setting prices below the accepted level. The terms of the agreements Apple struck with these companies allowed them to terminate their relationship with its 16 Russian partners at any time, for any reason. Apple, which previously protested the charges and claimed Russian companies were free to set their own prices has since changed its tune. “We worked closely with FAS during their investigation and are glad to put this matter behind us,” an Apple spokesperson told FT. “We work hard to make the best products and services in the world for our customers and are deeply committed to making sure our resellers are able to compete fairly in the markets where we do business.” Apple’s specific scheme, according to the Russian report, was to require its resellers to hold to its own specified prices for a period of three months. As schemes go, it’s a smart one. The chart below illustrates why, but remember, this is a fiscal year chart, not a calendar year chart. Apple’s Q1 2017 began on September 25, 2016, for example. This chart shows how Apple’s quarters break down compared with the calendar year. Each Q1 spike equals a new iPhone launch. The 5S in Q1 2014, the iPhone 6 in Q1 2015, the 6s in 2016, and so on. In both FY 2014 and 2015, the first quarter accounted for 30% and 32% of all iPhone sales that year. In other words, if Apple wanted to strong-arm companies into obeying its own pricing model, it would do so at launch. The company could face a fine of up to 15% of its sales in Russia. The last interesting bit of the puzzle is Apple’s statement contains no specific denial of the charges brought against it. It has become common practice in the US to allow corporations to escape taking responsibility for their actions by not requiring them to admit wrongdoing as a condition of settlement, and can instead chalk things up to “mistakes,” “accidents,” or “robust competition” depending on the circumstances. It’s nice to see that particular custom hasn’t embedded itself everywhere just yet.

Anker braided Lightning cables Bloomberg spotted a mystery Apple wireless device code-named A1844 going through testing back in September of last year. We noted one clue that it likely wasn’t a consumer-facing device – the color-coded wiring – and photos now posted by the FCC confirm this. Spotted by Business Insider, device A1844 is revealed to be nothing more interesting than an electronic badge reader for a door. 1. Present the company provided credential to the reader. 2. The reader will indicate granted access by briefly changing color to green and playing a sound. Declined access is indicated by red color and a second sound.  Since Apple seems content to leave it to third-party companies to make HomeKit-compatible devices like smart locks, this is almost certainly designed purely for Apple’s own use. One of the details revealed during a rare look inside the Apple Park campus was iPhone-like elevator buttons. Given the famed attention to detail of both Steve Jobs, the man behind the spaceship campus project, and Jony Ive, whose design remit was extended beyond products to Apple Stores and more, it seems likely this is a custom fitting designed for the new building. Apple last month officially named the campus and theater, and revealed that the first staff would move in next month, with construction work continuing through to September.

It has been around since 2010 and Apple encourages you to "talk to Siri as you would to a friend" so you can get things done — like sending messages, making calls and finding restaurants. Siri's got a sense of humour too. If you ask her to borrow some money, she'll sagely reply with, "Neither a borrower nor a lender be." Read More Siri will pretend to be the computer from Lego Batman But sometimes it can lead to something more serious. The Mirror reports that iPhone users have been taking to Twitter recently telling others to say the number 108 to Siri, adding things like, "You'll thank me later." But saying 108 will put you through to the emergency services in the UK because this number is the equivalent of 999 in India, writes The Sun . So what Siri does is recognise it as an emergency call, and puts you through to the services in your area. (Photo: Western Mail) Another would-be prankster went one further and urged people to not only say "108", but to then close their eyes for five seconds. This would of course mean you don't cotton on to the fact you've called the UK's emergency services until it's too late. Other numbers includes in similar pranks are: 112,110, 000 and the US number 911. Read More Sending iPhone messages after the iOS 10 update is way more fun than before What makes this prank particularly inadvisable are the thinly stretched resources of our emergency services. There could also be serious repercussions for anyone caught wasting the emergency services' time.

Source: ImagineChina The evening briefing will soon be available in your inbox every day. To be among the first to get it, sign up here.  Reclusive Chinese billionaire Duan Yongping has opened up about how he managed to topple Apple in China with a pair of cheap smartphones and some very savvy marketing. Once derided as cheap iPhone knockoffs, his Oppo and Vivo phones have leapfrogged Apple in the rankings, pushing the U.S. smartphone giant out of China's top three. Duan says Apple's Tim Cook had no idea who he was when they met a few years ago. He likely knows now.—Brent O'Brien and Alex Millson Singapore and Australia are two of the world's healthiest nations, but when it comes to living a long life Italy is the place to be, according to the Bloomberg Global Health Index. A baby born in Italy can expect to become an octogenarian, while 2,800 miles south in Sierra Leone the average newborn will die by age 52. Uber's President has had enough. Jeff Jones is quitting after less than a year with the ride-hailing app due to a long string of controversies surrounding the company. Scandals range from allegations of sexual harassment and a toxic work culture to the combative behavior of CEO Travis Kalanick, who was recently caught on camera berating an Uber driver. Default fears are resurfacing in Singapore ahead of a wall of maturing corporate debt. Pressure to pay down obligations has been unrelenting. Companies excluding banks in Singapore must repay S$38 billion ($27 billion) of local bonds through the end of 2020. Six firms have defaulted on S$1.2 billion worth of notes since November 2015. A Chinese lampshade-maker is hanging by a thread. Donald Trump's threatened tariffs on Chinese goods could kill off thousands of small and medium-sized businesses in China that rely on exports to the U.S. At Eric Li's glass factory, three of his four furnaces sit dormant and his staff of 1,000 lampshade and vase makers has been slashed to 150 from more than 1,000 a decade ago. Trump's tariffs could finish off his business. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Why resource-rich Australia can't keep its lights on. The country has some of the world's largest reserves of fossil fuels but it's running short on gas, which has raised the prospect of widespread power outages in the near future. The crisis recently prompted Tesla CEO Elon Musk to claim he could fix the problem within 100 days. Now summer peak demand has eased and it looks like the lights will stay on - for another two years at least. How do you spot the truly rich in Switzerland? Forget shiny timepieces and instead take a look at their license plates. Switzerland doesn’t allow vanity plates, so special or lucky numbers sell for big money. While Swiss auctions of license plate numbers can’t quite compete with those in the United Arab Emirates — where the wealthy pay millions of dollars — they are not far behind.

Unfortunately, the Galaxy S8 won’t be released until the end of April, and the iPhone 8 won’t be available until the fall. But let’s take a look at the latest revelations from the past week. iPhone 8 Though it hasn’t been confirmed, BGR says Apple could entirely ditch the Touch ID on the upcoming iPhone 8. “Apple, meanwhile, is also expected to add facial recognition support to the iPhone 8, and there’s more and more indirect evidence that seemingly confirms the feature. It’s unclear at this point whether Apple will also use iris scanners for Apple Pay purposes, but a number of reports do say the iPhone 8 will have special sensors that will recognize faces and surroundings.” Will Apple get rid of the Touch ID? [Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] The article adds that these advanced cameras may not only replace the Touch ID, but will be used for AR purposes as well. Some of the commenters after the article aren’t very excited. “Apple plans on putting Touch ID on a dongle and charge a measly 99 dollars for it. It will be practically magic,” AquaVelva sarcastically points out. “This feature was OK when I got it on my Galaxy Nexus in 2011,” says VAVAMk_2 Last week, MacRumors reported that the iPhone 8 may not have the curved OLED screen that it was rumored to have. However, this week, Apple Insider reported that Apple’s next smartphone may indeed have a curved OLED screen, but it won’t be curved as much as some had hoped. For others, this is okay since they don’t like looking at curved videos or photos. There are also some who think that a curved screen takes away important real estate space on a smartphone. Galaxy S8 Samsung’s new phones will have curved screens just like the Galaxy Note 7. [Image by Daryl Deino] Speaking of curved screens, it appears that both the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus will have similar curved displays, except the one on the S8 Plus will be 6.2 inches, while the display on the regular S8 will measure 5.8 inches. More importantly, both screens will have an increased pixel resolution. First, there were rumors that Samsung would deliver a 4K screen to at least one of its new Galaxy S8 ­­­devices. This excited people who own or plan to own the Gear VR since the Quad HD screens from previous Galaxy devices that powered the Gear VR looked too pixelated in VR. Then, there was disappointment as it appeared that both the Galaxy S8 and the S8 Plus would only sport Quad HD screens like the previous generations. However, reliable information from BGR reveals that both devices will display Quad HD+ screens with a 2960 x 2400 pixel resolution. It’s not quite 4K, but it’s close. This means that the screen door pixel effect in the Gear VR will be minimized. This is also good news for everybody else who doesn’t use the Gear VR; a 4K screen would eat up way too much battery life. Leaked images of the S8 devices have appeared all over Twitter.

Reporter Sam Kim says that the new Galaxy S8 will employ facial recognition technology for mobile payments within a couple months after its release. They will allegedly add cutting-edge security for this. Samsung is going to announce the S8 series on March 29, and both the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are expected to arrive in stores — at least in the United States — on April 21. Based on all the information revealed, are you more excited about the Galaxy S8 than the iPhone 8? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry Apple Pledges Two More R&D Centers Investing Over Half a Billion Dollars in China By Rafia Shaikh Mar 17, 2017 15Shares Share Tweet Submit While you may be getting excited about Apple potentially working an all-American iPhone, the Cupertino tech giant is furthering its investment in China. The company has set up two new research and development centers in Shanghai and Suzhou. Apple announced its plans on Friday in a post on its Chinese website. The new locations are added to those previously announced for Beijing and Shenzhen with Apple pledging to invest more than half a billion dollars (over 3.5 billion yuan). All four centers are expected to open later in 2017, Apple said. Related Apple Acquires ‘Workflow’ – A Powerful Automation App For iOS And Makes It Free While the iPhone maker focuses on its new product development programs in Cupertino, the company hopes to attract graduates from local universities in China. The company noted that it’s important to develop technical expertise in the Apple supply chain, with a focus on university graduates. Apple’s research and development center in China aims to develop technical experts in the Apple supply chain and [among] graduates from universities such as Peking University, Tsinghua University and Shanghai Jiaotong University. As part of Apple’s continued growth and investment in China, the company has partnered with schools to include internship programs to help develop the next generation of entrepreneurs. Some suggest that the company is investing more in China to be in the good books of the local government. The news comes as CEO Tim Cook plans to attend the China Development Forum – an annual conference that gathers Chinese officials and global executives – over the weekend. Advertisement Apple mentioned that while it directly employs only 12,000 people in China, it has “created” over 4.8 million jobs in the country, including 1.8 million iOS app developers. Last year, Chinese authorities forced the Cupertino tech giant to shut down its online music and book services in the country. With the sales falling 17% in its latest fiscal year in the country, and iPhone facing some strong competition from companies like Oppo and Huawei, Apple could be looking to curry favor with not only the government for easier access and fewer restrictions but also to attract local talent to compete against these companies. Related Apple’s Online Store Will Be Unavailable Tomorrow Due To ‘Maintenance’ Dan Riccio, senior vice president of hardware engineering at Apple, said the company is “honored to have excellent talent and positive entrepreneurial spirit in China” and is “looking forward to working with more local partners and academic institutions through the expansion of R&D centers.” Source Share Tweet Submit <a href="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538336708&cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Related ‘Will Shift iPhone Production To U.S. If Apple Bears All Costs’ – Pegatron CEO On Shifting iPhone Production Mar 15, 2017 18 With the Release of iOS 11 Apple Might Kill as Many as 200,000 Apps – Here’s Why Mar 15, 2017 10 Smart Homes With Apple’s HomeKit Integration For Sale In San Jose, California Mar 15, 2017 13 Apple Hires Jonathan Zdziarski – Popular iOS Security Researcher and Forensics Expert Mar 14, 2017 11 Apple Expected to Announce New iPad Pros Next Week Along With 128GB iPhone SE Mar 13, 2017 14 Google Photos For iOS Has Picked Up A Brand New Editing Feature Mar 9, 2017 16 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

With Apple and its A10 processor employing TSMC's InFO-PoP technology, the fan-out market has exploded. Apple's involvement will undoubtedly generate increased interest in the fanout platform, and market revenue is forecast to reach around US$2.5B in 2021, with 80% growth between 2015 - 2017. Moreover, following the high-volume adoption of InFO and the further development of fan-out wafer level packaging technologies, a wave of new players may enter the market. The supply chain is also expected to evolve, with a considerable amount of investment in Fan-Out packaging capabilities. In such a fast-growing Fan-Out market, it is essential to deeply understand the global patent landscape in order to anticipate changes, harvest business opportunities, mitigate risks, and make strategic decisions in order to strengthen one's market position and maximize return on one's IP portfolio. The report thoroughly investigates the Fan-Out packaging patent landscape (chip-first, chip-last, face-down, face-up, single-die, multi-chip module, package-on-package, system-inpackage, etc.), and this report contains detailed patent analyses including countries of filing, patents' legal status, and patented technologies, as well as patent owners, their IP position, and IP strategies. More than 3,100 patents relating to over 1,200 inventions on Fan-Out packaging have been published worldwide through September 2016, coming from 100+ patent applicants. A first wave of patent applications occurred from 1999-2006, induced by Infineon. Patent applications have increased since then, with Freescale (NXP), STATS ChipPAC (JCET), SPIL, Amkor, and TSMC entering the Fan-Out IP arena. Today the number of enforceable patents is increasing worldwide, with several companies already standing out by virtue of their strong IP position. All of major players involved has filed patents on Fan-Out packaging, except for Nanium, which does not file any patents at all but instead has adopted a different IP strategy that we discuss in this report. Another special case is the presence of patent licensing companies like Polaris Innovations (WiLAN), which in 2015 acquired key patents from Infineon/Qimonda. The visibility of such companies in the patent landscape is a tangible sign of the market explodes. In the next few years Polaris Innovations could assert its patents to make money, and in this report we present its most critical patents. We have also noted Samsung's conspicuous IP presence in the FOWLP patent landscape, despite the company's unclear market position. R&D labs are also present (i.e. Fraunhofer, A - STAR, CEA), but to a lesser extent. Most new entrants in the FOWLP patent landscape are Chinese players (HuaTian Technology, NCAP, SMIC), and more recently we have observed Apple's appearance. Apple, which this year chose TSMC's InFO-PoP technology for its A10 APE, has recently filed some patents on Fan-Out wafer level packaging (chip-last, chip-first, PoP, and SiP), reflecting a genuine interest in the FOWLP platform. Key Features Of The Report: - IP trends, including time evolutions and countries of patent filings - Patents' current legal status - Ranking of main patent applicants - IP collaboration, joint development, and licensing agreements - Key players' IP position, and relative strength of their patent portfolios - Patent segmentation by technology solution (chip-first, chip-last, facedown, face-up), process steps (die placement, molding, planarization, RDL), architecture (multi-chip, PoP, SiP, face-to-face package), and technical challenge (warpage, die shift) - Matrix showing patent applicants and their patented technologies - Technical solutions found in patents for warpage and die-shift issues. - FOWLP IP profiles for 18 key companies, including countries of filing, patents' legal status, patented technologies, prior art strength index, IP blocking potential, partnerships, and IP strategy - Excel database with all patents (3,100+) analyzed in this report, including technology segmentation.

With that in mind, we want to take a look at the most important things to know about the iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. In March, Apple rolled out its highly anticipated iOS 9.3 update. It went through an extensive beta but the update immediately caused problems for iPhone and iPad users. To address these bugs and other lingering issues, Apple pushed out several new versions of iOS 9.3. iOS 9.3.1 arrived with some important bug fixes and patches. After that, Apple pushed out an iOS 9.3.2 update to the iPhone 4s and other iOS 9-powered devices. A few days after that, it released iOS 9.3.3 update. Soon after that, the company pushed out iOS 9.3.4 update. Shortly after the release of iOS 9.3.4, Apple released an iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. It will be the last update the iPhone 4s receives from Apple. The iPhone 4s will never get iOS 10. If you’re coming from the iOS 9.3.4 update, iOS 9.3.5 features three three patches and nothing else. If you’re coming from something older than iOS 9.3.4, your iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update is going to be a much larger update. Apple’s previous iOS updates are baked in. With that in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone 4s users need to know about the iOS 9.3.5 update’s performance, its problems, the iOS downgrade process, and more. iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 Reviews   1 / 7 We've been able to spend some quality hands-on time with many of Apple's other iOS updates but we haven't spent enough time to provide quality feedback about the iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. So, we must turn to the opinions of others. As we push further and further away from Apple's iOS 9.3.5 release date we've seen iPhone 4s users from all over the world relay feedback about the update's performance. If you haven't installed yet you should make it a point to dig into these mini reviews. iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update reviews are still mixed months after the update's release. While some users are seeing solid performance in key areas like battery life and connectivity, others are complaining about lag, freezes, and occasional stuttering.  Some users have said that they are sticking with the iOS 8 update, others are saying that the iOS 9.3.4 and iOS 9.3.5 updates solved some of the lag issues they had with earlier versions of iOS 9. As of right now there is no clear cut answer which means those of you with an iPhone 4s need to be extremely careful with this upgrade. Dig into this feedback and decide if it's worth it to you and your device. For most of you, it will be thanks to the nature of the security patches on board.    1 / 7 23 Responses 04/20/2016 Enajrowe Reply Hurrah..!!!Ｉ ᴊᴜｓᴛ ɢᴏᴛ ᴘᴀɪᴅ 6784ＵＳＤ ᴡᴏʀᴋɪɴɢ ᴏғғ ᴍʏ ʟᴀᴘᴛᴏᴘ ᴛʜɪｓ ᴍᴏɴᴛʜ.

Since first moment the speaker play no sound. I turn back my phone to iOS 9.3.2 and everything is ok. I don’t want to risk my phone for an upgrade (9.3.5) that could be the last one. 09/05/2016 Petya Reply Hi Juan! How can I return my Iphone 4S from 9.3.4 to 9.3.3 ( Which version is better 9.3.3 or 9.3.2) ? Recently installed version 9.3.4 and the phone began to overheat and the battery is depleted… Need a help! Thanks 09/03/2016 johnny Reply Iphone 4s with 9.3.5 is perfect what are you all on? Still an amazing phone and still updating and supported. Get a new phone or accept things on a 5 year old phone takes time. 09/05/2016 Robert Jackson Reply I had my iPhone 4s since the beginning. And yes with 9.3.5 she is still kicking strong and doing well. I cannot say much for others, but if they have any problems with any updates. Just re-set the whole thing (make sure you on iCloud ) like a brand new phone, or to the last day like two days ago. And when all is boosted. You’ll have more storage for some reason , and everything you had since. And I have a 16 gigger (n####r) joke…. Smile….it won’t broke yo face! Jamaican Man. Make sure you have an iPad or MacBook. They all feed off one another like clockwork. Adios Gringgos 09/19/2016 premn Reply Anyone know if there is a further update coming. My 4S has become almost useless. And I’m pretty sure it was after the 9.3.5 update. I’m hoping they might fix it? Thanks. 09/30/2016 prem Reply Update: After one month of sound and other issues, my 4s suddenly started working fine with 9.3.5. Amost as if it needed a month to get used to the update. Thought I should share this here. 09/30/2016 Chris Reply 4s stopped working when I tried to update to 9.3.5. Never was able to upgrade, only shows the “plug into iTunes” and is basically bricked until I figure out how to fix it. 10/13/2016 Abramski Reply Can u put the device in DFU mode? You do it this way, make sure the phone is off AND connected to your mac or pc and leave iTunes open, press and hold down the power button and count 3 seconds, after you count those 3 seconds, you push down the home button but don’t release the power button, hold the power button and home button pressed simultaneously for about 10 seconds, in mean time the screen should turn black as you reach 6 or 7, after 10 second, release the power button but keep holding down the home button until you see a prompt in iTunes that will tell you to restore you’re iPhone. Good luck! 11/01/2016 Mike Morley Reply Since updating to ios 9.3.5 my iPhone 4s shuts down at 35% battery level. I have heard that Apple do not plan to release any further updates to iphone 4s so I either put up with this or upgrade the phone. Of course apple would love me to upgrade the phone. I also upgraded my ipad2 to ios 9.3.5 and found it would then not let me past password sign in, it to a great deal of time to sort this out including complete reset and restore of the machine. I don’t have time to fix apples mistakes so I’m switching to android, at least you are not badgered continuously to upgrade it’s operating system APPLE NEVER AGAIN ! 12/17/2016 Satheesh Reply When i update to 9.3.5 My 4s asking to connect itunes. I dont know why? Anyone can explain? 02/08/2017 NIROSH Reply what’s the Next date of 4s update 03/17/2017 Sue Reply 9.3.5 was the last update for 4S! 03/19/2017 user Reply battery problem and overheating..

The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus may not deliver super screen resolutions, but they hit the right notes for many buyers and with iOS 10 there are even more reasons the iPhone is better than Android for many users. iPhone competition includes the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, One Plus 3, the LG V20 and other phones that deliver a bigger challenge for Apple — but there are still places where the iPhone is clearly better than Android and iOS 10 is better than Android Nougat. Many of these could change with the Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 later this year, but for now – iPhone has an edge. You need to learn what the iPhone does better and how Apple delivers a better experience than Android to see if an iPhone is the best smartphone for you in 2017. Here are 15 reasons the iPhone is better than Android phones in 2017. Use our list of reasons the iPhone is better than Android to figure out which new smartphone you should buy this year. Read our iPhone 7 review to learn what sets this phone apart from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. You can buy the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus at a discount with the best iPhone 7 Black Friday deals. Read: Siri Tips & Tricks Even if you think you know which phone is best, you might be surprised to learn about all the reasons the iPhone is better than Android. iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking Most of the popular apps are on both platforms, but many top games and apps still come to iPhone first. We’re seeing more apps come to both Android and iPhone at the same time, but there are still way more iPhone only apps that we see than Android only. When apps are available on iPhone and Android we still often see a better design on the iPhone version than on Android. This is something that still rings true in 2017. For example, we still see some new Snapchat features and Spotify features come to iPhone before Android. iPhone owners are enjoying Super Mario Run, but the Super Mario Run Android app is still on the way. Read: Best iPhone Apps Apps are an area where the gap is closing, but the differences still exist and are noticeable. We also see Apple take better care of the App Store. Recently they purged 47,300 apps from the app store that were simply bad or abandoned. Fast iPhone Updates for All iPhone owners enjoy quick and regular iOS updates for the iPhone no matter what carrier they use. Faster updates are available for all iPhone owners. Android updates take months to arrive on all the devices. After an Android device is 18 months old, you may need to wait for a new Android smartphone to get the latest software. Apple delivers iPhone updates to devices that are three years old. Apple offers iPhone 4s iOS 9 support. It is unheard of to see support for an Android phone that old. iOS 10 is available for the iPhone 5. When you look at Android devices support ends much faster. Google promises at least two years for Nexus devices, which means Nexus 6 support ends this fall and the Nexus 6P in September 2017. Google may push farther out, but it is not a guarantee. Other Android device manufacturers don’t typically match the longevity of iOS updates. On top of the added update support, Apple does not allow carriers to hold up the updates. As soon as the update is available from Apple it is available on every carrier. If you really want Android Nougat, you may need to simply buy a new Android phone. Works Great with All Your Devices If you own an iPhone, iPad and Mac your information flows smoothly from one device to the other. You can quickly sync photos to all of your devices, answer a phone call on your iPad or Mac and send text messages from your other devices. There is also support for Handoff that allows you to start a task on your iPhone and continue on your iPad or Mac. The iPhone works great with the iPad and Mac. Overall the connectivity between these devices is something Android doesn’t yet match without relying on a collection of third-party applications and services to hodgepodge together a similar feature. Sharing a file from your iPhone to your Mac is also faster and easier thanks to AirDrop. This built-in service sends the file wirelessly directly to the Mac, even when there is no other WiFi around.

You simply can’t go wrong. I own an iPhone 5, iPad Mini 3, MacBook Pro, iMac, and Apple TV. I would not even consider anything else, especially something from that “G…” company which I abhor. I won’t even use their search engine. Same goes for anything from that software manufacturer that, well, just call it “MS). Try calling any other manufacturer for support and see if you can understand what they are saying. I suppose I am bias toward Apple but after nearly 30 years of dealing with computers of all sorts I guess my opinion is warranted. 07/17/2015 gabe Reply why people like iphones? I never understood why anyone would like to give control to another company of what you do with their device. why force u to follow MEDIA SHARING and digital rights media? you cannot torrent on iPhone, nor transfer music and videos without ITunes or a paid online service in iOS. I hate that Samsung s6 tried copying apple iPhone. no microsd slot and integrated battery. CMOn! 04/06/2016 Sai Reply You ever used apple ? 07/05/2016 greentoe Reply http://gtoe.me/l/7A0q-A-04r 02/27/2017 david Reply yea 03/04/2017 Evie Reply It is simply the portability. I have watch ,I go to the gym. I have apple computer and I can receive my phone calls there and iMessages. It crashes less often than microsoft does. I can contact apple support, whenever I want. The other time ,the bluetooth in my iPhone did not work, I contacted tech support midnight and they were available. We could not fix the problem. They called me the next day and told me to go to the nearest store and pick up a brand new phone. One more thing, my iPhone was out of warranty for 165 days. They told me they cared about customer satisfaction. When I called microsoft in order to talk to me they wanted $250. Now, compare 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply You’re literally so idiotic that you can’t spell the full name of a company. Only Apple, cuz you’re an I sheep. You can go very wrong. If people were smart these days, they would understand that iPhones are unequivocally not the right choice for them. You wouldn’t recommend anything else, because it is too limited and unintelligent to use anything else. Stop trying to influence other people to buy garbage phones and devices 05/12/2016 Nancy Reply Why are u being a hypocrite calling someone idiotic for not knowing how to spell the company name right when some of ur sentences don’t even make sense. Apple doesn’t have any competition be used it is the best phone to get. 07/13/2016 Rona Reply First of all, don’t criticize someone for calling someone else idiotic when you can’t even use proper spelling or grammar. Second, Apple is all marketing. There is nothing special about it. Android offers phones that have expandable memory (and guess who doesn’t?) and better high-speed data services. iPhones die extremely quickly, you can’t use iTunes on any other devices, whereas Android platforms are available on all devices, the picture quality on an iPhone is pathetic compared to Androids, and Apple products are majorly behind in technology. The latest update for an iPhone came out two years ago for an Android. Apple has a set array of things it can do, and you can’t customize or change that. But if you want a high-end technology phone, choose an Android. It does so much more and you can customize and change its features. I have had both an iPhone and an Android phone. 09/14/2016 Abhishek well,mam i am an android user and i would like to say that iphones are the best because when you buy an android first it will give you good performance but after one month it will start hanging and work slow and that is same with every android devices.and their are so many android malware which also affect performance. Iphones are the best, secure and stable. 09/15/2016 Me Stay butthurt, loser ; ) 12/04/2016 jgames “nothing special about it” fastest phone ever 3d touch very good camera looks very nice “nothing special about it” why do we need expandable memory on iOS? gime a few reasons for that. “better high-speed data” give me your source for all this information. iphones die extremely quickly? how? do you even have an iphone? iphones have much better standby and screen on time with heavy usage than android. you cant use itunes on other devices, yes, but ios wants to keep it ios exclusive because their services are one of the major selling points for them. android platforms are available everywhere, but google software is usually preferred to ios software. pathetic picture quality? wut? iphone pictures wont lose quality when you zoom in and support much more colors than any old android camera. android cameras are very nice as well, though. “apple are behind in technology” a lot of people say this but it’s actually quite the opposite. 3d touch was very innovative, its like a ‘right click’ for your phone. the latest iphone update did not come out 2 years ago. you seem like you have no idea what you’re talking about and just spouting nonsense. apple can do a lot of things without customization, but what customization do we really need? people always saying android is more customizable but never give examples, and when they do its “homescreen.” moving home screen icons around is a pretty useless feature tbh android isnt more high end tech than iphone and i dont see how much more it does. you havent even explained how it can in your comment. so please use common sense before spouting nonsense 02/27/2017 Gage iPhones are by far the better phone. I’ve had android phones for most of my life but i bought an iPhone 6 about a year ago and now I have the 7 and I can’t imagine going back. Android is slow, every button you push there’s a lag before it actually opens the app or whatever you pushed. Also, every android I’ve ever had has had terrible battery life, it never lasts the full day but my iPhone almost always does. And my last point, android automatically installs like 10-20 on your phone that you cannot delete no matter how hard you try. Apple has 3-5. Yes, android has a port for SD cards, but what good is that if a large amount of your memory is made up of apps you don’t want. You’re entitled to your opinion but I advise that you get yourself an iPhone 7 and keep an open mind. I’m fairly certain you realize how much better it is 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Not very nice. Also, Apple is just as good as Android, theres aspects that one company has over the other, and vice versa, so the best thing to do is just to test out both and find your favorite and use it because Android and Apple’s problems and advantages weigh out each other so it really just matters which one you like the most so just use the one u like and stop arguing. 08/19/2016 Zane Reis Reply I prefer Android because of the coustomization it has to offer. I prefer to be able to change change almost every aspect about my phone and making it the way “I” like it, not the way Apple likes it. I like the coustomization while others find it chaotic, confusing, and would rather it be (in their eyes) simpler. 05/26/2016 Billy Reply Says the one who has Zombie Knight as their username. 07/18/2016 Nate Pauley Reply That’s an interesting rather stupid mindset to have and it makes me reflect on the time I had those same views. It took me 6 years as an android user to eventually realise how inferior it is to iOS. Android is plagued with fragmentation, so much that not even customisation can save it. There should be a term that describes blindsided android followers, if there is one then I’d like to know it. iOS is solid, stable, secure and much more better looking than android – Apple pays exquisite attention to the finer details and they will continuously improve on the irritating nooks and crannies so many people mention in the comments. The best part is APPLE USERS CAN ACTUALLY BE A PART of the firmware updates and have assurance in a better OS experience overtime. I’ve had my S6 for a year and I’ve only managed to have one firmware update that took 7 months to deliver. I can only give credit to android for the premium android devices such as my S6, until then the physicality of a device alone cannot make me shift in the near future. I want a solid experience, not a hollow one. 08/02/2016 Adarsh Reply Hi, Your comparison of iphone with S7 is not right because in case of iphone both hardware and software are developed by Apple and in case of S7 developer of hardware is Samsung and developer of software is Google. I use Nexus 5 phone, hardware and software both developed by Google and manufactured by LG and ipad Air2 by Apple. Both devices update periodically whenever updates are released and I am happy with both. 09/15/2016 Me Reply LOL stay laughably buthurt/beyond tasteless loser Fandroid X ) 03/02/2017 xxLoser123xx Reply Wow you know how to use a Thesaurus. 03/06/2017 Sally Fallis Reply Wow! I AM impressed! You know about the Thesaurus!! I didn’t think anyone under 50 ever heard of it anymore! 12/17/2015 Noah Reply This comment, as well as this article are laughable at best. Coming from a person who owns all major Apple products but frequently bounces back and forth in the smartphone department, I don’t see how any of these actually make the iPhone “better” than android. I would say the only point that is valid is the support Apple has from app developers. It’s pretty easy to see that apps on the iPhone can be “prettier” than apps on android with the extra animations, and quick gestures. However even that is relative, since iOS gives you security and “pretty animations” but gives of freedom and functionality in the process. I still can’t tell you which phone is better, as that all is personal preference and I really don’t care which phone is “better”. I just want a phone that does what I want it to do without too many hiccups (which is why I’ll never buy another Samsung device). For now, I’d say in terms of productivity, the iPhone is great if you are a person who needs iMessage, FaceTime, and the Apple ecosystem to feel comfortable doing work. While I believe most android phones will get work DONE. With the amount of third party apps available to you on the play store, multi window, Google now on tap, and other gestures. I have always felt an android is phone is more a workhorse while the iPhone is king of simplicity. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Congrats, you just wasted about 5-15 minutes of your time typing out this article because its not going to convince anyone.

So, he’s not being biased. http://www.gottabemobile.com/2016/05/26/android-vs-iphone-2016-android-better/ 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Just because he has another article doesn’t mean this one’s biased 01/30/2017 Selenia Thank you for that. This article and many commenters made me want to vomit thinking he was so biased and the sheep just followed along. I can give numerous reasons Android is a better OS, but that is not the point. However, some Android devices suck. Most of the detractors comments are true of stock Samsung devices. Samsung may be the most popular, but far from the best. They make pretty good hardware, but the software begs for rooting and custom ROMS. I am typing from a Nexus 6P, which is pure Android. Google does good with monthly updates, too. But I am using Pure Nexus, the best reason for owning a Nexus/Pixel device, with ElementalX kernel for out of this world stability, smoothness, flexibility, and battery life. Unless I use hotspot(tunneled over VPN), I only have to charge every 2 days under pretty heavy use. PN is actually updated more than Google’s stock and usually delivers security updates within a day of release, which is faster than Google often rolls it out to most users. 01/06/2016 Leo Keys Reply Why would someone else go with a product by Google, NVidia (I will come back to them), or Microsoft; over that “A…” Company (Repeat)? The reason people would use nVidia over the AMD (god I hate AMD’s Products) GPU’s found in Mac products? They want a more powerful GPU. Apple says that their “PC’s” are better and use top-notch products. Why don’t they use the GeForce GTX 980m in the MacBook Pro? Why don’t they use Quadro cards over FirePro cards? Because Apple doesn’t know anything about Graphics. As for iMac’s I have no clue why some use an i5. Apple products thermal throttle a lot. Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs. It is also much more free to do what ever you want. But, because your an iSheep, you can’t process facts that favor the other side of the grass. Guess your life must be happy, getting råpēd by Apple, every year and paying thousands on eye candy. Why use Google or Bing over Yahoo? Yahoo sucks, that’s why. Face the fact that Yahoo and other search engines are inferior to Google. Apple products are trash and are eye candy for white girls (Starbucks and that stuff). 01/06/2016 Pedro Coimbra Reply Now you have to bring the Nvidia/ATI war? What, the iphone/android isn’t enough for you? Dude AMD cards are equally powerful, no matter how much you “hate them”. Why Apple chose AMD? Maybe prices, power consumption, price/performance ratio, easier to adapt to their hardware, who knows? But a company such as Apple (you can write the complete name, it won’t bite you) so adept at optimization doesn’t make these decisions lightly, they HAVE a reason, one that you *don’t know*, but that’s irrelevant. About the i5, a reason for the apparent lower specs must be because of how streamlined and optimized the OS is, instead of being made to work with zillions of combinations of brands, boards, peripherals. So what you want in hardware to cope with the software, was made achieved with the fat-free software. «Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs», well I guess any system is secure with the right Antivirus programs, isn’t it? but never 100%. How about a system that doesn’t need antivirus, just a little inteligence from it’s user? Android safe… yes, keep dreaming, it’s not as the net isn’t filled with cases of security holes and breaches of android. If you reply to my I advise you right now to not bringing ATI/Nvidia stupid nerdish arguments or sheep mentality, about mobile platforms and geekinesses like that, because I simply don’t have the patience.

Also other things like sharing things and integration compared to Apple products only. Almost every line in this article is not right. 12/12/2016 Cjros Reply LOL, thank you for making me 100℅ sure that Android is way better than newest IOS. Your arguments are so poor and naive :). The only thing youve got right is the SD expansion, but it is not any issue at all :). Thank you, my hero :) 12/15/2016 Debapriyo Reply You are so dangerously biased towards Apple that some of your words make so sense and are outright stupid. I have no problems with you choosing an apple product but lol. You don’t use Google search engine? Then you are missing out. Their search engine is still the best and most reliable and miles ahead of other search engine options. Google Maps way better than Apple Maps. Every tiny feature Apple introduces in the new version of IOS, Google had it in android 2 years back. I myself love some Apple products and appreciate the high standards of quality they incorporate in their products but please don’t even compare Apple with Google. Apple just makes iphones, macbook and some fancy toys. Google makes much much more and is the spearhead of IT innovation today. Be a fanboy but don’t be an idiot. 03/22/2017 ComputerGeek Reply you’re weird 06/23/2015 Chris H Reply Some of these reasons for being better than Android phones are oxymoronic. An extended warranty and readily available Apple Stores suggest that the iPhone is prone to bugs and damage. I will stick with my G3 because I know if I drop it it won’t shatter and I won’t have to give more money to Apple either for a case and/or a screen fix. There is a reason there aren’t Android stores out there. Because their phones don’t nearly have as many issues in my opinion. Consider Chevrolet and Honda. The Honda will last and is just as nice if not nicer than the Chevy, which will not last nearly as long and will force loyal customers to buy yet another Chevy. 07/27/2016 eiendiaies your_ufo Reply I would love to hear your comment now about your G3. Android stores are not because android companies dont give a f.ck about costumers, they just improve SPECS SPECS AND SPECS but where is NO improving quality. Why for example iphone 12 megapixel camera can beat sony xperia 23 megapixel camera, why iphone 1500 mah battery last longer than lg 3000mah, why fingerprint on iphone works much better than samsungs? And whats a practical difference between 640p vs 2k smartphone screen? Damn the real sheeps dont understand what apple cares about costumers and they stay at same screen resolutions because they just dont need to improve screens, android companies just keep adding numbers on specs. But where is quality improvment? You say iphone works better because of lower resolution screens, but than why androids keep improving resolutions but forget about older android users? I am ex samsung and LG user, rubbish costumer services, if android die than i must wait couple weeks for replacment, if somethin happen with iphone i know where is apple store and dealing with them in same day. Price stays high for iphone for a real reason. Iphone is not about SPECS, its about quality in every aspect. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply The issue with iPhones that I hated was that the only way you could fix any glitch that would inevitably crop up is by factory resetting the phone each and every time. It’s such an annoying and time consuming process having to set everything back up again. When I made the switch to Android I was really impressed by how stable and self contained it was. Whenever there was a glitch it was limited to that particular app and you could simply reinstall it and it’d be fixed. I’ve never encountered any systemwide issues such as the iPhone misc storage bug that would happen to me all the time with the 6s. Apple does a great job hiding all of its glitches by simply not providing any prompts. Apps just disappear when they crash. It’s terrible. I know a lot of people with the misc storage bug to this day and don’t know it. They just think they’re out of space all the time because they need a new phone.. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply I lol’d at how much superior the author thought the lightning cable was because it was reversible. You have a fifty fifty chance at it if you do it blindly but most cables have a dimple on top to make sure you get it even time.

Some of these were acceptable reasons, but most were not. My wife is using an iPhone 6, and I have the Galaxy S6 edge. We both agree that my phone is far superior in terms of speed and screen resolution, but her camera, even being spec-deficient to my Android, seems as good as, or even better somehow. I like your point on the updates all rolling out at once, but almost every other “point” you made about iPhone being better boils down to one thing: lots of your friends have iPhones. That’s it. That’s the selling point, and the basis of this article. “iPhone apps look better.” – That’s completely relative. Lots of apps do look better, but they generally are paid apps that are free in the Play Store. “Works for all your devices” – So what? I thought this was a phone article. Android works with all your crap too. “No Carrier bundled apps” – I dont know how that’s a selling point, but okay, you win. Bloatware is an issue on android. “Sharing to other iPhones”/”Better resell” – Your friends all have them, so you should too. Then you can sell them to other friends who have older ones and make more money. Ridiculous. Yeah, you get a few more bucks for them, so that means you should have an inferior phone? Who buys a phone because of resale value? Preposterous. “Lightning cable is miles better” – My S6 charges from nothing to 40% in 10 minutes. iPhone can’t do that. I understand that the cable may be good, but “miles better” is a stretch. “Apple Stores” – So? I don’t even understand how this is a point in your article. Go to best buy, it’s the same crap. “Touch ID”/”Headphone controls” – Those both work flawlessly on a good number of high end android devices as well. “iMessage, Facetime, blah blah” / “Share apps easily” – All your friends have these, so you should too, or they’ll laugh at you. “Siri works better than Google Now” – Google Now isn’t Siri. That shouldn’t be a comparison. It’s not trying to be Siri. It’s a voice search, and that’s it. Siri works, but it doesnt work “better” than anything else, because there’s nothing to compare it to. If you like having Siri, good. “Notifications are better” – No, they’re not. Android’s notifications work exactly the same. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying iPhone isn’t better, I’m just saying you haven’t proven that it is here in the slightest. Both OS’s are very well made, and the playing field is far more level than any avid IOS or Android user wants to admit. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply Excellent comment. I totally agree with you. 08/07/2015 Sam Reply DONT throw away your s6 edge… get an iphone but if you can use them interchangeably 07/15/2016 quenchybro Reply lol hi sam 10/09/2015 Palbo Reply I disagree. Bloatware is not really a problem on Android; any respectable company will only install commonly used and necessary apps like the Play Store and Gmail. If you are buying a phone that will leave your wallet intact (and still deliver better specs in every single measurable way than an iPhone 6, such as the lenovo k3 note) from a less known company which may allow bloatware, you can easily root the phone and uninstall it. I do agree with your other points, though! 05/27/2016 ZENCKPRI Reply Phinfankid you are completely right. I agree with everything you said. You are probably the only logical person who has commented so far. Also the iPhones storage is just a scam to keep people paying and buying more storage. Unfortunately the Samsung Galaxy s6 also removed the microsd slot, but luckily Samsung got it sh*t together with the Samsung s7, which in my opinion is the best phone. 07/12/2016 10beasts Reply You really explained the situation very well! Loved it. 07/09/2015 D Reply This article compares Apples to apples. Your references to Android are focused towards Samsung (you know the company that makes the screen, processor, RAM, and ROM in most Apple devices). Compared to a more vanilla Android experience, Apple blows. My $200 Zenfone 2 is better than any fruity phone at a third of the cost. With Apple, you pay more for less, but get a pointless logo. 07/10/2015 Scott Reply What about Apples different charger cords? Droids micro USB cords work with any other Android device. In fact, pretty much all phones but apple use it. They want you to need to buy new chargers more often. Apples are streamlined fads also, just like every product they’ve ever released. Yeah, cause being “cool” means getting the same more expensive products all the other rich kids got. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply I had both and I don’t agree with this article. I prefer Android phones over Iphones. I think Apple have better computers, but not better cell phones. 03/06/2016 Firas Bajjar Reply Keep dreaming…. 03/06/2016 Firas Reply Keep dreaming….Apple has better computers you serious? You can do a lot of stuff on Windows pcs while Mac struggles to do one stuff….At least it’s stable and easy to use through…But seriously it’s overpriced shit…You can get almost awesome gaming laptops for the price of a MacBook Air. In fact, iPhone is better than android….Because the mobile era is another thing, it’s called mobile for a reason. It should be easy to use and quick. That’s why Apple wins at this point…Come on get real men you wanna play GTA V on your mobile? No for sure. Apps are even better (which surprises me why it isn’t the same for a Mac vs Windows) iPhone’s are faster than most android phones….But if you compare it to stock original android phones, the iPhone still beats them but not as much as other android phones. Because unfourtantely Google didn’t know how to configure Linux properly but i bet you if it does…The iOS faster than android is a history….Linux is ultra-powerful and that’s why most of the world super computers use it…Because you can tweak it the way you like and you will get an extremely faster performance than Windows and Mac. But Google couldn’t handle it I guess….Even the Java language is much faster in terms of processing but I’m still surpsised why iOS apps are still faster….It’s just another replica of Nokia’s fault with Symbian (Nokia never built a stable Eco system for it until it’s near to death period, which led the CEO to get rid of Symbian because it takes years to built an eco system) 05/19/2016 PABLO Reply Right off the bat i can tell you are a little kid who just bought a samsung and is butt hurt you made the wrong choice, “struggles to do one stuff” he also pays great attention in class shown by how grammatically correct this is (as i was writing this I found this… “The iOS faster than android is a history” WHO TEACHES THIS KID I NEED TO COMPLAIN)! 08/04/2015 Robin Reply Poorly written article bringing in irrelevant points and downright false information. Take your “works great with all your devices” section for an example. I use an android phone and an apple computer, and the two devices are 100% compatible with no need for a “third-party application” or service. Completely untrue information in this section. Also I have texts and all the regular online messaging apps I use from both devices well synced. All data, photos, contacts, music, etc from my phone are stored in a cloud service and attainable through my mac computer and my (android) phone. Also your first section “iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking” contradicts itself. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply My iPhones have NEVER worked great with my PC laptop. NEVER. And the people in the store aren’t much help either. I’ve wasted hours in there. So I don’t know who the person who wrote this article talked to, but my experience has been awful with compatibility between iPhone and PC. In fact, it’s the main reason I’ll never buy another iPhone. 08/10/2015 Malin Saming Reply Really? Here are 10 reasons you have apples for brains: Android is free, Google drive storage is FREE. 15 gig of files, unlimited photos! Androids voice recognition is WAY better, try a comparison, Siri is like a nagging wife who can’t get it right. Android phones have wireless charging! Android phones built in payment that works everywhere. Not at 3% of stores like Apple payment. Android phone MULTITASK, thats right you can run a dozen apps at the same time while talking. Android phones have sizable widgets, so you have live streaming info on your home screen. Android phones are available in endless formats, not like the communist way “everyone has the same”. Android phones PLAY ALL FILES, iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple. Android phones have rapid charging, 10 min = 4 hours of use. Android phones are available with 2 days of battery. I could go on and on but your Apple brain will not listen anyways. You probably have a really nice typewriter that you show off the lack of it needing toner or electricity. There is a reason Android is about 82% of the market and Apple has fallen from 33 to about 12%… In fact the remaining iphone users I know all run Google everything on their iphone anyways, why not get the best hardware too. I look at everything I can and see things for how they are, then I buy the best I can find, if you do the same you will love your new Galaxy S6 8^ ) 12/13/2015 Pedro Coimbra Reply I tried, but stop reading after the «iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple.» Just this BS of a sentence already has 2 lies in it.

And childish comparison . 09/16/2015 Srikanth Reply I can say something here because I own and use both iPhone 6 Plus and a Samusng Galaxy S6 edge equally everyday. So I think I am in a position to give a fair judgement …or at least decide what works better for me. I have changed over from iPhone as my default device to S6 edge and back to iPhone few times. But I find myself using iPhone 6 Plus more often than S6 Edge…because of these reasons 1. Smartphone is smart because of quality apps. I always found iOS apps looking neater, working smoother and more consistent compared to Android Apps. Just to quote an example…Adobe acrobat reader which i made default app to open PDF files….is not able to open files since last two days all of a sudden and reporting error. Everything is updated but still doesn’t work somehow. But works fine with iOS. 2. Screen of iPhone is marginally inferior to my S6 edge which is stunning. But I don’t hold them near my nose and try noticing pixels. From a practical point of view iPhone screen is absolutely fine. 3. In spite of inferior hardware specs on paper, I can’t deny iPhone user interface is more fluid and smooth. Thats what makes the experience more pleasant for me. 4. iPhone 6s is already launched…I am not upgrading. But know what? Last night iOS9 update was available to my phone. I have already updated to same. Isn’t that amazing? I can’t help comparing my Galaxy note 4, my near stock android Motorola droid turbo.. etc..which haven’t received even 5.1.1 Lollipop when Android Marshmallow is about to be launched in a month. Sad. This alone is enough for me to stick to iPhone as my default device. 5. I havent noticed parallels for some Apps in Android (Drafts, Soulver etc). Which I learnt to use often and liked. I am a fan of some automation apps like Tasker on android which doesnt have an iOS equivalent. But as of now my use of same is less. 6. I guess iOS is bit more secure compared to android against virus attacks and hacking. it IS something important to me in this era of mobile banking and when we keep so much data on Google drive and One Note etc. and hey…Google has made most of its apps available to iOS. I agree my S6 edge is superior in Camera department and pictures look very good. Also usage of widgets is better in android. But after using both OS since last 3-4 years, I am sticking with iPhone as my default and S6 edge for miscellany and photos. This is what works for me. I know others have other reasons to stick to any one OS. I have best of both worlds now but can’t help saying one is better than other at present. 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Updates are an invalid point, because the newest version of iOS isn’t as good as a 2 three year old version of Android 12/02/2015 Srikantha Krishna Reply I don’t agree with you there. Updates are important. They optimise the software, remove bugs and important to plug security issues. Of course Google releases them but only nexus customers get it. Other manufacturers don’t release it in time. Tell me now how many handsets are going to get Marshmallow and when???? 04/25/2016 Sally Fallis Reply So which is less complicated for the over-50 me who is good with words but not pictures? I had to ask a young person what all those little dots and waves, etc., meant on my Ipod Touch. I really miss words, but I realize I am alone in that. Is a Samsung any easier to navigate for (duhhh…) me? 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply If you are over 50 you should definitely stick with Apple 1. it is extremely easy to use 2. you can do many tasks without even doing anything, but simply telling your phone to wake you up at 5am, or to remind you to take your pills when you get home 3. you can change the text size and icon size to accommodate your eye-sight 4. you can ask any teenager to help you organize the icons into more intuitive way Microsoft Windows phones are rich on words, but while it would satisfy your need for everything being written – the phone will be difficult to use, and will still contain many icons. So, go with Apple, even an older 16GB model, will still be fully supported, and will work perfectly well, do not get 64GB version, you wont need all that memory. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply but apple is expensive 08/25/2016 ermm Reply with android it is much easier to use… you can tell your phone to set and alarm….you can change the text size 01/10/2017 Frank McConnell Android is an absurd ecosystem, the UI is very hard to even remember, iOS is better due to the simplicity of the UI. OP was right about iPhones being easy, I use one because android is hard to use. Maybe you should get an iPhone, it’s 5x faster than every android phone in the world and you’ll get a good one on eBay for like $200! Why do you think Google is better on iOS than on android. lel, Android is a joke OS and should be defunct! 10/15/2015 Andras Reply I´ve been an iPhone user for 2 years, recently I bought an Android phone to verify if really Android is superior… After 2 months of testing it, I sell the Android and bought an iPhone 6… This do not prove that iPhone is better, but for my needs, iPhone is totally superior… Android is good, everything is cheap but is not an stable OS… Yes you can have all personalize, but for what? I´m not a teenager anymore so whats the point to have all personalized and change it every week? By the way the output of the sound of the iPhone is really more superior than the output of any Android phone With an iPhone (in music business) is way better you can control lights, console really simple with iPhone and all tech for music is much more easy to sync and to handled on an iPhone… Music business in a MAC is much much easier I love iPhone and I would not change it anymore Like I said I´m not saying iPhone is better for everyone but for my needs yes it is 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Wow! You’re actually dumber than every other I sheep here. IPhone has good sound? Better than any Android? Hahahahahahaha! Have you even seen an HTC One phone? Best speakers and any phone! Ever.

Dude, i use both systems and i can point out one thing better that most people usually ignore, my Father is blind, he uses an iPhone because tbh the Voice-over mode for iPhone is the best ive seen and used so far. Nothing much..im still happier with an Android. 10/25/2015 floyd Reply There’s no Denying android ports are a p.i.t.a. 11/04/2015 The Truth Reply Lol i laughed my ass off as soon as they said “quick updates” and it showed a 904mb update. Its like we intentionally left out carrier costs, the limited gb storage that iphones have And dont even get me started on “no company bundled apps”. Do you know how much tracking, data mining even occurs with an iphone? Fingerprint bypass? Are u srs? The iphone is for the general public who doesnt know any better just following ignorantly what is popular culture. Android = Professional industry Iphone= uneducated general public facade 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply yeah, tell that to all my banker friends who make millions and choose Apple to be the secure choice for the data exchange and storage, go “personalize” your phone, show them all how individual you are, myspace was definitely better than stupid facebook where you cannot “personalize,” so ignorant right? 11/14/2015 GET REAL Reply A PHONE IS A PHONE 12/09/2015 I phones all the way Reply Umm androids suck, I phones are more high tech and aren’t as slow 12/15/2015 jj Reply Android…LOL, joke. 12/26/2015 juststephen250 Reply Are you Sirious?

All the successful people I know use an iPhone. The only credible alternative in business to an iPhone would be a BlackBerry running BB10. Android devices are for the unemployed and vagrants. Thankfully I don’t know anyone with an Android phone. I don’t want to either! Please only contact me if you use an iPhone and have a job / home. I don’t want be associated with anyone that uses an Android. It would make me look bad. Thanks. 03/03/2016 Jack Reply The fact that u say “Android devices are for the unemployed and vagrants”, just ticks me off. You are what I like to call a dumb ass like every kid I know. You only choose an Iphone because every one else has an Iphone, if not you would of picked android and said Iphones suck, you also don’t even know how technology works bitch, so I would not be talking because there are far more android devices with better specs, and fyi i’m a kid obviously i’m not employed. 04/22/2016 Derp Reply Well then maybe you didnt know what a high end android phone is.. Poor you. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply This post is what makes you look bad. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Also, aside from your arrogance making you look bad, you have got to be kidding about BlackBerry. I carried the Z10 now carry the Passport with BB10. I only have it because my company prefers BB’s security. But as far as fuctionality, it’s like working with bear skins and stone knives compared to iPhone or Android. The lack of apps and limited integration with other devices is stifling. That’s why I carry a separate personal phone. It’s also why BB is abandoning BB10 and switching to an Android platform. So are you going to cast off your somewhat acceptable friends who carry BlackBerry when their platform becomes Android? They better run out and get an iPhone when that happens so they can still be honored to be deemed worthy of your friendship. 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply 1. Android they switch to is FULLY custom and has all google services BLOCKED 2. This is the reason why companies are abandoning BlackBerry due to high maintenance costs and instead make private applications for iPhones which you can only download using a special code, a secure application within a secure platform, cheaper to maintain, more convenient for an employee to use. I completely agree with Bob, Androids are for 12 year olds and vagrants, the paper specs of Androids (factually and historically) are not an indicator of how they perform. And the fact that you think that you are smarter than a mass of hard working high ranking professionals, and that you need to show them all how “individual” you are by always “personalizing” your phone – just shows you are a fool and have nothing to do but to play with yourself on your phone like a kid, I bet you are one of those people who thinks wearing a watch is stupid and unmanly because you have a clock on your phone. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply ur insulting me cos im twelve so dont try piggy 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply You guys keep proving how Apple markets to ignorant people with a credit card. Reason many companies don’t use Android is because of the differences in OS customization from device to device and manufacturer to manufacturer. That can be a nightmare for testing in house apps. Nothing to do with security. My company uses Android tablets, but all the same kind. Only point you are right about is specs don’t reflect performance. Nexus/Pixel devices have good specs, not the best, but just try finding a faster Android or iPhone, for that matter. Why? Stock Android that hasn’t been bastardized. 01/17/2016 Grace Reply I use an iPhone, but custom built my own PC. I don’t like Android phones (had a Samsung galaxy for a year before switching back) but I also don’t like Apple computers. Honestly? What people buy is a matter of taste.

LOSER! 03/23/2016 sheel r shah Reply This article is so immature and stupid. Seriously, apps look better? You couldn’t even come up with a better reason?? I can literally break this article point by point. I would just like to say one thing though as a rebuttal, A NEXUS too receives the ota updates. An iPhone 64gb on contract costs almost the same as a carrier free nexus. I am a galaxy s7 user and the screen quality is maybe 2 generations over the iphone. As for the notifications, I prefer android’s iteration way more than apples. And about the cables, except the s7, all flagships use USB type c Samsung compensates with wireless charging. The battery life on a nexus or an s7 edge is way superior than the iPhone. And hangout video quality is as good as facetious. Also I like the fact that you don’t need to get out of hangouts to make a video call. In iphone you can usee iMessage but then to make a video call you need to get out and go to facetime. I get to play with manual controls on my camera which iphone doesn’t permit. I can literally go all day long about this. Just one actual good point about iphone you could have mentioned instead of the trash is that it has a stronger graphic processor that but by a small margin. 03/23/2016 sheel r shah Reply One more thing. You mentioned sharing. Do you feel ashamed that you cannot share media via Bluetooth?? The most basic mode of sharing? Talking about airdrop please use wifi direct once. Or nfc sharing. 03/28/2016 Stanata Reply Basically what this article is saying is: “use iPhone instead of Android – it’s more easy to use if you’re an idiot!”… lol There isn’t even one reason of those in the article that is 100% true… and almost all of them are complete crap! I mean come on – even monkey can plug MicroUSB and it is “a must” standard in Europa for instance anyway. Let alone that the future is in the wireless charging… And who today is NOT using Viber or WhatsApp? Who needs another messenger? I can continue, but don’t see point in that – the articles like this is obviously paid one. But sooner or later it will be clear at the end – the open environment will always be above the close one, because it is more close to the people! Cheers! 03/29/2016 Dark Penguin Reply I’m not sure I get why the headphones are supposed to be a distinctive selling point. My GS5 came with headphones that offer the same control options.

Then the account with and once you are inside the prisoners you are under arrest until proven innocent. Luckily the Sony Z1 appeared and decided to get one.

It’s a Huawei, nice BIG screen I guess they call a Phablet. My younger son has an iPhone 6 plus. I decided to try an iPhone 5s just to see what it’s like. I have 30 days to check it out. So far, the ONLY thing see is the slow motion camera that’s cool and maybe some cuter emogies …I think they’re called. Otherwise….. I’m so far not impressed. My Huawei Android is 16g the iPhone 5s is 16g. The Huawei was I think $200 and the 5s $160 with its VERY tiny screen. My son has a 6 plus and 64g and that would cost me $650 or maybe it’s $650 for the6 plus 16g. Anyway…. Lots MORE MONEY. I guess if you have a lot of music… It’s better but I just have Lots of pictures. I like my sd card for these. I don’t know all the techy stuff and I don’t do Twitter or FaceTime or sharing pics except Facebook and text. I thought maybe some apps would be cooler but so far… I’m not impressed with the iPhone at all. Just my opinion. 04/12/2016 D Dawg Reply smoke weed everyday 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply wtf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 04/19/2016 J Corn Reply I knew this article was a joke when his very first reason is “Snapchat looks prettier on iPhone”. And you’re listing reasons why apple is different, not better. 04/21/2016 Anujay Singh Reply Apple optimises the iPhone’s hardware and software. The iOS Is custom built for and iPhone but the android softwares are not built for any particular device or hardware so optimisation is nog as good as in an Apple device. It not about specs the camera which shas more megapixels cannot alone deliver better pictures , a processor with more cores and greater clock speed can not alone give better performence until it utilises the most of it. So as Apple builds it products to its own requirements and deliver better products than android phones. An iPhone has better quality of internals as well as the body and feels premium than its competitors so that’s why an iPhone is an iPhone. 04/26/2016 De'Zsa Smith Reply Currently on my iPhone 6s+, sobbing as I type this. I’ve just got through longingly browsing Google’s Playstore, seeing all the recent updates of my favorite apps and hidden gems that the Apple Store just cannot compete with. Android has some seriously dedicated developers, and I’ve always admired them and even began looking into Android app development. That is… Until I switched over to iPhone several months ago after being a dedicated Android user. I will always be Team Android, hands down. I had a rooted Nexus 5, which means I’m all about customizability, design, testing, flexibility, and freedom. Then I decided I wanted to try something new—FaceTime, great camera, updated social apps like snapchat…you know, the basics. Biggest. Mistake. Ever. Switching over to Apple feels like I’m using a flip phone. Now I’m trying to decide if I should just switch back, or keep this iPhone as a means of communication (don’t know if I’m willing to give up FaceTime with family and friends) and have an Android for all the things I miss. 04/27/2016 weez Reply I just giggle at these articles. Ok Iphone kids, my phone has a webhost, tftp server, a windows deploy share with every iteration of windows going back to w2000, an SMB client, FTP client and host, Tftp server, wi-fi signal scanner, packet sniffer(nmap), a high frequency oscilloscope, a bluetooth HID remote that controls anything bluetooth, a linux/android debugger, point of sale and inventory tracking software(apple has it too but not complete on the phone), and at will I can change my MAC and spoof other phone’s IDs. My phone is a half decade old S2. So I guess if you plan on propping up a desk buy an Iphone, for everyone else that has work to do either grab a toolkit full of different things or just grab your android phone. 04/28/2016 Ken McDowell (@morpheusxp) Reply I don’t understand why it is all Android users say that iPhone users are sheep and that they use an iPhone because everyone else uses an iPhone. The iPhone has less than 20% market share world wide. That means less than 1 in 5 smartphone users have an iPhone. It seems to me going with the herd is more of an Android thing than an iOS thing. Just saying… 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply I think it is more because a lot of iPhone users seem cultic. I honestly think iPhone is a high quality product. But I really like high end Androids as well. However, I know people who use only Apple products and make little comments here and there about how inferior ALL Androids are. In that way I think they are like sheep because they have bought into this notion that their are no good Androids and they are operating on a higher plan than non-iPhone users. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Agreed. Probably because in the beginning people lined up outside of stores to get the latest and greatest iphone. It’s great hardware, but I can’t get used to a single button. Plus iphones seem to have a higher resale value. I don’t know. I do like how apple updates their devices in a timely manner and no bloatware, etc. I think Android is getting there, but unless it’s a nexus, updates are all over the place. I want the screen of a Samsung, build of an HTC with the battery life of my droid turbo, a headphone jack at the bottom of the phone instead of the top and I would be in heaven. Plus everyone I know say is that a Galaxy? So people in my area associate anything android as a Galaxy. Great marketing by Sammy, but perception becomes reality sometimes. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Meant to say plane, not plan. ☺ 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Yup, it is about the Apple cult and the attitude that you are unwashed and not worthy if you use an Android. The attitude you must be broke, homeless, etc. My Android costs as much as a lower range current iPhone and can do way more. Here in the US, they have much greater market share, unfortunately. 04/28/2016 Joe Reply iphone has nothing on android. They have a good camera but that is about it. isheep all butthurt because android is taking over the world. 04/30/2016 qwertypop13 Reply So far all my favourite android apps were not available on ios, plus a lot of apps are a minimum of 10 cent cheaper on gpl than on apple app store. I also find it totally ridiculous that iphones need to be jailbroken to undergo any form of customization. Plus who wants fast updates at the expense of severe bugs, them slowing down stuff even more and getting a crappy operating system that hasnt changed since 5 years. Iphones are for people that only use their phones to txt and make calls. ps. I have a $20 alcatel phone and wouldnt ever trade it for an iphone. Buy what you like, but the points on this website are the worst I have ever seen. As far as I know you cant even use iphones to transfer files other than audio and photos to and from macs/pc’s. Apple phones are overpriced by like $500 dollars just because they have a flashy logo which they stole from the beatles. 05/05/2016 anthony Reply I love my android devices. Have I had problems. Yes. More than my wife’s iphone? Definitely. But I tinker with it a lot more than her iphone. I transfer files back and forth from a computer a lot easier with my device. Yes using third party apps but it’s still easier. I have all my music in google play, but use itunes (whole family uses ipods) so I just sync up that to google music and playlists as well. Each device has it’s pros and cons. I have used a rooted tablet to get pure android (didn’t like it) and have an ipad 2 which I love. It’s about choice and I like that we have it. Two points I agree with the author about: Timely updates and bloatware. HTC is bucking the trend to stay afloat by addressing this. Wireless charging is not worth it yet. I much prefer quick charging and new devices starting to roll out with usb-c. 05/07/2016 C Reply The article and ensuing comments are a joke. This is what The internet has come to now days. Let me be clear, I have years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux. I have every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you. Now that we have established my far superior ability to actually comment here goes. First of all, the people on this blog and on others like it simply cannot help the fact that more people love iphone than android, period. So they make nasty little comments because they are frustrated that in reality they couldnt influence people in high school and they aren’t able to now. Second the android users who get angry at Apple users simply appear to only be mad because they don’t have an iphone them selves. Guys! Really! Let me be clear I have Windows and android and iOS. Iphone for the nomal every day user is PERFECT! Let them be! The android is perfect for more shady people who want to be power users an anarchists or some how feel like they are breaking the law or the rules. That is how android feels and that’s the base line of the os. I currently have an android because I can be one of those more shady people who like to go against the grain. But I don’t like android. Who the he’ll wants to root a phone? Who wants to spend hours on doing something? Not I! It takes me 10 minutes to jail break an Apple as and BAM I’m a super users with a linux based system and am sitting with a very powerful device! They all being said I have an android bc of expandable memory, an IR blaster, and a few other small features. When Apple steps up the game with these I will switch to Apple. Here is one reason why. What is a smart device? It is an item created to make your life as a human eaiser. Apple does that by leaps and bounds! The phone thinks of you like a loyal old dog and wants to do nothing more than serve your every whim. I can tell you the iphone holds up better, know why? Ever had to fix your mom or dads PC? And you think to your self wth are they doing with this thing. We never hear that issue out of iphone. So really is a beast just for that reason alone simply bc the general population can break them by doing stupid stuff. Now on to adress some other stupid comments for people who pretend they are SO smart. Windows is better than a Mac ios! Hum WRONG! Know why? Windows is a dos based crap system with a gui created for the average consumer to use a device. It’s not a damn computer it’s a pretty device to help you numb skulls use paint and word or get on the internet. What is my point now!! Oh yet MAC IOS is FAR superior at least for anyone who actually knows how to use Linux which by the way was and still is the base os on which all other smart software was and still is created. So you pretty little Windows fanboy users, please get a grip because until you stop drooling over your poster size photo of Bill gates and actually learn Linux you know nothing about computing. The really dumb person who commented about Honda’s vs Chevys! Hahaha seriously though? You also probably know nothing right? Honda and GM use the exact same part manufactures which in turn makes both cars CRAP! Research before you comment. Go get what ever phone you want and fanboys of each need to get a grip! 05/29/2016 C Reply Just to clarify a few things for the “people who pretend they re SO smart” Windows has been detached from DOS since windows 2000, It maintains compatibility by running an DOS virtual machine on the NT Kernel. Not all systems are based on Linux, Linux is based on Unix, Mac OS (and IOS) is largely based on BSD which is a variant of UNIX, The Windows Micro-kernel is also partly based on UNIX. For someone who has “years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux.” and “every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you” you are spreading a lot of misinformation. I personally own all apple products, but have and still use the other platforms, They all have their advantages and downfalls. And although I use a Mac, Ipad and Iphone predominantly I still have moments of frustration when I miss windows, android and linux for one reason or another. 05/29/2016 CC Reply Not the same “C” as above btw 05/18/2016 Nikhil Bansal Reply Great Information.

Also, how can you say apple doesn’t come with bloatware? Have you tried removing the stocks app recently? What about file sharing, have you never heard of Android Beam? Or the fact almost every flagship has a fingerprint scanner now? This is the most poorly written, one sided piece of crap I’ve seen in a long time. How do you even have a job? P.s. I own a Nexus 6p for private use and iPhone 6s Plus for work and they’re pretty much equal in every way except for the Nexus having a better screen, free apps, faster charging and longer battery life. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply +1 lol 06/03/2016 alpharidley9098 Reply This article made me laugh pretty hard. I just love the reasons they give for the phone being better. Now 1 thing that is always MORE important than ALL of these is the actual phone. Also, those apps that come with the phone, it depends on what you are getting… Also, you do know apple is making a switch to MicroUSB right? Humph. Seems like just in this 1 paragraph I have already made better points than this article. Anyways, phone-wise, androids are almost always more powerful than an apple phone because of the fact that iPhones are never equip with a good core or a good amount of RAM. They slow down quite quickly and seem obsolete after a few months. Yes. Months. I have had my Moto G3 for awhile and it is still ultra fast and has no technical issues. 06/03/2016 Jens Lipponer Reply problem with iphones is that u need itunes etc.. and too many permissions. I like to just plug in and drag and drop files…. I don’t give a monkey’s behind whether apps look better or what not. let’s be honest, price wise the iphone is beaten every time. there is just no bang for buck. I laugh at people who buy these things for the show off appeal as I know they are getting ripped in a rather large way……… 06/08/2016 Mohamed Faizul Reply I used android for 7 years this is my first iphone 5s bought two years back From the day i bought this iphone till now regularly i m browsing in website that why iphone is better than android, why iphone is better than android,why iphone is better than android,why iphone is better than android but while using android i m much okay with everything…. iPhone is simple best for call ,messaging ,camera with instant speed though its two year old device … But not more than that In android its like sea u can do lot lot more than iphone but not as quality standard reliability fast easy as iphone . 06/09/2016 Ryan Reply Has anyone thought that maybe iPhone is more simple than Android simply because the staff aren’t smart enough to produce anything more complicated than simple? It seems obvious to me. At least Android screens don’t break when you drop the phone on carpet like iPhone’s do. There’s Applecare because the iPhones break like a window hit by a baseball because the whole phone is either thin aluminum or covered in glass (which is a hazard if the glass shards cut you and potentially make you bleed out). The aluminum iPhone’s are currently being made of bend in your pocket! They’ll need some high quality flexible glass and easily bent straight CPU (without anything on the inside being destroyed). By the way, for the vibration thing on Android you don’t have to input password or anything just click the power button and hold down the turn down volume button for a second or two and that’s it. 06/10/2016 Shaggy C Reply So your reasoning is half “It’s popular” and most the other half is comparing apple features to the bad features of a multitude of android phones?

So we may conclude lots of ……… 07/03/2016 Charlie Drac Reply I’m so late to this party, but I HAVE to comment.. I do not care what the name brand is. It could be called Android or robot or Apple or peaches or dog poo. All I care about is having a good phone that can do the most. Phones are expensive. I’m not buying a brand name. I’m looking to buy something that has everything it could possibly have if I’m going to spend that kind of money. You’re “reasons” show good things about IPhone, but are not “reasons” as to why it’s better. IPhones are good phones. People like IPhones because it’s a trend. It’s popular. That’s it. IPhones are not even close to androids. Be truthful. Androids are mini-computers. Literally. IPhone is not. You can do 100 more things with Android that you cannot do with IPhone. The That is the truth. And Apple products are a lot more expensive. Why would anyone pay more for a phone that gives you less? It boggles my mind. Android has variety. There are many, many phones, companies, styles to choose from. They even offer cheaper options that get the job done. They have an SD card slot. Why would anyone dish out $100’s more for more storage? That SD card is yours forever. For future phones or other devices. You can plug your phone into your computer and save(on the phone or SD card) anything (music, photo’s, video’s, contacts) and it’s yours. Without having to go through ITunes or anything else. Apple doesn’t own my stuff. I own it. And I can customize anything I own. There are IPhone stores for these little nick knacks. Transferring files, contacts, etc. It’s like going to a car dealership. One side has a variety of great cars. The other side has one car that is the most expensive. You see that all the other cars have a ton of features, options, colors to choose from, engines, horse power, cylinders, 2-door, 4-door, SUV’s etc. You ask “what’s so great about this lonely more expensive car tht only comes in one model and doesn’t have these other options?” The saleman replies with “Because it’s popular”. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply Yes, this! I agree 100%. 07/04/2016 Emanuel Reply No some of these staments are wrong android has a mode that will change you load out to make it simpler and look like apple cameras so much better its not even comparable iphones are rhe same every year android is some thing different like the edge and note you clearly didnt do your research i use to love iphone and thought it was the best and galaxy/android suchs but when i swiched ill never go back to an apple phone 07/05/2016 greentoe Reply http://gtoe.me/l/7A0q-A-04r 07/05/2016 Sam Smith Reply I just smell a whole lot of fanboying and bias. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply I’m astonished at some of the reasons listed why iPhone is supposedly better. I have two iPhones now, a 5 and a 6, that I can’t get my photos off of onto my PC laptop. I’ve gone into the Crapple store more than three times and still haven’t gotten them off. My idea of HELL is the Crapple store! I hate that place. There’s hardly room to stand and then you end up being sat at a table waiting with a bunch of other frustrated people waiting for a tech to help you. Of course this is after you make an appointment, or in my case last time, two appointments. I don’t see that as a plus at all because not only is going there a royal pain in the ass, but then they don’t even offer much help after several hours. My iPhone does not recognize as a drive when I plug it into my PC. It used to, and then stopped. I don’t want to have to use iTunes to transfer photos or music. I want to just plug it in and have it be a drive and copy whatever files I like back and forth. It does not work; and I’ve spent, literally, hours trying to get it to function that way. I also have a pretty complex DSLR camera and yet it is still easy as can be to transfer the photos from the memory card onto the computer. So why can’t a supposedly user-friendly phone just do the same thing? I seriously hate my iPhone 6 so much I wanted to shoot it, except I discovered it’s worth a good bit of money still so I’ll sell it on ebay. 07/09/2016 Joey Reply A lot of childish responses from android fans here. I gave the nexus 6p and try for 2 months after my old iPhone broke. Hardware was great, but I found on this android phone the app integration and interoperability to be no where near as good as an iPhone. Apple is just better when it comes to form and function. Buy an android if you want to tweak it forever and play in a sandbox, buy and iPhone if you need a productive phone. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply Your comment may not be childish but it is not correct. Comparable Android phones have far better form and function. Take the iPhone 6s plus verses a Note 5 or s7 Edge. The Apple is bigger and heavier yet packs has a smaller or same sized screen as the Samsung’s’ yet has far less features. Both these phones are far more productive, can multi-task properly, be fully customized and allow widgets on lock and home screens for speed, convenience and ease of use. The Note even includes a stylus or pencil. Great compact design, fully featured and greater functionality (Android) vs Heavy outdated bloated hardware with mid-range specs and limited functionality (IOS). Not to forget the limited compatibility of iPhones and lack of choice! 07/10/2016 Chris Reply There are facts, then there are opinions. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply This article is a disgrace, misleading at best. Most of the reasons are just not true or highly debatable. 07/12/2016 Benito Paul Reply congratulation all of u commented on weather iphone or android’s is the best In my point of view it may be any phone that is android or iphone. If we had a phone that should meet our requirements.Requirements means each and every people has different requirements in case of security,memory capacity and so and so. Hence apple or iphone buy any thing because all are vanity, “vanity of vanities” 07/14/2016 aileen Reply I’m someone who switched from android to ios but this article is utter bullshit. Yes, I love my iPhone and i’m so glad I switched by my samsung galaxy 4 was nothing but shit lately but these arguments in the article are dumb as hell. Lightning is better than micro usb? excuse me, what? my iphone takes ages to charge (iphone 6) whereas my s4 charged within an hour. i don’t see how that makes micro usb bad. but well my iphone battery lasts over a day and my old phone could have never. sharing location isn’t hard on android since almost everyone uses whatsapp bc imessage doesn’t exist on android and whatsapp has a location sharing option so that argument was dumb. yes, apps do look prettier on ios but i don’t see how only that would be a reason to switch?? this article clearly comes from someone who has only owned apple devices and doesn’t even know what they’re talking about, if you really want to prove a point you need to ask someone who has used BOTH of the things you’re trying to compare otverwise you’re just gonna embarass yourself. just saying. 07/20/2016 KappaPride Reply Why are you guys even arguing about this? 07/24/2016 George Reply The major advantage iOS has over Android is that Apple designs the phone and software. Whereas for Android (open source) other manufacturers have to play with it to get it to work and sometimes it’s not fluid. Take the Nexus phones for example…they just work like the iphones. No bloatware..nothing (like the iphone). Majority of my friends have iPhones and sometimes I wish I did too because of MMS (iMessage). I used both and I hate that i have to use itune for everything but it is what it is I guess. 07/24/2016 Landry Reply I’m 8 years experimented developer for iOs devices and I say that Apple releases so frequent updates because iOs is just a stone age OS to fool iOs users that Apple works seriously behind their products. It must run to compete Android OS. 07/27/2016 Aza Reply Best to have both. I have an Se and G4 best of both worlds 07/30/2016 Bob Reply So many things piss me off in this article but specifically stood out Notifications I have no idea with this author is saying he obviously hasn’t seen an android phone, they are exactly the same. Lightning vs. Micro-USB Micro-USB usually charges everything from headphones, to power banks, and of course cell phones. And multiple times to insert it is an absurd comment, after about a week you’ll probably memorize which way it goes, and how do you insert it incorrectly more than once. And USB type-C is just starting to come to the mainstream that’s why it’s not on everything. Storage Why do people even buy the 128 GB version, not to get apps but to download media like pictures, videos, music, etc. I agree with the statement about how sd cards are treated but there’s a much more simple solution, buy a larger storage option. Sharing purchased content Sign into the play store with the account that originally bought the content, install it, then sign out. Problem solved, and if anyone says “it’s more convenient” think about how often you might actually purchase something that costs actual money, I’ll bet it’s probably less than once a week. And it doesn’t take long to sign in and then back out 08/14/2016 Adso Rossi Reply I love iPhones. They always have nice designs and I like the simple interface. I have been itching to get an SE with its smaller dimensions (I like small phones). Money is not a problem to me but as much as I really want one I will stick with my Android device. Why? Cause the compatibility of iPhones to Windows pcs are real bad or none. You’d say “get a Mac” but I can’t: too many programs I need that unfortunately are only Windows-available. If this one single point of compatibility would be addressed, the iPhone becoming as compatible as Androids, I would get that iPhone SE in a heartbeat! 08/21/2016 nathanlittles plays minecraft Reply Who the hell needs iPhone I can name 100 reasons why Android is better but I’ll just name 20 1. Freedom 2. Apk 3. More sizes 4. More colours 5. Waterproof phones 6. Big and small tablets instead of the HUGE iPad 7. Clear cache option 8. For apps and also all the app store apps 9. No need for jailbreak but if you root you’re device will have no restrictions :D 10. Notification swipe 11. Google now 12. Google maps instead of the crappy apple maps 13. Multiple users feature 14. SD card storage So you don’t run out of storage easily like on the 16 gig iPhones (128GB or even 256GB) 15. Pattern unlock 16. There’s everything on Google play store even GPS spoofers to do the Pokémon go spoof in like 2 seconds 17. Unknown sources option 18. No need for an apple I’d all you need is a Google account which is way easier to set up and use 19. Get apps that are not out in your country easier (Pokémon go) 20. Android sounds better then apple 08/22/2016 Jim Reply This article made me so angry I must go punch a kitten. It’s an interesting psychological phenomenon, our emotional ties to brand loyalty. It’s as if the device we choose to use says something about who we are as people, and there is some ancient war of two types of people being waged through our genetics. Apple users are like Yankee fans, Android users are the goth kid outsiders. And the war rages on. 08/30/2016 Deleau Clément Reply Hi. Please kill yourself.

Like, the notifications. Android is wayyy better. You clear all at once or swipe. It combines like notifications that you can separate. It allows to interact with the notification and app without opening it and its just, way simpler and cleaner. 09/10/2016 Nigel Nderi Reply Let me settle this. Choose an iPhone if you are incompetent or are ok with a company controlling you’re phone completely. Choose an Android if you want to be able to enjoy the latest technologies and can competently manage it’s abilities without whining that it takes more than half a brain cell to use. 09/11/2016 Josh Mcduff Reply Just read all the comments and wow it’s all he said she said. I’ve had my Nexus 6p which btw one poster said it’s Google made nope huewei or whatever. Point is not the same, for about a year now and I’m now getting the iPhone 7. Are the specs pretty damn similar? Yes alot of the same features? Yes update often? Yes Nexus gets all the Android ones first like Apple. Price? Actually the 7 is less than the Nexus by about 150.00 CAD sooo that defeats the argument about price… Just saying. I love my Nexus but I’m open to changing. Ice bounced back and forth alot between Android and iOS can I say one is superior to the other? Absolutely not it all comes down to does it do what I want it to and can I afford it. 09/12/2016 Lee Reply All good and well people love free stuff but free stuff comes with a price of selling your info to the uncontrollable thirst party. iPhone also offer easy printing option than android you have to download something that will ask you to upgrade by paying just to use your printer no way! Also iPhone helps stop third party apps that try to use your phone making phone calls example if you are searching for nearest restaurant Google will show the call number to the same restaurant but when you try to call instead of calling direct the parasite apps like whatsaapp, text… And more they pop up asking you to use them making a call while they can’t function without your service they bug you each time taking away the time you spend trying to make a call. If you’re in a hurry and these app try to suggest you use it think how buggy this is. The same applies to text messages. 09/15/2016 Jada Reply Have u really owned an android?

Apple has had to recall their product so many times because people died from the battery exploding. And with Apple every 3rd phone they stop making updates for it. Android always has updates for their products. Plus Apple owes the government 37 billion dollars Android doesn’t. The iPhone 7 that is coming out is a total ripoff. They copied Samsung. Apple has never made a crack resistance screen and a waterproof phone. Samsung is simply better. 09/17/2016 Rob Doyle Reply I completely am for people having their own opinion, that being said I disagree with the title of this article. That being said without any bias coming into play here, some of the points that the author was trying to make aren’t true or aren’t completely true. 1. “Works with all your devices”… The real title should be works better with all of your APPLE devices. The examples in the article are all apple examples. The author obviously has no experience with android or windows. 2. “Faster Updates”…. Compared to what android device? You can’t just say that Iphones get updates faster and compare that to all android phones. The way that this section was written made it sounds like the day an update is release for Android, nine of there phones get it immediately like the iPhones… this just isn’t true. If you have a nexus you get updates as they are released (just like and iPhone) There is a bunch of other examples that just show the author has no experience with android devices, I’m just going to keep this short. People will choose what they think is best for them. My issue is with the author, not the opinion. All the argument were completely based on opinion and not facts. People are going to read this and take it all as fact, instead of doing research and finding the right device for them. 09/18/2016 Jonathan Masters Reply I have both an iPhone 5 and a Galaxy S7. While there are some advantages to the iPhone, there are several reasons why I just can’t make a permanent switch. First, no home screen widgets (like my calendar and agenda). Sure, you can add something like that to the notifications screen, but that involve swiping, as opposed to right on the home screen. Second, it’s so difficult — even annoying — trying to organize files on the iPhone. On an Android, it operates exactly like a computer should (and our phones really are computers these days), with folders, subfolders, etc., so you can just copy the files to where you want them for later use. You can’t do that on an iPhone, where all of your files go to some mysterious and deep “collection” on the phone. If Apple were to add those two features, then I’d happily switch away from Android. 09/21/2016 de Coulon Thierry Reply I wanted to try an iPhone, so I got an old one. I could simply not install anything because everything on the AppStore has moved to iOS > 7. I could not bring a single file to the phone. All it would do is sync with iTunes on my Mac, but there is nothing to sync because I don’t use this Mac for everyday life. The iPhone I got did not have any smart way to save battery. The iPhone I got could not play any of my music because a) I could not upload it and b) I could not install anything that would play ogg files. The iPhone I got was heavier, thicker and less good looking than my current Sony. So OK it was an old iPhone, but 90% of what I say would be true for the latest iPhone, and at what price! If you live in the Apple world, then an iPhone is probably the logical choice. I live in the Linux world and now I know I’ll never take another look at an iPhone. 09/24/2016 Jim Washko Reply Worldwide stats – Android users 82% vs IOS users 18% There’s not enough votes to even tilt the scale towards IOS being better. Being as the story indicates Android phones are only good for 2 years that makes them more expensive. How can IOS users explain why 82% of the market would rather pay more for less?, if that were in fact true. Iphone offers less control, poor resoluion, no expandable memory and not all phones can share the same apps. Android offers all of it as well as compatible with Windows whcih is currently at 80% of the market share. This is like comparing the Yugo to Prius. Sure the Yugo is cheaper at first, but after a year of so, not so much. Iphone resale is more, but that will drop due to fewer and fewer users as they get tired of the box of crayons with only black and white as an option. when they can get the box of 64 and a sharpener 09/24/2016 Capi Reply Is this all a big joke? You keep saying “iPhone is better than Android” about ten times in the article, like a mantra we have to learn and assimilate, Am I the only one who noticed this? I have and iPad, and iMac and I used iPhone (4, 4s and 5) I am familiar with both iOS and OSX but actually I have an Android and installed Windows 10 on my iMac. OSX is a good system if you like simple and easy interfaces, I don’t really have any problem with it, is a really good system once you learn to do things that are diferent with Windows, like formating drives with Disk Utility. (And if we forget how difficult could be for some people to use drive formats like NTFS in a Mac) But iOS, thats another story, Apple manufactures iPhone and developes a OS which works perfectly with that device, which, supposedly, makes it safer. There ends all iOS and iPhone REAL advantages. There are a lot of reason to say Android is better than Android, but the main reason is that you can freely add and delete files from it. I connect my Android to my computer, I press “Windows key” + “E” and immediately I see all my drives and my Android device there, and I can drag or delete files from it. But when I connect an iPhone I have sync up files with iTunes. Why the hell people think synchronization is good? For example, I spent one week adding all my music from CDs to my iTunes library, then I synced my iPhone and… voilá, my music was there. Then my computer died, and my music adquired during years with my money was completely lost, just because I didn’t buy it to Apple. But hey, music was still on my iphone, but NO, I need a third party program, which costs money or could be a malware, just to upload my songs again to a new computer. (Of course I have all my CDs, but thats a week lost) Im simply asking you to do like me if you can, just try everything, because if I read this article (iPhone is better, iPhone is better, iPhone is better…) I have the feeling that not everyone, but many people conform with iPhone. Just for popularity, for Apple fanaticism, or just because a website is telling you to buy it with superliminal advertising. 09/26/2016 wgallagher142 Reply I actually find that android apps have become much prettier and definitely more modern than iPhone apps at this point.

I have been a heavy android user till date until yesterday when I bought iPhone 7 plus. I own an iPad since two years. I am happy with my iPad which I use mainly for games and some handwriting. Yes I was annoyed from android. I owned s3. It had, due to some reason, a built in issue which I only realized after warranty finished. My faulty s3 obliged me to hate Samsung and android. Then I bought note 4. It solved all my problems I faced on s3. But still there were some things I did not feel good about. Now after purchasing iPhone 7plus 128 GB I understand the power of google. The three apps Google search, google maps and google drive are enough reason to close down iPhone factory from the face of earth. 10/10/2016 BM Reply Thinking to upgrade from s5. Thought for iPhone 7. But it can not do even 5 % work compared to android. My andrioid mobile automatically silents itself when I enter meetings or office. Automatic meeting mode when meeting is scheduled (only beeps) I can give my mobile to anyone to see coz I have app specific fingerprint. Only sensitive apps are protected. All other is open. These are not possible with apple except jailbreak. These are just samples. I can write journal what android can do. Speed is not important with a Ibrick which can not do anything smart. I’m not a fan of apple or Samsung. I want my work to be done and my pocket secretary to work according to my requirements. 10/10/2016 Charles Alden Reply 15 reasons why Android is better. Reason number one, you have an actual file system. Anyone who has dealt with iOS horrendous file management paradigm appreciates the ease as at which files are accessible in Android. You simply click on Open, navigate to where your files are stored, select, done. There is also never any reason to use the Share function except when sharing data with the internet. Number 2, multitasking, iOS’s multitasking absolutely sucks, especially when you compare it to Android. Example, I can stream a film to my TV wirelessly, while compiling an application via a remote terminal, while downloading a 40GB file directly to my NAS drive which is mounted as a local folder, while I convert a media file to .mp4, while I play N64, 007 Goldfinger using a replica N64 USB game controller. I’m able to select my own default apps, so when I download a file and click open, the app that I normally use for that extension opens up automatically. I have a global search function, which is one of the worst things about iOS, how do you find files. That was rhetoric, you can’t, it’s basically hunt and peck. I can customize voice commands, this is perhaps one of the coolest things about about Android. I have around 250 custom voice commands, mostly for searching files. Such as, “show me all file [file extension] created on [date]. Even photos, show me all photos from [city] on [particular date/month, years], even for a particular person , “show me all photos for [name] on [particular date/month, year]” External display support, when am connect my phone to a monitor not only is the resolution fully supported but so is the aspect ratio. Mouse support, while connected to a monitor I can use a mouse and a keyboard. Even when not connected to a phone, having access to a mouse is an absolute must when using a tablet as a laptop. USB peripheral support, so besides mouse support, my phone supports a TB external HD, HP All-In-One printer in which the scanner even works, USB replica game controllers in which a have one for the N64, SNES, Sega and PlayStation. Better overall specs, I have a 2K AMOLED display, 6GB of RAM, USB C, SD Card reader, HDMI out support, etc. I can use a custom desktop LDPI, I changed my LDPI to 380 which is the LDPI that activates tablet mode, which means all of my apps are a lot more powerful than the normal phone UI ones. I can customize my entire system to what I want it to be, give it personality, iOS users have been using the same system UI for the last 9 years. There is absolutely nothing I can’t customize. Inner app communication is a lot better, since iOS has a Walled off prison, or so called Walled Garden, apps communicate via API’s, which is the root of everything wrong within iOS. Anyway as stated above, I don’t have to use some half assed sharing function which creates a copy of the file your sharing every time you use it to open up my files within multiple apps, I simply click on Open. I can even open up the same file within multiple apps at the same time. I never, ever have to create more than one file, I just use the original file, always. I can use Linux under a Chroot, meaning I have a full Debian server running under my phone. Why would you want this, well first of all I have CLI applications like; Python, Perl, PHP, MySQL, Apache, etc. I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed like; Dia, Inkscape, Gimp, BlueFish, etc. I can use my phone as a desktop computer, this one might sound weird but not only is it possible, it works incredibly well. Especially when my phone has 6GB of RAM and a Qualcomm 821. Like I said above I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed in which a bring them up using a xterminal, when I’m at work I have access to about a hundred different Windows applications via a Citrix client which works fantastically. All of my applications including the ndroid ones are opened up in individual windows, so none of that dual app view non-sense. In which in iOS less than 0.5% out of a million plus apps actually support. I have access to widgets, they might not interest you but they are extremely handy. I can use wireless chargers. I can use custom ROMs, even completely different OS’s like Ubuntu Touch, SailFish, etc. I will never, ever not be able to run the latest version of Android. When a manufacturer stops updating their phone, no problem, I just install a custom ROM and they work fantastically. My phone is a computer, a real powerhouse, a real smartphone. Every time I use an iPhone I absolutely hate the experience. I mean even to type a post like this I would have to use a text editor as I would be afraid to loose all of my work as anytime you switch to another app, Safari just resets. It has happened to me numerous times, it’s why sites have started saving drafts, not for the Android users but iOS users. Though what bothers me the most is the lack of multitasking, yes, sure, there are a few apps that can run in the background but they are far and few and none of them are the ones that I need or want to use. Than there is the file system or I should say lack of, dealing with files IOS is simply a complete nightmare. Anytime someone at the office who uses an iPhone gets sassy with me about having an Android phone I simply ask them to show me their user directory, what, you can’t mount it, why not, your phone is so great. Not only do I have my remote server directly mounted as a local directory on my phone but my workstation and all of my cloud services as well, all accessible within any app installed. Again, my phone is also my desktop computer and why not, it’s not only powerful enough but more than capable. I couldn’t believe how horrible the external display support was on my iPad Pro, which I recently replaced with a Lenovo YogaBook, best decision I ever made. Talk about a complete makeover on how I work, I’m actually productive now. I can create detailed reports, all in the background and automatically, I have access to a scripting language, automation, multi-user support with OpenID to access my firms internal network, a real Office suite, MS Office for iOS was a complete joke, there isn’t even a import feature, scripting language, nope, database support, nope, by the way, I have the Android version. Which opens up every app under their own window, iOS’s dual app support on the iPad Pro was a joke, hardly anything supports it and that drag and drop feature, only apps designed by the same developer can use it, so MS Word to MS Excel yes, MS Word to Apple photos, no, useless. Yes, my post is huge, but this authors best 15 reasons why the iPhone is a joke. Almost everything listed I have on either my Yoga Book or new Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus or don’t need it as it’s a waste. In fact 90% of the so called new features in iOS 10 are useless. I held on to my iPad Pro thinking iOS 10 would be a game changer, not only was it not, but there wasn’t a single feature that improved my experience. Apple keeps skipping over every feature that we actually want, need. If your happy with multitasking, file management, the fact that you can’t select your own default apps, lack of customizations, horrible external display support, lack of USB C, limited NFC, horrible USB peripheral support, especially mouse support. Horrible inner app communication including the Sharing function in which took Apple 8 years to even release that crap, ugh, the list just goes on and on and …………. 10/11/2016 Gigi Reply This is one of the most biased articles I have ever read on complementing Apple. I am an adult, I don’t need Apple to limit what I can do with my phone and what I can share and who I can share with. I have used Iphone before and it surely not my cup of tea. 10/12/2016 Emma squire Reply Okay Listen what I think is that you have written an article telling the blank truth of your mind. But you see I have an iPhone 6s,iPod 5,MacBook air, MacBook Pro, Samsung TV with built in smart tv, Samsung galaxy tablet pro and I don’t mind Samsung to be truthful. Also I find that Apple is more easier to use but harder to switch from an iOS device to an LGphone. Emma squire, 11y/o from Aus. 10/14/2016 Babble Reply Let’s face it… I use an android lollipop but after comparing and visualizing the specifications.. One can truly say that iPhone is way more better than android. ..though we need to invest some bucks unlike android phones. 😀 10/14/2016 Huen Reply iOS is superior to Android. I was suckered in buying 2 android devices the samsung galaxy s3 and the nexus 4. I gave it a try because my friends raved about android. They are smart people who generally have great advice and knowledge on technology. So I said I’ll give it a shot because they have good judgement. However I found out that their judgement were out of biased hatred toward apple. Android devices: 1. on paper they have more ram, sometimes quicker cpu clock speed, higher resolution etc. however real life performance tests apple out scores android devices, just check geek bench and speed tests. As for higher resolution our eyes dont even detect the larger resolutions. 2. I found out the hard way, downloaded apps that just didnt work for my device. Google needs to improve this I dont know if they are better now but man they need to detect the hardware your using and tell you ahead of time before you download and install an app that its compatible with your device! 3. customizations my butt!! Its a great idea so called if all your launchers actually look good! haha I tried all these loaders for my s3 and they were all ugly. Just go with apple, its like saying would you hire great designers for your house and you would just let them have their way in designing the house for you or would you want to design it yourself? doesnt make sense look at xiaomi great example they just copy everything apple does and it looks great. Dont hire cheap designers to design the way your phone looks and works. 4. OS – android’s solution to everything is “oh just download this app to make it work or oh just kill this task or reduce brightness or this or that” why?! If I’m paying 1k for a phone why does it not just work? Why must I non stop have to tweak things on my phone to get save battery or make things work? For instance for whatsapp there was no function built into the app that when I want to send a larger video than that of the given limit on a video it just rejects it. On iOS whatsapp gives you a little function that u can just cut the video into segments and send them in separate messages? This sounds like it can be something that is on the app level. I dont know but as for end user experience its just not convenient you need to download another app that will cut videos in segments for you this is retarded. 5. battery life just sucks on android – and my friend is all like well it works for me…well that’s because he had to buy a new battery that was double the size and totally threw out the idea of having a sleek thin phone. Theres on and on the list goes android and samsung devices are not superior devices. The features samsung lovers speak of are just gimmicks. Keyboards, widgets, notifications honestly who cares? Especially when widgets just take down performance on your phone? I just dont see any benefits on android especially the argument went something like this: “oh android phones are cheaper for superior hardware” Like I said hardware maybe superior on PAPER but in real life benchmarks iphones outshine samsung and htc and other top tier android devices. By the way prices are not cheaper anymore so android fanboys have no actual argument. Like I said I tried android and they are not superior phones both hardware and software. Aesthetically Android phones are ugly. You now pay a premium price on sub premium products, and they explode. lol 10/20/2016 Jamezz_ Reply Sure. A Samsung or LG’s phone software is ugly. But stock android?! Android 6.0 stock? It’s an extraordinary interface with origami-style apps. The geometry with the shadows and vibrant colors is beautiful. The app drawer is simple, and you can put the apps you use on your home screen. Android’s advantage is software. iSheep are just too autistic to use it. 10/16/2016 Cmi Reply I have both! I have an iPhone for work and I have an Android for my personal use, in my opinion the phone is shit and could not compare to the Android in any area,i f it were up to me I would NEVER own an iPhone. Anybody who argues this point has never used them side by side. No comparison.anybody who stands in line for the new iPhone is absolutely getting the shaft and not even getting the best product , it’s laughable! 10/18/2016 George Brite Reply Great article. Over the years I’ve had both. Even a couple of Macs. I use PC’s now because I like being able to work on them and build my own. For the average user the I Phone is a better choice. They are simple and work well. Here’s the big negatives for me: The hardware and software are proprietary. In fact the phones are sealed. You can’t install an extended battery. No SD slot. No root access. Comparable Android phones cost a lot less. The Android phones natively work with Google Apps. We use our phones in the business. If I were a casual user it wouldn’t matter if it were a Trac Phone or an I Phone. We use the Google phones and Motorola phones. They run pure Android without all the carrier bloatware. I like to say Apple invented the smartphone, but Google perfected it. It’s like the choice between a toaster oven and a microwave or a full commercial kitchen. Most people will get along fine with the toaster and microwave. They don’t need a commercial kitchen. But, what if you could get the full commercial kitchen for the same price as the toaster and microwave? Everyone has an opinion about which is better. But trust me when I say this isn’t a choice between chocolate and vanilla. There are very distinct differences between the Android and Apple phones. 10/21/2016 ZinicHD Reply Wtf, apps never ever releases on iOS first. It always releases on android first. Also app updates releases on android first, so that’s kind of bullshit what you are saying. The only thing iOS beats android in is security and stability. Also you can get virus scanners on android, so that thing doesn’t matter. And one thing more, who ever uses FaceTime or iMessage, when we have messenger, Skype ect… And that point when you said that iOS stock apps was the stupidest crap I have ever heard. First of all it was a shit point, what are you gonna need the looks for? Second is that not everyone thinks it look better, so keep that mind. I am a iOS user and I am so disappointed that you can’t even customize the most of the things. I have to admit that the design of iOS is pretty nice, but you get quick tired of it. That’s why I jailbreaked my device to get the ability to customize it more professionally. But I don’t compare a android device and a jailbroken device, because jailbreaking is not something that comes with Apple. iOS is also very expensive compared to android devices. And checking storage on android is way more organized than iOS, so I don’t know where you get that idea that checking storage on iOS is better. 10/22/2016 Bent Vanwijnsberghe Reply the lightning port part is bs i have an iphone (looking for a new phone android) and there are around me on my desk already 3 micro usb and 1 lightning port witch costs around 40 bucks for a new one 10/25/2016 Selenia Reply Terrible article by an obvious fanboy. You are listing many things, like lack of carrier or manufacturer bloatware, reversible charging plug, seamless sharing, etc and saying they are exclusive to Apple. Try Googling USB-C, the current standard on any higher range Android, some still cheaper than an iDevice. Try a Nexus, or as of this year, Pixel phone. No bloat, Android as Google intended it. That would be a more fair comparison as those are at least close in the chain to Google, like an iPhone is to Apple. That is, instead of being made by some company who may not even care how it represents Android, build quality, and other important things, instead of pure profit(not say all non Nexus/Pixel phones are bad by any means, but some do give Android a bad name with poor specs and modified/outdated versions of Android). Seamless sharing? Ever hear of WiFi Direct, Bluetooth, or NFC? NFC is the simplest. Just hit share and tap. All but the cheapest Androids have that these days. Anyways, I am convinced you have never used a decent Android, ever. Certainly not one from Google themselves. I will leave you to tend to your iFlock. 10/30/2016 MzJens Reply For android, I think google products like nexus & pixel are much better than samsung. However, I noticed a lot of crappy apps available on google play that doesn’t work. Some apps require root access which only advance users should do. Android interface is not as intuitive as iOS. Some android apps hang. I’ve never had ios apps hang on me 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Reply “You have to try multiple attempts before putting the charger in at the right angle” 1. If you do it in a lit environment you will get it in first try because the micro USB shape is easy to see 2. If you are in the dark: And have an official Samsung charger – there will be a “bumps letting you know which way to put it and the only thing that can go wrong is you missing the port, which is possible on iPhone too. And have any old micro USB – there are two, normal, ways to insert it horizontally upside down and horizontally the correct way both 180 degree angles so please don’t exaggerate it. Finally Samsung cares about you that’s why they use micro USB. This may seem weird but basically to legally make a lightning USB cable you need a licence from Apple and Apple only have their own unique charger to earn more profit, that’s why apple chargers are always more expensive, because they are sold by Apple or the retailer needs to make his money back from the licence fare. P.S. Samsung devices come with a 1 year warranty for free and because it’s Samsung you can get cheaper insurance than their one (yes they have one) P.P.S. Sharing has always been easier on android to anything because you could share with a variety of options such as Bluetooth, NFC, messaging app, other third party apps, S share (Samsung own “air drop” that came out in Android version 4.1.3 BI7 – before Ios 7 Also the settings icon is useful, it’s like apple not making the send button on messages 3d touch to send so you don’t accidently press it, sure sometimes you send half written messages but it is more convenient and normal to have it to a single normal touch. And there is a difference between apps looking better and having more features on Apple which are usually hardware based, I just brought this up because no matter who you ask if you compare a Samsung phone with its equivalent iPhone generation, Samsung phones ALWAYS have better displays and MOSTLY have better cameras. Samsung phones are also very comfortable, for example I am writing this on a Samsung galaxy s7 edge There is a setting that allows the micro sd card to be added as side by side storage Finally Samsung has always had earphone controls so either I read it wrong that you said these are things we will miss very much or you are really confused 11/12/2016 Tetsuokenpachi Reply Each and every single of these are false. Android is actually better in every single of these areas. From the first to the last one. Worse yet, many of these points are actually some of the very reasons why idevices absolutely suck. 11/16/2016 Billy Sastard Reply apple is crap, these idiots make their products so expensive, but android is cheaper and has alot of awesome features.android is also WAY more customisable, with out necessarily rooting your device.And if you do, you can do almost anything from installing apps to changing your software. 11/16/2016 Calculadora Gestacional Reply I think both of them are just great! 11/16/2016 Caleb Reply The update can still download on older Apple products, because I have a IPad 2 that came out in 2011 and it still receives all of the latest updates. It is running IOS 10 right now. 11/16/2016 saurabh Reply Been an exclusive apple lover for 7 years now. But just bought an edge 7. Was amazed to see how much progress android has made and makes my iphone look so limited. I am aware that android tends to slow down over time but that is yet to happen to me. For now the openness of android is amazing as it is giving me a computer like experience while iOS still strictly behaves like a mobile device only. Classic hurt points being in iphone /iOS being No expandable memory No dual sim version (i travel internationally and need this frequently) Unable to use lastpass like apps the same way as in android (and keychain is BS, BTW) Simple things like themes unavailable Very less system wide control Very limited customisation I can go on but i think unless my expensive edge can give me same performance as now for ATLEAST 2 years, i’ll eat my words back But, the 15 points mentioned here are almost all very unconvincing. 11/17/2016 Philip Reply Apple are just simple phones no really fancy stuff I have had two Android phone I love their features but not their battery life which is crappie I have had two Apple iPods and two iPhone they were the 4 32 GB & 5s 64 GB now on Android your apps get updated every 3 months on Apple sometimes twice a week IOS updates are twice month at least I bought my iPhone 5s 64 GB which started with iOS 7 in 2014 now it got iOS 10.1.1 it seems the IOS are getting worse not better it freezes crashes most apps lot of the app you can’t even post two year let alone one day old photo I can get on my Samsung Galaxy S3 with 3 year old photos on it and post photos off it to any app only reason I like the small iPhones I can collect lot photos that way I can post to my apps like now I got over 106K photos on my 5s 64 GB which you can’t do with big phones only problems I got with iPhones are updates on apps and IOS’S like this month iOS 10.2 supposedly be coming out it seems the new IOS’s don’t really fixing any problems you get on your iPhone it just give you different problems while you still have the same old problems you also got figure Apple iPhones are about 3 years behind Android phones on new ideals 11/18/2016 Nick Reply Apple!?

From the moment you boot up ios, there are restrictions to what you can do with your phone. Can you flash IOS9 to iphone4s? Guess what, my old galaxy s2 is already running marshmallow like a charm and i think both of them were released in the same year. and i am in the process of flashing Latest nougat 7.1 cyanogenmod version on my s6 edge. You are writing about malware crap which is misleading. New android versions since lollipop allow users to modify app permissions but i think you are so caught up in app constrained ecosystem, you didn’t noticed. IOS isn’t secure anymore as we thought it was. Su vulnerability has already been fixed and there is no more stagefright bug in android. And you obviously have no idea about the difference between android based phones and android phones. Most of the Phones from samsung, htc, sony etc run Custom Android based OS, They are actually custom build port of android, not real android phones, so obviously there will be some issues too if you try to port IOS on samsung. A high end smartphone can go head to head with iphone in each and every aspect. My s6 edge is not even a tad slower than iphone 6, in fact, it performs even better. The slowdown overtime can be experience on low end smartphone. Obviously the one writing this comment has no idea about fstrim. Stop posting such nonsense crap in order to get traffic to your website. 11/25/2016 ashford Reply I have never once had a problem with android phones, but decided to switch it up as IPhones are the ‘in thing’ It was okay for a few months, but soon started having plenty of issues with speed, memory and doing basic things. I decided to upgrade it to the 7, which turned out to be just as bad. For the price, they should be giving people something amazing, not mediocrity! P.S. How much did they apple pay you for such a bad article. 12/03/2016 Brandon McLean Reply You didn’t mention how Apple has a much smaller battery, late software updates, unneeded restrictions, is insanely overpriced, and most of all, Apples processor specs come in at a fraction of what Androids of the same price have, AKA 1.6 GHZ (Apple iPhones) vs 2.4 GHZ (ASUS, Galaxy S7, OnePlus all running Android), 2 GB of RAM (Apple) vs 4 GB of RAM (Android). Android is by far the superior technology. Your only argument is that Android uses Google’s superior sharing system, rather than their own like Apple does. 12/14/2016 Keith Llewellyn Reply For me, it’s all about security, and Apple has the best. Also, if you buy an iPhone you get updates and support for a couple of years more than Google provides for it’s own Nexus or Pixel phones. Two years worth of updates for the OS and Three years for security updates FROM THE DATE OF FIRST INTRODUCTION is totally inadequate. It means that you have to buy a new google phone from the date it is first available in order to really benefit from the updates. 12/27/2016 Apple Marketing Machine Reply Let’s compare the “core” features of a new iphone to a 2 year old android phone: iphone 7 plus – Released 2016, September Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Released 2014, October iphone 7 plus – 1080 x 1920 pixels (~401 ppi pixel density) Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 1440 x 2560 pixels (~518 ppi pixel density) iphone 7 plus – Quad-core 2.23 GHz Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Quad-core 2.7 GHz iphone 7 plus – 12 MP camera Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 16 MP camera iphone 7 plus – Non-removable Li-Ion 2900 mAh battery Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Removable Li-Ion 3220 mAh battery okay…you can have your “better looking apps”. 12/28/2016 MACKabiVIPer42 Reply Yes Android phones are better everything wise but iPhone battery is better last as long as up to 3 to 4 years Samsung last up to 6 months I know had S3 and HTC 1 still got S3 3rd battery it’s just iPod on second iPhone first one was iPhone 4 32 GB lasted 4 years got iPhone 5s 64 GB it’s over 2 yrs old but don’t use for taking photos just for collecting photos which small iPhone can collect up too 100K photos like my iPhone 5s I’m not SELFIE PERSON where I got take photo of my self in every window mirror and bathroom I love stealing other people photos like Anime ladies in bikinis to post on my other apps even Animals if they are cute enough yes Apple do make there apps crappie and there IOS’s also which crashes and freezes a lot then half time you can’t post photos or articles from your e-mail too the apps but I take Apple for small phone over android big phone 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply More pixels require more energy and chip performance.

This list is pure “i don’t like it so that means android is bad” and “its apple so whatever it does it’s genius”. if you’ve ever ACTUALLY went from crapple to android (unlike 99% of the comments here that say they have but in reality… well) you would notice a LOT of improvements over crapple. 1: The price to quality ratio is MUCH better that apple’s. 2: More customisation options. Unless you count changing your phone cover as “customizing”. 3: It’s not apple, so it’s better (see what i did there? I did the shit apple fanboy’s do) 4: No dumb “inovations”. 5: Simplifying things and making something that takes 3 seconds isn’t better, Sony, Samsung etc focus on more important things to improve. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply Well you sound like Forest Gump in his movie when he said that his friend opened Apple company for selling fruits….

But if you’re like majority of people and have a Windows computer that’s a lie. I installed iTunes once and my computer was never the same again.

I have a android galaxy tab 3 and the iPod 6 generation and if I was to choose which is better it’s definitely Apples product and I never would get an android again. When I got my android new at Walmart it couldn’t even get the latest version, it was completely unbelievable. After I had it for 3 months it slowed down on me and its battery life is horrible. Now when I bought this IPod new I’ve had it for a double the time now and it works like new and best of all it can get the latest version. The quality of Apple is way better. In my opinion the iPhone is the best visual quality I’ve seen yet. Ive done some decent gaming on them and if you want something to save your progress then forget android, because not all the game link to your google play account so if you reset it the ones that don’t link are gone. Unlike apple I haven’t had any issues with it. I’ve lost decent money and progress on android because of it. Yes Apple does come out with the newest technology a bit latter then android but you can see it it a good way or a bad. The bad way would be that their slow, the good way you can see it as if their watching googles failing parts and their making it better. 01/03/2017 Marcelino Reply Also I can see you all are fighting over this topic which is pretty stupid. To be honest you can’t necessarily compare them. Everyone is different so everyone is going to want something different. If we all wanted android or we all wanted Apple we would become robots. If you wanted to find a phone to get then get into inside detail to see what your looking for. If you wanted fun texting and want to be more secure then go straight for apple because they got the best for that but if you wanted fun lock screens or be able to put micro SD cards and changeable batteries then go for android but let me remind you that anyone can take the SD card out and take your information. Hope this helps. 01/04/2017 LOREN FOK Reply people will buy iphone just because thats what everyone else has they dont even know what they are buying.

To know about these or making a decision about which is better or not… Please read about these two on this link: http://peaktal.com/iphone-ios-or-android-which-one-is-best-to-buy/ 01/17/2017 Haviette Reply Please, folks, be nice.

Now of course I’m an apple fan. 01/29/2017 THETRUEANDROIDUSER Reply Apple fanboys,crying it out.What a pity,brainwashed fools 01/30/2017 dstrauss Reply I have been an iPhone user since day one (currently 7 Plus), but this article is insanely prejudiced. Most of the alleged superiorities are interoperabilty between iPhones (iMessage, Airdrop) or between iPhone and other Apple devices (Handoff) – if you are a PC owner, or have a large number of friends or fellow users on Android, these advantages are insignificant at best. I will concede that updates and lack of carrier bloatware are significant pluses, the author is doing an extreme disservice to new users by basically promoting an iPhone prejudice. 01/31/2017 Matt Perkins Reply iPhones win over Android smartphones for these 5 critical reasons. Security, Privacy, Stability, Performance and Usability. iOS gets far less malware than Android, it has far less critical vulnerabilities than Android. Vulnerabilities are patched quicker in iOS. iOS crashes and freezes less than Android, Apple doesn’t harvest data to sell like Google does (Google has even started collecting identifiable data since they released their new voice assistant). iOS is a faster OS than Android is while Android smartphones slow down faster than the iPhone does. And of course iOS offers the better out of box experience. Not to mention you can never make Android as secure as iOS, only close to as secure. Part of the reason is even if you tweak your Android settings to be similar to iOS, the official Google Play Store gets far more malware than the AppStore and Cydia combined. So only way to even remotely match it is not download apps or games. My other favorite part of iOS over Android is the fact you can use true adblockers in iOS, not just adblock browsers without the need to root or jailbreak. Google will never allow you to block ads in Chrome or block all ads third party ads without rooting. And as you knowing rooting and jailbreaking merely lowers the security of the OS. That’s another thing Jailbroken iOS is more secure than untouched Android as long as you stick to the default repos in Cydia. 02/01/2017 Shaun Anderson Reply Android Download from unknown sources like a regular computer Download files from browser Plug in and transfer anything to and from computer. File System. Just acts more like a computer in regards to freedom to do as you will where iPhone is locked down like a game system. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply You can do all that in iTunes. iPhone is more careful to protect data while android is less careful. Today security is most important and that is iOS goal. 02/02/2017 lg k4 ekran koruyucu Reply LG K10 LTE için sergi 1280 X 720 piksel yüksek çözünürlüklü ekran çözünürlüğe sahip IPS LCD yaptı. 02/10/2017 thomasammy749 Reply Stay at home mom Kelly Richards from New York after resigning from her full time job managed to average from $6000-$8000 a month from freelancing at home… This is how she done !!!!!!!!!!!!!http://jobbuzz7.com 02/14/2017 Debadeep Biswas Reply I also believe iPhone is better than Android. I am tired of using Android and going to buy iPhone soon for better camera, speed and style. 02/17/2017 LordyAlmighty Reply One VERY important fact that no one has mentioned… with Apple you can be a total amoral ignoramous and be surrounded by adoring fans !! Who really cares if the poor sods on the other side of the world live the lives of slaves? Who cares if they have to stand ALL day, and ASK for pissbreaks? Who cares if the companies solution to suicides are suicide nets around buildings and removing knives? Who cares if the iphone costs a dollar to make, but sold for $600? Who cares if most of the jobs are not in the countries paying for the status symbols? So lets be clear, its all about “im better than you because i can waste money on bling, and *&$! your community at the same time”. 02/18/2017 exycheezy Reply I’ve had both. many times. I’ve had every version of the iPhone. I’ve never had an Android phone update properly. My 3 year old plays on my old 2nd gen iPhone that has the latest IOS on it. . .. android can’t do that. with the exception of a Verizon flip phone, every single Android phone I’ve ever had got a virus, crashed and I had to reset to factory settings at least 2 times per phone. I have never, ever ever got a virus on ANY Apple product, and never had to put any software or app to keep it running correctly. As far as customization? Who cares. If you’re so busy and have so much time to waste trying to impress everyone with crazy fonts and wild customization, the iPhone is way to sleek, sophisticated and user -friendly for you. Software dictates hardware. The IOS blows Android OS away. And, any (anyone who’s actually worked on both will agree) Apple product gets sometimes twice the speed out of less RAM and processing than ANY other OS (Windows or Android). Give me stability anytime. so your phone has an expandable memory? What good is it when it won’t run half the time. Have a nice day all. . .. .after all, they’re just phones. . .. right? 02/19/2017 Richie Reply Some things to add (pros and cons) as a PC & Android guy that just switched to iPhone (but I’m staying on PC): 1) The iOS versions of Microsoft apps are better than the Android ones and they work great. 2) Article is correct: the iOS versions of apps are generally better than their Android counterparts, in ways you will notice. It’s really kind of a shame for Android – I don’t get why they don’t just match the exact app. 3) Lightning is neat but I found MicroUSB more useful, since it’s used for more devices, i.e. I have a MicroUSB running from my desk to my PC to charge my wireless mouse, and then I would also use it to charge my phone sometimes. 4) Yes I do miss customization heaven with Android, but this iPhone runs like total butter. Android runs WELL but this thing is so zippy and responsive – you wouldn’t believe it until you spent time with one. 5) ALSO customization isn’t as cut-off as it used to be with iOS. Some apps can latch onto some functions in the phone, kinda like installing an extension for your desktop browser. It’s something. Really I just bought an iPhone to “try something new” and I’m really liking it. 02/28/2017 Toby Reply Just do a Quick google search iphone is less reliable than Android, theres your Answer in the studies. End of debate… 03/01/2017 Viking Sheep Reply These comparisons are so lame… Eg: Country X is much better than the rest of the world, because the rest of the world have varying standards, while Country X has only 1 level of corruption. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply First: great respect to Steve Jobs who dedicated his life to Apple iPhone invention and to make communication better more joyful between people. Also to feel the power and beauty of technology in your hand. How I wished that Isaac Newton or Ainstein or Nikola Tessa or… would see what we have today… Second: iPhone is far more serious for people who want job to be done as fast and simpler way without delays. Android phones are for kids who like customizations and pretty colors and to look like iron man or similar… Third: iPhone is made of better materials. And looks for business high class. Android phones are copying iPhone’s look especially Samsung. Fourth: iPhone technology, the software and hardware gives you exactly what you need. No more no less. Android technologies gives you extra things which are seldom used and are simply extra using more battery and device performance. Fifth: iPhone has a specific style in design. Keeping updating same style to better one making it each time better and better. Sixth: Applications on iPhone are much better with much less defects than Android. At the end, I had various Samsung, Sony, Huawei, Htc and iPhone phones. I choose iPhone. Now I have iPhone 6s+ black limited edition with golden Apple. It’s very nice piece of equipment. at the bottom line, Apollo 11 travelled to the moon using Fortan on its 360 kb computer. Today we are talking of gigs bytes. So I respect both iPhone and Android technologies for their great effort and progress. Competition shall exist to make difference and better.

Will the Apple model work for Maruti? March 20, 2017 14:36 IST With Nexa, the value-for-money mass-market car maker hopes to attract premium buyers. Sangeeta Tanwar reports. IMAGE: Since the launch of Nexa, Maruti has launched Ciaz, Baleno, S-Cross and Ignis, covering the spectrum from a sedan priced more than ₹8 lakh to a compact car priced at ₹4.59 lakh. Photograph: Anindito Mukherjee/Reuters. Who are Maruti Suzuki's biggest customers? Maruti Suzuki (Maruti), the automaker synonymous with value-for-money mass-market cars, has been making attempts to upscale its imagery by offering buyers "premium car buying experience" through its new-age Nexa showrooms. Since the launch of Nexa in July 2015, Maruti has launched Ciaz, Baleno, S-Cross and Ignis. The launches show that at one end of the spectrum the automaker has Ciaz, a sedan (priced upwards of ₹8 lakh), and on the other it has the compact car Ignis (priced at ₹4.59 lakh). Launched exclusively through Nexa, the two cars are poles apart in terms of positioning and pricing. What does this huge gap in buyer profile and pricing say about brand Maruti's attempt to go premium with launches emerging out of Nexa? Does it amount to diluting Nexa's core brand proposition of delivering a premium customer experience to buyers? The company brushes aside any hint of contradiction or toning down the brand proposition of Nexa. Vinay Pant, assistant vice-president, marketing and sales, Maruti Suzuki India Limited, says, "With Nexa, we aspire to replicate technology brand Apple's business model which commands a premium on a wide range of products at different price points." For example, Apple has an iPad and an iPad Mini, and it also offers a MacBook Air alongside a MacBook. The idea is to cater to mass as well as niche buyers while ensuring that products with Apple's logo are seen as a premium offering by buyers. Similarly, Maruti wants to command a premium on vehicles which have a Nexa imprint. With an aim to maintain its "premium" imagery, Maruti is positioning and pricing each Nexa vehicle launch smartly. For example, Ignis is a compact car but the vehicle is priced at a premium vis-à-vis its competitors. Offering premium features, Ignis is not in competition with Renault's small car Kwid. Maruti vs workers: Lessons from Manesar For Maruti "premiumness" does not necessarily come from the price tag alone. For instance, Ignis is a differentiated product targeted at young first-time car buyers. In the compact segment with a 1.2-litre engine, Ignis offers a five-speed automated manual transmission and the "Smart Play" touch screen infotainment system that boasts Android Auto, Apple CarPlay features that appeal to millennials. The car targets a segment that understands technology and is willing to pay for it. At traditional showrooms, the key consideration for a buyer is a good car package (competitive pricing plus service guarantee) and not the technology. Ignis, as a first-time buy for millennials (who already have a car at home), would not have been appreciated as much had it been launched through traditional Maruti showrooms. Pant explains that the automaker's traditional showrooms, by virtue of their positioning, cater to first-time buyers. About 50 to 60 per cent of customers visiting these showrooms are first-time buyers. In case of Nexa, about 70 per cent of visitors are replacement buyers who have already experienced a car. Nexa visitors would already have an Accord or a Honda car, but now they are on a lookout for a smaller vehicle like Baleno. These are the buyers who have been changing their cars and while upgrading did not consider Maruti as a replacement brand. Nexa, therefore, is looking to change this. With Nexa, the automaker is looking to bring back 55 per cent of buyers who are not returning for their second or third car purchase. Sridhar V, partner, Grant Thornton India LLP, says for companies which have achieved market share the next logical step is a move to increase margins. And for passenger vehicle companies, to focus on distinguishing and attracting a set of customers through premium positioning and branding is not out of place. "When you price it appropriately, the strategy could lead to success. Young customers are aspirational and they look for passenger vehicles with advanced features, something a mature player in the market would not want to miss out on," adds Sridhar V. Why small-car leader Maruti started thinking big Pant believes Maruti faces a unique challenge. Of the top 10 brands in India, eight are from Maruti's stable. And yet, when one talks about premium products, the industry gets back to talking about volumes. According to the automaker, with differences in sales channels, models, reach and size it is unjust to compare Nexa sales with its traditional showroom sales. For example, sales of Swift and DZire combined are to the tune of 30,000 per month. These models are sold through 2,000 outlets across India. By comparison, Nexa is a young network with 200 stores in 121 cities. As of January, the network has sold over 185,000 vehicles. Nexa launches Ciaz and Baleno have done well for Maruti. Baleno is selling an average 10,000 units per month. Nexa, says Pant, "is not about volumes". At present, he adds, Nexa as an initiative is more of an image building exercise, and in due course numbers too would follow. "But Nexa sales cannot compete with a Swift or an Alto -- these cars are first-time buys, and sales numbers will be high. We will need those models because they are what Maruti has built its success on. We will not lose focus there and keep fortifying our position in the mass car market."

Apple announced on Friday to invest 3.5 billion yuan (US$507 million) to establish four research centers in China including one in Shanghai, which will be open "later this year". It was the first time for Apple to establish research facilities in China, its second biggest regional market. "Apple has to adapt strategies to make itself more localized in China when it faces aggressive Android phone rivals here," said Jia Mo, a Shanghai-based analyst of research firm Canalys. Through the new centers, Apple can better handle the competition with local competitors like Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo, said Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates Inc, who called the competition "irritant". In the recent quarters, Apple's revenue in China declined 12 to 16 percent year-on-year, because of tough competition from cheaper local smartphones and macroeconomics weakness. The iPhones can meet the localized specific demand in China, such as enhanced selfie feature and super-powerful battery. It means that Apple is losing innovation advantages compared with other brands, said Canalys' Jia. By the end of 2016, Huawei, Oppo and Vivo took the top three positions in the domestic smartphone market. They have developped high-end models to challenge Samsung and Apple's market positions in the segment. Samsung has developed models specifically for Chinese consumers like enhanced camera for selfie, beauty optimization software and assistant tools for payment and online "Hongbao" (red packet money among family members and friends). Samsung named the models as C series representing designed for China.

"The manual for model 'A1844, which supports both NFC and Bluetooth Low Energy, includes wiring instructions, and in fact says that users have to present the company provided credential to the reader," appleinsider.com reported on Monday. The new 175-acre Apple Park near Cupertino will be open to employees from April, while the construction of buildings and parklands is scheduled to continue through the year, the US tech giant announced earlier this year. In honour of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' memory and his contribution to Apple, and his vision to make Apple Park a centre for creativity and collaboration, the theatre at the campus will be named the Steve Jobs Theatre. Apple Park will include a visitors centre with an Apple Store and cafe open to the public, a 100,000-square-foot fitness centre for Apple employees and development facilities and the Steve Jobs Theatre. The Park has been designed in collaboration with "Foster + Partners" and it replaces five million-square-foot of asphalt and concrete with grassy fields and over 9,000 native and drought-resistant trees, and is powered 100 per cent by renewable energy. In the past few months, Apple has submitted two other wireless devices for FCC approval, identified as A1845 and A1846.

Home Industry Duan Yongping: Secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple in China Duan Yongping: Secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple in China Duan Yongping is convinced Tim Cook didn’t have a clue who he was when they first met a couple years ago. The Apple boss probably does now. By: Bloomberg | Published: March 20, 2017 2:19 PM Duan is the reclusive billionaire who founded Oppo and Vivo, the twin smartphone brands that dealt the world’s largest company a stinging defeat in China last year. (Reuters) Duan Yongping is convinced Tim Cook didn’t have a clue who he was when they first met a couple years ago. The Apple boss probably does now. Duan is the reclusive billionaire who founded Oppo and Vivo, the twin smartphone brands that dealt the world’s largest company a stinging defeat in China last year. Once derided as cheap iPhone knockoffs, they leapfrogged the rankings and shoved Apple Inc. out of the top three in 2016 — when iPhone shipments fell in China for the first time. They managed to do it because the American smartphone giant didn’t adapt to local competition, the entrepreneur told Bloomberg in what he said was his first interview in 10 years. Oppo and Vivo employed tactics Apple was reluctant to match, such as cheaper devices with high-end features, for fear of jeopardizing its winning formula elsewhere, Duan said. “Apple couldn’t beat us in China because even they have flaws,” the 56-year-old electronics mogul said. “They’re maybe too stubborn sometimes. They made a lot of great things, like their operating system, but we surpass them in other areas.” That’s not to say Duan doesn’t appreciate the iPhone maker’s global clout. In fact, the billionaire’s obsession with his U.S. rival is legion: he’s long been a big-time investor in Apple and an unabashed fan of its chief executive officer. “I’ve met Tim Cook on several occasions. He might not know me but we’ve chatted a little,” Duan said. “I like him a lot.” Apple couldn’t confirm Duan’s meeting with Cook when contacted by Bloomberg. But Duan has blogged incessantly about Apple’s products, share price and operations since 2013, when the company was worth half what it is today. He needs “a really big pocket” because he carries four devices, including a heavily-used iPhone. In a 2015 post, he argued Apple’s profit should reach $100 billion within five years. Today, Duan won’t say when he actually bought in but says much of his overseas wealth remains tied up in the iPhone maker. He even lives in Palo Alto, an easy drive from Apple’s new UFO-like headquarters in Cupertino. “Apple is an extraordinary company. It is a model for us to learn from,” Duan said. “We don’t have the concept of surpassing anyone, the focus instead is to improve ourselves.” Oppo’s gains against Apple may now earn an even broader following for the billionaire dubbed China’s Warren Buffett by local media for his investment acumen. Born in Jiangxi, a birthplace of Mao Zedong’s Communist revolution, Duan began his career at a state-run vacuum tube plant before making his name with homegrown electronics. Duan left the factory floor around 1990, when China was just embracing capitalism and opening industries to private investment. He headed to southern China’s Guangdong province, then the cradle of liberal reforms, to run a struggling electronics plant. His first product was the “Subor” gaming console with dual-cartridge slots — a direct shot at Nintendo Co.’s classic Family Computer, known elsewhere as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The 100- to 400-yuan Subor became a hit in the absence of local competitors. Duan even enlisted Kung Fu star Jackie Chan to endorse the device. By 1995, revenue from the Subor exceeded 1 billion yuan. You May Also Want To Watch: Duan left to set up a new business that year as the operation flourished — a pattern he would repeat in later years. He christened his second venture Bubugao, literally “rising higher step-by-step.” BBK, as the company came to be known, created a popular line of VCD and MP3 players but later also made DVD players for global brands. Subsidiary Bubugao Communication Equipment Co. became one of the country’s biggest feature-phone makers around 2000, going head-to-head with Nokia and Motorola. It was the first iPhone in 2007 that paved the way for Oppo and Vivo. While they share a common founder in Duan, the sister brands are fierce competitors, trotting out dueling marketing campaigns in markets from India to Southeast Asia. Their salesmanship philosophy plays well in emerging markets, IDC research manager Kiranjeet Kaur said. “The companies fully understand how to make the best of their people, a specialty they inherited from Duan,” said Nicole Peng, a senior director at Canalys. Importantly, they understood their millennial audience. “Many of their managers are young and have been working at the company since graduation.” Duan’s latest endeavors were, in part, dreamed up in Apple’s backyard. By 2001 at the age of 40, Duan had decided to move to California to focus on investment and philanthropy, later installing his family in a mansion he reportedly bought from Cisco Systems Inc. Chairman John Chambers. But the advent of the smartphone forced the entrepreneur out of retirement. By the second half of 2000s, BBK was on the verge of falling apart as sales of its basic devices slowed. The likes of Huawei and Coolpad were making smartphones priced at around 1,000 yuan. That nearly put the company under, Duan recalled. “We were in serious discussions about how to close the company peacefully — in a way that the employees can leave unhurt and suppliers don’t lose money,” he said. Those intense brainstorming sessions spawned the two businesses that would go on to embody Duan’s greatest success. In 2005, the entrepreneur and his protege Tony Chen decided to create a new company. Dubbed Oppo, it sold music players but ramped up to smartphones in 2011. In 2009, BBK itself created Vivo, headed by another of Duan’s disciples, Shen Wei. “Making mobile phones was not my call,” said Duan. “But I reckoned we could do well in this market.” At first, neither label garnered much attention. The iPhone was captivating users with its revolutionary apps system and elegant interface, while BlackBerrys lorded over the corporate market. But Oppo and Vivo then developed a marketing-blitz approach that relied on local celebrity endorsement and a vast re-sellers’ store network across China. They crafted an affordable image that appealed to a millennial crowd, then tricked out their devices with high-end specs. On the surface, Oppo and Vivo phones now routinely surpass the iPhone on measures such as charging speeds, memory and battery life. It paid off. The duo together shipped more than 147 million smartphones in China in 2016, dwarfing Huawei Technologies Co.’s 76.6 million units, Apple’s 44.9 million and Xiaomi’s 41.5 million, IDC estimates. Oppo and Vivo both doubled their 2015 haul. In the fourth quarter, they were No. 1 and No. 3, respectively — Huawei was second. Their approach worked particularly well in lower-tier cities, where mid-range phones became a mainstream hit, said Tay Xiaohan, an IDC analyst. Duan’s smartphone progeny are also gaining some momentum beyond their home turf. In the fourth quarter, Oppo and Vivo were fourth and fifth in the world, respectively. About a quarter of Oppo’s shipments went to markets like India, where it hopes to dig in before Apple establishes a meaningful presence. Duan also owns a “small amount” of Alphabet Inc., whose Android operating software runs Oppo and Vivo devices as it does the majority of the world’s smartphones. “Smartphones are an unprecedented opportunity. We forecast at least for the next 10 or 20 years, there’s no replacement. But we don’t know,” Duan said. Cook said on the weekend that Apple doesn’t have a specific goal for market share. “The competition is more fierce in China — not only in this industry, but in many industries,” Cook told the China Development Forum in Beijing. “I think that’s a credit to a number of local companies that put their energies into making good products.” Duan has increasingly kept his distance from the Chinese smartphone makers despite remaining a significant shareholder (he won’t say how much). He says he prefers to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy California with his journalist wife and kids. In fact, he attends board meetings but claims to get most of his information on Oppo and Vivo from the internet, to avoid “disturbing them.” His rivals have been less considerate. Last October, Xiaomi Corp. co-founder Lei Jun lambasted competitors who build dense store channels in rural areas in pursuit of quick sales. In an interview with China Entrepreneurs Magazine in October, Lei accused such players of using “imbalanced information” to trick buyers into shunning Xiaomi, precipitating its decline from the top spot. “Those who said this were insane,” Duan said without naming names. “When someone talks about an information imbalance, deep down they believe consumers are idiots.” His most visible passion these days is stock investment, which is why he agreed to pay a then-record $620,100 in 2006 to lunch with Buffett. Quotes from the Sage of Omaha still pepper Duan’s blogposts, right alongside tips on golf and Apple. Duan cemented his reputation as a savvy financier in part by digging his friend, Netease Inc. founder William Ding, out of a hole. Ding’s internet company tanked to as low as 13 cents after the dot-com bubble burst, then almost became the first U.S.-listed Chinese company to get tossed off the Nasdaq over an auditing issue. Duan came to his friend’s aid, buying about 5 percent of Netease with just $2 million in 2002, when the stock price averaged 16 cents. Company filings show he still held just over 4 million shares as of March 2009, but Duan said he sold much of that when Netease hit $40. His other much-studied holding is premium-liquor company Kweichow Moutai Co. He said he bought in at 180 yuan in late 2012. While it nearly halved in 2014, Moutai today trades above 370 yuan. Duan isn’t shy about talking up his trades, not least of which is Apple, which remains near a record high despite a rare sales decline in 2016. But looking back on his decades as first entrepreneur then stock-picker, his proudest moments remain rooted in BBK. Though he claims to keep it at arm’s length, he admits to worrying about succession and whether the company culture will survive another generation of leaders. Management has tossed around the idea of an initial public offering but that wasn’t an urgent consideration, Duan said. And while BBK’s Vivo and Duan’s own Oppo have done well, there’s no certainty in a fast-moving business. Both are starting to ramp up everything from the features on their phones to marketing campaigns: Oppo notably used Barcelona’s Mobile World Congress to unveil its most advanced camera technology yet, signaling a new maturity. One thing’s for sure, Duan doesn’t see himself returning to an active executive, leaving others to deal with the next challenge. “I’ve made it clear many years ago, I will never make a comeback,” he said. “If there’s a problem they can’t fix, then neither can I.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

Publishing a post entitled “Joining Apple” to his personal blog, the researcher writes: “I’m pleased to announce that I’ve accepted a position with Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture team, and am very excited to be working with a group of like minded individuals so passionate about protecting the security and privacy of others.” Zdziarski says that the decision to join the Californian firm marks the conclusion of what he feels has been a personal “matter of conscience.” “Privacy is sacred; our digital lives can reveal so much about us – our interests, our deepest thoughts, and even who we love,” the security researcher says. “I am thrilled to be working with such an exceptional group of people who share a passion to protect that,” he concludes. Exactly what Zdziarski will be doing over in Cupertino, wasn’t shared. But given Zdziarski’s background in analysing the effectiveness of solutions built of the purpose of mobile security, (and in doing so uncovering what is widely considered to be the first major backdoor in iOS)… it can only be a good thing that he is going to be on Apple’s side, going forward. Especially as the debate over whether it’s morally right -or even possible- to systematically unlock an iOS device, bypassing all in-built protection methods such as “Touch ID” and the device’s passcode option, continues to rage on … Continue Reading You may also like...

And while BBK’s Vivo and Duan’s own Oppo have done well, there’s no certainty in a fast-moving business. Both are starting to ramp up everything from the features on their phones to marketing campaigns: Oppo notably used Barcelona’s Mobile World Congress to unveil its most advanced camera technology yet, signaling a new maturity. One thing’s for sure, Duan doesn’t see himself returning to an active executive, leaving others to deal with the next challenge. “I’ve made it clear many years ago, I will never make a comeback,” he said. “If there’s a problem they can’t fix, then neither can I.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Bank Negara sees economy, exports growing faster in 2017 Jack Ma optimistic about introducing Alipay e-wallet service in Malaysia S.Korea throws shipbuilder Daewoo new US$6b lifeline Bursa Malaysia remains above 1,750 at mid-afteroon Ringgit to stabilise gradually, no more large outflow Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 China capital controls leave buyers of foreign property in bind (VIDEO) Jack Ma to launch Alibaba’s regional distribution hub in Malaysia, sources say Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple in China Apple CEO Tim Cook calls for more global trade with China Apple plans two more Chinese research hubs as iPhone sales slow (VIDEO) Wikileaks says it has CIA spy tools as McCain cites dangers (VIDEO) Tech breakthroughs take a backseat in upcoming Apple iPhone launch (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     New 2017 IMac To Challenge Microsoft's Surface Studio? Posted: Mar 20 2017, 5:05am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Mar 21 2017, 9:43am CDT, in News | Apple   This is not the 2017 iMac - it's the Microsoft Surface Studio   A new iMac is overdue. Apple is expected to release the 2017 iMac. I am writing this story on a mid-2011 27" iMac 3.4Ghz Core i7 w/ SSD. Soon this  iMac will be old enough to go to school. My urge to get a new iMac has died when I upgraded the RAM to 32GB. This dated computer is responsive and great to work with. Don't Miss: MWC 2017 Highlights I will only get tempted to get a new iMac if it is incredible. The last time Apple has updated the iMac was in 2015. Apple will release a new iMac in 2017 - at least this is what Apple pundits say. There is not a single evidence that this is going to happen. Apple is under fire for neglecting the desktop. Microsoft used Apple's moment of weakness in a perfect way. The Surface Studio makes the iMac look like ancient technology. The new 2017 iMac needs to be innovative in design and functionality to counter strike. The full configured Surface Studio is $800 more expense than the most expensive iMac. This alone is a defeat for Apple. Microsoft makes more expensive computer than Apple. Who would have thought that we come to this? What I want to the most in a 2017 iMac is a largest screen. I don't feel that 27-inch is enough. I want 5K or 8K resolution on a screen that is at least 30 inches. I want more space on the screen to have browse windows arranged next to each other. Dell has unveiled a 32-inch 8K monitor at the CES 2017 with the Dell UltraSharp UP3218K 8K monitor. If Dell can, Apple can. With a bigger screen, I also would like to see an ability to adjust the stand to move the screen up and down. The tilt function is not enough to optimize for desk ergonomics. I am not sure if I need touch capability, like the Surface Studio offers for my line of work.  The performance of the 2017 iMac needs to be strong enough to allow for responsive user interface. No lag between switching desktops and launching apps. I don't care how Apple achieves this and what kind of chips are in the new iMac. When will Apple release the 2017 iMac? At this point it is just guessing. April is a possibility for Apple's first event in 2017. Another option is the WWDC 2017, kicking off on June 5. Update: Apple unveiled a bunch of new products including a new iPad and iPhone SE on March 21.

"Financial services ultimately is an industry that's built on trust and if you think about the next generation that's coming through, certainly when I think about my kids, the brands they trust - Apple, Google - it's the technology brands," Mr Byres said on Monday. "They wouldn't have a clue about the four major banks that we have here ... (and) as far as my kids are concerned, they have accounts with Apple so we're not actually that far away." A KPMG report released last week suggested 84 per cent of millennials would consider banking with a tech giant if they offered a better product or deal than a traditional bank, and Mr Byres said there was little to prevent more competition. Apple already offers Apple Pay - which allows iPhone users to use their device like a contactless credit or debit card - in more than a dozen countries, including through ANZ, Macquarie, MyState and others in Australia. There could be scope within current regulations for the Cupertino-based giant to issue credit cards, mortgages and small business lending should it so choose. "At this point they're playing in particular places - particularly focused on the payments space rather than seeking to be a broader financial services offering - and I think the system in the way it's set up can accommodate that, but its not hugely difficult to envisage them offering a range of other services and that will test the regulatory model," Mr Byers said at the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's annual forum in Sydney. "You can do anything in this country without an APRA licence except for one thing and that's take a deposit." ASIC chairman Greg Medcraft said he expects Apple, Google or Amazon to target areas they see as undeserved, as Chinese retail giant Alibaba has done with small business lending. "What puts the fear into the heart of banks is the prospect of Amazon in particular. I think they're coming," Mr Medcraft said. "Amazon might buy one of the banks, who knows?"

Home Industry Technology Apple iPhone SE available at Rs 19,999; here’s how to buy and other details Apple iPhone SE available at Rs 19,999; here’s how to buy and other details Apple seems to have slashed the price of the popular iPhone SE in India as the 16GB model of the smartphone is now reportedly available at the price of Rs 19,999. By: FE Online | Published: March 20, 2017 1:01 PM Apple had announced the iPhone SE smartphone around the same time last year, but it came to India in early April. Apple iPhone SE is almost like the iPhone 6s in a 4-inch body, and some features missing.(Representative Image: Reuters) Tech major, Apple seems to have slashed the price of the popular iPhone SE in India as the 16GB model of the smartphone is now reportedly available at the price of Rs 19,999. Meanwhile, under new rates, the 64GB variant of iPhone SE is available for only Rs 25,999. Under the new offer, consumers are being offered Rs 5,000 as cashback when the iPhone SE is purchased using a bank debit or credit card. The price cut information was first unveiled bu a retailer from Kerela “@itnetinfocom (via Tech PP)” while Gadgets 360 later confirmed the report about the offers. The new cashback deal on the iPhone SE was initially available on March 17 and will continue to do so, reportedly till March 31. Most notably, the cash back offer of Rs 5,000 is applicable on bank credit cards and debit cards only. The banks whose cards are being accepted, are Axis Bank, Citibank, HDFC Bank, HSBC, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Kotak, RBL Bank, SBI, Standard Chartered, UBI, and Yes Bank. Consumers should also know that the offer of Rs 5,000 cashback is not available for American Express debit cards. However, Apple has not issued any official statement about such offers on iPhones. Apple’s official online e-tail partners, Flipkart and Infibeam have also not posted any information about such an offer on their platform and have the previous pricing in the list. You may also like to watch: According to the new deal, the terms and conditions are such that the cashback will be credited to the bank account of the user, on or before 90 days of buying the smartphone. However, there is a catch. You may not be able to go for the cashback option if you buy the Apple iPhone SE on EMI using debit and credit card. Apple seems to be challenging the mid segment now, by making its older iPhones more affordable. This could also indicate that the company might be trying to bring out a brand new version of the iPhone this year. Earlier the iPhone SE (16GB) was sold at Rs 29,990, while the iPhone SE (16GB) came with a price tag of Rs 36,000. You may also like to watch: Apple has been slicing down the prices of its iPhones continually for some time. Apple had announced the iPhone SE smartphone around the same time last year, but it came to India in early April. Apple iPhone SE is almost like the iPhone 6s in a 4-inch body, and some features missing. With the smaller and cheaper variant getting a further price cut, Apple must be expecting a huge market in India. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 20 March 2017 | MYT 2:30 PM Secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple in China Giant-slayers: Oppo mobile phones on display at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Oppo’s gains against Apple may now earn an even broader following for the billionaire dubbed China’s Warren Buffett by local media for his investment acumen. — AFP Duan Yongping is convinced Tim Cook didn’t have a clue who he was when they first met a couple years ago. The Apple boss probably does now.  Duan is the reclusive billionaire who founded Oppo and Vivo, the twin smartphone brands that dealt the world’s largest company a stinging defeat in China last year. Once derided as cheap iPhone knockoffs, they leapfrogged the rankings and shoved Apple Inc out of the top three in 2016 – when iPhone shipments fell in China for the first time.  They managed to do it because the American smartphone giant didn’t adapt to local competition, the entrepreneur told Bloomberg in what he said was his first interview in 10 years. Oppo and Vivo employed tactics Apple was reluctant to match, such as cheaper devices with high-end features, for fear of jeopardising its winning formula elsewhere, Duan said.  “Apple couldn’t beat us in China because even they have flaws,” the 56-year-old electronics mogul said. “They’re maybe too stubborn sometimes. They made a lot of great things, like their operating system, but we surpass them in other areas.”  That’s not to say Duan doesn’t appreciate the iPhone maker’s global clout. In fact, the billionaire’s obsession with his US rival is legion: he’s long been a big-time investor in Apple and an unabashed fan of its chief executive officer.  “I’ve met Tim Cook on several occasions. He might not know me but we’ve chatted a little,” Duan said. “I like him a lot.”  Apple couldn’t confirm Duan’s meeting with Cook when contacted by Bloomberg. But Duan has blogged incessantly about Apple’s products, share price and operations since 2013, when the company was worth half what it is today. He needs “a really big pocket” because he carries four devices, including a heavily-used iPhone. In a 2015 post, he argued Apple’s profit should reach US$100bil (RM443bil) within five years. Today, Duan won’t say when he actually bought in but says much of his overseas wealth remains tied up in the iPhone maker. He even lives in Palo Alto, an easy drive from Apple’s new UFO-like headquarters in Cupertino.  “Apple is an extraordinary company. It is a model for us to learn from,” Duan said. “We don’t have the concept of surpassing anyone, the focus instead is to improve ourselves.”  Oppo’s gains against Apple may now earn an even broader following for the billionaire dubbed China’s Warren Buffett by local media for his investment acumen. Born in Jiangxi, a birthplace of Mao Zedong’s Communist revolution, Duan began his career at a state-run vacuum tube plant before making his name with homegrown electronics.  Duan left the factory floor around 1990, when China was just embracing capitalism and opening industries to private investment. He headed to southern China’s Guangdong province, then the cradle of liberal reforms, to run a struggling electronics plant. His first product was the “Subor” gaming console with dual-cartridge slots – a direct shot at Nintendo Co’s classic Family Computer, known elsewhere as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The 100- to 400-yuan (RM65 to RM256) Subor became a hit in the absence of local competitors. Duan even enlisted Kung Fu star Jackie Chan to endorse the device. By 1995, revenue from the Subor exceeded 1bil yuan (RM642mil).  Duan left to set up a new business that year as the operation flourished – a pattern he would repeat in later years. He christened his second venture Bubugao, literally “rising higher step-by-step.” BBK, as the company came to be known, created a popular line of VCD and MP3 players but later also made DVD players for global brands. Subsidiary Bubugao Communication Equipment Co became one of the country’s biggest feature-phone makers around 2000, going head-to-head with Nokia and Motorola.  It was the first iPhone in 2007 that paved the way for Oppo and Vivo. While they share a common founder in Duan, the sister brands are fierce competitors, trotting out duelling marketing campaigns in markets from India to South-East Asia. Their salesmanship philosophy plays well in emerging markets, IDC research manager Kiranjeet Kaur said.  “The companies fully understand how to make the best of their people, a specialty they inherited from Duan,” said Nicole Peng, a senior director at Canalys. Importantly, they understood their millennial audience. “Many of their managers are young and have been working at the company since graduation.”  Duan’s latest endeavours were, in part, dreamed up in Apple’s backyard. By 2001 at the age of 40, Duan had decided to move to California to focus on investment and philanthropy, later installing his family in a mansion he reportedly bought from Cisco Systems Inc chairman John Chambers. But the advent of the smartphone forced the entrepreneur out of retirement.  By the second half of 2000s, BBK was on the verge of falling apart as sales of its basic devices slowed. The likes of Huawei and Coolpad were making smartphones priced at around 1,000 yuan (RM642). That nearly put the company under, Duan recalled.  “We were in serious discussions about how to close the company peacefully – in a way that the employees can leave unhurt and suppliers don’t lose money,” he said.  Those intense brainstorming sessions spawned the two businesses that would go on to embody Duan’s greatest success. In 2005, the entrepreneur and his protégé Tony Chen decided to create a new company. Dubbed Oppo, it sold music players but ramped up to smartphones in 2011. In 2009, BBK itself created Vivo, headed by another of Duan’s disciples, Shen Wei.  “Making mobile phones was not my call,” said Duan. “But I reckoned we could do well in this market.”  At first, neither label garnered much attention. The iPhone was captivating users with its revolutionary apps system and elegant interface, while BlackBerrys lorded over the corporate market. But Oppo and Vivo then developed a marketing-blitz approach that relied on local celebrity endorsement and a vast re-sellers’ store network across China. They crafted an affordable image that appealed to a millennial crowd, then tricked out their devices with high-end specs. On the surface, Oppo and Vivo phones now routinely surpass the iPhone on measures such as charging speeds, memory and battery life.  It paid off. The duo together shipped more than 147 million smartphones in China in 2016, dwarfing Huawei Technologies Co’s 76.6 million units, Apple’s 44.9 million and Xiaomi’s 41.5 million, IDC estimates. Oppo and Vivo both doubled their 2015 haul. In the fourth quarter, they were No 1 and No 3, respectively – Huawei was second. Their approach worked particularly well in lower-tier cities, where mid-range phones became a mainstream hit, said Tay Xiaohan, an IDC analyst.   Duan’s smartphone progeny are also gaining some momentum beyond their home turf. In the fourth quarter, Oppo and Vivo were fourth and fifth in the world, respectively. About a quarter of Oppo’s shipments went to markets like India, where it hopes to dig in before Apple establishes a meaningful presence.  “Smartphones are an unprecedented opportunity. We forecast at least for the next 10 or 20 years, there’s no replacement. But we don’t know,” Duan said.  Cook said on the weekend that Apple doesn’t have a specific goal for market share.  “The competition is more fierce in China – not only in this industry, but in many industries,” Cook told the China Development Forum in Beijing. “I think that’s a credit to a number of local companies that put their energies into making good products.”  Duan has increasingly kept his distance from the Chinese smartphone makers despite remaining a significant shareholder (he won’t say how much). He says he prefers to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy California with his journalist wife and kids. In fact, he attends board meetings but claims to get most of his information on Oppo and Vivo from the Internet, to avoid “disturbing them.”  His rivals have been less considerate. Last October, Xiaomi Corp co-founder Lei Jun lambasted competitors who build dense store channels in rural areas in pursuit of quick sales. In an interview with China Entrepreneurs Magazine in October, Lei accused such players of using “imbalanced information” to trick buyers into shunning Xiaomi, precipitating its decline from the top spot.  “Those who said this were insane,” Duan said without naming names. “When someone talks about an information imbalance, deep down they believe consumers are idiots.”  His most visible passion these days is stock investment, which is why he agreed to pay a then-record US$620,100 (RM2.74mil) in 2006 to lunch with Buffett. Quotes from the Sage of Omaha still pepper Duan’s blogposts, right alongside tips on golf and Apple.  Duan cemented his reputation as a savvy financier in part by digging his friend, Netease Inc founder William Ding, out of a hole. Ding’s Internet company tanked to as low as 13 cents after the dot-com bubble burst, then almost became the first US-listed Chinese company to get tossed off the Nasdaq over an auditing issue.  Duan came to his friend’s aid, buying about 5% of Netease with just US$2mil (RM8.85mil) in 2002, when the stock price averaged 16 cents. Company filings show he still held just over 4 million shares as of March 2009, but Duan said he sold much of that when Netease hit US$40 (RM177).  His other much-studied holding is premium-liquor company Kweichow Moutai Co. He said he bought in at 180 yuan (RM115) in late 2012. While it nearly halved in 2014, Moutai today trades above 370 yuan (RM237).  Duan isn’t shy about talking up his trades, not least of which is Apple, which remains near a record high despite a rare sales decline in 2016. But looking back on his decades as first entrepreneur then stock-picker, his proudest moments remain rooted in BBK. Though he claims to keep it at arm’s length, he admits to worrying about succession and whether the company culture will survive another generation of leaders.   And while BBK’s Vivo and Duan’s own Oppo have done well, there’s no certainty in a fast-moving business. Both are starting to ramp up everything from the features on their phones to marketing campaigns: Oppo notably used Barcelona’s Mobile World Congress to unveil its most advanced camera technology yet, signalling a new maturity.  One thing’s for sure, Duan doesn’t see himself returning to an active executive, leaving others to deal with the next challenge.  “I’ve made it clear many years ago, I will never make a comeback,” he said. “If there’s a problem they can’t fix, then neither can I.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Three ways to protect social media accounts from pirates and hackers Geely pulls out of buying Malaysia’s Proton, as its profits surge by 126% Maybank and CIMB to enable Alipay mobile wallet in Malaysia Doctors no different from soldiers Staying connected through social media Is technology ruining your relationship?

(Reuters/Stephen Lam/Files) Apple Inc.s Chief Executive Tim Cook defended globalisation in a rare public speech in China, as his company faces political pressure in the US to bring back factories. Don't miss: iPhone SE Available for Rs 19,000: All You Want to Know Cook also said data privacy was one of the company's values, although he stopped short on Saturday of criticising decryption demands from governments as Apple has previously in the US, reported the Wall Street Journal.

Also read: Facebook Likely to Showcase its Hardware Products in April During his speech, Cook said globalisation "in general is great for the world," but noted socio-economic gains may not be evenly distributed within or between countries. Despite globalisation's shortcomings, countries should not shy away from such development, he said. "I think the worst thing would be to, because it didn't help everyone, is to say it's bad and do less of that," Cook said. "I think the reality is you can see that countries in the world...that isolate themselves, it's not good for their people." The subject is a contentious one for Apple, a US company that farms out a bulk of its manufacturing operations to China. President Donald Trump recently called for Apple to bring iPhone production to America, a move that would stimulate the domestic economy. Trump has asked the same of many US multinationals in attempts to repatriate overseas jobs, said the report. Cook also touched on cyber-security and user privacy, both highly sensitive subjects in China. Parroting past statements on the matter, Cook said Apple employs end-to-end encryption to protect its customers from nefarious actors. He fell short of taking a stand against Chinese cyber-security policy that requires companies to furnish authorities with technical assistance in investigations and data gathering operations, reported the Journal. Cook tiptoed around the subject of data privacy, saying, "We think that an individual should own their data and should be able to control their data." He is in China to bolster relations with the country's central government. Apple's top executive is slated to speak with Xu Lin, director of the Cyberspace Administration of China, in a private meeting on Monday. Cook also said that Apple Inc will be setting up two more research and development (R&D) centres in Shanghai and Suzhou, following Beijing and Shenzhen. apple ceo globalisation Tim Cook First Published: March 20, 2017, 12:02 PM IST Read full article Next Story Recommended For You 2017 Nissan Terrano Facelift to Launch in India on March 27 3 Reasons to Not Buy a Term Plan Xiaomi Redmi 4A Review: An Affordable Redmi 3S Facelift India Isn't Comfortable With Women Who Are Unapologetic About Their Sexuality: Swara Bhaskar Alia-Sidharth, Sonakshi-Bunty and Others Attend Anushka's Phillauri Special Screening About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News 34 Indian Scientists to Meet Nobel Laureates in Germany Maruti Suzuki Ignis Review: Is It The Car For You?

This makes sense too, as last year the iPad Pro 9.7-inch was introduced on 21 March. According to the publication, the rumoured launch comes from reputable supply chain analysts and a possibility of an early April event is also on the cards. According to a report in Inquisitr, the Apple iPad Pro 2 is set to launch soon, in not one, but four different variants. Online speculations hint at display sizes such as 9.7-inch, 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch for the iPad Pro 2. International media hasn’t received any invite to any Apple event yet, so an exact date is not known. So this may mean that the event is scheduled in April, as there is at least a 10-day gap between the invite-sent date and an Apple event. Inquisitr even hints that the iPad Pro 2 launch could happen via just a press release and not an actual event. 9To5Mac hints that the 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 model will come with an improved skin with True Tone technology. This technology basically gives the iPad the smarts to automatically adjust its colour temperature based on the surroundings. This variant of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is expected to sport the same Apple A9X chipset as the iPad Air 2. The Apple iPad Pro 2 with the 10.5-inch display will be something new, as it is a display size that Apple hasn’t sold before. According to 9To5Mac, the 10.5-inch model will have extremely thin bezels, which means that it will have the same footprint as that of the 9.7-inch model, but with a much larger display real estate. It is also expected to come with a virtual Home button. It will also come with an LCD panel and not an OLED panel as was previously rumoured. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro is expected to be housing an Apple A10X chipset, which is an improved variant of the A10 chipset seen in the iPhone 7. The regular upgrade to the iPad Pro in the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch display sizes are expected to sport the same Apple A10X chipset as the 10.5-inch variant. As usual both these models will support the Apple Pencil Stylus as well. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 is most likely going to get the 12MP rear camera as well as True Tone technology which is present in the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro model. All these are speculations, so we will have to wait till Apple announces actual event dates.

"The manual for model 'A1844, which supports both NFC and Bluetooth Low Energy, includes wiring instructions, and in fact says that users have to present the company provided credential to the reader," appleinsider.com reported on Monday. The new 175-acre Apple Park near Cupertino will be open to employees from April, while the construction of buildings and parklands is scheduled to continue through the year, the US tech giant announced earlier this year. In honour of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' memory and his contribution to Apple, and his vision to make Apple Park a centre for creativity and collaboration, the theatre at the campus will be named the Steve Jobs Theatre. Apple Park will include a visitors centre with an Apple Store and cafe open to the public, a 100,000-square-foot fitness centre for Apple employees and development facilities and the Steve Jobs Theatre. The Park has been designed in collaboration with "Foster + Partners" and it replaces five million-square-foot of asphalt and concrete with grassy fields and over 9,000 native and drought-resistant trees, and is powered 100 per cent by renewable energy. In the past few months, Apple has submitted two other wireless devices for FCC approval, identified as A1845 and A1846. --IANS anuj/sm/vt SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Modi's Yogi Adityanath pick baffles the political pundits Goa assembly elections 2017: Winners Punjab Assembly Polls: Prominent winners and losers Early Holi for BJP after historic victory in UP Cartoon: BJP sweeps UP About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2017.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 20 March 2017 | MYT 1:29 PM Tim Cook says Apple not aiming for specific China market share No fixed target: China has unique characteristics, in that its mobile payment market is well ahead of the US and local consumers have a greater willingness to change habits, Cook said at a panel discussion at the China Development Forum in Beijing. — Reuters Apple Inc doesn’t have a specific goal for market share in China, where it faces the fiercest local competition anywhere, chief executive officer Tim Cook said.  China has unique characteristics, in that its mobile payment market is well ahead of the US and local consumers have a greater willingness to change habits, Cook said at a panel discussion at the China Development Forum in Beijing. He added that Apple’s new research and development centres in the country should help the company reach China’s university community.  Cook’s comments come after Apple on Friday revealed plans to set up two more research centres, on top of two announced previously, and boost investment in China, Apple’s single largest overseas market.   Apple is facing a growing challenge from local smartphone brands Oppo and Huawei, which have been grabbing market share and squeezing Apple and Samsung Electronics Co since Xiaomi Corp came on the scene around 2011.  Including Vivo, Chinese vendors held the top three slots and accounted for 48% of shipments in the country during 2016, according to the estimates of research firm IDC. With a lineup of flexible- and curved-screen devices, they’re aiming to dominate the market in 2017.  A decline in Apple shipments in the fourth quarter has highlighted how the iPhone 7 failed to make a big splash in China.  Cook said at the panel that China should open further to foreign investment, adding that globalisation has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty across the globe, even if the benefits have been uneven in many countries. He said that Apple’s innovation can drive job creation in China, and that app development for Apple already supports almost two million jobs in the country. — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Analyst Reports , Technology Related Stories You May Be Interested Three ways to protect social media accounts from pirates and hackers Geely pulls out of buying Malaysia’s Proton, as its profits surge by 126% Maybank and CIMB to enable Alipay mobile wallet in Malaysia Doctors no different from soldiers Staying connected through social media Is technology ruining your relationship?

The Apple boss probably does now. Added by Agency Staff on 20 March 2017. Saved under Editor's pick Tags: Apple, Duan Yongping, Huawei, OPPO, Tim Cook, Vivo, Xiaomi Tweet Duan Yongping Duan Yongping is convinced Tim Cook didn’t have a clue who he was when they first met a couple years ago. The Apple boss probably does now. Duan is the reclusive billionaire who founded Oppo and Vivo, the twin smartphone brands that dealt the world’s largest company a stinging defeat in China last year. Once derided as cheap iPhone knockoffs, they leapfrogged the rankings and shoved Apple out of the top three in 2016 — when iPhone shipments fell in China for the first time. They managed to do it because the American smartphone giant didn’t adapt to local competition, the entrepreneur told Bloomberg in what he said was his first interview in 10 years. Oppo and Vivo employed tactics Apple was reluctant to match, such as cheaper devices with high-end features, for fear of jeopardising its winning formula elsewhere, Duan said. “Apple couldn’t beat us in China because even they have flaws,” the 56-year-old electronics mogul said. “They’re maybe too stubborn sometimes. They made a lot of great things, like their operating system, but we surpass them in other areas.” That’s not to say Duan doesn’t appreciate the iPhone maker’s global clout. In fact, the billionaire’s obsession with his US rival is legion: he’s long been a big-time investor in Apple and an unabashed fan of its CEO. “I’ve met Tim Cook on several occasions. He might not know me but we’ve chatted a little,” Duan said. “I like him a lot.” When contacted for comment, Apple couldn’t confirm Duan’s meeting with Cook. But Duan has blogged incessantly about Apple’s products, share price and operations since 2013, when the company was worth half what it is today. He needs “a really big pocket” because he carries four devices, including a heavily-used iPhone. In a 2015 post, he argued Apple’s profit should reach US$100bn within five years. Today, Duan won’t say when he actually bought in but says much of his overseas wealth remains tied up in the iPhone maker. He even lives in Palo Alto, an easy drive from Apple’s new UFO-like headquarters in Cupertino. “Apple is an extraordinary company. It is a model for us to learn from,” Duan said. “We don’t have the concept of surpassing anyone, the focus instead is to improve ourselves.” Oppo’s gains against Apple may now earn an even broader following for the billionaire dubbed China’s Warren Buffett by local media for his investment acumen. Born in Jiangxi, a birthplace of Mao Zedong’s communist revolution, Duan began his career at a state-run vacuum tube plant before making his name with homegrown electronics. Apple CEO Tim Cook Duan left the factory floor around 1990, when China was just embracing capitalism and opening industries to private investment. He headed to southern China’s Guangdong province, then the cradle of liberal reforms, to run a struggling electronics plant. His first product was the “Subor” gaming console with dual-cartridge slots — a direct shot at Nintendo’s classic Family Computer, known elsewhere as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The 100- to 400-yuan Subor became a hit in the absence of local competitors. Duan even enlisted Kung Fu star Jackie Chan to endorse the device. By 1995, revenue from the Subor exceeded a billion yuan. Duan left to set up a new business that year as the operation flourished — a pattern he would repeat in later years. He christened his second venture Bubugao, literally “rising higher step by step”. BBK, as the company came to be known, created a popular line of VCD and MP3 players but later also made DVD players for global brands. Subsidiary Bubugao Communication Equipment Co became one of the country’s biggest feature-phone makers around 2000, going head-to-head with Nokia and Motorola. It was the first iPhone in 2007 that paved the way for Oppo and Vivo. While they share a common founder in Duan, the sister brands are fierce competitors, trotting out duelling marketing campaigns in markets from India to Southeast Asia. Their salesmanship philosophy plays well in emerging markets, IDC research manager Kiranjeet Kaur said. “The companies fully understand how to make the best of their people, a specialty they inherited from Duan,” said Nicole Peng, a senior director at Canalys. Importantly, they understood their millennial audience. “Many of their managers are young and have been working at the company since graduation.” Duan’s latest endeavours were, in part, dreamed up in Apple’s backyard. By 2001 at the age of 40, Duan had decided to move to California to focus on investment and philanthropy, later installing his family in a mansion he reportedly bought from Cisco chairman John Chambers. But the advent of the smartphone forced the entrepreneur out of retirement. By the second half of 2000s, BBK was on the verge of falling apart as sales of its basic devices slowed. The likes of Huawei and Coolpad were making smartphones priced at around 1 000 yuan. That nearly put the company under, Duan recalled. “We were in serious discussions about how to close the company peacefully — in a way that the employees can leave unhurt and suppliers don’t lose money,” he said. Those intense brainstorming sessions spawned the two businesses that would go on to embody Duan’s greatest success. In 2005, the entrepreneur and his protege Tony Chen decided to create a new company. Dubbed Oppo, it sold music players but ramped up to smartphones in 2011. In 2009, BBK itself created Vivo, headed by another of Duan’s disciples, Shen Wei. “Making mobile phones was not my call,” said Duan. “But I reckoned we could do well in this market.” Oppo is one of China’s biggest smartphone brands At first, neither label garnered much attention. The iPhone was captivating users with its revolutionary apps system and elegant interface, while BlackBerrys lorded over the corporate market. But Oppo and Vivo then developed a marketing-blitz approach that relied on local celebrity endorsement and a vast re-sellers’ store network across China. They crafted an affordable image that appealed to a millennial crowd, then tricked out their devices with high-end specs. On the surface, Oppo and Vivo phones now routinely surpass the iPhone on measures such as charging speeds, memory and battery life. It paid off. The duo together shipped more than 147m smartphones in China in 2016, dwarfing Huawei’s 76,6m units, Apple’s 44,9m and Xiaomi’s 41,5m, IDC estimates. Oppo and Vivo both doubled their 2015 haul. In the fourth quarter, they were number 1 and number 3 respectively — Huawei was second. Their approach worked particularly well in lower-tier cities, where midrange phones became a mainstream hit, said Tay Xiaohan, an IDC analyst. Duan’s smartphone progeny are also gaining some momentum beyond their home turf. In the fourth quarter, Oppo and Vivo were fourth and fifth in the world respectively. About a quarter of Oppo’s shipments went to markets like India, where it hopes to dig in before Apple establishes a meaningful presence. “Smartphones are an unprecedented opportunity. We forecast at least for the next 10 or 20 years, there’s no replacement. But we don’t know,” Duan said. Cook said on the weekend that Apple doesn’t have a specific goal for market share. “The competition is more fierce in China — not only in this industry, but in many industries,” Cook told the China Development Forum in Beijing. “I think that’s a credit to a number of local companies that put their energies into making good products.” Duan has increasingly kept his distance from the Chinese smartphone makers despite remaining a significant shareholder (he won’t say how much). He says he prefers to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy California with his journalist wife and kids. In fact, he attends board meetings but claims to get most of his information on Oppo and Vivo from the Internet, to avoid “disturbing them”. His rivals have been less considerate. Last October, Xiaomi co-founder Lei Jun lambasted competitors who build dense store channels in rural areas in pursuit of quick sales. In an interview with China Entrepreneur Magazine in October, Lei accused such players of using “imbalanced information” to trick buyers into shunning Xiaomi, precipitating its decline from the top spot. “Those who said this were insane,” Duan said without naming names. “When someone talks about an information imbalance, deep down they believe consumers are idiots.” His most visible passion these days is stock investment, which is why he agreed to pay a then-record $620 100 in 2006 to lunch with Buffett. Quotes from the Sage of Omaha still pepper Duan’s blog posts, right alongside tips on golf and Apple. Duan cemented his reputation as a savvy financier in part by digging his friend, Netease founder William Ding, out of a hole. Ding’s Internet company tanked to as low as $0,13 after the dot-com bubble burst, then almost became the first US-listed Chinese company to get tossed off the Nasdaq over an auditing issue. Duan came to his friend’s aid, buying about 5% of Netease with just $2m in 2002, when the stock price averaged $0,16. Company filings show he still held just over four million shares as of March 2009, but Duan said he sold much of that when Netease hit $40. His other much-studied holding is premium liquor company Kweichow Moutai Co. He said he bought in at 180 yuan in late 2012. While it nearly halved in 2014, Moutai today trades above 370 yuan. Duan isn’t shy about talking up his trades, not least of which is Apple, which remains near a record high despite a rare sales decline in 2016. But looking back on his decades as first entrepreneur then stock-picker, his proudest moments remain rooted in BBK. Though he claims to keep it at arm’s length, he admits to worrying about succession and whether the company culture will survive another generation of leaders. And while BBK’s Vivo and Duan’s own Oppo have done well, there’s no certainty in a fast-moving business. Both are starting to ramp up everything from the features on their phones to marketing campaigns: Oppo notably used Barcelona’s Mobile World Congress to unveil its most advanced camera technology yet, signalling a new maturity. One thing’s for sure: Duan doesn’t see himself returning to an active executive, leaving others to deal with the next challenge. “I’ve made it clear many years ago, I will never make a comeback,” he said. “If there’s a problem they can’t fix, then neither can I.”  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 77Expert warns SA on too much renewable energy 37ANC mulls plan to end DStv ‘monopoly’ 4Cell C swings to net profit of R540m 2IFC coy on Net1 allegations 2Zuma to lead grants reform Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

India Today Tech Last Updated: MAR 20, 2017 New Delhi Email Author The Apple iPhone SE has a new price. There is nothing official about it but the price in all probability will have blessings of the Apple India. The phone is now selling for an effective price of Rs 19,999 after a cashback discount of Rs 5000 at several offline stores, if the purchase is made with the debit or credit card. The price for cash mode or online is apparently still higher. The Rs 19,999 is the price for the 16GB version of the phone. The 64GB version costs Rs 25,999. The information about the special offer on the iPhone SE was first revealed by ITNetInfoCom, a retailer based in South India. iPhone SE Now available in India at Lower price than US. 16 GB @ 19999 64 GB @ 25999 .

This is an interesting phone with a design that is similar to that of the iPhone 5S but with the hardware that was closer to that of the iPhone 6S. It was launched with a price of Rs 39,000. Also Read: Quick look: Apple iPhone SE is like an old friend The phone has a 4-inch screen and full-metal body. However, inside its metal frame the device has A9 processor and the 12-megapixel camera that Apple fans first saw in the iPhone 6S. Should you buy it? Before you can buy the iPhone SE at its special prices, first you have to find a retailer that is selling it at a special prices. This means, you won't get iPhone SE for Rs 19,999 online. You will have to buy it from an Apple-authorised offline store. But once you do manage to find the iPhone SE at a special prices, you will be faced with the question of if it is a good deal at Rs 19,999 or not. The answer to this question is that it is indeed a good deal. Also Read: Apple iPhone SE review: Old bottle, new wine The only reason not buy the iPhone SE at the special price is its small screen. Otherwise this is a very good phone with a fantastic camera. It is also fast enough, is a much better deal than the iPhone 5S and runs the iOS 10, which most (but not all) Apple users like. As far as the phone is concerned here is what we said about it in our review : The iPhone SE is a new wine in an old, touched up bottle. It is a premium experience.  It is largely meant for people who have been using the iPhone 5S and don't want a bigger phone. Overall, the iPhone SE is a great phone for people who want a small phone. For everyone, else there is the iPhone 6 or the iPhone 6S. However, this was our conclusion for the iPhone SE at Rs 39,000. At Rs 19,999, this is an even better buy if you don't mind the smaller screen.

By Corinne Reichert | March 20, 2017 -- 05:53 GMT (22:53 PDT) | Topic: Tech Industry Apple NZ has paid no taxes within New Zealand, and has instead been paying the amount due to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), it has been reported. According to the New Zealand Herald, Apple NZ has paid nothing in taxes to the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department for the last 10 years despite making sales worth around $4.2 billion since 2007. Latest New Zealand news NZ telco urges shareholders to reject Spark's 'predatory' acquisition Virtustream launches enterprise cloud platform in Australia and New Zealand Huawei opening datacentre, expanding research labs in New Zealand: Report Chorus must maintain uncongested copper links: Regulator Nokia extends fixed-line agreement with Chorus ahead of UFB2 The report cited Apple Sales New Zealand's financial statements as showing that it paid $37 million in income tax -- but that this was paid to the equivalent tax office in Australia rather than New Zealand. Apple has increasingly come under scrutiny for its tax-avoidance practices, having been audited by the ATO and accordingly upping the amount of tax it paid in Australia during 2014-15. According to the ATO's 2014-15 Corporate Tax Transparency report, Apple paid AU$146 million in tax, more than double the AU$72 million it paid a year earlier. Under Australia's new multinational tax anti-avoidance laws -- implemented as part of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recommendations stemming from its G20-commissioned base erosion and profit-shifting (BEPS) project -- as of July 2016, companies operating in Australia that have an annual global income of more than AU$1 billion are required to lodge their general purpose financial statements to the ATO if they are not already doing so with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). As a result of this, Apple in January revealed that it paid 97 percent of its AU$132 million 2016 Australian profit in taxes to the ATO, paying AU$128 million in taxes and leaving it with just AU$3.7 million in net profit. Apple Australia made AU$7.5 billion in revenue during FY16, and globally made $216 billion in sales. In September, Japanese authorities similarly cracked down on Apple's taxation practices after discovering that it was sending a portion of its iTunes profit to a business unit in Ireland without paying taxes on the international transaction during 2014 and 2015. The Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau consequently forced Apple to pay 12 billion yen ($118 million) in back taxes. Apple has been using Ireland's lax taxation laws to avoid paying up for some time, with the European Commission ruling in August after a two-year investigation that Ireland should claim €13 billion in "illegal tax benefits" back from Apple. The European Commission had found that Apple used two shell companies incorporated in Ireland to report all of its European profits to be taxed at a rate of less than 1 percent -- and at one point at a taxation rate of only 0.005 percent -- which constituted a breach of state aid rules, making the practice illegal. In December, however, Ireland announced that it would be appealing the European Commission's ruling to collect the €13 billion in taxes, saying the commission is infringing on Ireland's sovereignty. Ireland's taxation policies are designed to attract foreign investors, the Irish Department of Finance said. "The purpose of the state aid rules is to tackle state interventions which confer a selective advantage. The state aid rules by their nature cannot remedy mismatches between tax systems on a global level," the Irish government said in its legal arguments. "Ireland did not give favourable tax treatment to Apple. The full amount of tax was paid in this case and no state aid was provided. Ireland does not do deals with taxpayers."

The announcement comes as chief executive Tim Cook undertakes his latest trip to a country that ranks as Apple’s single biggest overseas market. Apple said it planned to build new research facilities in the eastern Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou, on top of centres slated for Beijing and the southern city of Shenzhen. Share this story AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File It also pledged to spend at least 3.5 billion yuan (R6.5 billion) on research institutions. Read also: Apple gets more iPhone fans All four centres were due to open later this year, the company said. They would help Apple co-operate with partners and attract talent from its suppliers and top educational institutes. The announcement came a day before Cook was scheduled to address an economic forum in Beijing, where senior government officials would confer with the heads of some of the world’s biggest corporations, including Royal Dutch Shell and Saudi Arabian Oil. Currying favour Foreign companies have a long-established tradition of building research bases in China to signal their commitment to the country and curry favour with the government. Apple’s announcement comes after iPhone shipments fell for the first time in China last year.  China had for years driven Apple’s spectacular growth, even as smartphone demand elsewhere faltered. But vendors like Huawei Technologies, Oppo and Vivo are eroding its market share with increasingly high-end devices. The US company is counting on the release of the 10th anniversary iPhone later this year to supercharge growth.

But with such a devoted following, the iPhone is expected to generate billions in profit for the foreseeable future. THE ASSOCIATED PRESS In this Monday, June 10, 2013, file photo, developers look over new apps being displayed on iPads at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco. Apple still hasn't shown any sign of being able to duplicate its late founder Steve Jobs' knack for game-changing innovation, but that isn't stopping the world's most valuable company from reaching new heights. Apple's iPhone has a devout following, and its app store has become the company's fastest-growing segment. CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) — The Apple of today hasn’t yet shown much indication of emulating its co-founder, Steve Jobs, and his streak of world-changing products, but it’s still proving a tough act to beat. The main reason: When Jobs died in 2011 he left behind the iPhone, a product with such a devout following that it will likely spin off billions in profit for the foreseeable future — even if Apple fails to come up with “the next iPhone,” whatever that might be. Apple stock up 20 percent so far in 2017 True, Apple recently reported its first annual sales slump in 15 years and docked CEO Tim Cook’s pay as a result. But stock market sage Warren Buffett and other investors have been betting on Apple’s continued success. Its shares are already up nearly 20 percent in the first two months of 2017, hitting record highs and boosting the company’s market value to roughly $720 billion. The recent gains helped keep shareholders in a mostly upbeat mood last month during Apple’s annual meeting at its Cupertino, California, headquarters. It was the final meeting on this Silicon Valley campus; Apple is preparing to move into its new headquarters, Apple Park, a nearby 175-acre site anchored by a spaceship-shaped building glistening with curved glass. Since the Apple Watch, the company has been in a dry spell The Apple Watch, the only new device introduced during Cook’s reign, is the world’s best-selling smartwatch. Unfortunately, smartwatches just haven’t captured the public’s fancy the way the iPod, iPhone and iPad did during the decade leading up to Jobs’ death in 2011. Now, online music streaming is turning the iPod into a relic, and the iPad’s sales have fallen for the past three years. Those challenges prompted one shareholder speaking at the annual meeting to question whether Apple is losing its innovative touch. He said the company seemed to be doing a better job of “financial engineering” — for instance, spending $47 billion buying back stock and paying shareholder dividends — than it is in coming up with new product ideas. Cook wasn’t on stage at the time that point was raised, but later in the meeting he said that Apple still generates nearly 40 percent of its revenue from products other than the iPhone. “All of these are essential to Apple’s growth,” Cook said. But nothing is more fruitful than the iPhone, even though Apple has offered only relatively minor upgrades and changes to the device since 2014, when it first released a model with a larger screen. That stasis has also taken its toll. Many users found no compelling reason to trade in their older models, and iPhone sales fell last year for the first time since its introduction in 2007. Apple reversed that trend in its most recent quarter, if only barely. Analysts expect sales to accelerate this fall, predicting that Apple will unveil a souped-up — and more expensive — iPhone to celebrate the device’s 10-year anniversary, spurring a “super cycle” of buying. Consumers are apathetic, but addicted to smartphones Still, it is increasingly difficult to get consumers excited about smartphones. These modern slabs of glass and metal are all pretty much capable of doing just about everything that people want, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. Even if they aren’t buying new models as frequently as they once did, iPhone owners tend to be fiercely loyal to the brand. When they do get around to buying a replacement, they usually stick with Apple, whose “ecosystem” of apps and services tied to the iPhone makes switching especially painful. (Google is now trying to do much the same thing with Android-based phones.) Apps and services is Apple's fastest-growing segment What’s more, iPhone fans tend to have higher incomes, allowing them to spend more on apps and services such as Apple’s music subscription service. Apple typically collects a commission ranging from 15 percent to 30 percent of sales from apps sold in its store — the only way to reach the vast majority of iPhone users. The formula is turning the app store into Apple’s fastest-growing business. Services revenue rose more than 20 percent last year to $24.3 billion. Within the next four years Apple believes its service revenue will double to nearly $50 billion — an amount that would almost rank that business among the 50 largest U.S. companies.

Only Samsung, with 25.1% has more. Photo: AFP Duan Yongping is convinced Tim Cook didn’t have a clue who he was when they first met a couple years ago. The Apple boss probably does now. Duan is the reclusive billionaire who founded Oppo and Vivo, the twin smartphone brands that dealt the world’s largest company a stinging defeat in China last year. Once derided as cheap iPhone knockoffs, they leapfrogged the rankings and shoved Apple Inc. out of the top three in 2016—when iPhone shipments fell in China for the first time. They managed to do it because the American smartphone giant didn’t adapt to local competition, the entrepreneur told Bloomberg in what he said was his first interview in 10 years. Oppo and Vivo employed tactics Apple was reluctant to match, such as cheaper devices with high-end features, for fear of jeopardizing its winning formula elsewhere, Duan said. The companies have also stolen a march over Apple in India, where together, they have a 16.2% share of the market according to researcher IDC. Only Samsung, with 25.1% has more. “Apple couldn’t beat us in China because even they have flaws,” the 56-year-old electronics mogul said. “They’re maybe too stubborn sometimes. They made a lot of great things, like their operating system, but we surpass them in other areas.” That’s not to say Duan doesn’t appreciate the iPhone maker’s global clout. In fact, the billionaire’s obsession with his US rival is legion: he’s long been a big-time investor in Apple and an unabashed fan of its chief executive officer. “I’ve met Tim Cook on several occasions. He might not know me but we’ve chatted a little,” Duan said. “I like him a lot.” Apple couldn’t confirm Duan’s meeting with Cook when contacted by Bloomberg. But Duan has blogged incessantly about Apple’s products, share price and operations since 2013, when the company was worth half what it is today. He needs “a really big pocket” because he carries four devices, including a heavily-used iPhone. In a 2015 post, he argued Apple’s profit should reach $100 billion within five years. Today, Duan won’t say when he actually bought in but says much of his overseas wealth remains tied up in the iPhone maker. He even lives in Palo Alto, an easy drive from Apple’s new UFO-like headquarters in Cupertino. “Apple is an extraordinary company. It is a model for us to learn from,” Duan said. “We don’t have the concept of surpassing anyone, the focus instead is to improve ourselves.” Oppo’s gains against Apple may now earn an even broader following for the billionaire dubbed China’s Warren Buffett by local media for his investment acumen. Born in Jiangxi, a birthplace of Mao Zedong’s Communist revolution, Duan began his career at a state-run vacuum tube plant before making his name with homegrown electronics. Also read: The building of UrbanClap, one on-demand service at a time Duan left the factory floor around 1990, when China was just embracing capitalism and opening industries to private investment. He headed to southern China’s Guangdong province, then the cradle of liberal reforms, to run a struggling electronics plant. His first product was the “Subor” gaming console with dual-cartridge slots—a direct shot at Nintendo Co.’s classic Family Computer, known elsewhere as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The 100- to 400-yuan Subor became a hit in the absence of local competitors. Duan even enlisted Kung Fu star Jackie Chan to endorse the device. By 1995, revenue from the Subor exceeded 1 billion yuan. Duan left to set up a new business that year as the operation flourished—a pattern he would repeat in later years. He christened his second venture Bubugao, literally “rising higher step-by-step.” BBK, as the company came to be known, created a popular line of VCD and MP3 players but later also made DVD players for global brands. Subsidiary Bubugao Communication Equipment Co. became one of the country’s biggest feature-phone makers around 2000, going head-to-head with Nokia and Motorola. It was the first iPhone in 2007 that paved the way for Oppo and Vivo. While they share a common founder in Duan, the sister brands are fierce competitors, trotting out dueling marketing campaigns in markets from India to Southeast Asia. Their salesmanship philosophy plays well in emerging markets, IDC research manager Kiranjeet Kaur said. “The companies fully understand how to make the best of their people, a specialty they inherited from Duan,” said Nicole Peng, a senior director at Canalys. Importantly, they understood their millennial audience. “Many of their managers are young and have been working at the company since graduation.” Duan’s latest endeavors were, in part, dreamed up in Apple’s backyard. By 2001 at the age of 40, Duan had decided to move to California to focus on investment and philanthropy, later installing his family in a mansion he reportedly bought from Cisco Systems Inc. chairman John Chambers. But the advent of the smartphone forced the entrepreneur out of retirement. By the second half of 2000s, BBK was on the verge of falling apart as sales of its basic devices slowed. The likes of Huawei and Coolpad were making smartphones priced at around 1,000 yuan. That nearly put the company under, Duan recalled. “We were in serious discussions about how to close the company peacefully -- in a way that the employees can leave unhurt and suppliers don’t lose money,” he said. Those intense brainstorming sessions spawned the two businesses that would go on to embody Duan’s greatest success. In 2005, the entrepreneur and his protege Tony Chen decided to create a new company. Dubbed Oppo, it sold music players but ramped up to smartphones in 2011. In 2009, BBK itself created Vivo, headed by another of Duan’s disciples, Shen Wei. “Making mobile phones was not my call,” said Duan. “But I reckoned we could do well in this market.” At first, neither label garnered much attention. The iPhone was captivating users with its revolutionary apps system and elegant interface, while BlackBerrys lorded over the corporate market. But Oppo and Vivo then developed a marketing-blitz approach that relied on local celebrity endorsement and a vast re-sellers’ store network across China. They crafted an affordable image that appealed to a millennial crowd, then tricked out their devices with high-end specs. On the surface, Oppo and Vivo phones now routinely surpass the iPhone on measures such as charging speeds, memory and battery life. It paid off. The duo together shipped more than 147 million smartphones in China in 2016, dwarfing Huawei Technologies Co.’s 76.6 million units, Apple’s 44.9 million and Xiaomi’s 41.5 million, IDC estimates. Oppo and Vivo both doubled their 2015 haul. In the fourth quarter, they were No. 1 and No. 3, respectively -- Huawei was second. Their approach worked particularly well in lower-tier cities, where mid-range phones became a mainstream hit, said Tay Xiaohan, an IDC analyst. Duan’s smartphone progeny are also gaining some momentum beyond their home turf. In the fourth quarter, Oppo and Vivo were fourth and fifth in the world, respectively. About a quarter of Oppo’s shipments went to markets like India, where it hopes to dig in before Apple establishes a meaningful presence. “Smartphones are an unprecedented opportunity. We forecast at least for the next 10 or 20 years, there’s no replacement. But we don’t know,” Duan said. Cook said on the weekend that Apple doesn’t have a specific goal for market share. “The competition is more fierce in China -- not only in this industry, but in many industries,” Cook told the China Development Forum in Beijing. “I think that’s a credit to a number of local companies that put their energies into making good products.” Duan has increasingly kept his distance from the Chinese smartphone makers despite remaining a significant shareholder (he won’t say how much). He says he prefers to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy California with his journalist wife and kids. In fact, he attends board meetings but claims to get most of his information on Oppo and Vivo from the internet, to avoid “disturbing them.” His rivals have been less considerate. Last October, Xiaomi Corp. co-founder Lei Jun lambasted competitors who build dense store channels in rural areas in pursuit of quick sales. In an interview with China Entrepreneurs Magazine in October, Lei accused such players of using “imbalanced information” to trick buyers into shunning Xiaomi, precipitating its decline from the top spot. “Those who said this were insane,” Duan said without naming names. “When someone talks about an information imbalance, deep down they believe consumers are idiots.” His most visible passion these days is stock investment, which is why he agreed to pay a then-record $620,100 in 2006 to lunch with Buffett. Quotes from the Sage of Omaha still pepper Duan’s blogposts, right alongside tips on golf and Apple. Duan cemented his reputation as a savvy financier in part by digging his friend, Netease Inc. founder William Ding, out of a hole. Ding’s internet company tanked to as low as 13 cents after the dot-com bubble burst, then almost became the first US-listed Chinese company to get tossed off the Nasdaq over an auditing issue. Duan came to his friend’s aid, buying about 5 percent of Netease with just $2 million in 2002, when the stock price averaged 16 cents. Company filings show he still held just over 4 million shares as of March 2009, but Duan said he sold much of that when Netease hit $40. His other much-studied holding is premium-liquor company Kweichow Moutai Co. He said he bought in at 180 yuan in late 2012. While it nearly halved in 2014, Moutai today trades above 370 yuan. Duan isn’t shy about talking up his trades, not least of which is Apple, which remains near a record high despite a rare sales decline in 2016. But looking back on his decades as first entrepreneur then stock-picker, his proudest moments remain rooted in BBK. Though he claims to keep it at arm’s length, he admits to worrying about succession and whether the company culture will survive another generation of leaders. And while BBK’s Vivo and Duan’s own Oppo have done well, there’s no certainty in a fast-moving business. Both are starting to ramp up everything from the features on their phones to marketing campaigns: Oppo notably used Barcelona’s Mobile World Congress to unveil its most advanced camera technology yet, signaling a new maturity. One thing’s for sure, Duan doesn’t see himself returning to an active executive, leaving others to deal with the next challenge. “I’ve made it clear many years ago, I will never make a comeback,” he said. “If there’s a problem they can’t fix, then neither can I.” A Mint staff writer contributed to this story. bloomberg Topics: Oppo Vivo Duan Yongping Oppo founder Apple More From Livemint READ MORE Govt removes 1% tax on cash purchase above Rs2 lakh Shinzo Abe’s wife Akie accused of giving cash-filled envelope in real estate scandal Donald Trump fights for US healthcare bill, makes headway with conservatives First Published: Mon, Mar 20 2017. 11 07 AM IST Editor's Picks How the London attack unfolded at the heart of UK government Radhakishan Damani quiet as ever after stellar D-Mart listing Snapdeal in talks with Flipkart, Paytm for a potential sale Latest News Govt removes 1% tax on cash purchase above Rs2 lakh Shinzo Abe’s wife Akie accused of giving cash-filled envelope in real estate scandal Donald Trump fights for US healthcare bill, makes headway with conservatives Amid deepening ties, Chinese troops join Pakistan Day parade Gold prices edge up on sustained buying Mint On Sunday Rape laws: A call for change Where now are the bindis of yesteryear?

Source: AAP 20 Mar 2017 - 4:58 PM  UPDATED 20 Mar 2017 - 4:58 PM Tweet Australian Prudential Regulation Authority chairman Wayne Byres says there's a ready-made Australian market for the likes of Apple and Google should the US tech giants expand into the financial services industry. "Financial services ultimately is an industry that's built on trust and if you think about the next generation that's coming through, certainly when I think about my kids, the brands they trust - Apple, Google - it's the technology brands," Mr Byres said on Monday. "They wouldn't have a clue about the four major banks that we have here ... (and) as far as my kids are concerned, they have accounts with Apple so we're not actually that far away." A KPMG report released last week suggested 84 per cent of millennials would consider banking with a tech giant if they offered a better product or deal than a traditional bank, and Mr Byres said there was little to prevent more competition. Apple already offers Apple Pay - which allows iPhone users to use their device like a contactless credit or debit card - in more than a dozen countries, including through ANZ, Macquarie, MyState and others in Australia. There could be scope within current regulations for the Cupertino-based giant to issue credit cards, mortgages and small business lending should it so choose. "At this point they're playing in particular places - particularly focused on the payments space rather than seeking to be a broader financial services offering - and I think the system in the way it's set up can accommodate that, but its not hugely difficult to envisage them offering a range of other services and that will test the regulatory model," Mr Byers said at the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's annual forum in Sydney. "You can do anything in this country without an APRA licence except for one thing and that's take a deposit." ASIC chairman Greg Medcraft said he expects Apple, Google or Amazon to target areas they see as undeserved, as Chinese retail giant Alibaba has done with small business lending. "What puts the fear into the heart of banks is the prospect of Amazon in particular. I think they're coming," Mr Medcraft said. "Amazon might buy one of the banks, who knows?"

(Photo:chinadaily.com.cn/Feng Yongbin) Apple boss Tim Cook said on Saturday that China outdoes the United States and Europe in the development of mobile payment technology because local people are more willing to embrace changes. “People in the US and Europe get used to credit cards. And merchants in the US are very slow to adopt new terminals that make mobile payment possible. But in China, because of the huge number of small businesses, there is a higher willingness to embrace changes,” Cook said at the China Development Forum in Beijing. According to the Apple boss, this is part of China's booming mobile internet industry and proves that China has a big number of internet-related talents. “In future, whatever you can dream of, there will be an app for it,” Cook added. Apple announced on Friday that it will set up two more research and development (R&D) centers in Shanghai and Suzhou, after it announced similar plans for Beijing and Shenzhen last year. Apple said it has committed to invest 3.5 billion yuan (0 million) in these centers, so as to better tap into China's talents in manufacturing, app development, design and other sectors. When it comes to new technologies, Cook said it takes time before augmented reality will become part of everyday life, given that the complex technology demands further advancements in many aspects. “Unlike artificial intelligence which is already here and changing our lives, AR requires sensors, displays, batteries and many other different products to come out at one time,” he added. The seasoned executive also expressed his view on globalization amid global concern about the re-emergence of protectionism. “Globalization is not helping everyone, and it hurts some people. But it is not because globalization is bad. We have to better our efforts to help more people benefit from it,” he said.

While the details have not been officially announced, a number of retailers across the country have begun to offer Apple’s lowest priced iPhone SE from price tags as low as Rs 19,999. The price cut as first reported by Techpp, is close to Rs 10,000. The smartphone was launched in India at Rs 39,000 in April 2016 and is now selling at retailers at the new low price, but these in some cases can be availed on card purchases only. According to the source, the news (although not official) was broken by kerala-based Apple retailer ITNetInfocom (@itnetinfocom).

Apple recently announced a cashback offer for card transactions (non-EMI) where customers get a cashback amount of Rs 5,000 within 90 days of purchase. Indeed, this offer seems to add to the discount price which is why we have witnessed a drastic price drop. The cashback offer is expected to be available till 31 March. The new low price as clarified by the retailer, is after the Apple cashback offer and is only available on offline purchases in stores. The iPhone SE offer is an official offer from Apple of 5000 Rs Cashback.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones iPhone SE to take on Xiaomi Mi 5, OnePlus 2 and Moto Z Play after price cut: Here's why you should buy it Apple iPhone SE is available for Rs 19,999 for the 16GB model, and the 64GB variant is available for Rs 25,999 after Rs 5,000 cash back. Raymond Ronamai   March 20, 2017 08:51 IST Apple's iPhone SEApple India Apple appears to be seriously planning to conquer the Indian smartphone market, well aware of the fact that it has huge potential for growth as markets in most countries are saturated. The Cupertino giant hasn't officially cut the price of its iPhone SE in India but its authorised offline retailers are selling it at a huge discount, which will surely give mid-range smartphones from other OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) a run for their money. The iPhone SE is currently available for Rs 19,999 for the 16GB model, and the 64GB variant is available for Rs 25,999 after Rs 5,000 cash back. This means the 16GB variant will take on OnePlus 2 (Rs 19,999 for 16GB ROM, 3GB RAM), LeEco Le Max 2 (Rs 19,899), Xiaomi Mi Max Prime (Rs 19,999), Moto M (Rs 17,999 for 64GB ROM, 4GB RAM), Asus Zenfone 3 (Rs 18,999) and other devices priced under Rs 20,000. The iPhone SE 6 4GB variant will take on the likes of Xiaomi Mi 5 (Rs 22,999), Moto Z Play (Rs 24,999), Sony Xperia X (Rs 24,999), Google Nexus 5X (Rs 24,999), and OnePlus 2 (Rs 22,999 for 32 GB ROM, 4GB RAM). Also read: When and what iPhone models will Apple start producing in Bengaluru? The iPhone SE 16GB variant was originally priced at Rs 39,000 before being cut to Rs 24,999, while the 64GB model was priced at Rs 44,000. However, retailers are currently selling both the variants with Rs 5,000 cash back on purchase using a credit or debit card, taking the prices to a new low. Credit cards issued by Axis Bank, Citibank, HDFC Bank, HSBC, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Kotak, RBL Bank, SBI, Standard Chartered, UBI, and Yes Bank, and debit cards issued by Axis Bank, Citibank, HDFC Bank, HSBC, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Kotak, RBL Bank, Standard Chartered, and Yes Bank can avail the Rs 5,000 cash back offer. The offer is valid only from March 17 until the end of the month, and the assured amount will be credited on the card used within 90 days from the date of purchase. Only a unit per card is allowed and there is no EMI option. The unexpected offer could be a move to rake in revenue before the end of the financial year, which ends in March. It could also be done anticipating a price cut once Apple's planned iPhone assembly plant in Bengaluru becomes operational. It is reported that the proposed plant will assemble the iPhone SE to start with and it is expected to begin between April and June. Should you buy the iPhone SE? Well, it's a good deal for sure as the device comes packed with impressive specifications. The device features a 4-inch retina display with 1,136x640 pixels (326 ppi pixel density), Touch-ID  fingerprint sensor in the home button, an A9 chip, and an iOS 9.3 operating system. It also has a 16GB/64GB internal storage, a 2GB RAM, a 12MP iSight main camera with 1.22Âµ pixels, a 1.2MP front-snapper, and a 1,624mAh battery.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 March 2017 by Military News Apple takes supplier clean energy program to Japan Ibiden’s products help bring together the integrated circuitry and chip packages in Apple devices. Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

The biggest takeaway is, perhaps, the launch of future products. This year’s major event will begin on 5 June and run for four days. The first day is when Apple holds its major keynote, introducing the future of its software, with the rest of the days taken up with session for developers to learn how to use it. There are many product we don’t know of yet. The 2017 WWDC and the years to come hold big things in store for Apple. Record-breaking Revenue In the first quarter of 2017, Apple reported revenue of $78.351 billion, up 3.3 percent on the $75.872 revenue recorded in the same quarter a year ago. On the other hand, its net income profit was $17.891 billion, down by 2.6 percent on $18.361 during the same quarter a year ago. International sales accounted for 64 percent of Apple’s Q1 revenue. Since 2015, Apple’s iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch sales have hit new quarterly records, while its Services business, which includes iTunes and Apple Music, continue to gain some revenue. While, Apple plans to double its service industry revenues by 2020, its target market is worth only $800 billion. Let’s assume that the Apple Car turns out of be a huge money maker, adding up to $1.6 trillion of value to the company by 2020. Then we could say that Apple could double-triple its revenue.  While Apple scoops up over $3 trillion from the smartphone industry’s profit, it could be worth much more if it keeps adding new products in some of these categories – Apple Watch, Apple TV, and Apple Car. Acquisition of a Major Media Company During Apple’s earning call, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced plans to acquire a major media company. Last year, these acquisition rumors gained traction when Apple considered acquiring Time Warner and Netflix. Of course, the rumors have died down, and AT&T announced the purchase of Time Warner. A major media acquisition is on the cards – Apple plans to double the $24 billion of 2016 annual revenue in its service units, which includes all media sales. Tim Cook would need to show at least 20% growth rate by 2020, to cover up the year over year deceleration. Wall Street analysts are expecting at least 14% average growth per year over the next four years. To accomplish, Apple would need to reverse the slow down via a merger or a deal with a media company. Don’t be surprised if rumors emerge suggesting Apple is in talks with Walt Disney or CBS for a possible mega-merger. Smart Home Products During Apple’s Q1 2017 earnings call, Tim Cook also discussed a place in Apple’s ecosystem in which customers are immersed in its products wherever they do. Apple wants to be user’s companion – from iPhone to Mac to Apple Watch to Apple’s in-vehicle infotainment system. Apple is expanding its presence in the smart devices market with help from HomeKit, a service that lets hardware makers integrate control of their products into iOS 10. The expansion in to the market will put Apple into the left, right and center of the ever-increasing smarthome craze. "Now when I say good morning to Siri, my house lights come on and my coffee starts brewing," Cook said in his remarks. "When I go to the living room to relax in the evening, I use Siri to adjust the lighting and turn on the fireplace. And when I leave the house, a simple tap on my iPhone turns the lights off, adjusts the thermostat down, and locks the doors. When I return to my house in the evening, as I near my home, the house prepares itself for my arrival automatically by using a simple geofence." The company will play an omnipresent role in the consumer’s life by creating an Apple-dominated ecosystem of Apple hardware, Apple software and third-party products. The Launch of the Spaceship Late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was one of the chief proponents for building Apple’s main building – dubbed “Spaceship”. According to Matthew Roberts, a documentarian who has been flying a drone over Apple Campus 2 to watch its progress, the new campus is nearly ready to accommodate workers. The Spaceship is nearly finished, complete with 70% of solar panels atop, along with rounded glass along the walls. The campus is dominated with rows of trees, so employees can take a stroll on the walking paths. The Spaceship will span 2.8 million square feet of space and will house 12,000 employees. It will be one of the largest office buildings in the world. Additionally, it will be powered by renewable energy. Promising Development for Apple Starting in April, the Cupertino company will assemble iPhones in India. Apple executives met with Priyank Kharge, information technology minister for the Indian state of Karnataka, to cement the timeline. With Apple moving into one of the fastest-emerging smartphone markets in the world, it could expand distribution channels to attract a significant portion of first-time buyers. According to Counterpoint research, Apple shipped 2.5 million units of the iPhone in India. A third of which came to India in Q4 2016, following the launch of the iPhone 7. The company managed to capture the number 10 position in the Indian market as of Q4 2016, gaining a 62 market share in the premium segment. Apple still continues to struggle to gain a meaningful share of India’s smartphone market. It is widely assumed that by assembling its phones in India, the company will be able to cut down on high import taxes, thus reducing the price of iPhones in India. No more than 400,000 units will be assembled in India, and Apple has no plans to abruptly drop prices. The savings will obviously go towards expanding its retail and marketing footprint. Next, the Cupertino-Calif. company is in the midst of remodeling flagship stores all across the globe based on a new concept design proposed by vice president Angela Adhrents and design guru Jony Ive. The remodeled stores are promised to feature more places for customers to gather along with expanded areas for business customers. Expanding of flagship stores will start with the one in Midtown Manhattan, where Apple will expand to 77,000 square feet, up from 32,000 square feet. “We are reinventing the role our stores and employees play in the community,” Ahrendts told Fortune last year. “We want to be more like a town square, where the best of Apple comes together and everyone is welcome.” Apple Patents & Behind The Scenes What can we expect from Apple in the years to follow? Apple is known for its patents. In addition to protecting the current line of products from copy-cats, the company is working on fascinating technologies to use in its future products. One of the patents suggests Apple is keen on committing to green energy. It plans to build solar cells underneath the new iPhone’s touchscreen. The panel would recharge during the day so you won’t need to plug it into the socket anymore. Apple is also keen on integrating a premium casing to the upcoming lineup of smartphone. A new Apple patent describes a material with metal appearance that would allow radio signals to pass through, without disrupting the appearance of the smartphone. Lots of Apple patents relate to the smartphone’s accident-free buttons, greater touch accuracy, curved display, waterproof components, flexible iPhone, advanced Touch ID fingerprint sensor, Touch ID display, 3D photographs and interchangeable camera lenses. It’s still early days for the Apple revolution. Lighter, faster, thinner, whatever it is Apple has in store for us at the upcoming WWDC, we’re more than happy hyperventilate over!

"Why would a government spend taxpayers’ money with a foreign corporation which manipulates the system so it does not pay a fair share of tax in New Zealand," says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters. "These companies reduce what tax they owe in New Zealand through complex ‘related party finance transactions.’ Why would the New Zealand taxpayer buy off a company that is prepared to milk this country and give nothing back in return. "Why do some global corporates pay tax on New Zealand earnings but Apple doesn’t? Every year government departments will buy well over a thousand Apple devices - 1,381 in 2014/15 alone - and this doesn’t include District Health Boards or other agencies. "The way some Ministers talk up Apple you’d think they were on commission. "And it’s not just Apple because FujiXerox has been favoured by this government and also does a Robin Hood in reverse - it takes from the poor Kiwi taxpayer to give to its rich multinational paymaster. "Government procurement rules need to change after almost nine years of National doing nothing, and claiming they were in discussions with the OECD," says Mr Peters.

Last year, Apple brought the hammer down on the 11-inch MacBook Air, and this year, it appears that the 13.3-inch model might be next. With the MacBook Air series seemingly set to be discontinued, it is pertinent to ask: Is the MacBook Air still a compelling buy? Inasmuch as the Air line is aging fast, there are still three compelling reasons why Apple’s entry-level MacBooks are still a worthy purchase. Incomparable Battery The MacBook Air is the undisputed champion of battery life. The devices’ display, while considered by many to be the Air’s biggest flaw, actually plays in its favor, extending the machine’s already stellar endurance. According to a LaptopMag report, the 13.3-inch MacBook Air’s battery life is practically legendary, reaching north of 12 hours on one charge. In the portable computing market, very few have been able to challenge the Air when it comes to how long it could last away from the power outlet. IdentiMac just decoded a Serial Number for MacBook Air 11" i7 1.7GHz Early 2014 from USA #Apple #MacBookAir #MacOSX https://t.co/AMgOUgd5YQ pic.twitter.com/xjlU3L8hbF — IdentiMac (@IdentiMac) March 8, 2017 Apple has never actually managed to exceed the MacBook Air when it comes to battery life. Even the 12-inch MacBook, which features an almost all-battery design, falls short of the MacBook Air’s endurance. In LaptopMag‘s tests, the 13-inch MacBook Air lasted a full 14 hours on a single charge, while the more updated 12-inch MacBook lasted a humble 9.5 hours. Great Price Apple devices are not cheap, with the firm’s 2016-series laptops such as the 12-inch MacBook and the MacBook Pro being priced north of $1,000. The MacBook Air, on the other hand, still maintains its sub-$1,000 price. This gives the laptop great value for money, especially considering that the 12-inch MacBook, which is priced significantly more than the Air, is inferior in power. The entry-level 13.3-inch MacBook Air carries an Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, together with 128GB of internal storage. On the other hand, the 12-inch MacBook, which Apple seems to be building up to be the MacBook Air’s successor, sports a rather anemic Intel M processor. For its price, the MacBook Air simply offers more than its successor. Finally!! #blessed #macbookair #apple #happy pic.twitter.com/EhHpWWchhr — Rougzy (@Rougzzy) March 17, 2017 A Dongle-Free Life When the MacBook Pro 2016 was released, numerous Apple fans and critics noted that the device’s lack of ports would result in a dongle nightmare for users of the machine. True enough, the absence of simple ports such as an SD card reader and a Thunderbolt port forced MacBook Pro 2016 users to invest in various dongles. The MacBook Air does not have this problem, as the device still carries practically all the legacy ports that users would need to hook up their machines to external displays, digital cameras, and other peripherals. Apple’s insistence on the exclusive use of USB-C has polarized even Apple’s most dedicated fans. After all, it appears that convenience and practicality-wise, the Cupertino-based tech giant’s devices seem to be taking a step backwards. With the MacBook Air, however, users could rest assure that they could enjoy the full features of their laptops without having to commit to dozens of dongles. If Apple’s 2016 laptops are any indication, the MacBook Air is on its way out, according to a MacWorld report. Despite this, however, the device remains one of Apple’s most practical products, featuring capable internals at a rather reasonable price. The 13.3-inch MacBook Air currently sells for $999 on Apple’s website, but third-party retailers sell the device for just around $899. During sales, the MacBook Air becomes even more affordable, mostly being priced at just $799.

Rumors are high that the iPad Pro 2 series would be launched this coming week by the Cupertino-based tech giant. While the details about the iconic tablet’s launch remain unknown, speculations are high that Apple is preparing to unveil four new iPads for 2017, including a new, 10.5-inch version as well as a 9.7-inch low-cost, entry-level variant. A Forbes report has outlined what might be Apple’s strategy for its tablets this 2017, including, but not limited to, the release of four iPad variants. According to the report, Apple is preparing to unveil a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and a 9.7-inch iPad Pro sometime this coming week. Apart from these three devices, however, rumors are also high that Apple is preparing to unveil a 9.7-inch budget iPad that would be targeted at the entry-level market. Such as strategy has not been done by Apple since the first iteration of the tablet itself was launched back in 2010. Thus, it appears that contrary to the tech giant’s reputation, it appears to be preparing to dip its feet into uncharted territory. While unconventional, Apple’s strategy might actually work in the company’s favor, and it might very well usher in a new wave of interest in tablet devices. We may be just a few weeks away from getting our first look at new Apple #iPadPro2. Check out full specifications https://t.co/k33sAnWfXW pic.twitter.com/btQwrDGNl9 — Seasia Infotech (@Seasiainfotech) March 17, 2017 Tablet devices are on a decline. This is partly due to the increasing prominence of phablets, as well as the fact that tablet users do not upgrade their devices as often as flagship phone users. Even the most iconic tablet in the market, Apple’s iPad, was not spared, as the device’s sales have largely been on a decline over the years. This year, however, it appears that Apple is set to ensure that the tablet market becomes relevant again. If rumors are true and Apple is indeed getting ready to release a 9.7-inch entry-level iPad, the device would most likely be among the most attractive tablets in the market. After all, the device’s rumored price, speculated at just $299, is unprecedented for an Apple tablet. Even if Apple’s low-cost 9.7-inch iPad does not get released with the latest specs, there is a good chance that the device would manage to get the attention of consumers nonetheless. After all, the upcoming device’s $299 price would still be significantly lower than the aging iPad Air 2’s $399 asking price, thereby making it an attractive purchase for consumers who are looking for a capable tablet computer. Apple Rumored to Launch New 9.7-Inch iPad Pro 2 Before End of March https://t.co/MKFam8JURc #AppleRumors #iPadPro2 pic.twitter.com/TxjJuBcJSs — GiveMe (@Give_4me) March 16, 2017 Apple’s upcoming 10.5-inch iPad Pro is also notable, considering that the device would be debuting an entirely new design with a completely new screen size. If rumors are to be believed about the upcoming device, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro would also mirror several design cues that would be found in the upcoming iPhone 8/iPhone Edition, which is speculated for release sometime this September, according to MacRumors. Among these rumored new features is a design that drastically slims down the tablet’s bezels, enabling the 10.5-inch iPad Pro to feature a frame similar in size to that of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Apart from his, embedded sensors and features like 3D Touch are also expected to debut on the upcoming device. With the 12.9-inch iPad Pro and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro getting refreshed and two new iPad variants being introduced, Apple might very well spark a new wave of interest in tablet devices. After all, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 and the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro would be geared towards power users who are focused on productivity tasks. On the other hand, the low-cost 9.7-inch iPad Pro might very well be the device that could put Apple on them the map for a very wide demographic. With this approach, Apple might very well make the iPad relevant again.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Report sheds new light on the real game-changer coming to the iPhone 8 Image Source: Gabor Balogh Chris Smith @chris_writes March 16th, 2017 at 10:52 AM Share Tweet With each new iPhone release, Apple comes out with a signature feature for the brand new flagship, a feature that then becomes the norm for the series. It was the Retina display with the iPhone 4, Touch ID with the iPhone 5s, and 3D Touch for the iPhone 6s, to name just a few. Unlike other models, the iPhone 8 might ship with a few signature features, including a curved OLED display, wireless charging, and exciting new augmented reality (AR) support. But the real game-changer this time around might not simply be the new design we’ve been hearing so much about. Don't Miss: Warning: Dangerous new Gmail phishing attack can easily steal your Google login A new report from The Wall Street Journal seems to reinforce the idea that Apple is about to dive into AR with the help of iPhone 8 this year. AR features might be built into iOS 11 and future apps, but The Journal doesn’t reveal anything about the iPhone 8’s upcoming new software. Instead, the report notes that the iPhone 8 might pack specialized hardware that’s been crafted specifically for AR. Component suppliers who have not been included in Apple’s supply chain in the past might see a surge in sales this year thanks to the iPhone 8. The Journal focuses on a particular type of component that’s more sophisticated than anything found in previous iPhones: 3D sensors. 3D sensors are currently used as range finders and proximity detectors in the iPhone 7, but more advanced sensors are apparently in the works for the iPhone 8. “The sensors work by sending invisible light beams that bounce back from objects nearby,” The Journal writes. “This can be useful for facial recognition or for gesture control, like deleting an email by waving in front of the phone. The ability to map the surrounding three-dimensional environment could prove useful for augmented reality applications.” Lumentum is a company that might provide these new sensors for the iPhone, and it’s the “biggest hint” that Apple is going after AR. “We shipped our first revenue into what we believe to be a high-volume mobile-device application,” Lumentum CEO Alan Lowe said in an earnings call last month. The company ““could imagine quarters of $100-plus million type of marketplace growing to over $1 billion.” STMicroelectronics said in January that it ramped up its capital expenditure on account of a “newly won program” that’ll deliver “substantial revenue” in the second half of the year. STM also makes 3D sensors, and it’s a name that has been previously mentioned in connection with Apple’s iPhone.

Sara Barker March 20, 2017 11AM medium text large text This is the final week of the series that asks if a Windows user can become a Mac convert in 30 days (click here for week 1, here for week 2 and here for week 3). And it’s time for the big faceoff as I put Windows and Mac head to head. First in build, then in the operating systems. MacBook Pro vs notebook build This is an unfair category because Apple products are built in the same way, whereas the various PC/notebook manufacturers vary wildly in both quality, price bracket and specs. MacBook Pro: You get exactly what you see on a demo machine in any tech store. But there is no customisation. You do have to pay extra on an already rather high price tag for the accessories, but chances are if you can afford a MacBook, you can afford to buy the accessories too. It took a lot of adjusting to the keyboard and trackpad; but luckily Apple provided an external keyboard that felt better to work with. The Touch Bar is nice for image editing in apps like Photoshop but in truth I haven’t really used it beyond basic functionalities like brightness. In fairness, I never really used the F keys that much on any keyboard anyway. Windows-based notebooks: You can take more time to do your research and drill down into the things such as RAM, keyboard style, design, specs, graphics and portability for something that works best for you, rather than factory-produced and rigid systems. I would never want to be locked into buying only a couple of devices just to run an OS so Windows-based vendors win this round. The dongle mess MacBook Pro: Fail. I can understand putting a few USB C ports on a notebook to encourage people to switch to newer technology, but putting ALL ports as USB C really stuffs it if you want to use a humble USB stick or connect an external monitor. It is an inconvenience and eyesore to have a bulky dongle plugged in just to connect a single peripheral.  This is a good lesson for PC manufacturers: If you’re gonna implement USB C, do it slowly, include traditional USB ports and try not to alienate those of us who aren’t ‘hip’ enough to catch up right now. Not all of us are early adopters or the early majority. MacOS Sierra vs Windows 10 MacOS Sierra: Despite a couple of glitches here and there, the operating system itself hasn’t given me any troubles in terms of system updates. It’s also user friendly once you know your way around. It is, however, something that doesn’t quite have the amount of user settings and customisation that I would have liked, but it’s an OS and it does what it should do. System upgrades are free so you'll never have to buy a new OS again. Windows 10: Yes, Microsoft is forcing the ‘upgrades’ on everyone, and yes there are a heap of privacy issues (some of which are easier to turn off if you know how), Windows 10 is a best that takes some getting used to. I am one of those people who loved Windows 7, and I far prefer it to Mac OS or Windows 10. The upgrades from Windows 7 and 8 were also free however those wanting to purchase Windows 10 licences for their older PCs or those buying PCs out of the box may still be shelling out the dough. Software: Pages vs Word Pages: It's free, it's effective, and it's a native Apple app. It does have annoying autocorrects, but it’s a basic word processor that does what it needs to do. A quick look at Numbers and even Keynote lead me to believe the same thing. Free doesn't necessarily have to mean basic, but in this case it's all about simple functionality. Microsoft Word: Word is my go-to. It costs, it can be expensive and it has so much more variety and back compatibility on Windows. There are heaps of functionalities like mail merge; it’s comprehensive, flexible and it looks great.  Other word processing programmes such as LibreOffice also offer a more detailed look at word processing (and other office applications). It could possibly wipe Office off the map if it tried; and ultimately it's still a step up from Pages. Finder vs Windows Explorer They’re both similar in style, but Explorer has the added advantage of showing many more folders and being able to customise most of them. Finder’s interface is kind of drab and I was kind of annoyed that the ‘delete’ button doesn’t automatically send files to the trash. App Store vs Windows Store After my spiel a while back, I did a comparison and found that they’re both pretty much similar. I like the Windows Store interface better but using Apple’s App Store to download and authorises purchases using the fingerprint sensor was far better than putting in a password all the time. Security Mac: As I’ve mentioned, Mac is less prone to cyber attacks, but it doesn’t mean they don’t happen. Don’t be fooled, because it could cost you dearly. Windows: Unfortunately for Microsoft, the security timing couldn’t be worse as it held off on a mass of security updates from February - then released them all in March a few days ago. That’s going to hurt your bandwidth. My home Windows computer gobbled up 1GB+ of updates. Windows will be the target of most cyber attacks for the immediate future, at least. So, I’m going to hand security to Macs - tentatively, I might add. It’s not a deal maker or breaker.  As someone who watches the torrent of security breaches come in over the wire every day, it’s so clear that everyone should back up their data, everyone should use antivirus/anti-malware no matter what operating system you use.  The final verdict Side by side, I have to come to the conclusion that both Windows and Mac are good at what they need to do. Mac is let down by a rigid build that lacks customisation; Windows is let down by its ongoing  Windows 10 saga and security issues.  Both have ethical murky waters (as has been highlighted in the media recently) and both are massive tech giants. So have I converted to a Mac lover? Not really. I think I can now navigate between Mac and Windows after years of one-sided exposure; but in the end they’re just operating systems that both allow me to work - and play.  Broadband Compare – compare 1000s of broadband deals in NZ email facebook twitter google+ linkedin Related Apple devices are easier to use than rival devices, says Jamf The 30 day MacBook Pro challenge week 3: Can a Windows user become a Mac convert?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Two things about the new LG G6 are driving me absolutely insane Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Zach Epstein @zacharye March 17th, 2017 at 12:53 PM Share Tweet LG is the first big-name smartphone vendor to debut a new flagship device in 2017, and its new LG G6 is pretty spectacular. I gave readers a hands-on look at the G6 and some first impressions back in late February when it was first announced, and now LG’s US carrier partners have finally announced the LG G6’s release date. Verizon subscribers will be able to pick up the hot new flagship phone in just two weeks on March 30th, while the rest of the major wireless carriers in the US will release the phone a week later on April 7th. Reports suggest that G6 pre-sales have exceeded everyone’s expectations, but that shouldn’t be much of a surprise to anyone who has seen the device in person. The G6 is the first in a wave of next-generation flagship phones with displays that take up almost all of the front, and LG’s new handset packs plenty of power to compliment that pretty face. I’ve been using a pre-release version of the phone for the past few weeks though, and as great as the G6 is, there are two major design flaws that are driving me crazy. Don't Miss: There’s a mysterious new Google phone in the works and it isn’t the Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL Newsflash: design is a big deal. Smartphone functionality has been relatively stagnant for the past few years, and that isn’t expected to change very much in 2017. What will change this year, however, is smartphone design. Vendors finally have technology at their disposal that will allow them to create handsets that come closer than ever before to the all-screen smartphone of our dreams. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will feature a fresh new design with no side bezels and barely any bezels above or below the screens. Apple’s iPhone 8 will reportedly sport a similar design when it debuts in September. But there’s only one big-name phone company that has already unveiled its new kind-of-sort-of-all-screen flagship phone, and I’ve spent the last few weeks with it. It’s awesome. The fact that LG has managed to cram a gorgeous 5.7-inch QHD+ display into a smartphone that’s about the same size as Apple’s iPhone 7, which features a 4.7-inch screen, is incredible. That’s an extra inch in diagonal size, not to mention the G6’s pixel density of 564 ppi compared to 326 ppi on the iPhone 7. The G6 is beautiful, powerful, and ridiculously compact for a phone with such a big screen. But as they say, the devil is in the details. Apple separates its phones from the pack in a number of ways, and attention to detail is somewhere near the top of the list. Apple’s high standards when it comes to design and quality have forced rivals to elevate their game; it seems like forever, but Samsung’s flagship phones were made out of flimsy plastic as recently as three years ago. LG has also made great strides this year with the G6, but there are to design issues that are setting off every OCD alarm in my body. Both of these problems are inexcusable, but for me, the first one is by far the worst. What’s the one part of your smartphone you look at and interact with more than anything else? Yes, the screen, and the G6’s “FullVision Display” is a sight to behold. It’s big, it’s bright, colors leap off the phone, and the contrast is outstanding. Beyond panel quality though, there are two signature display features. The first is the design, which we’ve covered. The second is the round corners that give the phone a very cool look. Except, the corners aren’t round. 😡 In each of the screen’s four corners, LG hasn’t sloped the pixels on the panel properly. So instead of smooth, round corners on the G6 you’re left with rough, jagged edges that look horrible. I find that they constantly draw my eye away from the content on the screen, which is just awful, needless to say. It’s difficult to capture the full horror in a photo, but here’s a picture from xda-developers to at least give you an idea of what we’re dealing with here: It might seem like a silly gripe, but I assure you it’s not. The screen is the most important component of a smartphone when it comes to user interaction, and a mistake like this is inexcusable. I actually get angry every time I look at this phone, because the screen is so stunning aside from this misstep. It’s impossible to unsee. I would be remiss if I failed to remind readers once again at this point that the G6 I’m using is a pre-release handset. It is possible that the release version of the phone doesn’t have this issue. That said, I’ve seen a dozen different units at this point and they all had the same jagged edges in each corner. From what I’ve heard, that’s how the phone will ship. My second problem with the G6’s design isn’t quite as infuriating since it’s not literally staring you in the face each and every time you use the phone. It’s still another bizarre misstep that should never have made it to production though, and it involves the shape of the phone. Most phones are symmetrical from front to back. For example, if you look at the side edges of the iPhone 7, you’ll see a perfectly round curve that slopes evenly from the front to the back. That’s not the case with the G6. Instead, looking at the phone from its top side, the shape is like a rounded trapezoid — the sides are wider at one end of the slope than they are at the other. This is done intentionally, and it’s actually a very good idea. There’s just one problem: It’s backwards. 😡😡 Instead of following the contour of a hand and placing the wider edge in front like the Galaxy S7, LG made the G6 wider in the back. As a result, the phone is very comfortable to hold… when the display is face-down in your hand. When you hold the G6 properly with the screen facing you, it doesn’t feel good at all. Again, it’s not terribly easy to explain, but once you notice it you’ll never un-notice it. The simple fact of the matter is that it’s troubling to me that LG would greenlight any phone with issues like these, let alone the company’s 2017 flagship phone. LG has never been a leader where attention to detail is concerned, but little mistakes like this ruin the experience.

The Apple boss probably does now. Duan is the reclusive billionaire who founded Oppo and Vivo, the twin smartphone brands that dealt the world’s largest company a stinging defeat in China last year. Once derided as cheap iPhone knockoffs, they leapfrogged the rankings and shoved Apple Inc out of the top three in 2016 — when iPhone shipments fell in China for the first time. They managed to do it because the American smartphone giant didn’t adapt to local competition, the entrepreneur told Bloomberg in what he said was his first interview in 10 years. Oppo and Vivo employed tactics Apple was reluctant to match, such as cheaper devices with high-end features, for fear of jeopardising its winning formula elsewhere, Duan said. “Apple couldn’t beat us in China because even they have flaws,” the 56-year-old electronics mogul said. “They’re maybe too stubborn sometimes. They made a lot of great things, like their operating system, but we surpass them in other areas.” That’s not to say Duan doesn’t appreciate the iPhone maker’s global clout. In fact, the billionaire’s obsession with his US rival is legion: He’s long been a big-time investor in Apple and an unabashed fan of its chief executive officer. “I’ve met Tim Cook on several occasions. He might not know me but we’ve chatted a little,” Duan said. “I like him a lot.” Apple couldn’t confirm Duan’s meeting with Cook when contacted by Bloomberg. But Duan has blogged incessantly about Apple’s products, share price and operations since 2013, when the company was worth half what it is today. He needs “a really big pocket” because he carries four devices, including a heavily-used iPhone. In a 2015 post, he argued Apple’s profit should reach US$100 billion (RM443.3 billion) within five years. Today, Duan won’t say when he actually bought in but says much of his overseas wealth remains tied up in the iPhone maker. He even lives in Palo Alto, an easy drive from Apple’s new UFO-like headquarters in Cupertino. “Apple is an extraordinary company. It is a model for us to learn from,” Duan said. “We don’t have the concept of surpassing anyone, the focus instead is to improve ourselves.” Oppo’s gains against Apple may now earn an even broader following for the billionaire dubbed China’s Warren Buffett by local media for his investment acumen. Born in Jiangxi, a birthplace of Mao Zedong’s Communist revolution, Duan began his career at a state-run vacuum tube plant before making his name with homegrown electronics. Duan left the factory floor around 1990, when China was just embracing capitalism and opening industries to private investment. He headed to southern China’s Guangdong province, then the cradle of liberal reforms, to run a struggling electronics plant. His first product was the “Subor” gaming console with dual-cartridge slots — a direct shot at Nintendo Co’s classic Family Computer, known elsewhere as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The 100- to 400-yuan Subor became a hit in the absence of local competitors. Duan even enlisted Kung Fu star Jackie Chan to endorse the device. By 1995, revenue from the Subor exceeded one billion yuan. Duan left to set up a new business that year as the operation flourished — a pattern he would repeat in later years. He christened his second venture Bubugao, literally “rising higher step-by-step.” BBK, as the company came to be known, created a popular line of VCD and MP3 players but later also made DVD players for global brands. Subsidiary Bubugao Communication Equipment Co became one of the country’s biggest feature-phone makers around 2000, going head-to-head with Nokia and Motorola. It was the first iPhone in 2007 that paved the way for Oppo and Vivo. While they share a common founder in Duan, the sister brands are fierce competitors, trotting out duelling marketing campaigns in markets from India to Southeast Asia. Their salesmanship philosophy plays well in emerging markets, IDC research manager Kiranjeet Kaur said. “The companies fully understand how to make the best of their people, a specialty they inherited from Duan,” said Nicole Peng, a senior director at Canalys. Importantly, they understood their millennial audience. “Many of their managers are young and have been working at the company since graduation.” Duan’s latest endeavours were, in part, dreamed up in Apple’s backyard. By 2001 at the age of 40, Duan had decided to move to California to focus on investment and philanthropy, later installing his family in a mansion he reportedly bought from Cisco Systems Inc Chairman John Chambers. But the advent of the smartphone forced the entrepreneur out of retirement. By the second half of 2000s, BBK was on the verge of falling apart as sales of its basic devices slowed. The likes of Huawei and Coolpad were making smartphones priced at around 1,000 yuan. That nearly put the company under, Duan recalled. “We were in serious discussions about how to close the company peacefully — in a way that the employees can leave unhurt and suppliers don’t lose money,” he said. Those intense brainstorming sessions spawned the two businesses that would go on to embody Duan’s greatest success. In 2005, the entrepreneur and his protégé Tony Chen decided to create a new company. Dubbed Oppo, it sold music players but ramped up to smartphones in 2011. In 2009, BBK itself created Vivo, headed by another of Duan’s disciples, Shen Wei. “Making mobile phones was not my call,” said Duan. “But I reckoned we could do well in this market.” At first, neither label garnered much attention. The iPhone was captivating users with its revolutionary apps system and elegant interface, while BlackBerrys lorded over the corporate market. But Oppo and Vivo then developed a marketing-blitz approach that relied on local celebrity endorsement and a vast re-sellers’ store network across China. They crafted an affordable image that appealed to a millennial crowd, then tricked out their devices with high-end specs. On the surface, Oppo and Vivo phones now routinely surpass the iPhone on measures such as charging speeds, memory and battery life. It paid off. The duo together shipped more than 147 million smartphones in China in 2016, dwarfing Huawei Technologies Co’s 76.6 million units, Apple’s 44.9 million and Xiaomi’s 41.5 million, IDC estimates. Oppo and Vivo both doubled their 2015 haul. In the fourth quarter, they were No. 1 and No. 3, respectively — Huawei was second. Their approach worked particularly well in lower-tier cities, where mid-range phones became a mainstream hit, said Tay Xiaohan, an IDC analyst. Duan’s smartphone progeny are also gaining some momentum beyond their home turf. In the fourth quarter, Oppo and Vivo were fourth and fifth in the world, respectively. About a quarter of Oppo’s shipments went to markets like India, where it hopes to dig in before Apple establishes a meaningful presence. “Smartphones are an unprecedented opportunity. We forecast at least for the next 10 or 20 years, there’s no replacement. But we don’t know,” Duan said. Cook said on the weekend that Apple doesn’t have a specific goal for market share. “The competition is more fierce in China — not only in this industry, but in many industries,” Cook told the China Development Forum in Beijing. “I think that’s a credit to a number of local companies that put their energies into making good products.” Duan has increasingly kept his distance from the Chinese smartphone makers despite remaining a significant shareholder (he won’t say how much). He says he prefers to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy California with his journalist wife and kids. In fact, he attends board meetings but claims to get most of his information on Oppo and Vivo from the internet, to avoid “disturbing them.” His rivals have been less considerate. Last October, Xiaomi Corp co-founder Lei Jun lambasted competitors who build dense store channels in rural areas in pursuit of quick sales. In an interview with China Entrepreneurs Magazine in October, Lei accused such players of using “imbalanced information” to trick buyers into shunning Xiaomi, precipitating its decline from the top spot. “Those who said this were insane,” Duan said without naming names. “When someone talks about an information imbalance, deep down they believe consumers are idiots.” His most visible passion these days is stock investment, which is why he agreed to pay a then-record US$620,100 in 2006 to lunch with Buffett. Quotes from the Sage of Omaha still pepper Duan’s blogposts, right alongside tips on golf and Apple. Duan cemented his reputation as a savvy financier in part by digging his friend, Netease Inc founder William Ding, out of a hole. Ding’s internet company tanked to as low as 13 cents after the dot-com bubble burst, then almost became the first US-listed Chinese company to get tossed off the Nasdaq over an auditing issue. Duan came to his friend’s aid, buying about 5 percent of Netease with just US$2 million in 2002, when the stock price averaged 16 cents. Company filings show he still held just over 4 million shares as of March 2009, but Duan said he sold much of that when Netease hit US$40. His other much-studied holding is premium-liquor company Kweichow Moutai Co. He said he bought in at 180 yuan in late 2012. While it nearly halved in 2014, Moutai today trades above 370 yuan. Duan isn’t shy about talking up his trades, not least of which is Apple, which remains near a record high despite a rare sales decline in 2016. But looking back on his decades as first entrepreneur then stock-picker, his proudest moments remain rooted in BBK. Though he claims to keep it at arm’s length, he admits to worrying about succession and whether the company culture will survive another generation of leaders. And while BBK’s Vivo and Duan’s own Oppo have done well, there’s no certainty in a fast-moving business. Both are starting to ramp up everything from the features on their phones to marketing campaigns: Oppo notably used Barcelona’s Mobile World Congress to unveil its most advanced camera technology yet, signalling a new maturity. One thing’s for sure, Duan doesn’t see himself returning to an active executive, leaving others to deal with the next challenge. “I’ve made it clear many years ago, I will never make a comeback,” he said. “If there’s a problem they can’t fix, then neither can I.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Smartphone device can test sperm quality Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Montblanc just launched a smartwatch — here’s why it matters China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple in China Google could have three Pixel handsets in store for late 2017 Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles China’s secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple Apple CEO Tim Cook calls for more global trade with China Apple plans two more Chinese research hubs as iPhone sales slow (VIDEO) Apple’s Tim Cook attacks Trump’s travel ban (VIDEO) Apple reports blockbuster quarter as iPhone sales top estimates Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues The iPad Pro needs a refresh: Here’s what to expect Dan Moren 20 March, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News I think we can all agree that it’s about time for an iPad update. The most recently updated model, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, is approaching the year-old mark. And far be it for me to argue that every Apple product needs to be updated every year, but the iPad has struggled a bit over the last few years, and it could use a jumpstart. So, assuming that new iPads are coming down the pipeline – and the consensus seems to be that they’ll arrive sooner rather than later – what can we expect? What makes a Pro? Apple’s slowly been transitioning its iPad line to the Pro moniker, starting with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro released in November of 2015. But it’s still not clear what distinguishes a pro iPad: Apple Pencil compatibility? The Smart Connector? Four speakers? Even the current models don’t have parity, with the 9.7-inch boasting several features that the 12.9-inch model lacks, like a wide colour gamut, True Tone display, better cameras, and broader LTE support. I expect to see a revision to both Pro tablets that brings the specs a little closer together. The 12.9-inch Pro shouldn’t lag behind the 9.7-inch model, even if the smaller tablet is probably more popular. In general, Apple offers more in bigger, costlier models, not less – just look at the Plus series of iPhones. The iPad Pro is ready for a performance bump, too. Both models are currently built on the A9X system-on-a-chip, but the iPhone has moved on to the A10 Fusion and will probably this year sport an A11. The question is whether Apple will follow its pattern of updating the iPads to an A10X, or simply jump ahead to the A11X. My bet would be the former, if only because the iPads come first, and it’s hard to imagine the company stealing the thunder of an iPhone launch this fall. New iPads tend to bring new cameras, as well as a potential upgrade to display quality. But for anything beyond that, you’ll have to get a peek behind Apple’s curtain. Expanding the family Beyond individual specs, it’s worth wondering what the overall 2017 lineup looks like. The biggest rumour is a new iPad model featuring a 10.5-inch display. Studio Neat’s Dan Provost made a compelling argument that a 10.5-inch display could fit in a chassis very similar to the 9.7-inch model. But then what happens to the smaller one? Because having 10.5- and 9.7-inch iPad Pros would seem to needlessly complicate the lineup. What could happen is that the 10.5-inch model becomes the flagship iPad Pro, leaving the 9.7-inch version as the older, discounted model, where it will, in turn, displace the iPad Air 2. (The other possibility is that the 9.7-inch Pro vanishes completely, leaving the iPad Air 2 as the budget model.) Then there’s the iPad mini, which was lasted updated back in 2015, and uses the A8 processor that debuted in the iPhone 6. It’s about time for the mini to get updated or to shuffle off this mortal coil; my money’s on the first option, since there have been some rumours floated about a 7.9-inch iPad Pro. That makes sense, since it would unify specs across the line, but also allow Apple to keep the iPad mini 4 around as a low-cost option. As neat and tidy as it would then be to have a non-Pro 12.9-inch model, don’t hold your breath – right now, that seems like a Pro-only size. Better software Given the timing, it seems unlikely that a major iOS release will launch with these iPads, but we’re likely to see the official release of iOS 10.3, which has been in beta for several weeks. But iOS 11 should down the pipe in short order, and hopefully it pays attention to the iPad, which got short shrift in iOS 10. The multitasking features in iOS 9 were enough to tide us over while showing a glimpse of what could come, but the tablet is clearly a second-class citizen compared to the Mac when it comes to real, honest-to-goodness multitasking. So really, any iPad announcement that might arrive in the next few weeks is only the first shoe to drop. We’ll have to wait until iOS 11 debuts at WWDC this summer to get the whole story.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry Apple, Google and Facebook Have Backed Away From Fighting Trump’s Latest Travel Ban By Rafia Shaikh Mar 16, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Earlier in February, a number of tech companies had filed a legal brief opposing President Trump’s first executive order on immigration. Apple and Google were among the first to respond to this travel ban. However, these tech giants have now reportedly “backed away” from the legal fight against the second version of this travel ban. Apple, Facebook, Google, and others “skip” fighting the second travel ban “Apple, Google and Facebook are among more than 60 technology companies that appear to have backed away from the legal fight against U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban, deciding not to put their weight behind a lawsuit seeking to block the second version of his executive order,” Reuters reported late last night. Related [Updated: More Join] Apple, Facebook, Google, Uber, and Others File Legal Brief to Oppose President’s Immigration Order While the first amicus brief that was filed to oppose the original executive order had received support from 127 companies, the latest brief filed in the federal court in Hawaii on Tuesday on behalf of Silicon Valley companies listed support of only 58 companies. Advertisement Microsoft, Dropbox, Netflix, Twitter, Intel, Kickstarter are some other companies that had supported the original brief but didn’t sign the latest one. However, while Reuters’ report is based on the fact that the above-mentioned companies haven’t signed the “friend-of-the-court” brief yet, they could still do so. For example, Uber was reported to be in the process of adding its name to the brief. Companies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. “We do expect the group to expand.” It should be noted that Google and Apple were among the most outspoken companies who not only signed the original brief but had also donated to the crisis funds. Google CEO Sundar Pichai had said it is “painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues”. Cofounder Sergey Brin was also spotted at a march at San Francisco International Airport. Apple CEO Tim Cook had written a letter to his staff, noting that “Apple would not exist without immigration“. Reuters added that while the lawsuit may have lost some big names, it is still likely to succeed. A Hawaiian judge last night ordered an emergency halt to the latest ban, saying that it would cause “irreparable injury” by violating First Amendment protections against religious discrimination. Another judge in Maryland also blocked the latest travel ban, which was due to begin midnight on Thursday. President Trump has called this ruling “unprecedented judicial overreach”. Related Uber CEO Quits President Trump’s Economic Council After Criticism While it is unlikely that Apple, Google or other tech companies are more favorable to the second travel ban considering how heavily they rely on immigrants, none of the companies responded to a Reuters’ query on why they have chosen not to sign the latest brief.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Security Hackers Manage to Get Root Access on macOS – Two Safari Security Flaws Reported By Rafia Shaikh Mar 16, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit The annual Pwn2own conference is underway and that means we are going to be seeing some interesting – and critical – security vulnerabilities. Since Apple attracts most of the security researchers’ efforts (three of the ten attempts targeted Safari security on day one), we will be talking about the two zero-day vulnerabilities affecting Apple’s Safari browser that were showcased at the annual security conference. Two zero-day Safari security vulnerabilities reported by hackers With over $1 million in prizes, you can be sure that this conference attracts the best talent from around the world. The Zero Day Initiative has now posted the results of yesterday, confirming two Safari security vulnerabilities. Related Hackers Use Microsoft Edge to Pull Off a Full Virtual Machine Escape Day one of the conference managed to get two independent hackers $28,000 after they successfully demonstrated attacks on Safari using a use-after-free (UAF) in the browser combined with three logic bugs. Independent hackers Groß and Baumstark targeted Safari with a flaw that allowed them to scroll a message on a MacBook Pro Touch Bar. Advertisement In a partial win, Samuel Groß (@5aelo) and Niklas Baumstark (@_niklasb) earn some style points by leaving a special message on the touch bar of the Mac. They used a use-after-free (UAF) in Safari combined with three logic bugs and a null pointer dereference to exploit Safari and elevate to root in macOS. They still managed to earn $28,000 USD and 9 Master of Pwn points. Following this, Chaitin Security Research Lab also targeted Safari using a total of six bugs in their exploit chain, winning a prize of $35,000. Related Hackers Manage to Get Root Access on macOS – Two Safari Security Flaws Reported The Chaitin Security Research Lab (@ChaitinTech) successfuly exploited Apple Safari to gain root access on macOS by using a total of six bugs in their exploit chain including an info disclosure in Safari, four different type confusions bugs in the browser, and an a UAF in WindowServer. This earned the team $35,000 and 11 points towards Master of Pwn. Details of these flaws haven’t been shared since Apple will first patch up these vulnerabilities before details are made available to the public. Overall, the participating teams earned a total of $233,000 in prizes on day one. Apart from Safari, researchers found flaws in Microsoft Edge (which helped Tencent Security earn a massive $80,000), Ubuntu Desktop and Adobe Reader.

Right now on the Apple store website, you can buy an iPhone 7 in rose gold, gold, silver, black or jet black. Conspicuous from Apple's colour wheel since the 1980s is beige. No matter how much money you have to throw away on aesthetics, you cannot buy a beige iPhone. Until now. Colorware have just launched the iPhone 7 Plus Retro edition for people who don't just have more money than sense, but have such a discrepancy between the two that they wouldn't fit on the same line graph. Before I reveal exactly how much they're charging for it though, let's take a moment to marvel at its beauty: Now let's slowly turn over that price tag and… WOAH. $US1,899. Okay, putting it back now, being super-careful not to drop it. To be entirely fair to Colorware, they have gone for the second-most expensive iPhone 7 available – the 256GB iPhone 7 Plus. I say second-most, because they've hand painted the details on top of it, and presumably the finish of the Jet Black version would get in the way, but all the same the base iPhone costs $US969, which means the paint job is a whopping $US930. You may be wondering if anyone will buy one at that price, and the answer is almost certainly yes. Last year's iPhone 6S retro repaint cost only a little less, and is marked as sold out on the site. If you are interested, they're selling it in limited numbers, with the first 25 getting a handwritten number of authenticity. It dispatched in two to three weeks, meaning it'll be even more retro by the time it reaches your hands.

Watchlist | 26 Feb 2017 | Print  | Comment (7) Apple Remote Desktop 3.9 by Agen G. N. Schmitz In version 3.9 of Apple Remote Desktop — the remote management software’s first update since early 2015 — Apple now requires OS X 10.10.5 Yosemite, but provides backward compatibility for communicating with Apple Remote Desktop clients running any version of 10.8 Mountain Lion, 10.9 Mavericks, or 10.10.4 Yosemite. (The Apple Remote Desktop Client comes with the operating system, and version 3.9 will be made available via Software Update to users running 10.10.5 Yosemite or later.) The Remote Desktop admin app also adds support for the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro, enables administrators to export and restore an encrypted list of computers and user credentials, and enables admins to use an assistant cursor to call attention to items on a remote screen. Many users are experiencing a problem where client machines fail to authenticate and show the status “Needs Upgrade.” Reportedly, the solution is to go to Remote Desktop > Preferences > Security and select “Allow communication with older clients (less secure).” However, admins are reporting other problems as well, so it’s worth holding off on this update until the community gives it the all clear.

However, many 10.12.3 systems are failing to authenticate to other 10.12.3 systems for no obvious reason. Surprisingly, Screen Sharing is a workaround over ARD as that works (and more curiously on the second try.) Go figure!!! Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-27 17:30 Thanks for the info — sounds like it might be worth waiting for another update here. Reply Glen McAllister  2017-02-28 03:17 Definitely. I just had to restore both ARD Admin app & Client on my Mac to restore the ability to login in to an account different to the one currently logged in as, which is essential functionality, AFAIC. Had to disable SIP to restore the client in Time Machine. Reply Anonymous   2017-02-28 16:52 he he he ... i'm Anonymous again ... lol Reply Nunyuh  2017-03-06 20:40 LOL. Found out that as soon as this update began it slowed my MacBook down to the point it was stalling. So not interested in this latest update. Also, using the encryptions available not going to something less secure doesn't go with the purpose of encrpitng data in the first place. Apple communities seem to say there should be another update coming soon to correct the issues. Reply Anonymous   2017-03-10 00:33 The other issue floating around apparently has to do with using the short name versus the long name of the user. (see https://discussions.apple.com/message/31437644#message31437644) I just restored access by switching from the long name to to the short name as the ARD login Reply Petert   2017-03-16 20:15 We had a problem in one of our Music Labs where the teachers iMac running ARD could see all the Student units but only as Black Screens in the Observer Group View, no individual control (Screen Share) was available The 3.9.2 update release Mar 15, 2017 did not fix this. The work around fix was to: 1. On student iMac - manually switch off 'Remote Management' and enable 'Screen Sharing' in the Sharing Pref Pane 2. On Teachers iMac - Menu | Go | Connect to Server | Browse 2a. Select the Student iMac you just shared, add in the Admin User Details you would normally use in ARD in the Dialogue, asking for permission (to connect) 3. Return to the Student iMac - allow connection in the now visible dialog. 3a. Re-enable 'Remote Management' in the Sharing Pref Pane and reboot the Student unit. Repeat as required for each student mac. ARD could now see the screens in Group Observe mode and 'Screen Share' as you would normally expect. A most painful manual fix on 36 student units. pete Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

Apple's mysterious 'wireless device' has been revealed in FCC photos Kif Leswing Mar. 19, 2017, 5:53 PM 211,269 facebook linkedin twitter email print Last fall, Apple submitted an application to the Federal Communications Commission for an unannounced device with the model number A1844. At the time, the "wireless device," as it was described in the application, was a mystery. Speculation mounted in some Apple circles as a result. The application said it was a low-powered device with both Bluetooth and near-field communication wireless functionality. On Sunday, a user manual and photos of the mystery device were published by the FCC. The mystery device appears to be a badge reader that attaches to a door assembly, most likely for Apple corporate use: FCC Here's another look, according to an image included as part of an NFC test: FCC The user manual is not intended for general consumers and includes specific backend wiring instructions. Here's what it does, according to the user manual: Usage Instructions 1. Present the company provided credential to the reader. 2. The reader will indicate granted access by briefly changing color to green and playing a sound. Declined access is indicated by red color and a second sound. Apple has several smart-home products on the market — most notably software called HomeKit — that enable manufacturers to make smart locks and other products that work with the iPhone. Apple has never announced plans to sell its own smart lock or other Apple-designed smart-home hardware, and this electronic lock seems specifically designed for Apple corporate or retail use. Apple is putting the finishing touches on its new Apple Park campus, expected to open next month. When A1844 was revealed in the FCC application, some speculated it could be a new Apple TV or AirPort router, based on the limited information included in the filing. Apple has filed similarly cryptic applications for "wireless device" models, such as A1846, since then. Apple did not immediately return a request for comment.

Credit: REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Related iPhone 8 launch will see Apple release 3 brand-new devices iPhone 8 Rumor Rollup: The Great iPhone 8 freak-out, no worries about Galaxy... iPhone 8 will feature a curved OLED display Video Cool Yule Tools- Hot Picks Apple's rumor mill sometimes works in mysterious ways. With Apple's next-gen iPhone, for example, a sketchy report that surfaced in mid-2016 claimed that Apple's upcoming iPhone was such a huge upgrade that Apple was going to skip the iPhone 7's nomenclature and simply call its 2017 iPhone the iPhone 8. And from there, the iPhone 8 naming convention stuck. More recently, reports surfaced indicating Apple was still planning on releasing three brand-new iPhone models: an iPhone 7s, an iPhone 7s Plus, and a newly redesigned iPhone dubbed the iPhone 8. This, of course, never made much sense given that releasing an iPhone 8 alongside an iPhone 7s would not only cause widespread confusion, but it might also stifle overall iPhone sales. After all, who would want to buy an iPhone 7s when an iPhone 8 is already out on the market. Not to fear, Apple seems to know what it's doing. In case you missed it, a report from Macotakara earlier this month relayed that Apple's flagship 2017 iPhone—the one with the edgeless OLED display—won't be called the iPhone 8, but rather the iPhone Edition. If accurate, this is a smart move on Apple's part given that the "Edition" moniker is a great way to differentiate its flagship and more margin-friendly iPhone model while not making the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus models seem like yesterday's news. Also of note is the claim that the rumored iPhone Edition will launch a little bit later than the iPhone 7 and 7s, though we'll likely hear more rumblings about that from the rumor mill sooner rather than later. As a final point, some additional iPhone Edition rumors we've seen point to enhanced internals, improved Siri functionality, facial recognition software and, last but not least, a new facial recognition technology that may be a part of Apple's big push into augmented reality.

Mobile 2 0 0 March 19, 2017 iPad Pro 2 Launch: Press Release This March Or An April Event At Apple Campus? Venus Montalbo The Cupertino-based tech giant will purportedly release the new iPad Pro 2 soon. And adding to the launch anticipation for the new slate is the possibility that Apple will offer it in four major variants, including a smaller iPad Pro model. Most of the details existing online about the iPad Pro 2017 are only based on speculations, which mean nothing has been made official to the public yet by Apple, particularly when talking about its potential release date. But based on the latest grapevines, the launch of the iPad Pro 2017 models could just be around the corner. The earliest possibility for the iPad Pro 2017’s announcement could, in fact, be this week. According to MacRumors, a research firm that did not want to be named told them that Apple could reveal its new products this month and most likely, it could happen “during the week of March 20.” However, the firm did not specify the kind of Apple devices slated for release and how will they announce them. To provide a particular Apple product that might be made public in just a few days, the publication cited a prediction from a Japanese blog site Mac Otakara, which mentioned that a 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 could be announced this week. [Image by Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images] However, those who are religiously following Apple’s release traditions for its product could say that the likelihood of a proper launch event happening this week for the 2017 iPad Pro seems dubious, especially since there hasn’t been any kind of invitation sent out to media yet. So, to explain what could be a more realistic expectation from Apple this week, Mac Rumors noted the following. “Given that Apple usually invites the media to a launch event at least 10 days beforehand, and if the information we were provided about Apple announcing new products as early as next week is accurate, it is possible the so-called ‘iPad Pro 2’ could be announced via press release rather than at a launch event.” If the March announcement for the 2017 iPad Pro will not push through, the next rumored release timeframe for the updated iOS tablet is April where a keynote could be held for the first time at the Apple Campus to mark its inauguration as well. “Apple has moved ahead the production for its planned new 10.5-inch iPad to March instead of an earlier timetable set for May-June and is expected to unveil the new iPad at a product event to be held in early April,” reported DigiTimes, citing supply chain makers in Taiwan as its sources. We noted earlier in this article that four iPad Pro 2 variants could be scheduled for release this 2017. And you might already have a hint that two of these models are a 9.7-inch and a 10.5-inch versions of the iOS tablet. BGR reported that that 9.7-inch 2017 iPad will be equipped with an A9 processor while the 10.5-inch iPad Pro is getting the A10X chipset. [Image by Stephen Lam/ Getty Images] Brooke Crothers, a contributor for Forbes interviewed Rhoda Alexander, IHS Markit’s Director Tablets and PC, who said that the 2017 iPad Pro design with a 10.5-inch display will have slimmer bezels, resulting to similar physical size as that of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. “You end up with a unit that’s the same physical size as the 9.7 inch,” Alexander explained. This will make it possible for customers to also use accessories such as the Smart Keyboard with the 10.5-inch tablet. Catering to the high-end market, an updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro is reportedly in the works, too, which could be boasting of a 12MP primary camera as well as True Tone display, which the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro uses. An upgraded 7.9-inch iPad may also be set for release this year, unofficially referred to as the iPad Mini Pro by tech news publications.

The new recording, which is being referred to as a “playlist” rather than an album, is entitled More Life – and features a whopping 22-tracks as it boasts a personal message from the Ontario-born rapper himself. It reads as follows: More Life. More time with family and friends. More Life. I’ve still got vibrations to send. More Life. They say that we could live forever At night I pray it’s true I’ve done so much in my short time and still there’s more to do But if someone should come collecting Sooner than we’re all expecting At least the life you lived was one for you Despite Drake‘s heavy involvement in Apple Music’s initial launch, (and the artist being a regular on Beats 1’s OVO SOUND Radio), you might be surprised to learn that Graham’s latest recording is not exclusive to the service. This is because, according to Billboard, the release of previous album –Views– last April ended a two-year running agreement between Aubrey and the Californian tech giant, which reportedly required the MC to release two albums exclusively on Apple Music – alongside providing at least one music video and TV spot to the firm. Since Drake has now come good on this original obligation with Apple, the artist is now finally free to release all future music on other streaming services. In fact, More Life is the first release from the rapper since the dropping of Views to get its simultaneous initial streaming release on Spotify, too. Apple has highlighted only a single explicit track off the new album as being potentially worthy of a listen, however. That being: KMT (feat. Giggs). Stream it on Apple Music. Get it on iTunes.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Gabor Balogh The iPhone 8 is causing problems months before it’s even announced Chris Mills @chrisfmills March 16th, 2017 at 3:29 PM Share Tweet For every year in recent memory, the iPhone has been the phone to beat. Some years Samsung pulls it off, other years their ambitions, uh, go up in flames. Things are looking even more critical than usual this year: the iPhone 8 is slated to be a bigger change and a bigger deal than usual for Apple, while Samsung is looking to rebound from a disastrous 2016. Don't Miss: Leak shows a stunning Galaxy S8 in a stolen Jet Black finish One sign that Apple is taking the iPhone 8 seriously are the supply-chain rumors surrounding OLED displays. Organic light-emitting diode screens are known for having better contrast, deeper blacks and superior energy efficiency compared to traditional LCDs, which is why Samsung and other manufacturers have used them for years. Apple has not, preferring to stick with the tech it knows and loves. But for 2017, things are changing, and Apple is throwing a wrench in everyone else’s works. There’s a limited number of OLED displays produced by manufacturers every year, and a new report suggests Apple has captured 14% of the supply. That’s enough to cause shortages for other manufacturers like Huawei, which is reportedly unable to secure a supply of OLED displays for its phones this year. Samsung is believed to be Apple’s supplier. Samsung itself produces OLED panels in-house, so the supply of OLED for Samsung’s devices is secure. According to Digitimes,”about 70% of global output of OLED panels in 2017-2018, mainly from Samsung Display, will be consumed by Samsung Electronics and Apple, therefore limiting the supply of OLED panels to other smartphone vendors, said the sources.” That’s a problem for every company not named Samsung or Apple. The report says that Oppo and Vivo have supply of OLED panels locked down already thanks to pre-existing orders, but other manufacturers are going to be out of luck. That’s actually rather bad news for consumers, as a lack of OLED panels means competing phones will be worse. That means we’re faced with another year of choosing between Samsung, Apple, and no one else. The screen is a particularly important component this year in particular, because smartphone design is moving to take away bezels and make devices entirely out of screen. We’ve already seen this no-bezel approach with the LG G6 this year, and the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 are both expected to have an edge-to-edge display with no bezel, and no home buttons either.

Sure, you’ll find deals from Apple occasionally, but there’s not much movement on product prices. Consumers often turn to eBay, Craiglist, and other alternative routes to find deals on Apple products, but these purchases can be unpredictable. Instead or trying your luck, it may be better to stick with authorized retailers such as Best Buy, which currently has 12 standout deals on top Apple products.

Safari Thorin Klosowski Mar 20, 2017, 7:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple browsers chrome downloads ios 10 ipad iphone safari Share Safari has long been the go-to browser on the iPhone, but after Apple finally opened up the secret speed enhancements in Safari to other browsers way back in iOS 8, it's now possible to ditch Safari entirely for another browser. Chrome is the most obvious choice for doing so. But is it worth it? The Contenders You have a number of browser options on iOS, but most of them, like the privacy-focused Brave, the gesture-based Dolphin, or the speed-centric Opera Mini, all fill a niche instead of trying to be your daily driver. For that, Chrome and Safari lead the pack. Here's a quick summary of their feature-set: Safari: Safari is the default browser we've all come to know so well over the years. It does everything a browser needs to do, including offering up a private browsing mode, bookmarks, and as of iOS 9, ad blocking. Safari is deeply integrated into iOS, which means you can search for something in Spotlight and open it in Safari, and by default most apps will open any links in Safari. Chrome: When Chrome originally arrived on iOS, it was slow, but still managed to work so well with Google's other products that people used it anyway. Now, the two are equally speedy. Alongside features you expect in any browser, Chrome on iOS has a few Google-specific quirks, like a built-in QR scanner, Google Now support, a translator, and more. Chrome also tends to hide a lot of its interface, foregoing the bottom navigation bar prevalent in Safari and instead placing everything up top. This is an aesthetic thing, but design matters enough that you might prefer how one works over the other. Which browser is best for you is partially a matter of preference, but it also matters what other apps you use. Let's dig into where Chrome makes more sense than Safari and vice versa. Chrome's Voice Search Works Extremely Well If you want to search for stuff online with your voice, you want to use Chrome. Google pushes its voice assistant hard in Chrome in iOS and it works stupidly well. With a hard-press of the Chrome icon you can search before even open the app, and once you're in Chrome, you'll find the voice search icon everywhere you look. More importantly, the voice search is accurate, pulling up most results perfectly. This sounds like a minor feature, but if you can't or aren't good at typing on a phone's small keyboard, having what's essentially a dictation function comes in handy. For its part, Safari has the regular old dictation button that's built into iOS, but it's not voice search specific and doesn't work as well. Of course, you can also search using Siri, but it's not as fluid or useful as the voice search in Chrome. Chrome Plays Nice With All of Google's Apps, Safari Plays Nice with Everything A while back, Apple introduced a "deep linking" feature that essentially lets apps communicate with each other. While it's not a replacement for "default" apps like on Android, it does make it so developers can do things like have a URL link from Gmail open up in Chrome instead of Safari. As you'd expect, Google has taken full advantage of this. Provided you're a Google user on a lot of services, from Drive to Gmail to Maps, you can make it so all those apps communicate with Chrome. For example, when you tap a link to a map in Chrome and it opens up Google Maps, or tap an email link in Chrome and it opens Gmail. If you're deeply invested in Google, this works wonderfully and makes it so you can ignore Safari altogether. If you're not a heavy Google user, things get less interesting. Safari is still the default browser, which means URLs you get in text messages, Apple Mail, or links you search in Spotlight all route thought through Safari. While some third-party apps, like Spark or Airmail, have an "Open in" option that lets you choose your browser, that's not the case in all apps, so you're bound to still use Safari now and again. Unless you're very much into Google, Safari is probably your best option so you don't have to bounce between the two all the time. Both Sync with Their Desktop Apps There is one final, big reason why you'd choose one browser over the other. Both Safari and Chrome sync with their desktop counterparts. This means your tabs, history, and bookmarks all sync from your phone to your desktop. If this matters to you, then you'll want to go with whichever browser you use on your computer. Personally, while syncing always seems like a cool idea, it's something I never, ever use, so this doesn't matter to me as much as I initially thought it would. If you're in the same boat and don't actually utilise this, don't let the idea that you could affect your decision for which browser to use. Safari's Reading List is Great, but Chrome Has One On the Way An often forgotten about feature in Safari is its Reading List. Here, you get a Instapaper-esque list of articles you've saved for reading later. It's great if you read a lot on your phone and have no interest in more advanced options like Pocket or Instapaper. Chrome does not offer this at all right now, but it's rumoured to be on the way soon. Until we know how that actually works, Safari is your better option here. Of course, for now, Chrome users can still use a third-party app like Pocket or Instapaper. Safari Can Block Ads and Trackers If you're someone who blocks ads or third-party trackers using an ad blocker, then your choice here is very clear: use Safari. The "content blockers" introduced in iOS 9 only support Safari, and Chrome doesn't have any similar type of plugin. These content blockers aren't about ads, they also block cookies, weird page elements, specific URLs, comments, and more. So, if you want to mess around with any of that stuff, you want to stick with Safari. The Verdict: Chrome Is Great If You're Deep In Google's Ecosystem, Safari Is Best for Everyone Else Which browser is best for you depends on a lot things, including a general preference for how it works. Some people like Chrome's more minimal aesthetic enough that features don't actually matter. Others like the fact that Safari integrates automatically without any tweaking. In any case, if you like the "feel" of one over the other, know that they're both equally speedy and feature-complete, so there's no reason to actively avoid either. The one clear difference comes if you're an avid Google product user. Chrome does an excellent job of linking up with the rest of Google's apps, enough so that you almost feel like you're not even on an iPhone. In that case, stick to Chrome and you'll be happy. If you seek out other apps that deep link to Chrome you'll be able to pretend like Safari doesn't exist. For everyone else, stick with Safari. It's come a long way over the years and it works perfectly well. Is it a little boring? Sure. But how exciting do you want your browser to be? Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

By: Vigneshravi Menon Published: Friday, March 10, 2017, 18:15 [IST] Apple followed the trend set by other smartphone manufacturers and brought out the iPhones with biggers displays. While bigger the better term has been around for time immemorable, gadgets have always followed a smaller but more powerful concept, in most areas. However, when it comes to smartphones bigger and more powerful is the mantra that's proven to be the key. With Apple making this transition and bringing out new bigger iPhones and being done with conveniently sized ones, it was an end of an era. And with the beginning of a new phase, many users were excited about having iPhones with bigger displays as it offered many new possibilities and better viewability. While on the other hand, some weren't so happy about it including me, this could also be the sole reason why many existing users also didn't upgrade to newer iPhones sooner. As older iPhones provided the convenience with their size.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Leak shows a stunning Galaxy S8 in a stolen Jet Black finish Image Source: Benjamin Geskin Zach Epstein @zacharye March 16th, 2017 at 9:41 AM Share Tweet In September 2016, Apple executives to the stage to unveil Apple’s next-generation iPhones, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. For the first time in nearly a decade of selling smartphones, Apple chose to reuse the same smartphone design for a third consecutive year; in the past, the company would introduce a brand new look every other year in order to keep things fresh. But since the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus would once again reuse the iPhone 6’s design from all the way back in 2014, Apple had to find other ways to make things more interesting. The company added a dual-lens camera to the Plus model, it doubled the amount of internal storage at each tier, and it added two new colors to its iPhone lineup, a stealth matte black and a stunning new “Jet Black” with a glossy, mirror-like finish. It looked incredible. So Samsung promptly stole it. Stop us if you’ve heard this one before… Don't Miss: Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7 Plus: Hands-on video with S8 mockup shows how they compare While there is precious little question that Samsung travels its own path more so now than it ever has in the past, some old habits are difficult to shake. Late last year, for example, it took the South Korean tech giant less than three months to steal the stunning Jet Black color Apple introduced in September. Samsung had made plenty of black phones before, of course, but it wasn’t until the new iPhones came along that the company added a glossy black option to its flagship smartphone lineup. It looks like the response to Samsung’s take on Jet Black was positive, because the company seemingly plans to keep it in the mix this year when it unveils its hotly anticipated new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ smartphones less than two weeks from today. We saw a leaked Galaxy S8 mockup pop up earlier this week in a glossy black color, and now an even bigger leak shows Samsung’s next-generation flagship phone in Jet Black once again. The images were posted on Weibo (via Slashleaks) and they show a handset that is once again believed to be a mockup. As a reminder, third parties use leaked schematics to build to-scale models of unreleased Apple and Samsung smartphones using real materials, and these photos are believed to show one such model. Additional photos of the Jet Black Galaxy S8 dummy follow below, and hopefully they can help tide Android fans over for another two weeks until Samsung finally unveils its new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ smartphones on March 29th.

This week we discuss iPhone storage speeds, the Moto G5 Plus camera and the Note5. Oh, and the lack of any capable compact Android smartphones. Aravind: Recently on a YouTube page I saw a video saying that Apple hides a secret from its users that lower memory variant of iPhone have much slower read/write speeds than the expensive higher memory models. Is it legal for apple to hide such an important thing from users (I am not sure if it is mentioned in t&c)? It was actually us that first made that discovery back in October - the memory used in the 32GB version is much slower than the one the 128GB iPhones get. In our test the write speeds were nearly 8 times slower. It certainly is legal as there are no laws mandating that makers should announce memory speeds of their smartphones and almost no maker actually does that, so we cant be sure Apple is the only one doing this. Its certainly not a very ethical way of doing things, but its not like Apple promised everyone storage that can achieve a certain speed. The good news is that it doesnt seem to affect the user experience that much, so besides the bad feeling that being treated like a second-rate customer inevitably gives, its not too big a deal. Anonymous: Why are mobile companies not making high-end under 5 inches except for Apple? I am interested in buying an Android phone and was wondering if the Sony Xperia XZ Compact is coming or if its just a rumor ? Ah, weve been there - we even had a petition to see if many of you, our readers were on the same page. Compact and powerful Android smartphones has been a severely underserved niche and wed love to see more action there as well. But now lets try and answer your questions why. There are two reasons - the first one is that its simply easier to make a flagship large as it gives engineers much more volume to work with and lets them squeeze a bunch of extra hardware that enables many of the features that we would expect from a flagship device. Consider this - the camera module is the same size reardless of how big your phone is, but proportionally it takes much less space on a phablet than on a 4 smartphone. Same with chipsets, DACs and most of the other internal components. There is also the matter of cooling, which is easier to solve when you have a larger area to distribute the heat to. Theres also the matter of battery life - while a larger phone requires its battery to grow bigger just to make up for the larger screen and its increased consumption it still has an advantage there. You see the standby consumption is about the same regardless of the size of the phone - so a larger battery large phone will last much longer than a smaller phone with proportionally smaller battery. The other reason is consumer demand - larger phones are so much better for browsing, gaming and multimedia consumption so understandably the demand for them is rising. In a poll on the ideal screen size we had last year - over 80% of you wanted phones larger than 5. About 30% of the voters actually wanted at least 5.4. I can bet you any amount of money that if we were to repeat that poll now the votes will have shifted even more towards the larger sizes. So combining the higher R&D costs of a smaller flagship with its lower expected market demand means most companies dont even bother developing them. All that said, Sony deserves credit for releasing a few very capable Compact flagships, most recently the X Compact. Those all did excellently in our reviews so you still have some options there. Unfortunately, nobody but Sony itself can tell if an Xperia XZ Compact is on the way, but fingers crossed well see it at some point this year. Anonymous: Why isnt GSMArena having a feature every month telling about which phone is best to buy under each category? We actually have that - its not a monthly feature but we do a shopping guide every once in a while when we see that the market has changed enough to warrant a new edition. Last one came at the end of last year and well certainly release a new one once all the MWC announcement hit the shelves and we get the full picture. The main reason we are not doing these more often is the research required to make them useful is substantial and would divert resources from the reviews. We feel giving you detailed reviews and then letting you decide which smartphone in your budget best suits you is more useful than just putting up ready-made lists. And again, once we see a big enough shift in the market like the one we are about to witness over the next month and a half you can expect a new installment in the series. Kristen: The Moto G5 Plus offers the same rear camera setup as the Samsung Galaxy S7 (excluding OIS). What are your thoughts on it? We havent had the phone at the office yet so any conclusions and final verdicts at this point might sound extremely foolish once we see how the final product does in all the tests. Still, early samples from the camera that we took at the MWC floor look promising, if not quite Galaxy S7 grade. Heres hoping Lenovo used the extra time until the market launch to optimize the processing so the final units are actually able to match its high-flying colleague from team Samsung. And the phone in general looks pretty promising too - a decently capable yet power-efficient chipset, stock Android Nougat and a battery that's plenty big for its size. What yours truly failed to mention, though, is how ugly the back side looked. Not that front is particularly pretty with its huge bezels, but to me none of the elements at the back work together. I guess looks will always be a matter of personal preference though and theres always the option to slap a case on it and save yourself the eyesore. Jesu: I want to buy a Galaxy Note phone. As the Note7 is not an option is it worth buying the Note5 or its better to wait for the next one to come out? This is a tough one - the Note7 fiasco really put the numerous Note series fans between a rock and a hard place. You could either settle for last years version or make do without the S Pen and a slightly smaller screen on the Galaxy S7 edge. The wait for the next Note wont be a short one either - at best it will take another 7 months to arrive. The good news is Samsung is likely to bring back a slightly downgraded version of the Note7 to the market - these refurbished units will come with a smaller battery, but they should still be better than the Note5. We are yet to see how much theyll cost and if they wont bring any other corner cuttign. Still, unless there are other nasty surprises those should be the best options for Note fans that dont want to wait until Fall for an upgrade. Alternatively, if you can leave without the Note exclusive goodies there are plenty of capable phablets in the market - the Huawei Mate 9 and LG V20 are both purchases you are unlikely to regret, while the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus is there for those on a tighter budget. Anonymous: Can you explain how you calculate battery endurance rating and also can you add standby time to the endurance chart? Weve described the test in detail over here, along with most of the other tests we perform. What we do is calculate the endurance for the four tests (call, web browsing, video playback and standby) and then add them to a formula that by default would give us the endurance if you do an hour of calls, an hour of browsing and an hour of video per day with the phone being on standby for the rest of the time. However you can use the sliders over here to customize the usage pattern so its closer to your personal one and get more relevant results. The reason we dont add the standby test to the endurance chart is that it confuses more people than it helps. Those that believe its important to know can use simple math to calculate it using the numbers provided, but a modern day smartphone is not meant to spend a week on standby without being touched so we believe the number isnt really relevant. Instead we believe the endurance rating, while artificial on its own gives you a better reference point when comparing battery life between phones. If you have any questions for us - you can send them by using the form over here.

If you have suggestions for topics or specific questions you’d like to see answered, feel free to let me know. Catch up on past installments here.  One story that’s been making the rounds in the media recently has been Apple’s role in education as it faces increased competition from products like Chromebooks. Earlier this month, we reported on new data that claimed both iOS and macOS again were losing marketshare to Chromebooks. In the US, Chrome OS saw its share rise to 58 percent in 2016, up from 50% in the prior year. On the other hand, iOS dropped to 14%, down from 19% in 2015, and macOS dropped to 5% share, down from 6%. In your education environment, what technology should be implemented? What can Apple do to improve education? Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case There are a variety of things to consider in this argument, the first being price. There’s no way around it: Chromebooks are more affordable than Apple devices. You can get one for as little as $134 and partnerships between Google and school corporations are plentiful, making the price even lower than that. On the other hand, iPads have gotten significantly cheaper over the years. You can currently get an iPad Air 2 for $379 from Apple’s Education Store, while the company also works with corporations and universities to get that price down even further in some cases. That’s not to say, however, that Apple shouldn’t work to further reduce the price of the iPad for educators. Apple operates on one of the highest profit margins in technology and given how big of an emphasis Steve Jobs put on education, I personally am of the belief that Apple should work to provide iPads at cost to educators and schools. Pricing argument aside, however, there are other things to consider. And in my opinion, once you get past pricing, the advantage start to lean towards Apple. The biggest thing that the iPad has going for it in education is the ecosystem.  The iOS ecosystem is, in almost every way, the most advanced and established ecosystem there is right now. The App Store offers thousands of apps made purely with education in mind, some of which we’ve highlighted thus far in EduTech. That’s not to say the Chromebook ecosystem is lacking, though. Essentially, a Chromebook offers a full-powered browser that can get you many of the same services that iOS apps also offer. Chromebooks are also becoming more advanced with support for apps, but that feature is still in the early stages and still rolling out to devices. Another thing to consider here is security. Both Google and Apple offer tools to educators to ensure that students don’t have access to anything that could compromise their device, but the app-focused nature of iOS gives the iPad somewhat of an advantage here. Given that apps are reviewed by Apple before being made available to users, there’s less possibility of security compromises compared to the open web experience that Chromebooks offer. Another argument to consider when deciding between Chromebook and iPad is the design of each product. iPads are much sleeker and lighter than most Chromebooks, but with Chromebooks you get a full physical keyboard. That’s obviously a huge advantage for productivity, especially for note taking and content creation. Building off that argument, however, is the iPad accessory ecosystem. As we detailed last weekend, there are a multitude of accessories available for the iPad that significantly enhance its usage in education. While it’s more expensive to add a keyboard to the already more expensive iPad, it offers more flexibility than the Chromebook. Apple is also making efforts to improve iOS for education. The company offers a Classroom app that makes assigning working, sharing iPads, and much easier for teachers and administrators: Classroom turns your iPad into a powerful teaching assistant, helping a teacher guide students through a lesson, see their progress, and keep them on track. With Classroom, you can easily launch the same app on every student device at the same time or launch a different app for each group of students. Classroom helps teachers focus on teaching so students can focus on learning. The technology in education argument, however, goes much deeper than comparing Chromebooks and iPads…. Last year, Ben Lovejoy wrote a great op-ed piece highlighting 8 reasons why iPads are losing to Chromebooks in education. He argued that things like price, past failures, and software holes were some of the things Apple could improve upon in education. You can read Ben’s full piece for all of his thoughts, but I happen to agree almost entirely with him. Apple is losing in the education market. There’s no way around that fact. Educators are starting to more often choose Chromebooks over iPads, a decision that almost certainly stems from price and the ever-decreasing budgets with which school corporations have to work. Apple needs to do more in this area. Education markets a huge, nearly entirely untapped, opportunity for the company. One of the things I admired most about Steve Jobs was how much he valued the education system in the United States. And how he knew it needed to improve. Jobs also realized, however, that technology alone couldn’t fix education. He said in a 1996 interview with Wired: I used to think that technology could help education. I’ve probably spearheaded giving away more computer equipment to schools than anybody else on the planet. But I’ve had to come to the inevitable conclusion that the problem is not one that technology can hope to solve. What’s wrong with education cannot be fixed with technology. No amount of technology will make a dent. Apple can do more with education, offering iPads at cost to school corporations, building an ecosystem focused on learning, and even stepping into some of the non-technological problems. Like or not, Tim Cook has turned Apple into a voice a variety of social problems and if he’s going to keep that up, I’d really like to see him extend into education and use Apple’s power and money to improve education in any way way that it can. Jared Harrell // BuzzFeed News Cook has touched on education in the past, calling Chromebooks nothing more than “test machines,” but it seems to me like Apple hasn’t been putting as big of a focus on education as it once did. “Sure, I think there is lots of interest. Sometimes education doesn’t move as fast as any of us would like, but I think there are a lot of great teachers out there and a lot of great people out there who really want to improve the quality of education. “I’m not a fan of teaching to the test. I think creativity is so important. Training the mind how to think is so important. Teaching to the test, to me, is too much about memorization. In a word where you’ve got all the information you’ve got right here,” Cook gestured to my iPhone, “your ability to memorize what year a war was won and all this kind of stuff isn’t very relevant. The classroom of the future is problem-solving and creating and learning how to express yourself.” What Cook describes sounds great, an education system focused less on testing and more on creativity. But I continue to hope that Apple will do more in this area to help improve education around the world, rather than just talk about how it should look. Cook has put shareholder desires aside for things like environment reform, why not do the same for education?

With its stock price on the rise, the tech titan may put more emphasis on dividend growth when it updates its capital return program next month. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Mar 19, 2017 at 11:55AM Five years ago today, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced plans to start paying a dividend for the first time since 1995. Since then, Apple has raised its dividend at a steady but relatively modest pace. Meanwhile, Apple's original $10 billion share repurchase plan (announced at the same time) has morphed into a massive $175 billion share buyback program over the past few years. Apple will announce the latest update to its capital return program next month in conjunction with its Q2 earnings report. This time around, the iPhone maker may finally start to raise its dividend at a faster pace. Apple's dividend history Apple paid the first dividend under its current capital return program in August 2012. At that time, the quarterly payout was $2.65 per share. Adjusting for Apple's 2014 stock split, this translates to a dividend of about $0.38 per share. Each April since then, Apple has raised its dividend. The biggest increase came in 2013, when Apple raised its dividend by 15%. The smallest increase (8%) came the following year. The average annual increase has been about 11%. Apple restarted its dividend in 2012. It has been growing ever since. Image source: Apple. In total, Apple's payout has grown by about 50% during this period. For the past year, its quarterly dividend has been $0.57 per share. Apple can afford to pay more Common metrics of dividend safety indicate that Apple could afford to pay a lot more to its shareholders. It currently has a payout ratio of just 27% based on its earnings over the past year. A payout ratio twice as high would still be considered safe by most experts. Many investors prefer to measure dividend safety by looking at free cash flow. After all, if a company is not generating enough free cash flow to cover its dividend, then it has to issue debt or stock to plug the gap. Apple is in good shape from this perspective as well. The company generated more than $52 billion of free cash flow last year, while its current quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share works out to about $12.5 billion per year for dividend payments. The case for a hefty increase There are two main reasons why Apple should consider a bigger dividend increase than has been its recent custom. First, Apple's dividend yield has fallen significantly since the April 2016 update to its capital return program. When Apple raised its dividend last April, the new $0.57 per share quarterly payment worked out to a 2.2% annual yield. Now, thanks to Apple's surging share price, the dividend yield has fallen to just 1.6%. Second, with Apple stock recently reaching a record high of $140, share buybacks seem less attractive than they have been for most of the past five years. Apple's earnings multiple is near the high end of its recent historical range, which suggests that the stock is not a huge bargain right now. Apple P/E Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. Dividends and share repurchases are just two alternative ways to return cash to shareholders. As a result, if buybacks are generating diminishing returns due to Apple's rising stock price, it might make sense to shift the capital return program's emphasis toward dividends. A 20%-30% dividend hike could be coming Since Apple restarted its dividend in late 2012, its dividend yield has averaged about 2%. Just to get back to a 2% yield, the quarterly payout would have to rise 23% to $0.70 per share, based on Apple's recent stock price. There's a good chance that Apple will announce a dividend increase of roughly this magnitude next month. In the past year or so, Apple's management has placed an increasing amount of emphasis on the company's services segment. One of the big strengths of the services business is that it generates reliable recurring revenue, whereas device sales fluctuate due to product cycles. If Apple's cash flow is set to become more predictable in the future, then the company should start to behave more like other cash-cow businesses. That starts with offering a significantly bigger dividend. Adam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Apple and is long January 2018 $90 calls on Apple and short January 2018 $140 calls on Apple.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Report: LeEco downsizing plans for the US, selling Silicon Valley property 03/18/2017 at 11:00 AM by Brad Linder 6 Comments Chinese company LeEco unveiled its first smartphone, smart TVs, and other products for the US market in October. At the time, the company laid out plans to launch a comprehensive ecosystem for its products, including cloud storage, streaming video, and other services that could be used across platforms. Basically, LeEco wanted to emulate the success its had in China in the United States… a country where few companies other than Apple have really been able to build the kind of brand loyalty that makes that kind of ecosystem popular. Odds are if you have an Apple laptop, you also have an Apple phone… and maybe an Apple media streaming box. So how’s it going for LeEco? According to recent news reports, not well. Shortly after LeEco’s first products went on sale in the US, the company’s CEO sent a letter to employees noting that the company didn’t have the funds to support the pace of growth it was on track for. In December the company reduced its workforce in India and scaled back operations in that country. And now Reuters reports that LeEco is in talks to sell the 49-acre property in Silicon Valley that the company acquired from Yahoo in 2016. LeEco is also said to have already cut its US workforce by as much as half, so that it’s now at “more than 500,” which is a far cry from the 12,000 people LeEco had originally planned to house at the property it may now be looking to sell. LeEco’s vision for the US market included plans for everything from existing products such as phones, TVs, headphones, and software services to upcoming products including self driving cars. LeEco has even developed smart bicycles. But it takes a lot of money to win big in a market like the US, and it looks like LeEco may be running out of that. I also have to wonder if the company overestimated the demand for a new product ecosystem… I think many folks looked on with interest when LeEco promised high-quality smartphones with reasonably low prices, for instance… but were disappointed when they learned how much LeEco customized the Android software on those phones. LeEco hasn’t confirmed the Reuters report about the possible property sale, but it does seem clear that the company is scaling back its ambitions for the US market. But that doesn’t mean LeEco is getting out of the consumer electronics space in the US altogether. The company also spent $2 billion to acquire TV maker Vizio last summer, and I doubt Vizio TVs are going anywhere anytime soon.

Prices tied up in special weird promotion. A software ecosystem which was vague. Some seemed to be Android TV – which I’d like – but then they wouldn’t actually say that out loud it seemed. I’m only willing to work just so hard to buy something from you regardless of whether it might be a good deal or not.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. Skinned OS was the best option, because even the phenomenal ICS 4.0.3 had its omissions in its time. But ever since Android 5.1 (which fixed all the frustrating bugs from 5.0)… Stock OS Android has been a charm. In fact, it made Skinned OS look all childish, non-professional, and not well optimised. And the best part about it was, supporting a Stock OS is much easier for companies. To the extent where it is actually possible for them to roll out updates within 2 months of AOSP release, and actually support the software updates for 24 months after release. Unfortunately, very little OEMs care about timely updates or long-term support. So people should now either flock to iPhones, build their own OS, or just get Pixel/OnePlus/etc etc devices. No point in having the best hardware out there if the software experience is crap. (with that said, one of my favourite Skinned OS is actually FlymeOS) Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 3 days 2 hours ago Guest ExLeEco Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | March 14, 2017 -- 17:15 GMT (10:15 PDT) | Topic: iOS It's likely that Apple will release iOS 10.3 before the end of the month, which means you have some time to get your hardware ready for the upgrade. more iphone news iPhone 8 may not have the killer feature we've been hoping for The next iPhone won't switch to USB-C, but the cable might iPhones are much more unreliable than Android devices, claims report The iPhone decade: Apple's transition from Steve Jobs to Tim Cook The Cloud? Apple's iOS can't handle the Cloud Here's what you need to do to make sure things go smoothly for you. See also: Learn to become a Google Chrome power user Will you get iOS 10.3? First things first, will you get iOS 10.3? Here is a complete list of the devices that are supported by this release (basically, if you have iOS 10, you can get this upgrade): iPad 4th gen iPad Air iPad Air 2 iPad Pro (12.9- and 9.7-inch) iPad mini 2 iPad mini 3 iPad mini 4 iPod touch 6th iPhone 5 iPhone 5c iPhone 5s iPhone SE iPhone 6/6 Plus iPhone 6s/6s Plus iPhone 7/7 Plus To know what device you have, use this page to decipher the model number, which you can find on the back of the device or under Settings > General > About > Model. Is your device not in the list? Then you're out of luck. Back up your data Before you do anything major, such as upgrading your device, you need to make sure that you have a backup just in case things don't go smoothly. This is doubly so for iOS 10.3 because for the first time Apple is changing the iOS file system from the 30+ year old HFS+ for Apple File System. Apple File System is a huge improvement over HFS+, bringing with it features such as optimization for solid state storage, strong encryption, better file time stamping (down to the nanosecond), and many storage saving improvements. Apple plans to move macOS, iOS, tvOS, and even watchOS to Apple File System. But the two file systems are not compatible with each other, and once you upgrade to Apple File System, there's no way to convert back to HFS+ without blowing away all your data and reformatting the storage. What this means is that when iOS 10.3 is installed, every file stored on the device will be converted from the old format to the new format. And while we can expect that Apple will put a lot of effort into making this conversion process as smooth and painless as possible, upgrading a file system always opens up the possibility that something can go wrong. And if something does go wrong, data loss is a real possibility if the upgrade process has started converting files. Which is why you need a backup. You can either back up your data to iCloud (go to Settings > iCloud > Backup, then turn on iCloud Backup), or if you don't have enough space, you can take the old-school road and connect your iPhone or iPad to a PC to do the backup through iTunes.

SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 6 NEXT PREV Spring clean your device Chances are good that your iPhone or iPad has accumulated a lot of detritus over the months and years, so what better time to get rid of it than now. While iOS 10.3 doesn't need as much free space to install as earlier releases, getting rid of apps that you no longer use -- or perhaps have never used -- makes good sense. This is also a good time to find replacements for those aging apps that you've been using for years but that haven't seen an update in ages (usually because they've been abandoned by the developer). If you've been seeing some apps generate a message saying that it may slow down the device until the developer updates it to improve its compatibility then in iOS 10.3 that warning will be upgraded to suggest that the app "will not work with future versions of iOS," which means the end is nigh. Best iPhone or iPad apps (March 2017) SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 25 NEXT PREV Do I need to delete apps to make space for the upgrade? Not if you are on iOS 9 or above, because the operating system will clear space for you (even if that means deleting and redownloading apps). If you are on an earlier version, and you're cramped on space, then you might need to clear space by deleting apps (be careful -- because you will lose any associated data), deleting audio or video content (music, downloaded videos, audio books, etc), or moving data such as photos to the cloud (keep reading for more information). Update your apps If you've not updated your apps in a while, then this is a good time to do so, because a lot of the apps will have been updated to make them compatible with iOS 10 (although apps designed for iOS 9 seem to run well based on my testing). While it's likely that your device automatically updates apps in the background, it's not a bad idea to check just to make sure. Find the App Store app, then tap on it, and click Update (bottom-right of the screen). Once in there, you can kick off the update process. Put your photos in the cloud Another thing you can do is to upload your photos to the cloud. ZDNet's sister site CNET has an excellent rundown of some of the free services you can use for this. Know your passwords Following the upgrade, you'll need to enter your iCloud password in order to be able to reconnect to all your data and photos. If you don't have this close to hand -- remember, having it on the device you're upgrading isn't all that convenient -- then this might be a good time to do that. Also, if your iTunes backup is encrypted, then remember you'll need that password if something goes wrong! Pocket tools and gadgets "Every Day Carry"... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 13 NEXT PREV Is it better to upgrade or wipe a device and start from scratch? It's a lot less hassle to just upgrade a device because you get to keep all your apps and settings. However, devices that I have wiped and reloaded a new iOS onto, and then installed and re-setup all my apps and such, feel faster and seem to suffer from fewer problems (such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi issues). However, wiping and reloading the apps and data is pretty big hassle, and it's probably more work than most want to undertake. Should I wait a while before doing the upgrade? There will likely be an update or two to iOS 10.3 in the weeks following its release, so you might want to wait for the dust to settle and for any last-minute bugs to be squashed before making the leap, especially if you rely on your device. Also, if you use your device in a BYOD setting, make sure you get the OK from the IT department before upgrading, in case you're unable to access the network or data you need.

STRATEGY How This Company Went from a 95-Cent Book to a $2 Billion Business Learn storytelling techniques from the publicist for Polycom, Johnny Cash, and Steve Jobs. By Adele Cehrs Adele Cehrs, founder and CEO of Epic PR Group and author of Spike Your Brand ROI, has more than 20 years' experience in the PR and marketing industry. @EpicBVA Founder and CEO, Epic PR Group@EpicBVA WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement What people have "heard about you" influences how they interact with you and your company. Storytelling is a powerful way to position your brand and influence potential customers. One of the most enduring brand stories is the plight of the underdog. Remember the tale of the scrappy technology company founded out of a garage in Silicon Valley? Apple's story persuades us to root for "the little business that could," even before we buy a product. Decades later, Apple is hardly an underdog, yet that story continues to resonate with entrepreneurs, investors and employees alike. Public relations expert Cameron Craig, who spearheaded Johnny Cash's two Australian tours and helped craft the Apple brand story in the late 90's early 2000's, has an interesting take on what works and what doesn't. "As part of the PR team at Apple, I learned that simplicity is really the key to telling smart stories that resonate," Craig explains. "Jobs was a master storyteller and he oversaw every aspect of how the company was positioned -- including reviewing every press release." Craig also used the underdog story to great effect for Polycom. "It must have been my second week on the job and we had a Bring-Your-Kids-to-Work Day," Craig recalls. "I was in the cafeteria and I noticed [Polycom] co-founder Jeffrey Rodman talking to a bunch of 10 year-old kids, they're all in a circle and they're all captivated by what he was saying to them. He was talking about how he bought a $0.95 book from RadioShack on building speakers and how that book led to this company that we now know as Polycom." In the decades since the 1972 book Building Speaker Enclosures was published, Polycom has grown into an international technology powerhouse with more than 400,000 customers. The company recently sold for an estimated $2 billion. "Not a bad return for a $0.95 book," says Craig. "Great stories are everywhere -- it is up to internal teams to listen for them."Craig's approach isn't just spin from a 10-year Apple veteran. It's rooted in social science. In his recent book Pre-Suasion, social psychologist Robert Cialdini describes how people can be 'primed' and 'anchored' to think about certain things right before they make decisions. It's one of the reasons we feel good about supporting large corporate brands with underdog stories. The best brand stories, Craig believes, have a hero and a villain. The villain doesn't have to be human: It can be can be a concept, a problem, or a pain point. "In the tech world especially, the villain is complexity and the hero is simplicity," Craig points out. "And as humans, we love simplicity." You can do this, too -- even without Apple or Polycom's public relations budget. Craig recommends asking five people -- colleagues, friends, family -- the following questions: What is interesting about you and/or your company? What is your defining characteristic? What is that one thing that sets you apart from the rest? "You'll probably get five different answers, each of them different than what you think they might say," says Craig. "At the end of the day, it's about the people. Your story has to make them care, not just about what they do and who they do it for, but about how what you do impacts others' lives."

Apple published an "iPhone in Business" profile back in 2012 covering Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital along with an overview video of how the iPhone was being used at the hospital. In 2014 Apple introduced HealthKit and then in 2015 they introduced ResearchKit to empower medical researchers.   Yesterday Fast Company posted an interesting report on Apple's focus on the Health Care Sector. The report notes that "For Apple, the $3 trillion health care sector offers a lot of potential for growth for its iPad. The company is likely to restate its commitment to the tablet device as early as next week, with the rumored announcement of the 9.7-Inch "iPad Pro 2."   From an enterprise sales perspective–a priority for the iPhone maker in the wake of recent partnerships with Cisco and IBM–large hospitals and health systems that shift to iOS tend to buy devices in bulk. 'We now have hundreds of iPads for patients to use,' says L.A.'s Cedars Sinai's Shaun Miller,, who uses a compliant iPhone app called Voalte to text with other providers. 'As we expand to more wards, it'll be thousands.'   Cedars Sinai has also come a long way with its use of HealthKit and other iOS offerings. As of this week, patients can log in to their medical chart, click a download button, access a copy of their medical record, and port it to their Apple health app on a smartphone. That way, they can show it to any doctor they opt to see, even if they leave Cedars Sinai. This application might seem simple enough, but in health care it's 'cutting-edge,' says Darren Dworkin, chief information officer at Cedars Sinai, since until recently patients were burdened with the task of requesting and physically transporting their data on a USB Drive or CD-Rom if they wanted to share data between health providers at different institutions. That's in large part because electronic medical systems historically were developed for billing, not data transfer.   'Leading hospitals and health systems are using Apple products to transform all aspects of health care inside the hospital and beyond,' says an Apple spokesperson, emphasizing the 'privacy and security of iOS'" as a key factor for its growing popularity among hospitals for remote patient monitoring and in-patient care.   The report further noted that "Developers like Lanier and Patient Safe Solutions' Si Luo made an early bet that iOS would take off in health care. For them, Apple's public announcement about its first steps in health care with HealthKit couldn't have come quickly enough. 'We had been trying to sell iOS into hospitals for seven years, only to see tremendous uptick in recent months,' says Luo.   One of the earliest customers to come on board was Pueblo, Colorado-based Parkview Medical Center, which uses the Patient Safe Solutions app to help nurses manage patients' medications at their bedside. To help minimize errors, nurses can scan a patient's wristband to pull up a system on an iPhone that determines if the staff is administering the right medication at the right dose at the right time. The hospital also uses the app to ensure patients get the right blood for their type, as well as for voice and texting communications between nurses, doctors, and the pharmacy.   Luo recalls being invited to a meeting last winter with folks from Apple's growing health unit, alongside several chief information officers at hospitals and fellow iOS health developers. At that meeting, he says, the group discussed how various apps like Tonic Health and Patient Safe Solutions could integrate together, as well as three major issues with iOS that were causing some concern among the largest hospitals. According to Lanier and Luo, who both attended, those issues were: order fulfillment in device life-cycle management (meaning reassuring these enterprise customers they wouldn't need to order new devices in less than three years), security, and wireless connectivity.   Since this conversation 18 months ago, Luo says sales have jumped from 30 hospitals using the technology to 85 hospitals. He attributes the success to Apple making available an enterprise solutions architect by phone to reassure IT buyers about security and privacy, and a growing awareness of existing features like encryption of health data. 'Apple now feels like the safest choice,' he says and security analysts tend to agree with this assessment.

Ugonna Nwaeze: Dear Entrepreneur, Can Your Business Survive Your Absence? 24.02.2017 at 1:00 am By Ugonna Nwaeze 12 Comments I never thought about this question while I was present at my online grocery store Nkataa.com, but since my absence I have realised its importance. Had I not been lucky enough to tailor my business to run without me, I would have some serious problems right now. No one ever plans to be absent when there’s a lot of money to be made and a lot of business to be done, but sometimes life has a way of forcing us to be absent at some critical points in the lifespan of our businesses. I have seen that we are just as addicted to Apple products after the passing of Steve Jobs as we have ever been. Despite the high foreign currency exchange rate in our country, many of us already have the iPhone 7 and are eagerly anticipating the next Apple product to hit the market. Nigeria remains among the highest purchasers of luxury goods and electronics regardless of the incessant ranting on social media about the Federal Government, the recession and the rising cost of FOREX. This has caused me to think a bit deeply. Are there ways that businesses can be set up to outlive and outperform their founders? I am interested in this subject because I believe that even when I am present, a successful business is one that allows me to spend more time doing leisurely activities and spending time with loved ones. As a CEO, regardless of my presence at work, my business occupies my mind 24/7. I always think about salaries, staff welfare, how to break even, profitability, etc. In fact there’s always something business-related on my mind. I believe that these issues would be better attended to if they were the only issues on my mind. Sometimes, one needs to be absent from the running of business in order to focus on these issues. I would also like some time off to play, after work and on weekends. Furthermore, I need to reflect on what I’ve done so far and how I can keep improving. This is better achieved when I can step back from the day-to-day operations of my business. I certainly would not like to continue this cycle of overworking myself, until I am unavoidably absent again; something needs to change. The basic requirement for business survival for start-ups is having a team. I have come to see a lot of start-ups with brilliant ideas impeding growth because they have refused to set up a team. They run their businesses so intelligently when they are available, but whenever they are away it is a different story. The business and customers wait impatiently while they flood their customers’ social media timelines with fun pictures of their holidays or family functions. Followed by an apology post when they return saying “Sorry I wasn’t able to respond to you guys, Nigeria was driving me crazy and I had to run away, but I’m back now. Yaay!” Let me quickly make it clear that there is absolutely nothing wrong with running your business like this. Maybe sometimes it is better to enjoy your holiday without getting calls from customers that their food has still not come. However, if you want your business to out-live/out-perform you as a founder, and operate in your absence, then you need to get a team. There are a million ways things can be done and there are also a million excuses why things cannot be done. I would normally encourage young CEOs like myself to invest in a team. A lot of people would always say to me, “I love your team, give me Bose, she’s pretty and intelligent. It is not easy to find smart people in Nigeria. There is a serious gap in Nigeria for “good hands.” It is not easy to find people who understand your vision. “Nigerians? They will just run down your business…” I can keep going on but I think you get my point. Bose was always a pretty girl but she has not always been an intelligent girl. In fact we used to call her an olodo. I worried that I had made a mistake in hiring her and we decided to just ‘dump her in customer care to talk to customers jarey.’ That was a BIG MISTAKE! We had customers and friends calling me and saying, “Get that girl off the phone.” However, today Bose is known as valuable and intelligent and people are wondering, “where did you find her?” What happened to Bose? How has she in a short space of time been able to transform from being an ‘olodo’ to being an asset? I have seen this ‘Bose-like transformation’ happen to quite a few members of my team. It has been a roller coaster with different personalities out there. It has taken a great deal of investment. How did it happen? It took patience, capacity building, team-building exercises, and a lot more. In fact, I have lost some members of my team that I love so dearly because they refused my investments. Like I said earlier there are a million ways things can be done and there are also a million excuses why things cannot be done. One thing you must get done is to “get good hands.” You must build the capacity you need. This does not come through firing everyone who doesn’t meet your standards; it comes through building up the individuals you have to become the team you want. Which leads us to the next point: The second requirement for your business to survive your absence is having a team that you have invested in. My team is my brand and I will deploy the same level of effort and finances I use to build my brand, to build my team. I will conclude this article with saying that usually the ones who we feel are the good hands are often beyond the reach of start-ups in terms of being able to afford them – unless your dad gave you a “small loan” of a million dollars like President elect Donald Trump. However, this is not a problem because the people you have invested in will manage your start-up better than ready-made people you have employed. I am looking forward to the next article because I will focus on writing about setting up the right team and how you can invest in them. In the coming weeks, I will also cover other impediments start-ups face with setting up a team. Until next time, happy building!

It would run independent of me and 2. that it would outlive me and be a generational business so help me God. When planning it, I said to myself, after 5 years, I would step back and see if the business can continue without my physical presence for 2 months but God had other plans. After 2.5 years, “due to circumstance beyond my control” I have had to be away for almost 6 months now and mehn, MY SERVICE BASED BUSINESS IS STILL GOING ON! One thing that has worked for me was communicating the vision with my staff, understanding their individual motivations and showing them how the success of the business invariably achieves their own goals. I am grateful to God that for the inspiration to set it up that way at the outset. Grateful to him for sending staff who despite our differences, have the same same vision and thankful for the small effort of mine that is yielding fruit. I hope one day there would be many generational business in Nigeria which would tell their own success stories too. God bless the SME’s in Nigeria. We shall not just survive but thrive!

Love this! 10 Reply olanna&odenigbo February 25, 2017 at 12:14 am I am eagerly waiting for the next article…. struggled with this for long, gone through many people, but hopefully now making progress….I pray we keep growing. The few times I had to travel, even with a not-so-stable team, I have always organised for work and monitoring to continue in my absence, and it does…I must confess it’s a bit stressful to follow up on work and multiple explanations when my brain is on vacation. After a hectic year last year, I pretty much let go of my entire former team (each one at a different time and for different reasons) and reassembling another started again this year, with clearer intentions of what I required from the people I hire, and I noticed my more recent trip was better than my previous ones, my new assistant was more efficient handling things and communicating between other staff and myself… I on my part, was also more patient with communication cos I realised I couldn’t expect them to just know everything at once… So I am learning patience and hoping to keep building a better structure as we progress. I have learned I also don’t need to die with -the devil I know’ ….Let them go if they no longer serve the mission and/or refuse to be aligned. I offered a staff free training that I usually charge upwards of 200k for, and she was a no-show…not even phone call to cancel or reschedule. this is someone who was already slowing us all down and refusing to do something about a fixable problem…and she had the nerve to roll into work on Monday by 11am… how do we deal with such people biko… I’m learning o…different days with different lessons.

Titled More Life, the 22 tracks were premiered on Drake’s Beats 1 show, OVO Sound Radio, on Saturday without warning. The really great news for fans though is that More Life is available now to stream on just about every major music service, and not exclusive to Apple Music. This is the first music from Drake since his 2015 album Views that isn’t exclusively tied to Apple Music, a result of the musician’s partnership with the company. That doesn’t mean Drake and Apple’s relationship is ending however, as it was apparently those at Apple Music who helped decide to call More Life a “playlist” rather than an album or mixtape. Those wanting to listen to More Life can stream it on Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal, Google Play Music, and other services, plus there’s the option to buy and download it from the iTunes store. Already one of the standout tracks for fans is “Glow,” which features vocals from none other than Kanye West. With this surprise release, it’s expected that Drake is about to easily beat the weekly streaming record he set in 2015, which saw Views streamed over 250 million times on Apple Music in its first seven days. With More Life available on a range of services, topping that number in the first week shouldn’t be too difficult.

McIntyre March 19, 2017 7:54 am EDT Print Email Tweet Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) market cap sits at $734 billion, as its shares have passed an all-time high of $141. A number of analysts believe that figure will go to $160, or higher. Apple is likely to be worth three-quarters of $1 trillion within the next several weeks, if not days. Apple has posted a better share price growth this year than any other component of the Dow, up 20.9%. The Dow is higher by 5.3% to 20,915. Apple’s shares have been driven recently more by rumor than hard numbers. Although the company’s number for the last quarter were impressive, that information is nearly two months old. Apple set a record for iPhone sales, along with record numbers for most of its other hardware. Its forecast for the current quarter was good but not spectacular. It was certainly not enough to drive the stock up to present levels. The primary drive of Apple’s advance has been speculation about its new iPhone 8, which is expected to be released in September. Recent versions of the iPhone have not been considered game-changing improvements over past ones. Also, they have not been considered strong competitors with the flagship products of rival Samsung. Website MacRumors is among the best providers of information about Apple products. It recently published comments on the next generation iPhone: Apple has a major iPhone redesign planned for 2017, with a glass body and edge-to-edge OLED display that includes an integrated Touch ID fingerprint sensor and front-facing camera. The new iPhone may be sold alongside upgraded (but standard) 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhones. 5.8″ OLED display Faster A11 processor Glass body Edge-to-edge display Camera and Touch ID integrated in display No Home button Wireless charging Three models – One OLED, two standard It is not overly simplistic to say that if the iPhone 8 features do not live up to this and similar descriptions, Apple’s stock may take a hit. However, if it appears the iPhone 8 has at least this set of features the stock has an excellent chance to gain more. And, of course, there is the issue of iPhone 8 sales.

You can fix a frozen iPhone in 10 seconds without a computer or any other accessories so that you can get back with your day. You can also use this to fix a frozen iPad. Sometimes a frozen iPhone will not let you do any type of activity, and often you are stuck on-screen in an app or on a home screen. This can also help if your iPhone is stuck off and won’t turn on, but mainly you will use this when the iPhone is stuck on with an app or something on-screen. This is a hard-reboot, but some people will call it a hard-reset. Don’t worry about the reset part of this name. You are not resetting the iPhone like you would with a factory reset that wipes all the data clean. Fix your frozen iPhone in seconds. This may not solve all of your problems. If the iPhone freezes regularly you may need to remove an app or perform an actual factory reset on your iPhone and start from scratch. It’s normal for an iPhone to freeze once or twice in a year after you install a bad app or run into a problem. If things continue to freeze or go bad, there may be a hardware problem that requires a trip to an Apple Store. Fix a Frozen iPhone in 10 Seconds You can fix a frozen iPhone in about ten seconds by pressing and holding the power and home button at the same time until the iPhone restarts. If you have the iPhone 7, you need to press the volume down and the power button at the same time. Once the iPhone screen changes from the frozen state to showing an Apple logo or just a blank screen you can let go. This is a hard reboot. By pressing and holding the home button and power button you force the iPhone to restart. This is similar to holding the power button on a Macbook or laptop or just unplugging a device from power. You’ll see this screen when you fix a frozen iPhone. You don’t need to hold the power buttons after the phone restarts. You should not lose any data doing this, but if you were typing a message, document or working on something inside of an app you may lose that small bit of work depending on when it saved. You don’t need to be plugged in to power or connected to a computer to use this method of fixing a frozen iPhone. If the battery is low, it may help to plug-in to power, but otherwise you are good to do this anytime the iPhone is frozen. This works on any iPhone, iPad or iPod touch on any version of Apple’s software including iOS 5, iOS 6, iOS 7, iOS 8, iOS 9 and the upcoming iOS 10. Read: iOS 10 Tips and Tricks For users who consistently have this problem, it may be good to uninstall a problem app or make sure it is up to date. If you never restart your iPhone or iPad and you have this happen once or twice a year you can often avoid it by restarting you iPhone once every other week.

Gao Yuan Apple said it plans to build new research facilities in the eastern Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou, on top of centers already slated for Beijing and the southern city of Shenzhen. Photo: AFP Beijing: Apple Inc. has revealed plans to set up two more research hubs and boost investment in China, a pivotal market in which the iPhone has been rapidly elbowed aside by local rivals. The announcement comes as chief executive officer Tim Cook undertakes his latest trip to a country that ranks as Apple’s single biggest overseas market. Apple said it plans to build new research facilities in the eastern Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou, on top of centers already slated for Beijing and the southern city of Shenzhen. It also pledged to spend at least ¥3.5 billion ($507 million) on research institutions. All four centers will open later this year, the company said in a statement on its Chinese website. They will help Apple cooperate with local partners and attract talent from its local suppliers as well as from top educational institutes, according to its press release. The announcement came a day before Cook is scheduled to address a high-profile economic forum in Beijing, where senior government officials will confer with the heads of some of the world’s biggest corporations, including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Saudi Arabian Oil Co. Foreign companies have a long-established tradition of building research bases in China to both signal their commitment to the country and curry favour with the government. Apple’s announcement comes after iPhone shipments fell for the first time in China on an annual basis, in 2016. China had for years driven Apple’s spectacular growth, even as smartphone demand elsewhere faltered. But local vendors like Huawei Technologies Co., Oppo and Vivo are now eroding its market share with increasingly high-end devices. The US company is counting on the release of the 10th anniversary iPhone later this year to supercharge growth.

John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Mar 19, 2017 at 7:38AM Looking for a little income and growth for your portfolio? Consider buying shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA might seem like an odd choice for an investor seeking income, but what gets overlooked with this hot tech stock is the willingness of management to reward shareholders with dividends and share repurchases. NVIDIA Gaming has been good to the graphics specialist. In 2016, NVIDIA raked in $4.06 billion in revenue, an increase of 44% over 2015 as the upgrade cycle to the latest high-end graphics processors got under way. Continued advances in gaming technology, higher-resolution displays, and the emergence of eSports provide nice tailwinds for demand over time. Volvo XC90 SUV powered by NVIDIA DRIVE technology. IMAGE SOURCE: NVIDIA INC.  In addition, NVIDIA has other promising growth opportunities emerging with the growing adoption of its high-end GPU technology by other industries for deep learning, artificial intelligence, and self-driving vehicle applications. The combined revenue from its Datacenter and Automotive segment could be the company's biggest business in the not-too-distant future. In 2016, NVIDIA generated $830 million in revenue from its Datacenter segment, an increase of 145% over 2015, while the Automotive segment grew 52% to $487 million in revenue. CEO Jen-Hsun Huang expects the next phase of growth in datacenter to come from several industries, including healthcare, retail, transportation, and life sciences, among others. Here's what he said on a recent earnings conference call: The first adopters were hyperscale companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Google, which use deep learning to provide billions to customers with AI services that utilizes image recognition and voice processing. The next area of growth will occur as enterprise in such fields as healthcare, retail, transportation and finance embrace deep learning on GPUs. NVIDIA's technology is essentially affecting every area of the economy, so how do you value a company like that? The best way to evaluate the investment merits of a high-PE, high-growth business is to consider the market opportunity relative to the company's market capitalization. Intel believes the self-driving car market will be worth $70 billion by 2030 and could reach $100 billion. Compare that amount to the less than $500 million NVIDIA generated last year within its Automotive segment, and it's easy to understand the huge opportunity here -- and why NVIDIA's stock has rocketed to the stratosphere. NVDA data by YCharts. While NVIDIA's multibillion-dollar growth opportunities get all of the headlines, the vision and business skills of its management team, led by CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, get overlooked. Jen-Hsun Huang is the founder of the company and the reason the company is where it is today. He's also been a very shareholder-friendly leader willing to reward shareholders with the company's excess cash flow, something you don't see very often with relatively small companies in technology. The company has consistently paid out a growing dividend since it was initiated in 2012. Over the last three fiscal years, NVIDIA has distributed 83% of its free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. It's a good signal from management that they expect the company to continue growing in the future. NVIDIA currently offers a dividend yield of 0.5%; however, the quarterly dividend has nearly doubled over the last four years. As the business continues to grow and generate more cash from operations, the dividend could double again in the next five years, which would put the dividend yield then at 1% on today's share price. Apple Apple has built a sticky ecosystem with its lineup of iPhone, iPad, and Mac. IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.  The Apple logo is as recognizable as The Coca-Cola Co logo, Nike's swoosh, or the golden arches. Once you own at least two Apple devices, it's very likely you are hooked for life. Over the last four quarters, Apple generated $218 billion in total revenue and $45 billion in profits. The key driver of Apple's growth is iPhone sales, which made up 69% of total revenue in the first fiscal quarter of 2017. The most important thing for investors to know about is Apple's huge financial advantage over its competitors. Apple earned every penny of the smartphone industry's profits in 2016 while commanding less than 20% market share of unit sales. Absorbing all of the profits among smartphone makers gives Apple an enormous competitive advantage to reinvest in more advanced features, digital content, and other services, making the Apple ecosystem even stronger over time.  As Apple sells more devices, it should boost services revenue from iTunes, Apps, Apple Music subscriptions, and other digital content over time. Services revenue has been Apple's fastest-growing segment recently. In the holiday quarter, Services grew 18% year over year to $7.1 billion, bringing the trailing-12-month amount to over $25 billion. Apple generates robust cash flows, and the cash has been piling up on the balance sheet in recent years. At the end of December 2016, Apple had about $46 per share in cash and marketable securities. This is 33% of the current stock price. The cash-rich balance sheet gives management a lot of flexibility not only in running the business, but in how it chooses to reward shareholders. Apple has paid a steadily increasing dividend for about five years, as well as regular share repurchases to reduce the share count and boost earnings-per-share growth. The share buybacks have also been very timely thanks to the conservative valuation on the stock in recent years. Analysts expect earnings to grow about 9% annually over the next five years, and investors are not paying much for future growth, with the stock currently sitting at 17 times earnings. The stock's dividend yield is currently 1.6%. Even after the stock's recent 30% to 40% increase, it still looks attractive. Investors may not hit a home run with Apple given its nearly $1 trillion market value, but the business has a brand customers love, and it generates a lot of cash, and this should leave shareholders with a decent return over time.

By Theresa W. Carey Biography March 18, 2017 William Waitzman for Barron's The bull market is on sale for online brokerage customers. In the run-up to our 22nd annual ranking of Barron’s Best Online Brokers, two developments topped all others: The three major indexes—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500, and the Nasdaq NDAQ 0.4734576757532281% Nasdaq Inc. U.S.: Nasdaq USD70.03 0.33 0.4734576757532281% /Date(1490281075537-0500)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 23253 P/E Ratio 112.88709677419355 Market Cap 11622264974.2218 Dividend Yield 1.8288326903843406% Rev. per Employee 856647 More quote details and news » NDAQ in Your Value Your Change Short position Composite—all set record highs, and six brokers slashed commissions and other fees. At the 16 brokers we reviewed this year, the average monthly cost of trading for an occasional investor had fallen 25% since early 2016, to $47.51 from $63.45. That means more of the market’s gains are ending up in the pockets of self-directed online traders. Table: How Online Brokers Stack Up How We Ranked the Brokers Charles Schwab kicked off the price wars by cutting its base commission from $8.95 to $6.95, and after a flurry of activity, six brokers settled into reduced-fee structures. Following a second cut, Schwab now charges $4.95 per equity trade, as does Firstrade. TD Ameritrade and E*Trade dropped to $6.95 from $9.99. E*Trade charges active traders—those who trade more than 30 times per quarter—$4.95 per transaction. TradeStation announced that it is waiving its $99 monthly platform fee for its sophisticated analysis and trading engine, and also added a flat $5-per-trade charge to its elaborate fee schedule. And our 2017 winner of Best Online Brokers, Fidelity Investments, also joined in: The firm dropped its commission rate in two steps to $4.95 from $7.95. “We know that costs matter to investors,” says Barry Metzger, a senior vice president in Schwab’s Trading Services unit. When Schwab surveyed its clients recently, more than 70% said that cost is a critical component in investing and financial-advice decisions. Barron’s own reader survey shows that the majority of respondents want to keep their costs at a bare minimum. “But cost is just one piece of the puzzle,” as Metzger says. Barron’s encourages investors to look at the entire set of services a broker provides, including research and education offerings, and then decide whether the commissions assessed provide adequate value. Cost is an element in our rankings, and the six brokers who changed their pricing all earned more points in that category this year. The points awarded there are based on the range from cheapest to most expensive, with the least-expensive brokers earning more points. View Graphics We also take margin rates and other charges into account, and they can affect a broker’s score. Schwab achieved the biggest bump in its Cost rating from 2016 to 2017, going to 2.2 points from 0.9 points. Fidelity and TD Ameritrade both edged up a fraction. Margin rates rose this year for almost every broker. The rise in interest rates—demonstrated by the Federal Reserve once more last week—can help bolster the bottom lines of the brokers that have cut their commissions. The increase leads to higher margin-interest rates and higher rates of return on cash held in customer accounts. As we’ve written about price-cutting, we’ve received emails from fans of tastyworks, a new online brokerage launched in January by the founder of thinkorswim, Tom Sosnoff. His acolytes believe that the launch of tastyworks, with its innovative fee structure, was the first salvo in the price war. Tastyworks charges a commission only for opening a position—$5 for equities and $1 per contract for options. Closing a position is free. As much as we admire tastyworks, it seems unlikely that a small newcomer could cause such an upheaval. Schwab, one of the largest online brokers, both by assets under management and by number of clients, isn’t a nimble little sailboat that reacts to every passing breeze. It is, rather, a large ship—and it can take time to change headings. The firm appears to have started the process of lowering its fees months before the launch of tastyworks. Not everyone was eager to join in. TD Ameritrade said as recently as mid-February that it had no plans to cut fees. But when its biggest competitors slashed fees to $4.95, TD had to respond. “While we have made a point not to get involved in past price wars, in this case, the time was right,” says Steven Quirk, the firm’s executive vice president of trading. “We had the benefits of a rising-rate environment, the competitive environment, and our integration planning for Scottrade to consider.” Scottrade, which TD recently purchased, charges $7 for a stock trade, so TD’s new pricing is in line with that of its acquisition. Quirk says the brokerage business will continue to be dynamic, but warns against a price war that takes all participants to the bottom. “Firms that try to compete across multiple dimensions, such as price, product, and experience, will inevitably fail to be the best at any of them,” he says, adding that nobody wins in a price war when firms cut back on platform innovation, client service, and investor education. A WAVE OF CONSOLIDATION continues to break over the industry, with the venerable Scottrade having been acquired by TD Ameritrade, and OptionsHouse purchased by E*Trade. At some point this year, Schwab plans to complete its integration of optionsXpress, but E*Trade is moving at a faster pace, expecting its new unit to be assimilated this year. The number of online brokers has steadily declined over the past decade, and fees are generally lower but much less variable. In 2007, we reviewed 26 firms and 29 total platforms. Commissions for a stock order that year averaged $6.35, with a range going from free (at a couple of long-gone sites) to $14.95 (at Muriel Siebert). Placing an order for 10 options contracts resulted in much more variation, from a low of $7.50 (at Interactive Brokers) to a high of nearly $40 (at Bank of America BAC 1.2829119442022667% Bank of America Corp.

And not every broker had enabled options trading at that time. The 16 firms reviewed here all allow options transactions. Stock trading ranges from free (at Merrill Edge, which gives customers 100 no-fee equity trades per month, as long as they hold the requisite assets) to $7.50 (at TradingBlock). Ten options contracts incur commissions ranging from $4.50 (eOption) to $15 (TradingBlock). Another big trend this year is the proliferation of robo-advisors. Ten of the 16 firms in our survey report offering an automated portfolio-builder and rebalancing feature to clients. Though frequent traders are most coveted by online brokers, growing assets under management is also a key driver of success. Robo-advisors are nudging reluctant investors, particularly millennials, into the markets. Ram Subramaniam, head of brokerage and investment solutions at Fidelity, says the firm “believes the easy access and lower fees for professionally managed money has encouraged younger investors to move from savers to investors, which can help them meet their longer-term financial goals.” We did not explicitly review robo-advisory services for this feature, though having one helped a broker’s Range of Offerings score. More From Barron’s Apple: It’s No Longer About the iPhone Exclusive: Disney’s Iger On Movies, Parks, ESPN Don’t Go on a Wild Canada Goose Chase Our informal survey of Barron’s readers and other interested online traders turned up fewer security worries than in the past two years. Though the Identity Theft Resource Center (idtheftcenter.org) reports an increase of 40% in overall data breaches in 2016, uncovering a total of 1,093, only 52 (4.8%) of those occurred at banks or other financial institutions. A data breach occurs when an individual’s name, along with his or her Social Security and driver’s license numbers, and medical or financial records, have been exposed electronically or on paper. The only brokerage that appears on the list of those reporting a breach is Schwab, which told customers about “unusual login activity” in May 2016. “We believe someone may have obtained your username and password from a non-Schwab account or Website that you use and tried them successfully on Schwab.com,” the firm told clients. THIS SORT OF SECURITY BREACH falls roughly into the user-error bucket, though. If you use the same user name and password for multiple sites, scammers might be able to access your account. Fortunately, most of the brokers detect when you are using a new device or browser and require additional steps before you can log in. Schwab’s Metzger says, “Our sites use multilayered protections beyond login name and password before granting access to an account. In the event unauthorized account activity is suspected, the user is prompted to answer additional security questions, and failed login attempts are limited.” Mobile platforms continue to drive development at most brokers. Every brokerage in our survey with a mobile app—15 of the 16—reported growth ranging from 15% to 30% in trades placed on phones and tablets. To make the experience seamless across platforms, brokers have, for the most part, made it possible to synchronize watchlists and trading defaults across platforms. That means that when you set a trading default on, say, the Web browser of your broker’s services so that your standard order type is a limit order, that setting also appears on your mobile app the next time you log in, and vice versa. This is most helpful when your watchlists synchronize between your desktop or laptop and your mobile device. Until this year, most brokers required you to set up watchlists separately on each platform, a tedious task that, mercifully, appears to have gone extinct. Smartwatch apps, which primarily display alerts such as trade executions, are offered by 11 of our 16 brokers. The Apple Watch is supported by 10 of our brokers; one (Just2Trade) supports only Android-based watches. Two brokers, Tradier Brokerage and TD Ameritrade, support both Apple and Android watches. BUT LET’S GET TO the real excitement of our rankings. For 2017, Barron’s reviewed 16 firms, each of which supplied us with a large amount of data and hands-on trading accounts. As has become customary, Vanguard once again rejected our overtures. We considered resorting to other means because so many readers are interested in seeing how Vanguard would stack up. But since much of the data we request is difficult to find without a firm’s help, we decided to move on. Two brokers we’ve examined for many years, Scottrade and TradeKing, stepped away this year due to acquisitions. (In TradeKing’s case, the buyer was Ally Bank.) But we have two newcomers: Planner Securities and Tradier, each of which has an interesting story to tell. To analyze 2017’s top brokers, we took a hard look at the value they offer to clients, analyzing security, mobility, and social-media features as well as the depth of their investment tools and their trading capabilities. Our primary consideration in judging these 16 firms is how they work for our readers, who are high-net-worth active investors. Price-improvement statistics are built into our Trading Experience and Technology category. The ability to set up a personalized experience, both on a computer and with a mobile device, is a key area of focus. We want to see how smoothly the system moves from idea generation to trade ticket, and then on to reporting the results of one’s hard work. Customizable reporting is a concern. We think it’s important for investors and traders to understand which of their strategies work—and which need a little more work. Three firms earned 4½ stars, and our winner, Fidelity, was a repeat from 2016. Its margin was a bare 1/10th of a point over longtime favorite Interactive Brokers. TD Ameritrade moved up one spot to No. 3. Five brokers, each with unique strengths, earned four stars: OptionsHouse, Charles Schwab, Merrill Edge, TradeStation, and E*Trade. Because there are so many different trading styles, Barron’s also pinpoints top online brokers in six categories—frequent trading, in-person service, investor education, long-term investing, services for novices, and options trading—to help you decide where you might want to open an account or transfer an existing one (see table). We also show the brokers that were at the extremes when we calculated the monthly cost of trading for infrequent traders, as well as for those who trade multiple times per day. You can read about our methodology at Barrons.com in “How We Ranked Our Online Brokers,” and review the categories that informed our analysis in the tables “Barron’s Online Broker Survey: How the Brokers Stack Up,” the most comprehensive comparison we’re aware of listing the tools and services each firm provides. This year, we expanded the tables displaying research and news based on reader requests. Those requests are extremely helpful in our research, so please keep them coming. Fidelity Investments (4½ stars) wins because of its excellent mobile tools and assistance available whenever you want it. The firm is one of the rare brokerages that maintained access to international markets when others walked away. Now that the company has lowered its base commission to $4.95 and its per contract options fee to 65 cents, Fidelity’s full suite of tools and services is also a terrific value. Fidelity is leading the way in making the quality of its trade executions more transparent. We’re fans of the Fidelity report that displays after every execution showing how much price improvement its trading engine generated. As one of the three brokers that participate in the Financial Information Forum’s voluntary extended reporting program, which is working to standardize execution quality reports (the others are Schwab and Scottrade), the firm also puts out quarterly reports that show the percentage of orders that were price-improved, and the average savings per order. In the fourth quarter of 2016, a 500-to-1,000 share order of a stock listed on the S&P 500 attained an average savings of $10.25 per order at Fidelity. That gives you more back in price improvement than you pay in commissions. On its Website and in mobile apps, Fidelity’s design mandate is to create a unified customer experience, so that you don’t feel like you’re in a different universe on your tablet compared with your desktop. Its exchange-traded-fund screener now includes technical pattern recognition powered by Recognia, which lets you look for particular price events, such as a moving average crossover or, perhaps, a bullish engulfing line for candlestick enthusiasts. The screener will display all of the technical events you’ve chosen, then narrow down the choices further by fundamental items, such as market capitalization, or pricing characteristics such as volatility. Fidelity also has an ETF Compare tool, which shows you similar funds and lets you compare them side by side. ETFs that trade commission-free—91 in all at Fidelity—are indicated with an icon. Fidelity has made a concerted effort to go after the millennial market, including repackaging educational content onto its mobile site. There are 12 programs available now, with more being added monthly. The Planning and Guidance center is designed to allow customers to focus on the future, planning for any kind of goal from college tuition to retirement to taking a long vacation. Fidelity Go, the firm’s robo-advisory service, is clearly aimed at the younger set. Fidelity has also added a site that allows guest access for 30 days and includes its premium research. When the 30 days are up, you can decide whether to open an account. Interactive Brokers (4½ stars) maintains its position near the top of the charts. IB is aiming at more than just the hyperactive trader these days. In order to ease a new customer onto its flagship trading platform, the downloadable Trader Workstation, or TWS, IB has launched a layout library that includes 20 predefined setups for different styles of trading. There are templates for options traders, fundamental research, and traders who focus on the news. You can set up as many layouts as you’d like and switch among them using the tabs at the bottom of the screen. To keep from getting lost in the complexity of the Trader Workstation, IB introduced an artificial-intelligence-enabled assistant named IBot, which responds to plain English questions. IBot can answer queries about price quotes, option chains, order placement, upcoming corporate events, and market activity, among other things. The trader’s journal has been enhanced significantly, allowing you to organize your notes by underlying symbol so you can see all of your notes in one streaming view. These notes are stored on IB’s server, so you can access them whether you’re using the desktop, Web, or mobile version of the platform. IB also offers 10 low-fee robo-advisory portfolios from its Covestor Smart Beta Portfolios unit. The portfolios combine automated investing with human oversight, and their risk-return profiles are potentially more profitable than passive index trackers. Rather than being invested in ETFs, the portfolios, which are rebalanced quarterly, include a wide range of individual stocks. The minimum investment is $5,000, and the portfolios may include fractional shares of some of the stocks. Fees top out at 0.08%. TD Ameritrade (4½ stars) moved up into the top three this year by enhancing each of its platforms. On the Web, the experience of analyzing stocks has become more personalized in the My Stocks Overview section of its research section. The firm’s thinkorswim platform added global indexes to the charting package, as well as Federal Reserve data. Technical traders can use an enhanced scanner, which looks for classic and candlestick patterns. You can even set up a scan graphically, by dragging and dropping components into the tool. One of the creature comforts we appreciate is the way TD watchlists can be generated quickly from the output of a screener and then made available to all platforms—including mobile. You can have a multiscreen setup that includes your mobile devices, and all of your data and watchlists are instantly synchronized. The designer crew at TD has made thoughtful changes to the mobile experience, including the way long watchlists are sorted on smaller devices. Some other brokers don’t allow you to access real-time streaming data on multiple devices simultaneously, mainly because of the cost of supplying the data. “We’re good at negotiating with data providers,” notes a technical manager at the firm. With 20% of trades occurring on mobile devices, the focus on mobile is appropriate. Over the past year, TD launched its own robo-advisory service, Essential Portfolios, via its advisory affiliate, TD Ameritrade Investment Management. Goal-setting is a key piece of this service, with five diversified model portfolios recommended by Morningstar. Slider bars allow the client to make adjustments at any point in the investing cycle, and display the updated results. For clients who are not projected to hit their targets, up to three tips are presented to help them get back on track. OptionsHouse (4 stars), which was acquired last year by E*Trade, continues to operate as a separate entity but will be integrated into a single platform this year. The combined firms are targeting the summer for the completion of the process, which will offer the OptionsHouse platform to E*Trade customers, and vice versa. OptionsHouse’s Steve Claussen assures us that the platform will not be going away, and will be developing additional tools for analyzing and trading futures. When the merger is complete, OptionsHouse customers will be able to utilize E*Trade’s extensive education offerings as well as its recently-launched robo-advisory. On the mobile front, OptionsHouse launched two new native mobile apps in 2016, and is currently rolling out a new HTML5 application that can run on any device, from desktop to smartphone. The new layout is extremely flexible, and the design team worked to reduce the number of clicks and taps that it takes to get around, and to provide more functionality for active traders. Options chains displays snap onto the screen. When placing an options order, data for the underlying stock continue to stream, keeping the trader up to date during the process of crafting a spread. The platform has switched from a proprietary charting package to one powered by third party Chart IQ, which has given OptionsHouse additional technical studies as well as fundamental data (dividends, earnings, splits) that display on a chart. On mobile, the platform has been redesigned so that it can be operated with one hand, either right or left, for quick access to quotes and trading. The mobile options chain uses a tumbler for choosing strikes and dates rather than long drop-down menus. There are multiple trade analysis tools on both mobile and the HTML5 platform to make sure you know the probability of success. Charles Schwab (4 stars) continues to pull tools from optionsXpress into its flagship Web platform, and in the last year has invested into its trading infrastructure to support those tools. Once the integration is complete, Schwab will offer portfolio margining, which will be a benefit to active traders who use options to mitigate risk. Idea generation functions, including Trade Source, a gain/loss analyzer, have also been added to the Website. The site has also been enhanced with additional personalization, such as a customizable opening view with widgets that can be dropped into the display. Once you’ve updated this view on the Web, it follows you to your mobile app. For active traders, StreetSmart Edge added quite a few options tools, including a nicely laid-out trading workflow. A probability calculator is built into the trade ticket. When viewing account positions, you can resubmit, close, or roll out a position into a future strike with minimal effort. One area where Schwab has made a big push is transparency around order execution and quality. The firm has introduced a new order routing system that allows it to make direct comparisons of quality across execution venues. During the fourth quarter of 2016, this new system ensured that 98.4% of shares traded in the 500-1,999 share bucket were executed at the current market quote or better, and the average savings per order was $11.29. This focus on execution quality is most welcome. Schwab’s robo-advisory service, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, managed to amass $12.3 billion in assets by the end of 2016, which is an incredible figure for a service that launched in 2015. The firm has added another level of financial planning, Schwab Intelligent Advisory, which combines professional advisors with automated portfolios. Performance details are displayed upon logging in to the Website or the mobile apps. Merrill Edge (4 stars) found that about 50% of its customers who are using its mobile apps are mobile only, so it pushed to enrich the experience on smartphones and tablets. The apps now include a Dashboard feature that displays your portfolio, and quite a bit of information related to your holdings such as corporate events, ratings changes, and news. The events are presented based on how recently they occurred, and how impactful they are to your portfolio. When placing a trade on a mobile app, the entire process can be done on a single page rather than swiping back and forth. There is also quite a bit of customizable research and education content that can be viewed on mobile. The charting function is slick – when you switch to landscape mode on your device, the charts are fully interactive, which includes indicators, event markers, and comparisons to peers, indexes, or sectors. Store the template and use it again for a different symbol. There was also an emphasis on long-term investing on mobile, integrating goal planning content with self-service functions. In April, there will be a suite of mobile education modules through a partnership with Morningstar. Back on the Website, an options strategy builder has been launched, which helps a customer filter strategies by market outlook and volatility expectations. The options order entry screen was updated as well. The MarketPro platform includes the OptionsPlay toolkit as well as Recognia’s pattern recognition. Life events drive the planning and goal-setting capabilities of the platform. More than 20 life events, such as getting married, sending a child to college, buying a house, or retiring are included. Merrill has been baking in an enterprise-wide approach to helping clients meet their goals with varying levels of assistance from completely self-directed to advisor managed. Merrill Edge Guided Investing is the firm’s robo-advisory, which makes it possible to restrict the ETFs that will be included in the account. Customers with a Bank of America relationship, whether checking, savings, mortgage, or credit card, can see a unified view of all accounts from Merrill Edge. You’ll find financial advisors in almost every Bank of America branch. TradeStation (4 stars) dropped its $99 monthly platform fee, and added a $5 flat rate commission, which could be more appealing to less active traders. All customers will be able to access the firm’s RadarScreen tool for no extra charge as well. GainsKeeper, a tax management system, has been integrated to make April a less cruel month. Other enhancements include an Intraday Short Locate app to allow short sellers to find shares to borrow. When viewing quote detail on a particular stock, you’ll be able to see an “easy to borrow” or “hard to borrow” indicator. Several algorithms for managing large block trades have also been published. OptionsStation Pro is also available to all customers for no additional fee, and it has been simplified considerably in the last year. At the bottom of the options chain screen are four tabs rather than the previous 12, with access to trading, analysis, position management, and search. When viewing an options chain, as you click on a bid or ask, a spread gets built. The platform recognizes the spread you are building, or you can click on a drop-down menu to start with a particular strategy. The Analyze tab displays a profit/loss graph, while the manage tab lets you quickly roll a strategy out, or add legs. On mobile devices, options chain displays were expanded, including Greeks calculations. Conditional order types were enabled on mobile, as well as the ability to close all positions with a click. The firm added a huge amount of content to its educational offerings, with resources that address all asset classes and skill levels. There are live Webinars every day the market is open, including those on strategy trading, daily market intelligence, and “I Want To Be A Trader” sessions for novices. The platform is ideal for technical analysis junkies, and for those who want to build their own trading system. E*Trade (4 stars) rolled out its new Portfolio display last fall, which offers a much cleaner layout with easier access to additional functionality. The aim was to allow customers to get more tasks done without having to leave the page, which was a most welcome update. The entire navigation experience was overhauled and simplified; as a result, the Website feels much cleaner and up-to-date. The Estimated Income tool was overhauled, giving customers a clearer picture of how their portfolios are generating income with a customizable time frame and the ability to seek out additional income. E*Trade Pro’s charting package was significantly enhanced as well, including 110 technical and fundamental studies and comparison tools. The charts created in E*Trade Pro can also be loaded in the mobile apps, which is a welcome cross-platform integration. With the acquisition of OptionsHouse, E*Trade will be able to offer additional options analytics and trading functionality later this year. E*Trade launched its own robo-advisor, Adaptive Portfolio, in mid-year, which allows combinations of actively and passively managed ETFs and mutual funds. Portfolio analysis functions look similar when viewing a robo-generated portfolio or your regular portfolio in terms of asset allocation. The firm offers three other managed solutions with higher initial minimums. Tradier (3½ stars) is an interesting animal. This is its first year in our survey since its founding in 2012, and what it provide is essentially a trading engine and a back office management system to which third- party developers can attach a front end. So it’s hard to review when compared to the others in the story since there are so many possibilities inherent in this model. There are currently about 100 developers who partner with Tradier, including eSignal, Quantcha, Mobile Interactive and MissingStep. CEO Stephen Ehrlich, an industry veteran, joined the firm in May and says it plans to add another 100 providers and build its own front end this year. Ehrlich also said that it is about to announce an acquisition but was not ready to reveal the target when we went to press. Customers can use any front end they’d like, and subscribe to multiple partners. Since all account settings and data are stored in the cloud, you could use Livevol Core for your options trading and analysis, and then switch over to Technician for chart-based analysis and trading. Mobile apps are dependent on the partner. Most of the partners charge a subscription fee that is often waived based on trading activity. The platform earns 3½ stars based on its flexibility and pricing. In April, Tradier will offer its customers monthly flat fee possibilities for unlimited trading: $19.95 for equities, and $99 for options. Currently the flat fee is available through a handful of partners including EF Hutton (the direct investment platform that owns the storied name), Chart IQ, Equities.com, and Key2Options. Very frequent traders could save a lot of money using these flat fees. Lightspeed Trading (3½ stars) spent the first half of 2016 focusing on its small institutional clients, but turned back to the retail and active trader space in the second half of the year. One of its goals was to provide more content to clients, which resulted in a partnership with TipRanks, which lets you evaluate analyst and blogger recommendations, and includes a real-time feed of analyst updates. There were also some cosmetic enhancements to the order entry process, making it simpler. For options traders, Lightspeed customers can access the Livevol options scanner for free, which can otherwise cost you $100 per month. A smart order router for complex options trades was also implemented this year. The platform performed very reliably during the whirlwind trading episodes experienced over the last year. It’s worth a look for the very active trader or hedge fund. SogoTrade (3 stars) redesigned their Website in the last year, making navigation much simpler. They also put the entire account application process online, which saves international applicants a lot of time since they no longer need to print out, sign, and mail the new account forms. There were also enhancements made to the API, allowing developers and institutional customers to connect their own front end to the SogoTrade engine. OptionsPlay has been fully integrated; clicking on Trade once a spread has been chosen by the investor populates a trade ticket. “About 75% of our customers trade options,” reports Senior Vice President Kris Wallace. The firm is making a conscious effort to attract cost-conscious customers who don’t want to be swallowed up by one of the larger firms. So they are offering 100 free trades for new clients for the first 30 days after an account is opened. They also offer their lowest pricing tier, $3 per equity trade, to customers who transfer $10,000 or more into a new account. With offices in Taiwan, the firm caters to Chinese-speaking traders. SogoTrade’s parent company acquired MarketRiders this month, one of the early entrants in the robo-advisory space. Wallace says, “The days of 1% and greater advisory fees are coming to a close. A large and growing percentage of the under-40 age demographic demands mobile access to advanced portfolio asset allocation models at competitive pricing.” eOption (3 stars) completed the launch of its new desktop and mobile trading platforms in 2016, which includes enhanced research and improved charting technology and increased security. The mobile platform is moving closer to the desktop in terms of functionality, but remains a different experience for now. The firm’s guiding light with new development is now “mobile first,” and they are making sure that all new features will be delivered to iOS and Android platforms simultaneously with the desktop. Watch lists and other features sync across platforms. Social media sharing has been enabled in the platform, allowing customers to share articles to a variety of venues. The charting platform has been enhanced, and displays entry and exit points for your trades. When placing a trade, all commissions and fees are explicitly spelled out, including regulatory fees, so there are no surprises. The big advantage to eOption is the ability to trade enormous spreads at low cost. This firm is by far the least expensive choice for heavy options traders, and the enhancements to the platform make it easy to build spreads quickly. Firstrade (3 stars) focused on enhancing its options platform over the last year, adding support for 3- and 4-legged strategies. The ability to roll a strategy forward was added as part of this upgrade, as was a rewrite of the buying power and risk engine to provide additional funds for purchase of securities for those using margin. The firm was one of the six cutting its commissions this winter, and is now even with Schwab and Fidelity at $4.95 for equities. Firstrade remains committed to providing real-time streaming data, high quality market information, and research. It also has multilingual customer service representatives available to provide live help. CEO John Liu says, “We believe it is vital that customers are able to reach out to a real person when they have questions about their money.” Firstrade is seeing trades on its mobile platform grow to 25% of all transactions placed, and expects to see 30% by the end of the year. They are launching a new mobile app later this year, and expect the number of mobile users to increase significantly across the industry. Just2Trade (2 stars) streamlined its Website and enhanced their mobile apps over the last year. Just2Trade’s fees are very low, at $2.50 per stock trade, but the firm does not offer access to mutual funds or bonds. The Web-based trading application has streaming data with stock and options trading functionality that is relatively basic compared to others in the survey. Tabs offering access to charts and trading ideas open new windows that access third-party Websites, including advanced charting under the TradeX banner and trading ideas on BestTrades. For more advanced trading and analytical capabilities, you can access your Just2Trade account through several third-party applications, though you’ll pay additional fees. These include the recently-added MetaTrade, Sterling Trader Pro, OEC Trader and CQG Trader. The mobile futures trading platform, iBroker, is also available. Trading Block (2 stars) had a fairly quiet year in 2016 as most of the firm’s focus was on rebuilding its middleware to better serve its network of registered independent advisors and brokers. The long-scheduled revamp of the client-facing front end will take place this year. Trading Block’s score suffers because they do not offer a mobile trading platform yet, and fees are on the high side after all the other price cuts. TradingBlock’s suite of proprietary scanners, which include TradeBuilder and Portfolio Hedger for free, allow you to look for options strategies and collar strategies to protect existing stock or ETF positions. You can add EdgeFinder for $199/month, which is a real-time customizable scanner that analyzes over 30 different variables to locate potential trades. It also has a method for finding mispriced contracts, which can result in more profitable trades. Planner Securities (2 stars) focuses on bringing foreign accounts to the U.S. markets. Its current big push is into Brazil, but the firm is also present in Russia, Ireland, and Bulgaria. The platform offers research on Brazilian ADRs, and also automatically opens an iBillionaire robo-advisory account for every new customer. “If you trade, allocate 10% of the commissions generated and put them into the robo,” says Humberto Santos, Planner Securities’ managing director. The trading platform is AlphaPlan, which is a flexible Web-based application. The firm’s investment banking side also provides private equity, and offers management and financial advisory services to professional soccer players from Brazil and elsewhere.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 March 2017 by Military News Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Buys Apple Stock — Should You? CEO Warren Buffett recently disclosed that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) owned 133 million shares, or about $18.5 billion, worth of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock. Apple joins other sizable holdings — Wells Fargo & Co  and The Coca-Cola Co  — as one of Berkshire Hathaway’s top equity investments. Throughout his career, Warren Buffett has made successful investments in several different industries, but some of his most famous and rewarding investments have been in consumer product companies. His 1988 investment in Coca-Cola is probably Buffett’s most famous investment. Similar to Apple, Coca-Cola had a product with universal appeal and was demonstrating growing revenue and profits at the time when Warren Buffett invested 25% of Berkshire Hathaway’s book value in Coke shares. Apple’s competitive advantage Apple’s Opera retail store in Paris. IMAGE SOURCE: APPLE INC. Although the Apple investment is notable because of Buffett’s historical tendency to shun tech stocks, it actually fits the qualities the Omaha-based investor has looked for in other investments. If you use an iPhone, iPad, and/or a Mac computer, you probably have some experience with the stickiness of Apple’s products and services. It’s not likely that someone who has taken lots of photos of treasured moments and purchased lots of content from iTunes is suddenly going to abandon Apple for a Samsung Electronics Co  or a Microsoft  product. Millions of customers have a strong attachment with Apple’s devices, and this is what attracted Warren Buffett’s attention: Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product and enormously useful product that people would use … The continuity of the product is huge, and the degree to which their lives center around it is huge. And it’s a pretty nice … franchise to have with a consumer product. Apple creates beautifully designed products and has successfully tied it all together with Apple’s iCloud storage service, which automatically keeps all of your content synced between devices. The unique, spartan-esque product design and sticky services have led Apple to become one of the most iconic brands in the world. Apple consistently earns high customer satisfaction ratings, which continues to help sell tens of millions of iPhones every quarter. This success has been a good marketing tool for other product lines like Mac computers, which continues to show strength while the PC industry is in decline . These qualities have led to impressive growth in Apple’s business over the last 10 years: Fiscal Year Revenue Net Income 2016 $215.6 $45.7 2011 $108.2 $25.9 2007 $24.0 $3.5 Amounts in billions. DATA SOURCE: Apple Inc. annual reports. While Samsung controls the No. 1 spot in smartphone market share in terms of unit sales, Apple generated every dollar of profit in the industry in 2016, according to one analyst . Apple achieves this by commanding a premium price to competing products, reinforcing the brand’s strength in the marketplace. Should you follow Warren Buffett and buy Apple? Let’s not kid ourselves: Warren Buffett is one of the world’s greatest investors. You could do a lot worse than just sit back and buy every stock Berkshire Hathaway owns, and never sell. But keep in mind that Warren Buffett’s investments don’t always perform well right off the bat. In 2011, he disclosed on CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway’s $10.7 billion investment in International Business Machines , which has dramatically underperformed the market ever since. SPY data by YCharts . Don’t expect to hit a homerun with Apple Nonetheless, the strong financial position of the company and a great brand should deliver decent returns for shareholders in the future, but don’t expect to earn anything close to the stock’s nearly 1,000% rise in the last 10 years. SPY data by YCharts . The stock trades for a very reasonable 16 times earnings , and analysts expect the company to grow about 9% annually over the next five years. Apple also offers an annual dividend yield of 1.6%, and management has been using cash flow to buy back shares, helping earnings per share grow 16% annually over the last five years compared to 14.8% annual growth in revenue. Plenty more dividends and share buybacks will come since the business generates over $60 billion in annual cash flow and currently has a whopping $246 billion in cash assets on the balance sheet and only $73.5 billion in debt. Investors can achieve success using their own insights My takeaway from Warren Buffett’s investment in Apple is the advantage individual investors have over the big financial institutions in managing their own money. Anyone who has been an Apple customer in the last 10 years would have figured out long ago the same qualities one legendary investor observed only recently. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Problem Solving | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (11) How to Identify High-Performance GPU Apps on the MacBook Pro by Jeff Carlson Shortly after the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began shipping, battery life became a hot topic. Although Apple boasts up to 10 hours of performance per charge, I wasn’t seeing anything near that on my machine. I’d get maybe 4 hours. For a while, Consumer Reports refused to recommend the MacBook Pro because of battery life, although their testing methodology was questionable (see “Why We Should Care about the Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Rating,” 12 January 2017). The upside of the tempest was that Apple was able to fix some graphics and battery life issues in the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 updates. One of those problems centered around the way macOS switched between the built-in Intel graphics processor and the discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics card available in the 15-inch models. (Although I’m writing specifically about the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the following discussion applies equally to any MacBook Pro with a discrete graphics card.) When you launch a graphically demanding app, such as Adobe Photoshop, macOS switches to the Radeon processor, which consumes more power. When you quit the power-hungry app, the machine is supposed to turn off the discrete card and switch back to the integrated graphics processor, which offers less graphical power but doesn’t chew as much battery life. Before 10.12.3, macOS wouldn’t accurately sense that the changeover had happened and would continue to drive the display using the discrete GPU. Since applying that update, my battery life has dramatically improved. Even still, though, there are times when it seems as if my battery level is slipping away faster than I would expect given the work I’m doing. If you’re experiencing something similar, here’s how you can determine which apps are using which graphics processor and potentially track down the culprit. You have a couple of options: First, click the Battery menu bar item, which will tell you which applications are “Using Significant Energy.” That’s a fuzzy indicator, however. You can be running an application that’s using significant energy and still be using the integrated graphics processor. So, a quick trip into Activity Monitor is more helpful. Launch Activity Monitor (located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder; you can get there quickly in the Finder by choosing Go > Utilities) and click the Energy tab. At the bottom of the window, see which graphics card is currently in use: Integrated (the Intel GPU) or “High Perf” (the high-performance Radeon GPU). If it’s the latter, you may be burning energy faster than you want. To determine which application is causing the discrete GPU to run, click the Requires High Perf GPU column to sort the list of running processes based on that attribute. You may have to click the heading twice to sort it correctly; the caret to the right of the column title should be facing down to indicate that you’re sorting in descending order. At the top of the list, the apps that say Yes are your culprits. Quit those apps. Even if you’re not actively using them, their presence can keep the discrete GPU active. The Graphics Card indicator at the bottom of the screen should switch back to Integrated. You’ll notice that Activity Monitor also includes a Time Remaining estimate. When Apple released 10.12.2, it took the unusual step of removing this information from the Battery menu bar item (see “macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Focuses on New MacBook Pros,” 13 December 2016). Happily, you can still get that information in Activity Monitor. The estimate is still just an estimate, though, and shouldn’t be taken as gospel because macOS adjusts its energy management features frequently. Nevertheless, the Time Remaining estimate can be a helpful guideline if you’re getting close to the wire. Of course, if you have to use even a single app that requires the discrete GPU, your battery life will suffer, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Similarly, even if no apps are using the discrete GPU or reporting as using significant energy, the battery may drain faster than you expect due to other factors. Especially on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I’ve found that turning off keyboard illumination (expand the Control Strip on the Touch Bar to reveal the keyboard brightness buttons) and reducing screen brightness can make a big difference.   Make your next move with a beautiful website and customized domain name.

Is your MacBook Pro with Touch Bar getting less battery life per charge than you think it should? The culprit could be applications that are forcing it to use the high-performance graphics processor. Here’s how to tell which GPU is in use and which applications to close to switch to the integrated processor. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard  2017-03-13 15:31 This is brilliant and incredibly useful. I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro but I've always wanted to see which of my application uses the discreet GPU. It looks like my only application that uses it is Lightroom. Safari has memory issues but they're not related to the GPU. Reply Greg  2017-03-13 21:16 Why would pgAdmin need the graphics card? It's the only app that was using it. pgAdmin can view Postgres databases. That doesn't seem too demanding. Is there any downside when the MBP is not running off the battery? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:08 I just downloaded the latest version (4.13) and also found it requires the "high perf. GPU." My guess it's because its GUI is made using the Qt framework and there's something about the framework that makes the Mac think it should use the discrete video card; every application made with Qt likely will do the same. I would report it to Postgres in case there's some setting they can use in the Mac build process to make the application *not* trigger use of the discrete video card. When you're not running off battery, the consequences of using the discrete video card are much less significant; you're using more electricity than necessary and may be adding wear to the cooling fans. Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-14 01:55 I use a 15" MacBook Pro as the navigational system on a yacht and power consumption is critical, especially when there is little sun or wind for power generation. For years I have used gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io). This useful app places an extra item in the menu bar which indicates by displaying the letter i or n whether the integrated or Nvidia discrete processor is active. Pull down on the icon and it shows a list of apps requiring the external card processor. You can also switch between using Integrated only, discrete or dynamic switching. You cannot switch to 'Integrated only' if an app is already using the discrete processor. Some apps and an external display force discrete mode anyway. I have gfxCardStatus set to display a notification whenever the mode is switched. This is a useful warning when you happen to launch an app that turns on the discrete processor and comforting confirmation when you quite a culprit. I have successfully got app developers to remove unnecessary use of the discrete card and to fix an app that left it on when quitting. But if the app is no longer being maintained you may be out of luck - Bento for example. Thoroughly recommended. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:17 I wanted to mention gfxCardStatus, but it's no longer actively maintained, and doesn't work reliably under Sierra (and maybe a version or two back). I used it for years, and wrote about it for TidBITS in 2011: Reply Troy T  2017-03-19 22:55 I've used this utility for years and continue to be happy with it. As it isn't maintained, it's less helpful in shifting sources of video drivers, but it continues to flawlessly show when the system is using discrete graphics and which apps are forcing its use. As long as gfxCardStatus still reports what's going on with the video circuitry, I'll strongly recommend it for anyone who is interested in stretching their battery capacity. Reply DelfM  2017-03-14 08:35 It's probably rare that you would be concerned about power consumption when you connect an external monitor, but my 2012 MacBook Pro Retina switches to the high performance graphics card when I connect an external monitor, even if none of my open applications need it. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:14 Yes, I think all MacBook Pros with discrete cards switch to the GPU to power an external monitor. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:18 I don't understand why it automatically uses the discrete card when an external monitor is attached, Macs without such cards are able to use the same monitors. It also happens regardless of whether the external monitor is extending the desktop or mirroring the built-in display. At work, we always advise faculty to use the AC adapter when presenting from a laptop but it would be nice if they didn't have to. I don't have the ability to check at the moment but I wonder if screen mirroring over AirPlay or using 3rd party mirroring software triggers use of the discrete card. It would be a little ironic if they don't, given that mirroring by software almost certainly is more intensive than mirroring on a physically connected display. Reply David Redfearn   2017-03-14 13:57 I started looking at this data when I got my new MBP 15. One oddity I have noticed is that Apple Photos does not seem to use the AMD GPU. I have two Photos extensions (RAWPower and DxO) that do trigger the GPU when they are used, but when I am finished with them, the GPU is turned off. David Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 16:15 I would bet Apple tuned Photos especially so it doesn't need the GPU.

The company’s Tissot brand will introduce a model around the end of 2018 that uses the Swiss-made system, which will also be able to connect small objects and wearables, Swatch Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said in an interview on Thursday. The technology will need less battery power and it will protect data better, he said later at a press conference. Switzerland’s four-century-old watch industry has been adjusting to new competition since Apple Inc. entered its territory with the Apple Watch in 2015. Hayek faces the uphill challenge of trying to outsmart Google and Apple, which have fended off would-be rivals to their operation systems in smartphones and watches. Hayek’s strategy contrasts with that of LVMH watch chief Jean-Claude Biver, who earlier this week unveiled an upgraded TAG Heuer smartwatch the brand developed with Google and Intel. Hours after Swatch’s announcement, Richemont said it plans its first smartwatch, the Montblanc Summit, which will sell for $890 and up starting in May, using Android 2.0 technology. Competition from smartwatches has hurt low-end timepieces the most, and Hayek has been adding electronic functions into Swatch’s own less expensive brands such as Tissot and its namesake timepieces. This month, Swatch said it developed the world’s smallest Bluetooth chip for use in watches and household objects. Swatch’s approach will work better because it’s trying to “think small” as one of the biggest problem for wearable devices is battery drainage, Hayek said, speaking at the Biel, Switzerland headquarters of Omega, another of 18 brands that Swatch produces. “There’s a possibility for wearables to develop as a consumer product, but you have to miniaturize and have an independent operating system,” the CEO said. “I’m not convinced,” said Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas who follows the luxury industry. “People use smartwatches expecting to use the same apps they have on their mobiles. A proprietary operating system defeats the object.” Swatch is willing to supply third parties with the operating system, which has been developed with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology, a university specialized in miniaturization, Hayek said. The company has received about 100 requests for more information, with half coming from smaller Silicon Valley companies that don’t want to be dependent on Android and iOS, he added. Separately, Tissot has yet to start selling its Smart Touch smartwatch, according to Francois Thiebaud, head of that brand. He said last year the solar-powered watch would be available during 2016, and that it would be connectable to Android and Apple smartphones. It also would have functions such as showing the weather and helping the wearer find lost keys. Swatch also forecast a rebound in US and European markets as it published its annual report on Thursday. Hayek said revenue may increase about 7 per cent to 9 per cent this year. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

TAG Heuer on Tuesday unveiled the new generation of a $1,650 smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel. Two days later, Montblanc followed with the $890 Summit. Also on Thursday, Swatch Group Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract millennial shoppers during the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry. Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for giant Apple Inc., and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s traditional output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. “Swiss watchmakers aren’t doing this to fend off the Apple Watch.” $15,000 watches Instead, they’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers — who often don’t wear anything on their wrist, smart or otherwise. Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as $10,000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while TAG Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about $15,000. The original version of the Apple Watch starts at $269. “It’s a way to be on top of people’s minds, and hopefully getting people in their stores,” said Alessandro Migliorini, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities LLP. So far, Swiss watch makers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces. The top five brands by sales, as ranked by analyst Rene Weber at Bank Vontobel — Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines — have stayed out of the smartwatch market entirely. The latest releases represents a change of heart for Richemont, which owns Montblanc, and Swatch, which produces Omega. Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert previously said his brands only planned to make “intelligent watch-straps” and that putting electronic functions into the watch case creates a danger of obsolescence for time-honored watchmaking practices. Swatch CEO Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution.” TAG Heuer wants smartwatch buyers to upgrade. With its first device, customers could pay extra to replace it with a traditional timepiece if they ever decided it was obsolete. For the new version introduced this week, which is Swiss-made, TAG Heuer is offering a module for an extra $1,650 that can swap the smartwatch with a mechanical time face. Google, Apple Google’s Android operating system is behind a number of smartwatches, including Montblanc’s new gadget, which is made in China. The US tech firm has partnered with LG, and in February Huawei launched the company’s Watch 2. Models from Motorola, Sony and Fossil also run Google’s operating system. High-profile failures, such as the death of a $17,000 luxury version of the Apple Watch and the end of smartwatch pioneer Pebble, are easier to count than successes. Market researcher IDC declared in a report this month that “wearables aren’t dead,” but growth in the category is erratic. IWC had an intelligent watch-strap plan that never saw the light of day, while Tissot is behind schedule on its Smart Touch watch, which would work with iOS and Android. IDC estimates that 19.8 million smartwatches were shipped last year, missing a previous forecast of 28.3 million. Of the top five wearable makers, Apple’s volume dropped 7.9 per cent in 2016 while shipments at Samsung rose 39 per cent, according to the firm. Switzerland exported 25.4 million wristwatches in 2016, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. The mixed results for tech giants have eased some fears in the Swiss industry, which has reported signs of sales bottoming after 19 months of declining exports. Swatch this week forecast a rebound in US and European markets after previously reporting improvement in Asia and the Mideast. Guy estimates that TAG Heuer got slightly less than than 10 per cent of its sales from its first-generation smartwatch in 2016. If the technology remains a niche product for the Swiss makers, that might be a good thing, he said. Otherwise, they risk a slippery slope in which lower-priced timepieces undercut their sales. “Watchmakers have to be careful not to start to dilute their own brand equity by launching too many smartwatches,” Guy said. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Instead, it’s like a whole new App Store … just for indie-developed games. Across the section’s dedicated featured carousel (for example) you’ll find the likes of Beglitched – which Apple describes as an amazing game about “hacking, ducks and insecurity,” alongside Nimblebit’s addictive new city builder: Bit City. More info iPhone + iPad Beglitched $3.99 More info iPhone + iPad Bit City FREE There’s also mystery abound in otherworldly adventure: Pavilion … and if you fancy delving into some puzzle action to start the week, then you will likely want to check out Mushroom 11, which Apple is calling an instant classic. More info iPhone + iPad Pavilion: Touch Edition $3.99 More info iPhone + iPad Mushroom 11 $4.99 Alongside featuring individual titles through the section, Apple is in addition splitting its new indie discovery section up into different sub-sections. These include: Our 25 Favourite Indie Games – a selection of the best in indie games according to the App Store Editors, Indie Games Celebrate Innovation … – a hand-picked list of the indie games that ooze truly-innovative gameplay … and a list of indie games that feature what Apple calls Outstanding Gameplay. There’s even a section dedicated to games that boast incredible sound design, and, of course, a place for titles that offer those unforgettable moments … UPDATE Apple has added a number of other sub-sections to its recently added Celebrating Indie Games feature section on iOS. These include: – Breakthrough gaming moments – The best games you’ve never played – Games to spend the day with On Mac Apple’s recent efforts to highlight available indie titles on the Mac App Store are less impressive – but still nonetheless notable, given that the usual state of the Top Charts rarely gives indie developers a chance on the platform. In a number of regions, (including the U.S), the digital store’s usual ‘What’s Hot’ top feature section has been replaced with one entitled: ‘Celebrating Indie Games.’ The newly-added section aims to highlight gaming titles of varying price range and user complexity, and includes the likes of: Super Hexagon, Door Kickers, Dino Run DX, Super Stickman Golf 3 (FREE), Karma. Incarnation 1. and SOMA 2015 ($29.99). … although, currently, there doesn’t appear to be a link in order to access this section directly.

Photograph: David Frenkiel Vegetarian food and drink The Observer Six easy vegetarian recipes from the Green Kitchen David Frenkiel and Luise Vindahl, the husband and wife team behind the acclaimed blog Green Kitchen, now have three children. They’re the inspiration for their new collection of fuss-free recipes including sweet potato wraps and blueberry and yogurt cake Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close David Frenkiel Luise Vindahl Interview by Killian Fox Sunday 19 March 2017 05.00 EDT Last modified on Sunday 19 March 2017 05.32 EDT Two things have happened in David Frenkiel’s life recently that have prompted him to think about the meaning of home – the most obvious being that he has just written a book about it. Frenkiel is the Swede behind food blog Green Kitchen Stories, which he launched with his Danish wife Luise Vindahl in 2009. Back then, she was a health-conscious meat eater, he a carb-loving vegetarian. When they moved in together in Stockholm, she agreed to go veggie while he resolved to cut down on the pasta and pizza. The blog documented their adventures around a healthy vegetarian diet. Green Kitchen at Home, their fourth cookbook, is aimed at people who don’t have vast reserves of time on their hands. “We got requests from readers who want to eat proper vegetarian food on a day-to-day basis when they’re stressed, or working late, or have a family,” says Frenkiel. “So we tried to break down how we eat at home and build the book around that.” It helped that, just as the book went to print last October, Vindahl gave birth to Gabriel, their third child. So Green Kitchen at Home, with its shortcuts and fuss-free recipes, is also responding to their own domestic situation. The second thing that made Frenkiel reflect on home happened shortly before Gabriel was born. Last September, he flew to Istanbul, then headed south to Antakya, not far across the border from Aleppo. He had been invited to the Turkish city by the UN World Food Programme to help draw attention to the growing refugee crisis. The plan was to visit Syrian families and cook with them, then post about his encounters on Instagram. On the first day, visiting a woman called Suad who had fled Aleppo with her young family and was now living in a tiny rundown apartment in Antakya’s old town, Frenkiel found it hard to break the ice. “I’m an almost-2m-tall white man and she’s a short, pregnant, quite religious Syrian woman. It was difficult to really connect. But once we started cooking – she showed me how to make a Syrian tabbouleh – we both immediately started relaxing.” The experience has clearly had a big effect on Frenkiel and he’s hoping to work with the World Food Programme again – there’s talk of running workshops with Syrian kids in Jordan. “Even though we might use quinoa at home and they might use bulgur, we can cook together, eat together and become closer,” he says. KF Full vegetarian breakfast Facebook Twitter Pinterest Full vegetarian breakfast. Photograph: David Frenkiel We make this modernised, vegetarian interpretation of a full English whenever we crave something savoury in the morning. It’s warm, filling and generous without being too heavy. Apple and kale keep the flavours interesting, while browned onions, mushrooms, sweet potatoes and sprouts make it rich and hearty. We love to add some sriracha or gochujang sauce for a sweet and spicy flavour punch, but regular chilli sauce or even a good-quality ketchup can be used instead. The servings are quite generous here, so if you are a small family, it should still be enough for all of you with the addition of one or two extra eggs. Serves 2 extra-virgin olive oil 2 tbsp onion 1, peeled sweet potato ½, peeled brussels sprouts 10, trimmed mushrooms 10 of your choice, cleaned cherry tomatoes 10 red apple 1, cored cavolo nero or curly kale 2 handfuls, stems removed ground cayenne pepper a pinch free-range eggs 2 Heat the oil in a medium-sized frying pan on a medium heat. Finely slice the onion, add it to the pan and sauté for about 5 minutes or until it begins to soften. Thinly slice the sweet potato, cut the sprouts in half and roughly chop the mushrooms. Add them to the pan and sauté for 5 more minutes. Cut 5 of the tomatoes in half (leaving the others whole), thinly slice the apple and roughly chop the cavolo nero or kale. Add them to the pan along with the cayenne pepper, season to taste with salt and pepper and sauté for a further 5 minutes or until all of the vegetables are tender. Create two small wells in the vegetable mixture and crack an egg into each one. Cook the eggs to your liking. Serve straight from the pan, topped with a drizzle of spicy sauce or ketchup. Black rice, lentil and aubergine pilaf Facebook Twitter Pinterest Black rice, lentil and aubergine pilaf. Photograph: David Frenkiel I would put this recipe somewhere in between a pilaf and a salad, as it has both the qualities of flavoured rice and a generous, hearty salad. Serves 6 black or brown rice 200g, rinsed green lentils 200g, rinsed cardamom seeds 1 tsp sea salt 1 tsp extra-virgin olive oil 8 tbsp lemons juice of 1½ ground cumin ½ tsp ground turmeric ½ tsp chilli powder ½ tsp sea salt flakes a pinch aubergine 1, stem removed cucumber ½, topped and tailed, halved and seeds removed red onion ½, peeled avocado 1 ripe, stone removed and flesh scooped out spinach 100g fresh mint 1 handful (25g), leaves picked dried apricot halves 20 sea salt and freshly ground black pepper To serve full-fat plain unsweetened yogurt pistachio nuts roughly chopped Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6 and line a baking tray with parchment. Place the rice, lentils, cardamom, salt and 1 litre water in a medium-sized saucepan, cover and bring to the boil, then simmer for about 30 minutes or until tender and the water has been absorbed. Drain any excess water and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, place half the oil, juice of 1 lemon, spices and salt in a medium-sized mixing bowl and whisk until combined. Cut the aubergine into bite-sized pieces, add to the bowl, toss until well coated and transfer to the baking tray. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until tender and golden. Set aside to cool. In the meantime, slice the cucumber, finely slice the onion, cut the avocado into bite-sized pieces and roughly chop the spinach, mint and apricots. Put the rice and lentils in a serving bowl, add the remaining oil and juice of ½ lemon and toss to coat. Add the aubergine and the rest of the ingredients, season to taste and gently toss to combine. Serve topped yogurt and pistachio nuts. Tip Rice can differ in cooking time. Choose a variety with the same cooking time as your lentils. Green pea, broccoli and mint soup with puy lentil topping Serves 4 coconut oil or olive oil 1 tbsp onion 1, peeled garlic 2 cloves, peeled fresh ginger 2 tbsp, peeled and grated frozen green peas 250g fresh broccoli 250g, stalks included, roughly chopped (or frozen broccoli florets) vegetable stock 500ml sea salt and freshly ground black pepper coconut milk 1 × 400g tin fresh mint leaves 20 For the puy lentil topping cooked puy lentils 200g extra-virgin olive oil 1 tbsp unwaxed lemon zest of ½ sea salt and freshly ground black pepper To serve toasted pumpkin seeds fresh mint or purple shiso leaves sea salt and freshly ground black pepper extra-virgin olive oil toasted sourdough garlic bread To prepare the lentil topping, add the cooked lentils to a small bowl, stir through the oil and zest and seasoning to taste. Set aside. For the soup, heat the oil in a large saucepan on a medium-low heat. Roughly chop the onion and garlic, add them to the pan along with the ginger and sauté for about 10 minutes or until the onion begins to soften. Add the peas and broccoli and sauté for a further 5 minutes. Add the stock and season to taste. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally so the soup doesn’t burn. Remove from the heat and stir through the coconut milk and mint. Using an immersion (hand) blender or food processor, blend until smooth. Top with a sprinkling of lentils, pumpkin seeds, mint and some seasoning and a drizzle of oil, along with toast on the side. Fifty shades of greens Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fifty shades of greens. Photograph: David Frenkiel This was one of the first dishes I cooked for Luise and I like to think that it was then and there that she fell for me (and not watching my drunk feet trying to seduce her on the dance floor a week earlier). The original version didn’t include quite as many green vegetables – it was made with double (heavy) cream and served with pasta – but the essence was the same: green, creamy and delicious. You can use frozen broccoli and spinach instead of fresh, swap peas for beans and use olives instead of capers. If you don’t fancy coconut milk or cream, use ordinary cream, Greek yogurt (added right at the end) or a vegan alternative. This can be served with cooked quinoa, millet, rice or any pasta of choice. Serves 4 coconut oil or extra virgin olive oil 3 tbsp onion 1, peeled garlic 2 cloves, peeled fresh thyme 8 sprigs, leaves picked, or 1 tsp dried thyme broccoli 1 head and stalk courgette 1 capers 3 tbsp, plus brine white wine 120ml frozen green peas 190g spinach 100g full-fat coconut cream or milk 1 × 400g tin vegetable stock 250ml sea salt and freshly ground black pepper unwaxed lemon zest and juice of ½ To serve quinoa or cooked grain or pasta of choice roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley Heat the oil in a large saucepan on a medium-low heat. Finely chop the onion, garlic and thyme, transfer to the pan and sauté for about 10 minutes or until the onion begins to soften. Cut the broccoli into small florets, trim and slice the stalk and cut the courgette into half circles. Add the vegetables to the pan along with the capers and brine and sauté for a further 5 minutes, then add the wine. Once the alcohol has evaporated, add the peas, spinach, coconut cream and stock and season. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat and simmer until the vegetables are tender and the sauce has thickened, stirring from time to time so the sauce doesn’t burn. Remove from the heat and stir through the lemon zest and juice. Serve with quinoa, topped with a sprinkling of parsley. Middle Eastern sweet potato wraps Facebook Twitter Pinterest Middle Eastern sweet potato wraps. Photograph: David Frenkiel Roasted sweet potato slices are on weekly rotation in our home, tucking them into salads, mixing them with cooked lentils as a hearty dinner, placing them inside mayo sandwiches, or in wraps like this one here. The boiled eggs make it a more substantial meal; dates, pomegranate and feta add a burst of flavours, and lettuce and cucumber keep it light and fresh. Serves 2 sweet potato 1 small ground cumin ½ tsp ground turmeric ¼ tsp sea salt ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper ¼ tsp extra-virgin olive oil 2 tbsp wholegrain or buckwheat tortillas or flatbreads 2 mixed lettuce 2 small handfuls (50g) cucumber slices 10 hard-boiled eggs 2 free-range, peeled and quartered soft dates 2, pitted and thinly sliced feta 40g, crumbled pomegranate ¼, seeded tahini 2 tbsp sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6 and line a baking tray with parchment paper. Wash and dry the sweet potato then slice it into 5mm thick rounds (with the skin on). Put the rounds in a bowl along with the spices, salt, pepper and oil and toss until well coated. Spread the sweet potato out in a single layer on the baking tray and bake for 20-30 minutes or until soft and golden with crispy edges. Turn the slices over halfway through the cooking time to ensure that they bake evenly. Remove from the oven and set aside while you start assembling the tortillas. Heat the tortillas in the oven for a couple of minutes then lay them flat on a board. Fill the centre of each tortilla with a line of the lettuce, then top with the baked sweet potato, followed by the cucumber, eggs, dates and feta and, finally, a sprinkling of the pomegranate seeds, a drizzle of the tahini and a pinch of the salt and pepper. Gently fold the bottom of each tortilla up to cover part of the filling, before folding one side in towards the centre, followed by the other. Enjoy! Tip If you can’t find soft dates, soak dried dates in hot water for 20 minutes. Shattered blueberry and yogurt cake Facebook Twitter Pinterest Shattered blueberry and yogurt cake. Photograph: David Frenkiel We got the idea from a deconstructed chocolate cake we had at a Copenhagen rooftop restaurant a couple of years ago. By shattering the cake and layering the pieces with yogurt and whipped cream it looks even more decadent and it also turns the serving process into a lottery, as the pieces come in all shapes and sizes. As spectacular as it might look, the great flavour and texture are actually our favourite things about this cake. Light, moist and sweet, with pieces of blueberries breaking through. Serves 8 Dry ingredients rolled oats 100g almond flour 100g rice flour 80g baking powder 1 tsp sea salt ½ tsp vanilla extract ½ tsp Wet ingredients butter 100g, at room temperature pure maple syrup or runny honey 160ml unwaxed lemon zest of 1 full-fat plain unsweetened yogurt 250ml eggs 3 free-range, separated blueberries or berries of choice 300g, fresh or frozen (thawed) To serve full-fat plain unsweetened yogurt whipped cream fresh berries of choice Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4, grease a 20cm springform cake tin and line it with parchment paper. Place the oats in a food processor and blend until the texture resembles coarse flour. Transfer to a large mixing bowl, add the rest of the dry ingredients and stir until combined. Make a well in the centre and set aside while you prepare the wet ingredients. Cut the butter into cubes and add it to the bowl of a stand mixer along with the maple syrup and lemon zest and mix until well combined and creamy. Add the yogurt and egg yolks, mix until just combined and set aside. Place the egg whites in a clean, dry bowl of the stand mixer or in a medium sized mixing bowl and beat until soft peaks form. Using a spatula, gently fold the wet ingredients, followed by the egg whites and half the blueberries, into the dry ingredients until just combined, making sure not to over-mix as the cake will be compact otherwise. Pour the cake batter into the tin, scatter the remaining blueberries on top and bake for about 1 hour or until golden and a skewer inserted in the centre of the cake comes out clean. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool slightly in the tin before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Store the cake at room temperature in an airtight container and it will keep for 3-5 days. When ready to serve, carefully break the cake up into different-sized pieces and separate them slightly, while still maintaining the overall circular shape of the cake. Serve topped with dollops of yogurt, cream and a scattering of berries. • Green Kitchen at Home by David Frenkiel and Luise Vindahl is published by Hardie Grant (£25).

Hot Topics: Planning Board shakeup 'Top Chef' in Boulder Campfire sparked Sunshine Fire 'Forced pooling' in Erie Louisville development News tips Print   Email   Font Resize Ask Dave Taylor: What's an 'unlocked' phone? By Dave Taylor For the Camera Posted:   03/18/2017 01:56:01 PM MDT Updated:   03/18/2017 01:56:21 PM MDT Dave Taylor For the Camera Q: I was looking on Craigslist for a replacement iPhone 6 after I shattered my screen and don't understand what "unlocked" phones are and why I would want to buy one. Can you explain? A: First off, before you replace your Apple iPhone 6, check out both the Apple repair program and third-party iPhone screen replacement options. I went to a local place in Boulder when my phone screen cracked and for about $75 they replaced it with a brand new pristine screen. Better yet, they were done and it was ready to pick up in under 90 minutes. If your phone is more damaged, then you'll want to try and get one last backup then wipe all the data off it before you proceed. Go into your cellphone carrier store and ask them for help on that process. They might be able to salvage your simcard, too — that's the "brains" of your phone and identifies it on the cellular network. Move that to a new phone and the new phone rings when you get a call. Purchasing a used third-party smartphone is a reasonable approach, too, and do some research (I suggest eBay) to find out the going price of a particular device. That varies by cellular carrier, too, believe it or not. A brand new 16GB iPhone 6 for the AT&T network should run you about $300. If it's a lot cheaper, it's quite possibly stolen, so be extra leery of that. Advertisement Tip: You can check if a smartphone is stolen by asking the seller for the 15-digit IMEI number and then checking in with your carrier. If they don't want to share that info, walk away. Some cellular carriers "lock" their phones to their network, so if you buy an iPhone from a Verizon customer and want to use it on the AT&T network, for example, that probably won't work. Most of the time you can sidestep this by simply buying a used phone from someone using the same carrier. There are also ways that hackers can remove the carrier lock feature. Those freed phones are known as "unlocked" phones. Easy enough. Since we have so much critical and personal data on our smartphones now, I recommend a non-hacked replacement that's from the same carrier network. Check the IMEI to ensure it's not stolen — before you exchange payment — and then wipe the phone with a full factory reset before you start configuring it for your own use. Don't forget that your old phone still has lots of personal data on it, so you'll want to wipe that one, too, or completely destroy it if you're going to recycle it.

Reuters/Eric Gaillard Samsung has tried targeting working professionals with its newly unveiled Galaxy Book. The Apple iPad Pro is more like a high-powered tablet that some may feel is slightly over-priced. The Galaxy device is a tablet that can be a direct replacement for a laptop. The Samsung device has Windows 10 operating system, stylus and keyboard as a bundle. It provides a desktop feel to the tablet, more than the Apple device. The Super AMOLED screen is also a unique selling point for the tablet. However, it will be interesting to see whether the Samsung Galaxy Book can convert Apple loyalists and make them switch. New Atlas has compared the two devices with screen sizes 12-inch for the Book and 12.9-inch for the iPad Pro. Various other sizes are available along with slightly different configuration. Both devices are tablets first and have optional keyboard accessories that convert them into viable laptop replacements. The Samsung device is a bit thicker and is a smaller device. In the landscape orientation, it is however five percent shorter and 11 percent narrower. The Book is heavier than the iPad though both have aluminium build. While the Galaxy device is available in Silver and Black colour options, the Apple tablet comes in Silver, Gold and Gray. The iPad has a 4:3 display compared to the 3:2 display of Galaxy tab. The Samsung Galaxy Book has a display resolution of 2,160 x 1,440 pixels and 216ppi, making it a bit less sharper than Apple tablet’s 2,732 x 2,048 pixels and 264ppi. While both the tablets have their own advanced styluses, the 12-inch Galaxy Book has the battery-free S Pen included in the box. Apple fans have to shell out $99 for the stylus. The Apple Pencil charges via the Lightning Port. Even the keyboard accessories have to be bought separately for Apple, though Samsung includes them. While the Apple iPad Pro only has the 4GB RAM option, the Galaxy Book comes with a 4 or 8GB RAM option. The latter uses a seventh generation Intel core i5 chip, whereas the Apple device has the A9X processor. 128 and 256GB storage options are available for the Galaxy device. The iPad Pro is available in three storage variants, though the 32GB model is available only in the Wi-Fi model. Apple has no microSD option but Samsung has. Even though the Samsung model packs more megapixels in its camera, the iPad Pro is equally efficient in taking amazing photos. Both are available in standard Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi + LTE variants and have similar battery capacities. The USB Type-C ports are included in the Samsung Galaxy Book, while the Apple iPad Pro only has the Lightning port for charging and data transfer. Biometric login is only present in the Apple tab. One runs on Windows 10 while the other on iOS 10.

He had the dicey assignment of crawling into tunnels to find terrorists as an infantry officer with the Israeli Defense Forces. “These are small and narrow places, a very dangerous environment,” the businessman said. Those missions prepared Abuhazira, 36, for his work as the chief executive of a Gaithersburg, Maryland, company called Roboteam. It sells high-tech robots capable of carrying out at least some of the dangerous tasks he once performed, whether for a National Guardsman patrolling tunnels on the border of Mexico or a soldier in Gaza, Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq. “I knew after being in combat situations that I wanted to do things that will help protect and train soldiers and make it safer for them,” said Abuhazira, an accountant by training. He also knew he wanted to create a successful defense business. He has ventured into a crowded field against experienced rivals such as defense giant Northrop Grumman and QinetiQ North America, a publicly held company based in Britain. Roboteam’s mechanical troops keep the soldier/operators far from the unknown. The machines can snoop around corners, climb up and down stairways, case an empty building, listen for a conversation, cut a wire and even disarm a bomb. Roboteam was started in 2009 and has grown to more than 100 employees, three-quarters of whom are U.S. military veterans. That makes sense: 95 percent of its $50 million in annual revenue is generated in the United States. “The smartest thing I did is to hire only U.S. military veterans,” he said. “It helped us to get to the customer by better understanding the needs and developing the solutions that the warfighter will love.” Abuhazira said that Roboteam is profitable. He would not say how profitable. The company has sold nearly 1,000 remote-controlled gadgets to governments in 20 countries, including Australia, Poland, France, Italy, Israel, the United States, Britain and Canada. The machines are designed in Tel Aviv and Maryland, and are built in factories in Pennsylvania and Baltimore. Roboteam’s big sell is making a tool so simple that anyone can use it. There is no need to have a computer specialist helicoptered in or have an officer assigned to the unit as “the robot guy.” The business model is taken from a page of the Apple playbook. “Apple took a phone that is more sophisticated than any other phone, but made it with only one button,” Abuhazira said. “They made the phone very simple and intuitive. This is what we wanted to do with robots.” Another piece is the ability to adapt the gadget to the customer’s needs. Roboteam releases new versions of its machines once a year, similar to the frequent revisions Apple makes to its iPhones. As Abuhazira sees it: “We brought the Silicon Valley approach to the defense market.” The gizmos are so light that you can hoist one onto your back. The IRIS (Individual Robotic Intelligence System) robot reminds me of the toy Tonka trunks I used to play with. (My mother took them away a decade ago.) The IRIS sells for $15,000 and is designed to strap to a soldier’s thigh. Soldiers toss it through a window or around a corner so the little robot, which is built to always land upright, can sniff out danger on the other side of the wall. The sales pitch is that the tablets used to operate the robots are so simple that a soldier needs zero training with them. “You throw it and just work with it,” he said. “You don’t need your commander or someone. You don’t need a manual. You have one button, and it’s simple to operate.” Roboteam’s timing could make it a fortune. The U.S. military is in the midst of replacing 7,000 robots that it has purchased since the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003, according to National Defense, a publication that covers military business and technology. Abuhazira said that the company six months ago received $50 million from Israeli and Singapore investors that will help it ramp up production to meet the demand and perhaps even get into the consumer market. In addition to the IRIS, Roboteam manufactures two other models. The big seller is the MTGR – for Micro Tactical Ground Robot – which is about 28 pounds and sells for $70,000 per unit. The MTGR accounts for around a third of the company’s revenue. The battery-operated robot runs for up to four hours and has up to eight day-and-night cameras spanning 360 degrees. There is even a microphone for telling the bad guys to surrender. The soldier can run the MTGR from a tablet the size of a iPad from up to 1,600 feet away. The MTGR is used mostly for tunnels and culvert inspection to find or spy on the enemy. The third big gizmo in Roboteam’s arsenal is the Probot, which is essentially a mini-trailer the size of a riding lawn mower. The Probot is designed to carry – quietly – nearly a ton of equipment, ammunition or even injured soldiers to places a Humvee cannot reach. The Probot comes with a “follow me” kit that allows the robot to see its squad and follow a few yards behind for 72 hours. Roboteam was founded in late 2009, by Yosi Wolf and Elad Levy. Both Wolf and Levy once served in the Israeli Air Force and came from robotics backgrounds. Levy is the chief executive of the Israeli operation; Wolf no longer works on the defense side of the business. They had an idea to bring unmanned, ground vehicles to land forces. Up until then, land robots were the exclusive domain of specialists who worked with highly explosive devices. They are known as EOD technicians, for their work on explosive ordinance devices. Several of Roboteam’s staffers are former EOD technicians with U.S. military backgrounds. Wolf and Levy contacted Abuhazira through a mutual friend, and he joined the Roboteam in January 2012. Abuhazira grew up in a small city south of Tel Aviv and studied accounting and business at a campus in Beer-Sheeva after military service. “I left the military and thought, ‘It will be nice to learn business and accounting,’ ” he said. “I knew I was not going to work as an accountant, but it helps me even today. I have strong financial capabilities.” Abuhazira had experience in the military industry. After college, he had worked more than seven years at Bagira Systems, an Israeli company that develops training and simulation technology for the military. Roboteam entered the market with a splash. The first big contract came a few months after Abuhazira joined the company. It was a $9.8 million job to build and deliver 100 MTGRs to U.S. military counterterrorism units. Other contracts filtered in, including a $25 million U.S. Air Force contract for a man-carried MTGR that beat out QinetiQ and iRobot, essentially establishing Roboteam as a player, Abuhazira said. Roboteam released five products in rapid succession and won robotic competitions in the United States, Britain, Australia, Israel, Poland and Switzerland. “The thing I like the most is to support the soldiers,” he said. “That’s more my thing and not sitting behind a computer and running big Excel files.” It also beats climbing into a dark, dangerous tunnel.

NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER PHOTO AWARDS NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER PHOTO AWARDS Search for: Apple iPhone 8: Everything we know so far Seriously expensive? All the stories and speculation about Apple’s next flagship 19 March 2017 by Stuff Staff Sure, the iPhone 7 only launched in September – but things move quickly in the world of Apple. In fact, judging by prior form and industry sources, production and development of the next Cupertino flagship is well underway. There’s no better time than the present, then, to pore over the raft of rumours, leaks and speculation flying around about the next-gen iPhone. What’s in store? Well, as ever, it’s tough to make concrete predictions about what the iPhone 8 – or, perhaps, the iPhone 7s – will offer Apple fans until we see more solid evidence, leaked or otherwise. That said, with 2017 being the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone, if you believe the hype, something big could well be on the cards. Read on to find out more. WHAT WE KNOW >>> It’ll (probably) be all-glass It’s very early days, but there are already several shreds of evidence to suggest that 2017’s iPhone will be an all-glass affair. Okay, so it’ll probably still have a metal frame around its midriff but, whether to differentiate itself from the ever-growing pack of smartphone slabs or to do something special for the iPhone’s 10th birthday, several sources are pointing to a glass front-and-back design. If you’re wondering whether that’ll be really rather risky, well, it’ll probably be properly tough glass, too. It’s long been suggested that Apple might stick the sapphire crystal of its Watch on an iPhone – but that might be prohibitively expensive. A more reasonable option could well be to sheath it in Phire, a new, scratch resistant material being developed by Gorilla Glass makers Corning. >>> It might have a curved AMOLED display Every time a new iPhone comes up for discussion, it’s inevitable that speculation about its screen will be near the top of the list. What size, what shape, what spec: all hot topics amongst industry sources and rumour-mongers – and that’s as much the case with the next iPhone. There’s growing evidence that the 2017 iPhone will feature a display that’s curved in some way – whether at the edges or entirely. Yes, we’ve heard it before and, yes, we’re reluctant to put ourselves out there without more than a patent to go on – but, that said, given the success of Samsung’s Edge hardware, now could well be the time for Apple to go bendy. On the other hand, some have suggested, based on early evidence and the presence of the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro, that secondary displays on the device’s edge are as likely as a curved screen. We’re now expecting one single display, which is split into two “parts” through software – a 5.15in main screen, and a smaller secondary “function area” beneath it. The screen itself will be around 5.8in, but have much slimmer bezels than the ones we’re used to seeing on an iPhone. What’s more, more than one source has suggested we’ll see Apple move from its current LCD tech to some form of OLED for its display – whether to facilitate something flexible, or to counteract the added weight of the all-glass body. >>> It’ll be seriously expensive As if Apple’s steadily rising prices haven’t already added up so that every new iPhone makes a bigger dent on your bank balance, the iPhone 8 could be the most expensive one yet. Reports suggesting the AMOLED screens Apple will be using cost more to produce than the iPhone 7’s LCD display probably mean Apple will be passing that increase on to its customers. It’s all down to Apple wanting to use 3D Touch with AMOLED, which is proving trickier to do than with LCD. That could bump the cost well over US$1000 when the phone eventually arrives. >>> It’ll charge wirelessly More than one source has pointed towards the long-awaited wireless charging smarts finally arriving with next year’s iPhone. In fact, there’s evidence that Apple has been puzzling over how to achieve wireless charging at greater distances than the current haul of docks and mats permits. With limited NFC – largely for Apple Pay – introduced on the iPhone 6, many believe it’s high time for Apple to ship its flagship with wire-free charging. We’d have to agree. >>> It might ditch the home button If several key sources are to be believed, the next iPhone will do to the home button what the iPhone 7 did to the headphone jack. Apple went halfway with the 7, ditching the actual button aspect of its home button in favour of a sapphire glass circle with taptic feedback. Now, there’s mounting evidence to suggest Apple will be scrapping it altogether. How would that work? Well, a patent has surfaced – yes, one of those again – for a fingerprint scanner built-in to the actual glass, something that’s already been partially demonstrated by Chinese mobile manufacturer Xiaomi, which would do away with the need for a home button. This would fit with the all-glass rumours, as well as suggestions that the bezels on the new iPhone will be far smaller – though it would also require an iOS re-design to add a digital home button. The latest reports suggest a “function area” in place of the Touch ID home button, which would hold virtual buttons and interactive icons – a lot like the Touch Bar on the latest MacBook Pro. This wouldn’t be a separate display, like it is on the MacBook or on HTC’s U Ultra, but a part of the main screen. >>> It’ll be picky about its camera lenses There’s no word yet on the actual tech that’ll go into the next iPhone’s camera, but it has been suggested by more than one industry expert – most notably Ming-Chi Kuo – that the next iPhone edition will keep its dual-camera tech for the premium Plus model, rather than sharing its smarts across the range. Boo. >>> It’ll come in new colours Perhaps less revelatory than some of the other rumours circulating, there’s a suggestion that the new iPhone will come in at least two new colours – red and blue. OK, it’s hardly ground-breaking, but it is a departure from the muted tones usually associated with Apple’s flagships – and it’s something that was signalled, perhaps, by the Jet Black iPhone 7. Will we see a 5c rivalling colour line-up? Probably not, but it would be nice to see Apple affording its customers the luxury of a little more choice. >>> It might come in three models A 4.7in device, a 5in device and a 5.5in device, according to some. That line-up would fit well with an upgrade to the iPhone SE, alongside either an iPhone 8 and an iPhone 8 Plus. Or not. The latest theory suggests Apple will go big on the display, but slim down the bezels, effectively making a phone with the same screen space as an iPhone 7 Plus, but the same physical size as the iPhone 7. There would be no need for a larger phone to launch alongside it, so the next iPhone could arrive as a single, one-size-fits-all handset. >>> It might be the iPhone 7s You might have noticed that we’re being a little coy about what to call the next iPhone. That’s because no-one’s sure whether it will be the 7s or the 8. Apple has in recent years followed a fairly linear strategy of releasing a full upgrade one year, followed by an ‘S’ upgrade the next. Why would it break that cycle? Well, because of that 10-year anniversary. Would the Cupertino company really ship a marginally upgraded iPhone 7s on this grand occasion? Our heads say maybe – our hearts hope otherwise. ALL THE LATEST NEWS Wondering what our sources are? Well, you can put down the ketchup: here’s every story, rumour, leak and speculation we’ve spotted in the wild over the last few months. > 15 March 2017 Parts supplier TPK Holding has revealed (via 9to5Mac) the cost of each AMOLED screen being used for the upcoming anniversary edition phone – and it’s more than Apple currently pays for its LCD displays. Rather than paying £6 per screen for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 8’s screen will cost twice the price. That will almost definitely mean a price bump for customers once the phone arrives. Expect the next iPhone to be seriously expensive. > 17 February 2017 9to5Mac reports that KGI research analyst (and source of accurate leaks in the past) Ming-Chi Kuo has the latest info on the next iPhone’s screen. Apparently it’ll use a 5.8in OLED display, but with significantly slimmer bezels than previous phones. That means it can squeeze a much bigger display into a phone the same size as the current iPhone 7. The actual display area will be around 5.15in, because the bottom part of the screen will be dedicated to a “function area”, that replaces the physical home button with an interactive control panel – a lot like the current MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. > 8 December 2016 TechRadar picks up a report by Japanese blog Mac Otakara that the iPhone 8 – or, possibly, the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus – might well come in a red colour option as well as, possibly, a new Deep Blue. > 8 December 2016 SlashGear reports that the 2017 iPhones may, in fact, be the 7s and 7s Plus, according to Apple’s Taiwanese suppliers. It suggests that the only significant detail to change on next year’s models will be the processor, whilst the raft of major upgrades for the iPhone 8 will be delayed until 2018. > 7 December 2016 Bloomberg reports that Foxconn – long-time assembler of Apple products – has confirmed plans for investment and expansion in the US. > 28 November 2016 The Wall Street Journal publishes a story claiming that Apple is working on as many as 10 prototypes for its next handset. The biggest revelation? That at least one of the pre-production models carries a curved screen. The story also claims that Apple’s suppliers have been tasked with producing more OLED displays and screens with higher resolutions than those of arch rival Samsung. > 23 November 2016 The New York Times publishes a transcript of a phone conversation with Donald Trump, in which he suggests he might persuade Apple to move production of future products – apparently including the iPhone 8 – to factories in the United States. > 26 October 2016 Nikkei Asian Review publishes another article, this time suggesting that three iPhone models will be launched in 2017: a 4.7in device, a 5in device and 5.5in device. What’s more, the story builds on rumours that the new iPhones wil carry backs made of glass, manufactured by a Chinese company, in a move away from the present metal shells. > 11 October 2016 A second United States Patent surfaces detailing an Apple patent for a “display-integrated light sensor” that “can be implemented as an ambient light sensor or a proximity sensor”. > 4 October 2016 United States Patent is granted to Apple for “a capacitive fingerprint sensor” that’s “formed within the dielectric structure.” > 28 September 2016 Trusted Reviews publishes a story exploring the possibility that Apple will implement an in-screen fingerprint scanner on the all-glass iPhone 8. The suggestion is based on tech already in use by Chinese mobile maker Xiaomi, with the implication that Apple might utilise an ultrasonic scanner, without a home button or indent. > 12 September 2016 9to5Mac quotes statements by industry insider Ming-Chi Kuo that iPhone 7 Plus’ dual-camera tech will remain exclusive to Apple’s premium iPhone models, citing a need to keep costs down and retain an incentive for buyers to opt for the more expensive Plus. > 09 August 2016 Patently Apple reports that Apple has been granted a patent for a curved display, with plans suggesting the presence of displays of some sort on the phone’s edge. > 20 May 2016 Nikkei Asian Review shares a story detailing claims by Allen Horng, chairman and chief exec of Catcher Technology (a supplier to Apple), that one iPhone model next year will adopt a glass casing – though it will reportedly still have a metal frame surround. > 23 April 2016 Storm.mg suggests the iPhone 7 might scrap the home button altogether, in favour of an inductive design. > 17 April 2016 MacRumours picks up a report by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggesting that Apple’s 2017 devices will ditch their present aluminium casings in favour of something new – most likely glass. Why? Kuo suggests it’s in order to “enhance the competitiveness” of the iPhone in a market dominated by metal-skinned smartphones. Kuo further suggests that lightweight AMOLED displays may be implemented on the next generation Apple mobiles, in part to compensate for the heavier glass components. > 28 January 2016 Bloomberg reports that Apple is developing wireless charging for its iPhones and that the cable-free tech could be seen on its smartphones as soon as 2017. According to the story, Apple is researching technologies to allow phones to charge at further distances than those offered by charging mats at the moment.

While not the first to do this, Apple’s model caught consumer attention for ease of use. But due to a lack of marketing attention, it has languished. Not so with the D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion. D-Link has taken the router portability concept and beefed it up to the point where it’s a valid buy for the home network user as well as the “road warrior.” At its heart, the D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion is a portable router. But it’s in how easily and sensibly that it performs this task that its value can be found. Quick note: You might want to check out the included Quick Install guide — as it provides codes for a mobile app to use with iOS/Android devices. You’d find out about this later, but worth noting now, I think. The D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion can be used in three configurations — all of which affects the wireless network; in the router mode, it’s connected directly to a modem and so functions as a wireless network; in Repeater mode it amplifiers and extends an existing wireless network; in Wi-Fi hotspot mode it becomes the focal point for multiple wireless devices seeking connection through a private network of your choosing. The setup is as simple for each mode as expected from D-Link. The D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion plugs directly into an AC outlet — wait for the front-mounted LED to stop blinking and go solid green first. Set up is simple and I waited to try and use it in a hotel room during a recent trip. I adjusted the top-mounted tab to “Router” and then plugged it into the AC socket. Then I plugged the included Ethernet cable into it and the Ethernet socket in the wall. To set up a wireless network, I just went into the Network settings of the device I wanted to use (could have been a laptop but was an iPad), and entered the necessary information and security codes provided — it’s on a business-side card you can put away in your wallet. Once done, I had a wireless connection. If I had been at home, or was doing this in a larger space than a hotel room, I could have chosen the “Repeater” mode instead — dissimilar steps to set it up but in general pretty much the same, although you use a web browser as part of the process (http://dlinkrouter.local for Mac or if you’re a Windows person —  http://dlinkrouter). I had no need for a private network, but can see where this could be useful with a group that’s on location. Stepping back a moment, let me note that besides that information card, D-Link includes a flat, rubberized Ethernet cable that takes up much less room that a standard model. A nice addition, thanks. Because of the simplicity of the D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion Review, I neglected to give the guided tour. Not that there’s a lot to see — besides the already-noted LED and the toggle tab on top, the bottom finds the Ethernet socket, a reset button next to it and a USB socket at the other end. More on this now. Accessing stored information — be that data content or multimedia content (i.e., video, music) can be done locally by attaching a USB device (thumb drive, etc.) to that USB socket directly. This obviates the need for accessing from the “Cloud,” and so provides both a greater security for the contents as well as eliminating transmission issues, since it will be streamed locally. D-Link makes an app available to access the storage. It’s called “SharePort” and is designed specifically to access stored multimedia content from a D-Link compatible router such as the D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion Review. I used it with a variety of content — none of which used exotic file formats — and it all worked fine as a viewing application. I wouldn’t just count on it for all possible uses with the storage, however, so don’t get lazy. I haven’t gone into discussions of how stable and dependable the 802.11 N wireless transmission from the D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion is. That should tell you there’s nothing to complain about. In general the signal strength was never too weak to adequately perform in a high-definition environment. Of course there’s little problems space-wise in a hotel room, but in greater spaces I would expect its use would require some accommodation on the part of the user. I should probably note that there’s a WPS button on the side to initiate an auto protected/security between the D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion and another device. Those who like such things will find it usable — me, I just go the manual route so I know everything is set up like it should be. For more info on this you should go to the D-Link website and download the digital manual. You can also check into any firmware upgrades here as well — you’d download them on a computer connected to the D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion and then transfer them over, much in the same manner as you would when using one of D-Link’s other routers. Editor’s Rating: [rating:4/5] Great Bottom line: The D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion is a device that has dual purposes: those at home can use it to initiate or extend their existing wireless network, while travelers can use it to provide easier networking/local storage access while on-the-go. Regardless of which, you can’t fault the straightforward manner in which the $99 retail D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion provides networking capabilities. Pros SharePort Mobile app works with all D-Link DIR-series routers Compact form factor USB socket can charge devices Cons No extension capabilities for AC plug No mention of online manual Tweet It Like It Google + Linkedin Pin it Stumble Marshal Rosenthal Marshal Rosenthal is a Los Angeles-based freelance writer and journalist specializing in technology, consumer electronics and pop culture.

Reply Geeknizer on can I use this device in hostpost / repeater mode to extend LAN ethernet? i.e. suppose i want to connect my TV (which is ethernet only) to existing wifi network, can this device share network to Ethernet porT? Reply Marshal on If I understand you correctly, you can not connect the Ethernet port on your TV to the unit since that is reserved for the incoming Internet connection. You’d have to use a WiFi enabled TV or an adapter connected to the TV as is the case with some models of TVs as well as Blu-ray players) to be able to gain a signal. Now if what you are saying is can this be used as a repeater specifically, I would say that’s a good question as it’s not designed for that use. Granted you could plug it into an existing router to gain a WiFi signal but then it’s being at the router obviates it being used elsewhere. So I would say no. Reply Geeknizer on Thats sad that it wont bridge ethernet. Why in the world do they call this port Internet/LAN if latter is not supported Reply csi123 on “Now if what you are saying is can this be used as a repeater specifically… it’s not designed for that use.” No sure what you meant here. One specific function of the device is to act as a repeater. It is however not a bridge so you can’t use it to bridge the TV to an existing wifi network. If you need a travel router that can act as a bridge, take a look at the one from Asus (WL-330N3G) instead. Reply Gerry on Yes, you can. While using the dir-505 in repeater mode I hooked up the ethernet cable to the dir-505 and found it was spitting out internet through the ethernet port as well. Reply vikas on Ethernet port of dir 505 can be used to share internet , its tested. Reply Fernando...from Spain. on No way to connect to my WI-FI in order to REPEAT IT to the garden as I had it set so as not to transmit its SSID. So for now as far as the device has no way to select manually the name of the NET within the configuration wizard, it turns out to be useless… Software needs improving so as to include “MANUALLY ENTER NAME OF NETWORK” next to “SCAN FOR NETWORKS”. Reply satish on Can this device can convert an USB modem(with 3G chip) signal to wi-fi, so that I can use my Wi-fi only devices which dont have an USB ports? Reply Geeknizer on No, it doesnt Reply GD on I just tried one of these devices and found the setup to be clunky and confusing (when compared to an Airport Express). The product’s name is also misleading. To me, “mobile companion” = plug my Smartphone into the USB port, and the DIR-505 shares my mobile broadband connection over wifi (while charging my smartphone). Strange that DLink missed that one… Reply Android on GD: Your (non-apple) smartphone should be able to do what you are complaining about easily all by itself. Reply Apple on Even iPhones can do that.

Apple CEO Tim Cook (R) talked with Qian Yingyi, head of the School of Economics and Management in Tsinghua University at the summit. China should continue its reforms and encourage foreign enterprises to invest, Apple CEO Tim Cook said on Saturday at a forum in Beijing where he also defended globalization.  "It's important that China continues to open itself and widen the door," Cook said during the annual China Development Forum hosted by the Development Research Center of the State Council, a top government think tank. He will meet with Chinese leaders in the next few days.  Cook made the remarks a day after the Cupertino-based firm announced two new research and development hubs in China to be set up in Shanghai and Suzhou. Last year, Apple announced its plans to open research centers in Beijing and Shenzhen. At the forum, the helmsman of the US tech giant with operations across the world also made his case for globalization. "Most people would conclude that the problem is that globalization hasn't helped everyone, and it's hurt some people. But it doesn't follow that globalization is bad. It follows that we haven't done a good job of lifting up everyone and we think we have to put an intense amount of effort in doing that, because the world is so much better off."  Unlike his predecessor Steve Jobs, Cook has in recent years paid frequent visits to the Chinese mainland where the iPhone maker has profited but nevertheless has been losing market share to local brands in recent years. From November to January, Apple held 16.6 percent of the Chinese smartphone market, down from 25 percent from the previous year, while Chinese rivals such as Huawei were seen advancing at Apple's expense, according to the latest data from market consultancy Kantar Worldpanel. When asked his opinion on Chinese phone manufacturers such as Huawei and Xiaomi, Cook said they "do really good work and I think the competition is more fierce in China not only in this industry, but in many industries than it is in anywhere in the world. And I think that's a credit to a number of local companies that put their energies into making really good products." As for Apple's dominance in the smartphone arena in terms of profits, he commented that "There's a lot there I've seen, Apple's market share of smartphones I think in that way could be classified monopoly, [but] I don't see that at all."  He went on to say "What we tried to do is just we focus on making the best products ...and we'll have a pretty good business. But we don't try to make the most. Our objective has never been to make the most. So we do not have a market share objective or a unit objective." It's not only the cut-throat competition that has impressed Cook, but also the prevalence of mobile payment in China. "China is way ahead here," he said. "I rarely go somewhere in China that doesn’t accept mobile payment ... If I go out in the heartland of the US, too often mobile payment is not in the vernacular at all.” The reasons behind the stark contrast, as the Apple CEO put it, are partly due to the prevailing use of credit cards in the US and slow adoption of mobile payment terminals among merchants. In China, however, "there's just a high willingness to change and to move to what's new and what's obviously better." | PRINT | RSS Add Comment SINA English is the English-language destination for news and information about China.

Some of those much-anticipated devices are iPad Pro 2 and iPad Mini 5. However, the Cupertino-based company has remained quiet about any information regarding the matter. But on a good note, it seems like details finally be released next week. iPad Pro 2 Release Date According to MacRumors, a source told them that Apple might probably announce a new set of products next week. The launch might arrive in between March 20th and 24th. But, the publication did not mention as to what products consumers should expect to be unveiled. It was also not clear whether or not there will be an event for that launch. Now, another speculation surfaced online from Mac Otakara. Based on their report, a second-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro will be announced in the upcoming week. Since there is no Apple event next week, however, consumers should expect the release to be via press release. That would somehow make sense if the device would be just an iterative upgrade. iPad Mini 5 Release Date Another device consumers are expecting Apple to unveil soon is the iPad Mini 5. However, based on a recent statement of IHS Market Director for Tablets and PCs Rhoda Alexander, the device “may not get an update this year.” That is also the same prediction analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stated as reported by Christian Post. On a good note, the possibility of the tablet’s arrival is still open. Rumor has it that more information will be revealed in the first week of April. This news came after few consumers noticed that Apple’s online store indicated some of their tablet products to be available on April 4th. Should that be the case, then mark that date already for we could get some important information from there. As of writing, all of these information are pure speculations. None of those actually came from Apple since they are not confirming anything yet. But, stay tuned here on The Bitbag for updates in the coming weeks. For now, it is safe to say that all reports online regarding Apple’s next generation of tablets are all rumors. How about you? When do you think iPad Pro 2 will be unveiled? Do you think iPad Mini 5 will be upgraded this year? Share your thoughts in the comment section below.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Wearables Image Source: Gabriel O’Flaherty-Chan Someone ported ‘Pokemon Yellow’ to the Apple Watch Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal March 18th, 2017 at 1:13 PM Share Tweet Because the emulation community won’t rest until the original Pokemon games have been ported to every electronic device on the planet, Pokemon Yellow is now playable on the Apple Watch. On Friday, iOS software developer Gabriel O’Flaherty-Chan released a Game Boy Color emulator for Apple’s wearable device. O’Flaherty-Chan was initially underwhelmed with the amount of content available for the Apple Watch, so after making his own 3D game a few months ago, he began work on an emulator. Don't Miss: The iPhone 8 might ditch Touch ID altogether “The result is a surprisingly usable emulator which I’m calling Giovanni after the super-villain from my favourite Game Boy game, Pokemon Yellow,” O’Flaherty-Chan explains in a blog post. “Ironically, I’ve only ever played the game on an emulator, as growing up I didn’t have access to the real deal. In a way, I feel this is my way of giving back to the community.” He goes on to discuss some of the challenges he ran into while designing the emulator, including the balance he had to strike between framerate and performance. After all, he wanted the game to look good running on the watch, but he didn’t want it to sacrifice playability just to make it look better. Image Source: Gabriel O’Flaherty-Chan While this is certainly a fun proof of concept, you might be wondering how you can actually play a game like Pokemon Yellow on a watch. This was another one of the major hurdles that O’Flaherty-Chan had to overcome, using virtually every square inch of the display — as well as the crown — for the controls. “I’m anticipating revisiting the project once watchOS4/next generation Apple Watches are out, just to see if there are any opportunities to get a higher framerate,” O’Flaherty-Chan says at the end of the post.

News New Music Culture Features Lists The Archives Share < br />this article: News \ Watch Lana Del Rey Debut “Love” Live at Intimate SXSW Show Anna Gaca // March 18, 2017 Share < br />this article: CREDIT: Anna Gaca In theory, Apple doesn’t have to pay Lana Del Rey for endorsements at all–her presence alone can prompt everyone in a 30-yard radius to pull out their iPhone. But no ticket was hotter than Del Rey’s set at Apple Music’s branded South by Southwest venue Friday night. The show, announced just the day before, was her first concert since she wrapped up last year’s festival circuit, and the first since the release of her new single “Love” in February. Anyone hoping to hear a second new song, or a tidbit about an album, will have to wait longer: Lana played it close to the vest, and held the live debut of “Love” for last. As lead-up, she performed music from 2014’s Ultraviolence, and highlights from 2012’s Born to Die and Paradise EP. “Ride” received a slight makeover as a keyboard ballad; “Born to Die” became even more torchy live. Lana herself picked up a guitar for a shaky solo rendition of what she called “an old song,” “Yayo.” (She last released an album in 2015, Honeymoon, but you wouldn’t know it from Friday’s setlist.) SXSW crowds can tend toward the professionally subdued, but this was not true of people who circled the block trying to get into a Lana Del Rey show. They came wearing her 2014 tour t-shirt and screamed “you’re beautiful!” They cheered when she hit the notes, but also just when she appeared to be trying her earnest best. When sound problems affecting Del Rey’s in-ear monitors brought the show to a halt three songs in, the fans in the front row begged for selfies and were quickly obliged. About that live debut of “Love”: On record, it’s a dream of plodding bass, softly buzzing keys, and the clicking noise of someone cocking a gun. Last night, the drop hit with an unexpectedly powerful ripple of guitar before climbing to a finale drenched in echoing background vocals. Lana wiped her brow with a theatrical “whew” once she made it all the way through the song. There was no encore.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Apple has a choice to make. Will it make its Apple Pencil stylus compatible with devices other than its high-end iPad Pro tablets? I think it should. In 2015, when Apple first unveiled the Pencil, people wondered why the stylus wouldn’t work with non-Pro iPads, let alone iPhones. Then, in 2016, when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, people wondered why Apple didn’t make the phone capable of supporting the Pencil. Now Apple is said to be planning its third iPad Pro. It’s reasonable to expect Pencil support on the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro. But will Apple make an oh-by-the-way announcement about expanded support for Pencil after revealing the new slab? Unlikely. If anything, Apple could finally bring the Pencil outside iPad Pro land in September at its next iPhone event. Will it? I guess so. There will likely be new OLED displays on Apple’s 10th-anniversary iPhone. At the same time as it refreshes the displays, Apple could also introduce technology that can handle the Apple Pencil’s sensors for detecting pressure, angle, and location. Apple’s closest competitor in the smartphone market is Samsung, whose Galaxy Note phones have for years shipped with a stylus and a nifty, narrow on-board pocket to hold it. Earlier this year, Samsung introduced convertible Android-friendly Chromebooks with that feature, too. Must Apple follow Samsung in bringing stylus smarts to its flagship phone? No. Should it? Well, look at iPad sales. In the holiday quarter, the most important quarter in Cupertino, iPad revenue was down 22 percent year over year, and iPad unit sales were down 19 percent. Revenue growth for the iPad has been erased — the single biggest quarter for the iPad, revenue-wise, was back in 2013. The iPhone, meanwhile, is back to growth, with record revenue and unit sales. In 2012, Apple did bring its Siri virtual assistant to the iPad — the company’s newest device at the time — after debuting it on the iPhone in 2011. Now, after Apple has granted the iPad Pro more than a year of Pencil exclusivity, it would be wise for Apple to start letting consumers decide if they’d like to buy a Pencil for their iPhones — while the Pencil is still interesting.

Sunday, Mar 19, 2017 Search Archive Chinese Chinese Japanese French Spanish Russian Arabic Korea German Portuguese HomeOpinionsBusinessMilitaryWorldSocietyCultureTravelScienceSportsSpecial CoveragePhotoVideo English>> Apple CEO Tim Cook defends globalization during latest Beijing visit (Global Times)    09:53, March 19, 2017 Apple CEO Tim Cook (right) talks to Professor Qian Yingyi, dean of School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University at the 18th China Development Forum (CDF) in Beijing on March 18, 2017. [Photo/VCG] China should continue its reforms and encourage foreign enterprises to invest, Apple CEO Tim Cook said on Saturday at a forum in Beijing where he also defended globalization. "It's important that China continues to open itself and widen the door," Cook said during the annual China Development Forum hosted by the Development Research Center of the State Council, a top government think tank. He will meet with Chinese leaders in the next few days. Cook made the remarks a day after the Cupertino-based firm announced two new research and development hubs in China to be set up in Shanghai and Suzhou. Last year, Apple announced its plans to open research centers in Beijing and Shenzhen. At the forum, the helmsman of the US tech giant with operations across the world also made his case for globalization. "Most people would conclude that the problem is that globalization hasn't helped everyone, and it's hurt some people. But it doesn't follow that globalization is bad. It follows that we haven't done a good job of lifting up everyone and we think we have to put an intense amount of effort in doing that, because the world is so much better off." Unlike his predecessor Steve Jobs, Cook has in recent years paid frequent visits to the Chinese mainland where the iPhone maker has profited but nevertheless has been losing market share to local brands in recent years. From November to January, Apple held 16.6 percent of the Chinese smartphone market, down from 25 percent from the previous year, while Chinese rivals such as Huawei were seen advancing at Apple's expense, according to the latest data from market consultancy Kantar Worldpanel. When asked his opinion on Chinese phone manufacturers such as Huawei and Xiaomi, Cook said they "do really good work and I think the competition is more fierce in China not only in this industry, but in many industries than it is in anywhere in the world. And I think that's a credit to a number of local companies that put their energies into making really good products." As for Apple's dominance in the smartphone arena in terms of profits, he commented that "There's a lot there I've seen, Apple's market share of smartphones I think in that way could be classified monopoly, [but] I don't see that at all." He went on to say "What we tried to do is just we focus on making the best products ...and we'll have a pretty good business. But we don't try to make the most. Our objective has never been to make the most. So we do not have a market share objective or a unit objective." It's not only the cut-throat competition that has impressed Cook, but also the prevalence of mobile payment in China. "China is way ahead here," he said. "I rarely go somewhere in China that doesn’t accept mobile payment ... If I go out in the heartland of the US, too often mobile payment is not in the vernacular at all.” The reasons behind the stark contrast, as the Apple CEO put it, are partly due to the prevailing use of credit cards in the US and slow adoption of mobile payment terminals among merchants. In China, however, "there's just a high willingness to change and to move to what's new and what's obviously better."

Engst Tim Cook called them a “cultural phenomenon.” They’re backordered for six weeks on the Apple online store right now, and some independent Apple resellers tell me they can’t get any to sell. Apple’s new AirPods wireless earbuds are unquestionably an engineering feat, and while reviewers such as our own Julio Ojeda-Zapata and Josh Centers have identified a few weak points, the AirPods are generally well-received (see “Apple’s Wireless AirPods Were Worth the Wait,” 20 December 2016). The main negative is the $159 price, which makes the likelihood of losing or damaging one of the AirPods all the more worrying. While that price may seem high, most of the full-fledged competitors to the AirPods are at least as expensive, if not more so (see “CES 2017: Gadget Finds on the CES Show Floor, Days 3 and 4,” 11 January 2017). So what if I told you that you could buy a competing product for less than a tenth the price? Seriously. Don’t expect it to be as good as the AirPods, not by a long shot, but for somewhere between $5 and $20, you can buy a single Bluetooth earbud that does basically what the AirPods do — put a speaker and microphone in your ear without awkward wires. I first heard about this product category from a Cornell running buddy, Rob Kurcoba, who bought his first earbud from a Chinese reseller on eBay. At only $6.99, it was incredibly cheap, but he had to wait six weeks for it to arrive via slow boat. He paired it with an Android Wear smartwatch that could play music, the Sony Smartwatch 3 SWR50, and started wearing it on his solo runs. Soon, he was evangelizing it to the rest of us when we ran with the High Noon Athletic Club. Amused by his excitement, I looked on Amazon and was amazed to discover that the single-ear Bluetooth earbud had become almost a generic item, with numerous companies selling products that look nearly identical. I chose a $15 Nocobot model that had slightly better reviews than the others and got it a few days later — no need to wait for the slow boat with Amazon. It paired with my iPhone and my Apple Watch, and worked fine for listening to podcasts while doing yard work and a few times while running. This was all before the AirPods came out, and I lost track of it once yard work stopped for the year. But after the AirPods were announced and finally started to trickle out to users, I was a guest on MacBreak Weekly and mentioned the earbud while we were talking about the AirPods. That comment hit a nerve with listeners, generating lots of requests for more details. So here we are! Nocobot Bluetooth Earbud -- The earbud I bought and recommended on MacBreak Weekly was manufactured by a company called Nocobot and sold by another firm called Duto. It cost $14.99 and came with a custom four-inch USB charging cable with a needle-like tip that plugs into a tiny hole in the earbud. In my testing, battery life is about 3.5 hours of audio; I’m not entirely sure how quickly it recharges because there’s no way to check how fully charged it is. The earbud itself is black, and shaped like an old-style hearing aid, in the sense that it’s designed to fit snugly into your right ear. That’s either a plus or a minus, depending on your ear. It fits tightly in my ear — so well, in fact, that I have to pop it out by pulling up on the top of my ear and pushing gently from the back. It feels a little odd initially, but after a few minutes, I stop noticing it. I could easily see it not fitting in someone else’s ear. It fits only in your right ear, and in case my use of the singular hasn’t made this clear, it’s only a single earbud — your left ear remains uncovered. I consider that a plus for running or biking, where covering both ears is dangerous, but it’s a liability for when you want to block the outside world. The earbud has a single button that you use for pairing, toggling power, and starting and stopping audio: Press and hold the button for 5–10 seconds to put it into pairing mode. Press and hold the button for 3–4 seconds to turn it on or off. Press and hold the button for 1–2 seconds to switch its audio feedback between Chinese and English. Press the button quickly to start or stop the audio, or to answer and hang up calls. Press the button twice quickly to redial the last number called. The annoying part of the button is that it’s somewhat stiff, and pressing it means pushing in on your ear, which can be a bit uncomfortable. On the plus side, it’s unlikely to be pushed accidentally in your pocket or bag. Its only other interface is a recorded voice that tells you that it’s powering on or off, that the device is connected, if it’s ready to pair, and when you end a call. It also tells you when the battery is getting low, and I once heard it say “Battery high.” The quality of the audio is good, but not great. I mostly use it for podcasts while working outside, where it’s totally fine. When I first used it to listen to music while running, I experienced some skips and dropouts. I was able to resolve those by moving the Apple Watch to my right wrist or, when I’ve had the iPhone in a waist belt, sliding it around to the right side or front. The volume is loud enough for most environments, but some additional power would have been nice at times. Put bluntly, this is not an audiophile solution. I hadn’t used the Nocobot earbud’s microphone for calls of any sort until writing this article since I very seldom talk on the iPhone. When I called Josh, he reported that I sounded OK, but not great. For me, his audio was nice and clear, though not quite as loud as I would have liked. Using the iPhone’s built-in speaker and mic worked noticeably better for both of us. Our Skype test was less successful, likely due to the slow hotel Wi-Fi network I was using. The earbud can’t invoke or be used with Siri, unfortunately. You’ve probably noticed that I haven’t linked to this earbud yet. That’s because the particular one I bought isn’t available on Amazon anymore. Nor can I find any indication that Nocobot and Duto are even in business. We’re talking about sketchy Chinese companies here — that’s why it’s so cheap. However, the $14.99 G-Cord Ultra Lightweight Wireless Bluetooth Hands-Free Earbud looks identical, down to the logo on the button, so if you’re looking for one of these, give the G-Cord a try. QCY Q26 Bluetooth Earbud -- After I mentioned the Nocobot earbud on MacBreak Weekly, a listener recommended a competing product from QCY, which is a higher profile brand, to judge from a Google search. At its heart, the QCY Q26 is extremely similar to the Nocobot, being a single-ear Bluetooth earbud controlled by presses on a single button and responding via audio feedback. It costs $13.59 from Amazon and comes in a variety of colors. The QCY Q26 uses a stalk-like industrial design that has pros and cons. On the plus side, it should fit in anyone’s ear, and it comes with three sizes of rubber ear tips so you can choose the one that best matches your ear. That design also enables it to block sound better than the Nocobot earbud. Although it’s designed to go in your right ear, with the button on the top, you can flip it over and put it in your left ear, with the button facing down. It might not work well for calls in that orientation. Either way, the button is easier to press than the Nocobot’s button because you can pinch the QCY Q26 between your fingers while pressing. It’s not all good, though. The stalk design means that it doesn’t fit into your ear nearly as snugly as the Nocobot, and I’d be more concerned about it falling out accidentally. Plus, I find that the rubber ear tip blocks so much external noise that it almost feels like my ear has water in it — it’s somewhere between disconcerting and uncomfortable. (The Nocobot doesn’t block the ear canal as much, avoiding that situation.) The QCY Q26’s button is easily pressed in your pocket or bag, which can turn it on and run the battery down inadvertently or even pocket dial if it’s pressed twice in quick succession. Battery life isn’t quite as good as the Nocobot, at about 3 hours in my testing. The QCY Q26 comes with a micro USB cable for charging, and it plugs into a port on the other side of the earbud from the button. The port has a cover that’s devilishly hard to open; I can get it open only with the sharp point of a safety pin. Controlling the QCY Q26 is almost identical to the Nocobot, with a long press to put it into pairing mode, shorter presses to turn it on and off, quick presses to control audio or answer/hang up calls, and double presses to redial the last number. The audio feedback is similar too, though it doesn’t seem to talk in Chinese. Audio quality in comparison with the Nocobot is both better and worse. The QCY Q26 has a bit more oomph, and when Josh and I tested the microphone quality, he reported that it was a little better, but still reminiscent of AM radio. The rubber ear tip does block more ambient noise too. However, music sounded a bit muddier, and at least in my test unit, there’s a quiet background hiss. You don’t hear it when audio is playing at any significant volume, but it’s noticeable when the volume is very low or off. Plus, when I tried to use it while running with my iPhone in a waist belt, audio cut in and out enough that I stopped and swapped it for the Nocobot. It was fine when I used it to listen to music while standing at my desk, however. Making a Choice -- I won’t pretend that either of these earbuds is anywhere near as good as Apple’s AirPods. Their Bluetooth pairing can be annoying, audio quality isn’t as good, battery life is shorter, it’s more difficult to plug in their charging cables, their microphone quality is weak, and neither supports Siri or voice commands. And heck, you only get one, something that AirPods allow but don’t require. But these earbuds are so cheap that you may not care. I wrote this while at the ASMC Summit, a conference for independent Apple resellers, and when I showed these two little earbuds to one attendee, he said that he didn’t even bring his AirPods to the conference for fear of losing them. Just as the best digital camera is the one in your pocket, the best earbud is the one you have with you. Also, I’m talking about a category that contains much more than these two entrants. When you search for “Bluetooth earbud” on Amazon, you’ll see a variety of comparable products with slightly different industrial designs that you might find more compelling. Some are as cheap as $5, and there’s no reason I can see to spend more than $20 given how similar they look. I wouldn’t expect any of them to last for all that long, and they’d be easy to lose, but a super low price makes up for a lot of sins. My friend Rob, who got me started with these earbuds a year ago, tells me that he has since bought eight more, four of which he’s given away to family and friends. Of those he kept, he lost two and one broke, but at $7 each, he doesn’t feel bad about it. So hey, if you’re looking for a cheap wireless audio solution for one ear, give one of these earbuds a try. It’s not a big investment if it doesn’t work, and you might be pleasantly surprised.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment David Gustavson  2017-03-09 13:57 I like this stereo pair, connected by a wire that also provides a handy way to keep track of them hanging around your neck when not using one or both. (Run the wire behind your head.) I had no problem pairing. They work similarly to the ones reported on above. Maybe a bit too loud by default, but phone controls handle that easily. About $22. https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01LWZ6XZA/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Reply David Meyers  2017-03-10 17:11 If you don't mind a wire between the buds, there are several terrific options for around $30 or so on Amazon. I really like the SoundPEATS Q12 (in the ear) and Q9A (loop over the ear - very very secure) a lot. They've got a true wireless pair - which look identical to the Q9A but without the wire between the two - for about $50. Audio quality is quite good. Unfortunately, they both stink for phone calls. It's the phone call quality which is really making me consider AirPods. For calls, I use a Plantronics Voyager Edge (and when you think about pricing -- that Edge is about half the price of a pair of AirPods, which makes the AirPods not seem quite so outrageous.) Reply Floyd Bloom  2017-03-13 20:28 While you are considering SoundPEATS take a look at the QY7 version-- excellent audio, great stay in the ear fit, and inexpensive as well at Amazon-- SoundPEATS QY7 Bluetooth 4.1 Wireless 6 Hours Play-time Noise Cancelling Sport In-Ear Stereo Earphones with Mic (Black) Reply Josh Centers   2017-03-14 10:37 I covered the QY7 previously, actually based on Floyd's recommendation. https://tidbits.com/article/16774 Reply Scott  2017-03-14 07:33 Hmmm... sticking a rechargeable battery from a fly-by-night company in my ear? Great place for a battery fire. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:58 Brings new meaning to "My ears are burning!" :-) I can't find any indication that anyone has ever had such a problem, and the batteries are awfully small, so I'd be surprised if could happen. Reply Scott  2017-03-15 18:52 It's like I was predicting the future! http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/15/520269673/womans-headphones-caught-fire-midflight-australian-authorities-say Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-16 09:14 Hah—I saw that yesterday too! Given that your email address starts with "heimdall," I suppose extraordinary senses would be among your super powers. Reply Jim Schmidt  2017-03-15 14:11 I have one of the millions of knock-offs of that single ear bud. I got it off of Amazon for maybe $8. It's a perfectly acceptable speaker for my intended uses - out running or driving in the car. I've had it with me on numerous 5k runs, and never once worried about losing it. The quality is decent - I'm no audiophile, so I'm not one to ask about specifics. But I have it to keep my pace and check my stats (and listen to my phone when I'm in our Bluetoothless, AUX-less car), and it functions in that regard perfectly. I will note that it does play both channels of audio in that one speaker, so you don't lose half of your music to a missing earbud, which is nice.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 March 2017 by Military News Poynt POS Point of Sale Terminal Cash Register What is the Poynt Smart Terminal? The Poynt Smart Terminal brings the unlimited versatility of a mobile device to a future-proof payment terminal at a price that any merchant can afford. The terminal was built to meet the highest PCI and EMV security requirements as well as connect to any merchant bank. The Poynt Smart Terminal runs PoyntOS which allows developers to bring to merchants the tools and technology to manage every facet of their business without having to purchase additional hardware. What are the connectivity options in the Poynt Smart Terminal? The device connects to Wifi and has optional 3G capability. It also comes with a dock that allows for USB connectivity as well as an Ethernet port. What are the exact dimensions of the printer paper roll and where can I get it? A printer paper roll of 2 1/4″ x 16′ fits our terminal well. Here is an example of the roll we typically use for our terminal: http://www.pospaper.com/portableprinter-01.html You can buy it online and have it delivered to your store. How mobile is the device? The terminal is mobile and can move around your store. If you want to take orders while customers are waiting in line, take payments from curbside pickup or take it to the storeroom to do inventory you can do that. You can even take it on deliveries or to the farmer’s market thanks to its 3G/4G modem. How do I charge the device? The battery is charged by plugging it in through the micro USB connection on the side of the device or resting it on the dock. What kind of warranty do you provide? Warranty will depend upon the channel through which you buy your device. What applications are available on the Poynt Smart Terminal? There are several Poynt applications that come pre-installed on the device: Terminal, Register, Manual Entry, Settlement, and Help. We have also partnered with a number of developers to offer their applications to merchants. The number of applications will grow significantly, and with it the power of the terminal will exponentially grow. Remember when you had a phone with no apps? And what about all the value you get out of your apps today? That difference is exactly what we are aiming for with the 3rd-party applications running on PoyntOS. You will wonder how you lived without it! Are you a Point-of-Sale (POS) system? The Poynt Smart Terminal is a payment terminal with basic register functionality built-in. 3rd-party applications like eHopper, eThor, and Lightning Register can provide richer POS functionality. Over time more POS applications will get added to the Poynt platform. I saw in your video that you have a mobile app for iOS that allows me to monitor my business when I’m away from my terminal. Is there one for Android? What about a website? Yes and yes. We have built analytics and monitoring tools that work on the terminal, our website, iPhones, and Android phones. Does Poynt charge a per transaction fee? No, Poynt does not charge any per transaction fee. Your fees are dependent on what your acquirer bank / processor charges you. PAYMENT METHODS Why do I need to accept all of these different payment methods? Payment types are constantly changing. EMV cards are now the standard, in the US thanks to the EMV mandate. NFC payments are seeing increased usage thanks to Apple Pay. Some customers want to pay with cash. Our goal is to ensure merchants never have to turn down a customer based on how the customer wants to pay. Both the Poynt Smart Terminal and Poynt 5 package all the payment capabilities into single devices at an affordable price. MAGNETIC STRIPE Does the Smart Terminal accept good ol’ fashioned credit card swiping? Of course! And the Smart Terminal can accept PIN for pin-debit as well as Signature. What about other cards that store information on a magnetic stripe like loyalty cards, drivers’ licenses, gift cards, etc? Yes, the Smart Terminal can read those cards. However the information being read from the magnetic stripe needs to be interpreted by our software or a 3rd-party application. Another advantage of our open platform PoyntOS is that apps like these can be built by anyone with the skills. NFC What is an “NFC” payment? “Near Field Communication” is a standard enabling secure two-way wireless communication. NFC has been used for payments for years now, but has become popular recently as Apple Pay and Android Pay are based on it. Does the Smart Terminal accept payments by Apple Pay? Yes, the Smart Terminal accepts all NFC payments including both Apple Pay and Android Pay. EMV What is EMV? EMV refers to cards with small microchips in them that keep cardholder information more secure than a magnetic stripe. Each transaction has a dynamic authentication which is much, much harder to steal compared to skimming data from a magnetic stripe. EMV cards have been common in much of Europe and came to the US in October of 2015. What is EMV “chip-and-signature”? Rather than your card number being read from the magnetic stripe, it instead is read from the microchip. Customers sign receipts just as they have when using magnetic stripe cards. What is EMV “chip-and-pin”? EMV chip-and-pin involves card information being securely read from the chip, and the customer entering a PIN as a customer verification method (CVM). It’s kind of like entering a PIN when pulling cash from the ATM. Payments processed with chip-and-PIN technology are more secure and result in less fraud. QR What is a QR code? QR codes are like 2-dimensional UPC barcodes, enabling the storage of information. They can be used for a variety of things including coupons, payments and item identifiers. QR codes can be scanned using the Poynt Smart Terminal just like any other barcodes. When would someone pay with QR code? It’s another technology for enabling mobile payments that doesn’t require a second physical payment card. There are several payment methods in market using QR codes, and when they become popular, similar to any other payment method, consumers might want to pay with one of those. Why do I need to support QR code payments? As a merchant, you want to accept forms of payments that your consumers would demand. As an open platform, our goal is to allow merchant to accept the payments without being forced to change their terminals. BLUETOOTH What is a Bluetooth payment? Bluetooth payments enable a phone to securely and wirelessly communicate with the payment terminal. One big difference between Bluetooth and NFC is that the phone does not need to be very close to the terminal. In fact, customers can pay with their phone while sitting at a table or standing in line. CREDIT CARD IMPRINTS Nope, we don’t do that! Maybe a developer will build an app that will teleport you back to the 80s and you can do it there. If that happens, take us with you! Jokes apart, credit card imprints are used when a payment cannot be processed due to lack of network connectivity. Poynt Smart Terminal is built with offline capabilities to collect and process offline transactions. Your acquiring bank might require additional qualifications, please check with them for more information. CONNECTING TO YOUR PROCESSOR Which payment acquiring processors does the Poynt Smart Terminal support? Poynt has a close partnership with Elavon, EVO Payments, TSYS, and Vantiv. Other banks are also supported through our partnership with the CreditCall payment gateway. CONNECTING TO PERIPHERALS Does the Poynt Smart Terminal work with the cash register that I already own? What about cash drawers, scales, scanners, check processors, printers, etc? We have built the Smart Terminal to be able to integrate with cash registers, cash drawers, scales, ticket printers, scanners, and other peripherals. Clearly we haven’t tested everything that is out there, but we’ve built PoyntOS on the open Android platform and this enables us to take advantage of interfaces and tools that are standardized by the community. There is a growing list of accessories that have been certified to work with the Poynt Smart Terminal. SECURITY What does “state-of-the-art” security mean? The Poynt Smart Terminal has two processors, one of which is completely dedicated to the security of payment information. No payment card information leaves the secure processor unencrypted. All sensitive payment information is transmitted using end-to-end encryption powered by PCI-approved strong cryptographic algorithms. The device uses security technologies such as TLS, DUKPT, 3DES, PKI and AES, all of which meet the highest PCI and EMV requirements. POYNTOS SDK & DEV KIT What do you mean by “open” SDK? Our SDK is available to anyone, for free, to download and use. If you’re a developer and want to build applications to sell to the millions of small merchants in the United States, this is a great opportunity. What does the Dev Kit contain? The main item in the Dev Kit is the Poynt Smart Terminal (limited developer edition). “Developer edition” just means that it doesn’t have the same security controls as the merchant terminals, in order to allow for ease of application development and testing. Do I also need to order a merchant terminal in addition to the Dev Kit? No, the Dev Kit already contains a Poynt Smart Terminal (limited developer edition). You’ll be able to process test card transactions (MSR, NFC, EMV) against a test merchant store, just like you were using a live merchant terminal (but without your cards being charged). Can anyone build an app on your platform? Yes. All you have to do is register (for free) and download our SDK. Can I build a clone of Flappy Bird for PoyntOS? No. Applications on PoyntOS help merchants run their business more efficiently. Just like other application platforms we have an approval process to which developers will submit their apps. We need to approve all applications that run on PoyntOS to ensure merchant security. Are there any restrictions on what apps can be built? Yes. More detailed information is in our SDK documentation. Some key points to keep in mind: 1) Applications have no access to sensitive payment card information, and additionally are prohibited from asking for any payment card information; 2) there are restrictions on what can be displayed on the consumer facing screen; 3) sideloading of apps and services is not allowed; 4) access to custom USB devices from your apps must be approved by Poynt; and 5) all apps must be reviewed, approved, and distributed by Poynt through secure channel. Can an iOS consumer app interface with the Poynt RESTful cloud APIs? All requests to the Poynt RESTful cloud APIs need to be signed using application key (which can’t be loaded onto iOS app). You could have your iOS app talk to your own server (which has the application key) which talks to Poynt RESTful cloud APIs.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 March 2017 by Military News Apple announces environmental progress in China Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple’s industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” “Our power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,” said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei. “We’re pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.” Lens’ manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software With the Release of iOS 11 Apple Might Kill as Many as 200,000 Apps – Here’s Why By Uzair Ghani Mar 15, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit iOS 11 is on the horizon, and with its release the App Store might lose as many as 200,000 apps in one fell swoop. 32-Bit Apps Won’t be Compliant with iOS 11, Forcing Apple to Get Rid of Them for Good With the release of iOS 10.3 Beta, Apple started to warn users that the app they are using might not be compatible with future versions of iOS. In fact, to emphasize on this even more, Apple baked in a new App Compatibility section in iOS 10.3. This new section highlights all the installed apps on your device that haven’t been updated to support the 64-bi architecture that was introduced with the iPhone 5s. Related Apple Acquires ‘Workflow’ – A Powerful Automation App For iOS And Makes It Free So, with that in mind and data highlighted by app analytics company called Sensor Tower, Apple can kill as many as 187,000 (to be more precise) app with the release of iOS 11. To give you a new perspective how big that number is – that 187,000 figure accounts for 8% of the total apps available in the App Store as of March 2017. Advertisement Interestingly, the iPhone 5s came out in 2013 and it wasn’t until two years later Apple started to warn developers that they should update their apps to support 64-bit. That’s very alarming since 8% accounts for a huge chunk of the App Store. The major purge, in case you are wondering, has already started, with Apple making strides to remove as many as 47,000 apps from the App Store that does not fit its criteria last fall. And Apple appears to be constantly removing apps since then. But the big move will come with the announcement and subsequent release of iOS 11. Related Apple Is Now Offering Its iPad mini 4 in More Storage Capacity for the Same Price iOS 11 is all set for announcement at WWDC 2017 on the 5th of June. But apart from Apple’s mobile operating system, the Cupertino company will take wraps off the future versions of macOS, tvOS and watchOS as well. And at the end of the entire keynote, developers will be able to take the new software for a spin on their devices as long as they are registered with Apple. We will be diving into iOS 11 as well once the big day arrive and report back on our findings. Till then, stay tuned for more news.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile The iPhone Calibration Machine Can Prevent You From Fixing Your Own Phone’s Screen By Omar Sohail Mar 15, 2017 46Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple is strictly against the prospect of allowing its products from being repaired. So with the use of heavy software integration with the hardware, it becomes a very difficult process for third-party repair shops to perform their own repairs. Even though the company has allowed third-party repairs and states that it will not void the customer’s warranty, there is a machine that might help Apple’s monopolization of the repair business as well. The iPhone Calibration Machine Could Become a Huge Revenue Generator for Apple as far as Repairs Go – 3rd-Party Repair Shops Would Be Left High and Dry A former employee from the Apple Genius Bar describes the machine as follows, according to Motherboard. Related Apple’s iPhone Was the Most Popular Smartphone in 2016, But Which Model Exactly? “It was a big clunky machine that honestly looked like someone built it in their backyard. There were different ‘moulds’ that different iPhone models would go into before going in the machine, and it would take around 30 minutes … there was some weird liquid that needed to be placed in the machine that we would have to wear gloves with to fix it. Lots of gas type valves and whatnot. It literally looked like some backyard home job. Not very Apple-like at all.” Justin Carroll, CEO of Fruit Fixed states that it would make things a lot easier for repair shops if they had one of these contraptions. Advertisement “It would be great if a machine like that were available to independent repair shops. If we’re testing a battery or swapping a screen it would make our lives a lot easier. At the very least, it’d help if Apple open-sourced its diagnostic modes to other people.” Related Apple’s ‘Teardrop’ Design For The iPhone 8 Will Resemble The iPhone 2G, Claim Korean Sources According to people close to this information, Apple started using these machines soon after the release of the iPhone 5s. However, there is one capability of the machine that no repair shop has even been able to accomplish; allow a new Touch ID button to be paired with an old device. The sensor can be recalibrated with the old phone meaning that if Apple starts to incorporate fingerprint readers that are embedded in the display, it would give the tech giant unprecedented powers when it comes to repairs. Though third-party manufacturers can still find other ways to repair and replace different components of the iPhone, screen repairs are often the most common ones and such repairs will not be able to get carried out by them in the future.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7 Plus: Hands-on video with S8 mockup shows how they compare Zach Epstein @zacharye March 15th, 2017 at 10:56 AM Share Tweet Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus features a screen that measures 5.5 inches diagonally. While nothing is set in stone at this point, multiple reports from reliable sources suggest that the Galaxy S8 — the smaller of the two flagship phones set to be unveiled by Samsung two weeks from today — sports a display that measures 5.8 inches diagonally. On paper, it seems like these two smartphones should be relatively similar in size, no? Well, as we can see in a new hands-on comparison video, Samsung’s bold new Galaxy S8 design is even more impressive than we thought when you line it up next to Apple’s flagship phablet. Don't Miss: Leaks reveal the 10 most exciting new features coming to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 With the Galaxy S8, Samsung has managed to stuff a 5.8-inch Super AMOLED display into a smartphone that is barely bigger than Apple’s 4.7-inch iPhone 7. It’s one thing to read those words, but it’s another thing entirely to see the smaller of Samsung’s two new Galaxy S8 phones lined up next to its stiffest competition. Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ flagship phones feature a bold new design that does away with the oblong home button beneath the displays and narrows the bezels above and below the screens substantially. As a result, the company is able to fit a very large screen into a phone with an overall footprint that isn’t much bigger than the screen itself. How does that play out in the real world? The video below comes courtesy of YouTuber KK Sneak Leaks, and it shows what is believed to be a perfectly sized mockup of the Galaxy S8 created using accurate schematics leaked by the factories building Samsung’s new flagship phone. In the video, the narrator shows the phone next to Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus, which features a display that measures 5.5 inches compared to the 5.8-inch screen on the Galaxy S8. At around the 4:14 mark, you can see how the two phones compare in overall size. Again, the Galaxy S8 shown in the video is not a genuine handset. Instead, it is a mockup that is believed to have been built exactly to scale. With that in mind, it’s pretty incredible to see just how much smaller Samsung’s Galaxy S8 is, with it’s 5.8-inch display, than the iPhone 7 Plus and its smaller 5.5-inch screen. And of course, if you want to see a real Galaxy S8 in action for comparison, you can always check out the exclusive Galaxy S8 photos we published earlier this month. Meanwhile, the larger Galaxy S8+ Plus is expected to cram a massive 6.2-inch display into a phone that is roughly the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus. You can see size comparisons of those two phones in this post.

The 23-year-old rapper - who has not signed a record deal and releases his music through streaming sites such as SoundCloud - revealed he made the deal with Apple for his latest record ‘Coloring Book’ because it was too good to turn down. He tweeted: ‘’I never felt the need to correct folks on my relationship with @apple but now that more people have tried to discredit my independence, I wanna clear things up. ‘’@apple gave me half a mil and a commercial to post Coloring Book exclusively on applemusic for 2 weeks. That was the extent of my deal, after 2 weeks it was on SoundCloud for free. I needed the money and they’re all good people over there. I feel like if I didn’t clear it up people would keep trying to discredit all the work we did to make Coloring Book what it became. I think artist can gain a lot from the streaming wars as long as they remain in control of their own product. ‘’I just wanna remain transparent. Folks out there without a deal need to know they’re doing everything right just keep at it. If you come across opportunities to work with good people, pick up cash and keep your integrity I say Do It.’’ And Chance recently revealed that he would consider selling a follow-up to ‘Coloring Book’.  This news was published in The Nation newspaper.

Last week, Tag Heuer unveiled the new generation of a $1,650 smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel, Montblanc released the $890 Summit, and Swatch Group CEO Nick Hayek announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract Millennial shoppers during the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry. Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for Apple, and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s traditional output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. “Swiss watchmakers aren’t doing this to fend off the Apple Watch.” Instead, they’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers — who often don’t wear anything on their wrist, smart or otherwise. Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as $10,000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while Tag Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about $15,000. The original version of the Apple Watch starts at $269. “It’s a way to be on top of people’s minds, and hopefully getting people in their stores,” said Alessandro Migliorini, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. So far, Swiss watchmakers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces. The top five brands by sales, as ranked by analyst Rene Weber at Bank Vontobel — Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines — have stayed out of the smartwatch market entirely. The latest releases represent a change of heart for Richemont, which owns Montblanc, and Swatch, which produces Omega. Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert previously said his brands planned to make “intelligent watch-straps” and that that putting electronic functions into the watch case creates a danger of obsolescence for time-honored watchmaking practices. Swatch CEO Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution.” Tag Heuer wants smartwatch buyers to upgrade. With its first device, customers could pay extra to replace it with a traditional timepiece if they ever decided it was obsolete. For the new version, which is Swiss-made, Tag Heuer is offering a module for an extra $1,650 that can swap the smartwatch with a mechanical time face. Google’s Android operating system is behind a number of smartwatches, including Montblanc’s new gadget, which is made in China. High-profile failures, such as the death of a $17,000 luxury version of the Apple Watch and the end of smartwatch pioneer Pebble, are easier to count than successes. Market researcher IDC declared in a report this month that “wearables aren’t dead,” but growth in the category is erratic. IWC had an intelligent watch-strap plan that never saw the light of day, while Tissot is behind schedule on its Smart Touch watch, which would work with iOS and Android. IDC estimates that 19.8 million smartwatches were sold last year, missing the forecast of 28.3 million. Of the top five wearable makers, Apple’s volume dropped 7.9 percent in 2016 while shipments at Samsung rose 39 percent, IDC said. Switzerland exported 25.4 million wristwatches in 2016, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. The mixed results for tech giants have eased some fears in the Swiss industry, which has reported signs of sales bottoming after 19 months of declining exports. Swatch forecast a rebound in U.S. and European markets. Guy estimates that Tag Heuer got slightly less than than 10 percent of its sales from its first-generation smartwatch in 2016. If the technology remains a niche product, that might be a good thing, he said.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Pictures emerge of Apple’s secret iPhone calibration machine Chris Mills @chrisfmills March 14th, 2017 at 6:42 PM Share Tweet Apple is weirdly protective over the repair system that goes on at the Apple Store. You’d think that there aren’t many secrets to do with replacing glass screens and fixing iPhones that have gone for a swim in the toilet, but in Apple’s secret walled garden, everything is a trade secret. Motherboard‘s Jason Koebler has been reporting on the Apple Store’s repair system for a while now, and he finally got his hands on the holy grail: pictures of Apple’s secret repair machine, which allows Apple to replace the Touch ID sensor on repaired phones. That’s a big deal, because it’s the one component that third-party repair stores have been unable to crack so far. The calibration machine that all Apple Stores have holds the secrets to why. Don't Miss: Do you live in Boston or New Jersey? Pornhub will plow you for free As Koebler explained in an earlier post, the iPhone Calibration Machine is a general testbed that allows repaired iPhones to be calibrated to factory standards before being returned to customers. From the sounds of things, they go through a series of tests to calibrate the display, touchscreen, camera, and internal sensors: “It was a big clunky machine that honestly looked like someone built it in their backyard,” a former Apple Genius told me. “There were different ‘moulds’ that different iPhone models would go into before going in the machine, and it would take around 30 minutes … there was some weird liquid that needed to be placed in the machine that we would have to wear gloves with to fix it. Lots of gas type valves and whatnot. It literally looked like some backyard home job. Not very Apple-like at all.” But the important part, at least for third-party repair stores, is how the calibration machine allows a new Touch ID sensor to be installed. Koebler goes into detail about the pairing of the Touch ID sensor and Secure Enclave here, but the short version is that without the calibration machine, a new Touch ID sensor can’t be installed on an iPhone. That obviously makes it impossible to fix the home button on newer iPhones outside of an Apple store, but it also makes working on a broken screen incredibly fiddly. Head over to the Motherboard article to see the pictures of Apple’s hacked-together machine in action, and make sure to check out the previous coverage while you’re at it.

Ronald Brownstein 4:50 AM ET Maybe the Economy Isn't the Reason Why So Many American Men Aren't Working Alana Semuels Mar 22, 2017 Kaveh Waddell Mar 20, 2017 Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size In September 2002, less than a year after Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted by a grand jury for his role in the 9/11 attacks, Moussaoui’s lawyers lodged an official complaint about how the government was handling digital evidence. They questioned the quality of the tools the government had used to extract data from some of the more than 200 hard drives that were submitted as evidence in the case—including one from Moussaoui’s own laptop. When the government fired back, it leaned on a pair of official documents for backup: two reports produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that described the workings of the software tools in detail. The documents showed that the tools were the right ones for extracting information from those devices, the government lawyers argued, and that they had a track record of doing so accurately. It was the first time a NIST report on a digital-forensics tool had been cited in a court of law. That its first appearance was in such a high-profile case was a promising start for NIST’s Computer Forensics Tool Testing (CFTT) project, which had begun about three years prior. Its mission for nearly two decades has been to build a standardized, scientific foundation for evaluating the hardware and software regularly used in digital investigations. Some of the tools investigators use are commercially available for download online, for relatively cheap or even free; others are a little harder for a regular person to get their hands on. They’re essentially hacking tools: computer programs and gadgets that hook up to a target device and extract their contents for searching and analysis. “The digital evidence community wanted to make sure that they were doing forensics right,” said Barbara Guttman, who oversees the Software Quality Group at NIST. That community is made up of government agencies—like the Department of Homeland Security or the National Institute of Justice, the Justice Department’s research arm—as well as state and local law enforcement agencies, prosecuting and defense attorneys, and private cybersecurity companies. In addition to setting standards for digital evidence-gathering, the reports help users decide which tool they should use, based on the electronic device they’re looking at and the data they want to extract. They also help software vendors correct bugs in their products. Today, the CFTT’s decidedly retro webpage—emblazoned with a quote from an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation—hosts dozens of detailed reports about various forensics tools. Some reports focus on tools that recover deleted files, while others cover “file carving,” a technique that can reassemble files that are missing crucial metadata. The largest group of reports focuses on acquiring data from mobile devices. Smartphones have become an increasingly valuable source of evidence for law enforcement and prosecutors, because they’re now vast stores of private communication and information—but the sensitive nature of that data has made the government’s attempts to access it increasingly controversial. “It’s a very fast-moving space, and it’s really important,” Guttman said. “Any case could potentially involve a mobile phone.” It’s an odd feeling to flip through these public, unredacted government reports, which lay bare the frightful capabilities of commercially available mobile-extraction software. A report published just two weeks ago, for example, describes a tool called MOBILedit Forensic Express, which is made by San Francisco-based Compelson Labs. The tool works on Apple iPhones 6, 6S, and 6S Plus, two versions of Apple’s iPads, as well as several Samsung Galaxy smartphones and tablets. It can extract the following types of information from a mobile device: … deleted data, call history, contacts, text messages, multimedia messages, files, events, notes, passwords for wifi networks, reminders and application data from apps such as Skype, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, WhatsApp, Viber, etc. The product page for MOBILedit Forensic Express claims the software is capable of cracking passwords and PINs to get into locked phones, but it’s not clear how effective that feature is. Getting into a locked, encrypted smartphone—especially an iPhone—is difficult, and it’s unlikely MOBILedit can bypass every modern smartphone’s security system. When the FBI tried to break into an iPhone 5C it found at the scene of the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, it initially wasn’t able to access the phone’s data, and asked Apple for help. (Presumably, the FBI would have had access to MOBILedit and other commercial tools.) Apple refused, and the FBI brought a lawsuit against the company—but withdrew it when agents finally found a way in. Guttman says NIST doesn’t address phone encryption in its testing. “Encryption is certainly an issue for law enforcement access to phones and other digital media, but that issue is outside of our expertise and the type of work we do, which is focused on software quality and software understanding,” she said. The NIST report on MOBILedit describes how the tool fared against different combinations of smartphones and mobile operating systems. It found, for example, that the tool only obtained the first 69 characters in particularly long iOS notes. Besides that issue and five others, though, the tool largely behaved as it promised it would on iOS devices, the report says. “None of the tools are perfect,” Guttman said. “You really need to understand the strengths and limitations of the tools you’re using.” Unlike some more complex tools, MOBILedit doesn’t require an investigator to open up a smartphone and manipulate its internals directly—the software connects to the target phone with a cord, just like a user might to update his or her device. But law enforcement doesn’t necessarily need to force its way into a phone that it’s interested in searching, either by cracking open its case or by brute-forcing its passcode. In certain cases, officers can just ask—or pressure—the phone’s owner to open it. That’s what happened when Sidd Bikkannavar, a NASA engineer, was stopped by a customs agent on his way back to his native United States from a vacation: The officer just asked Bikkannavar to turn over his PIN, wrote it down, and took his smartphone to another room for about half an hour. When the agent returned the phone, he said he’d run “algorithms” to search for threats. It’s possible Bikkannavar’s phone was searched with one of the mobile acquisition tools that DHS has tested. The government’s growing library of forensic tool reports is supplemented by other testers. Graduate students at the Forensic Science Center at Marshall University in West Virginia, for example, do some of the same sorts of testing that NIST does. They often work with West Virginia State Police, which runs its own digital forensics lab on campus, to test extraction tools before they’re deployed. They post their results online, just like NIST does, to grow the body of shared knowledge about these tools. “If we weren’t validating our software and hardware systems, that would come up in court,” said Terry Fenger, the director of Marshall’s Forensic Science Center. “Part of the validation process is to show the courts that the i’s were dotted and t’s crossed.” A new NIST project called “federated testing” will make it easier for others to pitch in with their own test reports. It’s a free, downloadable disk image that contains all the tools needed to test certain types forensic software, and automatically generate a report. The first report from the project came in recently—from a public defender’s office in Missouri, an indication that digital forensics isn’t just the realm of law enforcement. I asked Fenger if the technical information being made public in these validation reports could help hackers or criminals circumvent them, but he said the validation data probably wouldn’t be of much value to a malicious hacker. “It’s more or less just the nuts and bolts of how things work,” Fenger said. “Most of the hackers out there are way beyond the level of these validations.” Share Tweet Comments Latest Video Ovarian Psycos: The L.A.

Twitter Facebook Email Most Popular Presented by J. Scott Applewhite / AP What Devin Nunes's Bombshell Does and Doesn't Say David A. Graham The House intelligence committee chair, a Trump ally, muddied waters and gave comfort to the White House, but he provided no evidence of wrongdoing or support for Trump’s “wiretap” claims. Updated on March 22 at 5:24 p.m. In a head-spinning development on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Representative Devin Nunes, the chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, revealed that … well, what Nunes revealed isn’t totally clear. Nunes held a brief press conference Wednesday afternoon saying that “on numerous occasions the Intelligence Community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition.” But Nunes’s vague statements raised a host of questions, and his decision to announce them publicly and then go to the White House to brief President Trump, having not informed Democrats on the committee about his new findings, cast a pall of politics over the proceedings. Continue Reading Alessandro Bianchi / Reuters A 130-Year-Old Fact About Dinosaurs Might Be Wrong Ed Yong New research on the creatures’ family tree could “shake dinosaur paleontology to its core.” When I first read Matthew Baron’s new dinosaur study, I actually gasped. For most of my life, I’ve believed that the dinosaurs fell into two major groups: the lizard-hipped saurischians, which included the meat-eating theropods like Tyrannosaurus and long-necked sauropodomorphs like BrontosaurusYes, Brontosaurus. It’s a thing again. ; and the bird-hipped ornithischians, which included horned species like Triceratops and armored ones like Stegosaurus. That’s how dinosaurs have been divided since 1887. It’s what I learned as a kid. It’s what all the textbooks and museums have always said. And according to Baron, a Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge, it’s wrong. By thoroughly comparing 74 early dinosaurs and their relatives, Baron has radically redrawn the two major branches of the dinosaur family tree. Defying 130 years of accepted dogma, he splits the saurischians apart, leaving the sauropods in one branch, and placing the theropods with the ornthischians on the other. Put it this way: This is like someone telling you that neither cats nor dogs are what you thought they were, and some of the animals you call “cats” are actually dogs. Continue Reading Jim Bourg / Reuters Schiff: 'There Is More Than Circumstantial Evidence Now' David A. Graham “There is evidence that … is very much worthy of investigation” of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, the Democratic vice chair of the House intelligence committee tells Meet the Press Daily. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said MSNBC Wednesday afternoon that there is evidence that is “not circumstantial” of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Schiff’s statement escalates the rhetoric on Capitol Hill about allegations of ties between Russia and the president’s circle. It follows two major developments. On Monday, FBI Director James Comey confirmed that his bureau is investigating collusion. Then, on Wednesday, Representative Devin Nunes, the chair of the House intelligence committee, made a puzzling announcement about so-called incidental collection of information from Trump team members. Nunes made that announcement without informing Schiff first. Continue Reading Carlos Barria / Reuters Can Trumpism Last Without Minority Voters? Ronald Brownstein The president wants to convert the GOP into a “worker’s party” for voters of all races. But it may be too late. Compared with the ongoing firestorm over Russia and impending showdown over health care, President Trump’s meeting with Congressional Black Caucus leaders Wednesday might seem peripheral to a presidency careening through constant turmoil. But the session, which aired but didn’t resolve differences about the federal budget and other domestic issues, captured a critical test of his political movement’s long-term viability. One of Trump’s most frequently expressed goals is reconstructing the GOP as a “worker’s party” that appeals to blue-collar Americans across racial lines. Key Trump supporters recognize that building an enduring coalition will depend on attracting more working-class black, Hispanic, and other minority voters to the agenda of economic nationalism that has riveted their white counterparts. Continue Reading Arnd Wiegmann / Reuters Maybe the Economy Isn't the Reason Why So Many American Men Aren't Working Alana Semuels Many experts have blamed a poor job market, but new research indicates that an overlooked cause may be poor health. CHARLOTTE, North Carolina—John LaRue is having a tough time of it these days. He used to move things for people, advertising his services on Craigslist. But work slowed up, and he became homeless and started sleeping in his truck, until, that is, someone stole it. Now, he told me, he’s fighting alcoholism and his health is deteriorating from living on the streets. I met LaRue at a Social Security office outside of Charlotte, where he was hiding his belongings in the bushes because he didn’t have anywhere to keep them and wasn’t allowed to bring them inside. “I feel like there’s a cloud over my head,” he told me. “It’s just been one thing after another.” LaRue is one among many. In 1957, 97 percent of men in America ages 25 to 54 were either working or looking for work. Today, only 89 percent are. Italy is the only OECD country with a lower labor-force participation rate for men in their prime years. Just why there are so many men who aren’t working is a matter of debate. In a 2016 report, President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers examined the declining labor-force participation rate and suggested that a drop-off in good jobs for low-skilled men was part of the explanation. Wages, the report theorized, are so low for many jobs that don’t require a college education that men don’t find it worth it to seek out bad jobs. A lack of job training and job-search assistance—when compared to other OECD countries—makes it more difficult for men to move into more lucrative fields. And a surge in incarceration has made it more difficult for men to find work when they leave prison, according to the report. Continue Reading Alkis Konstantinidis / Reuters Two Glimpses of a Grim Post-American Future David Frum New books point to gathering trouble in both Asia and Europe. As the United States under President Trump recedes from world leadership, things are not looking so good elsewhere on earth. Two new books—with similarly morbid titles—have arrived to warn of big trouble ahead for both the European Union and the emerging economies of Asia. The End of the Asian Century by Michael Auslin offers a point-by-point debunking of the “Asiaphoria” that gripped so many imaginations a decade ago. James Kirchick’s The End of Europe tours a continent in which democratic and liberal forces are losing ground to Russia-infatuated extremists of right and left. The conclusion left behind by a reading of the two together: The post-American world predicted by Fareed Zakaria a decade ago is shaping up as an exceedingly unstable and uncomfortable place. Continue Reading Arnd Wiegmann / Reuters Steve Bannon's Would-Be Coalition of Christian Traditionalists Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins and Brittany Pheiffer Noble From American evangelicals to Russian Orthodox, they're united against Islam. Is that enough to overcome all that divides them? “If we do not bind together as partners with others in other countries then this conflict is only going to metastasize,” said Steve Bannon in 2014. He was referring to a conflict he perceived between “Judeo-Christian values” and “Islamic fascism.” Speaking to a conference held at the Vatican, he seemed to call for Christian traditionalists of all stripes to join together in a coalition for the sake of waging a holy war against Islam. The rhetoric of a looming civilizational war has proved persistent. Recent years have seen religious leaders from both the American Christian community and the Russian Orthodox community coming together to bemoan the decline of traditional values. One example is the 2015 Moscow meeting between Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, and Franklin Graham, son of the evangelist Billy Graham. The Patriarch lamented to Graham how, after decades of inspiring underground believers in the Soviet Union with its defense of religious freedom, the West has abandoned the shared “common Christian moral values” that are the bedrock of a universal “Christian civilization.” Continue Reading Lucas Jackson / Reuters Trump's Credibility Crisis Arrives James Fallows Warnings that the president’s cavalier disregard for truth would have real-world consequences were vindicated on Tuesday. Donald Trump’s first two months in office have obviously been rocky. But the disruptions have mainly been internally generated—Trump’s tweets, the tensions and shakeups in his staff, his battles with the press, the investigations—rather than responses to genuine external emergencies. By historic standards, not much has really “happened” in the outside world since January 20. Sooner or later, something will happen, and Trump and his administration will have to respond. In mid-April of his first year in office, the new president John Kennedy had to deal with Bay of Pigs fiasco that he had authorized. In early April of his first year, the new president George W. Bush had to manage the repercussions of Chinese and U.S. military planes colliding midair off Chinese territory, and the U.S. plane being forced to a landing at a Chinese base. (Not to mention what happened in September of his first year.) Continue Reading Reuters What Happens If Uber Fails? Adrienne LaFrance Even if the ride-sharing service goes under, it won't necessarily set off a bubble-popping chain reaction. The thing about a market bubble is that you don’t really know how big it is until it pops. So it doesn’t pop, and doesn’t pop, and doesn’t pop, until one day it finally pops. And by then it’s too late. The dot-com collapse two decades ago erased $5 trillion in investments. Ever since, people in Silicon Valley have tried to guess exactly when the next tech bubble will burst, and whether the latest wave of investment in tech startups will lead to an economic crash. “A lot of people who are smarter than me have come to the conclusion that we’re in a bubble,” said Rita McGrath, a professor of management at Columbia Business School. “What we’re starting to see is the early signals.” Those signals include businesses closing or being acquired, venture capitalists making fewer investments, fewer companies going public, stocks that appear vastly overpriced, and startup valuations falling.

Liza Mundy Tech companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to improve conditions for female employees. Here’s why not much has changed—and what might actually work. One weekday morning in 2007, Bethanye Blount came into work early to interview a job applicant. A veteran software engineer then in her 30s, Blount held a senior position at the company that runs Second Life, the online virtual world. Good-natured and self-confident, she typically wore the kind of outfit—jeans, hoodie, sneakers—that signals coding gravitas. That day, she might even have been wearing what’s known as the “full-in start-up twin set”: a Second Life T-shirt paired with a Second Life hoodie. In short, everything about her indicated that she was a serious technical person. So she was taken aback when the job applicant barely gave her the time of day. He knew her job title. He knew she would play a key role in deciding whether he got hired. Yet every time Blount asked him a question about his skills or tried to steer the conversation to the scope of the job, he blew her off with a flippant comment. Afterward, Blount spoke to another top woman—a vice president—who said he’d treated her the same way.

It's possible that Microsoft is preparing to make a formal announcement about its release at a later date, but we'll have to wait and see. The original article follows below: Microsoft has quietly introduced a new tool designed to make it easier for Mac users to ditch their Apple devices, and switch to one of Microsoft's Surface machines instead, taking all of their files with them in the process. The enigmatic, all-knowing WalkingCat (@h0x0d) spotted the new Mac to Surface Assistant, but Microsoft does not appear to have made any kind of announcement regarding its availability. When you run the new migration tool on your Mac, it explains its purpose rather succinctly: "Use Mac to Surface Assistant to transfer information (documents, photos, movies and music) from this Mac to your Surface." Microsoft's Surface Studio all-in-one PC, which it launched last year, directly targeted Apple's core market of creative professionals, and won high praise from sites like 9to5Mac. Last December, Microsoft claimed that "more people are switching from Macs to Surface than ever before", so the company is evidently eager to support those buyers making the jump to its devices. After it announced its Surface Book 2-in-1 in October 2016, Microsoft launched a 'Mac to Surface Book' website, offering guides to help users considering the switch.

It's possible that Microsoft is preparing to make a formal announcement about its release at a later date, but we'll have to wait and see. The original article follows below: Microsoft has quietly introduced a new tool designed to make it easier for Mac users to ditch their Apple devices, and switch to one of Microsoft's Surface machines instead, taking all of their files with them in the process. The enigmatic, all-knowing WalkingCat (@h0x0d) spotted the new Mac to Surface Assistant, but Microsoft does not appear to have made any kind of announcement regarding its availability. When you run the new migration tool on your Mac, it explains its purpose rather succinctly: "Use Mac to Surface Assistant to transfer information (documents, photos, movies and music) from this Mac to your Surface." Microsoft's Surface Studio all-in-one PC, which it launched last year, directly targeted Apple's core market of creative professionals, and won high praise from sites like 9to5Mac. Last December, Microsoft claimed that "more people are switching from Macs to Surface than ever before", so the company is evidently eager to support those buyers making the jump to its devices. After it announced its Surface Book 2-in-1 in October 2016, Microsoft launched a 'Mac to Surface Book' website, offering guides to help users considering the switch.
