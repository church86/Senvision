Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Why Apple’s ‘Messages’ app won’t be coming to Android, now or ever Yoni Heisler @edibleapple June 3rd, 2017 at 3:02 PM Share Tweet With WWDC right around the corner, we’re just a few days away from Apple announcing a slew of compelling software and hardware updates. On the software front, Apple has done a solid job of keeping leaks to a minimum. Indeed, the number of WWDC rumors we’ve seen floating around this year is astoundingly small, especially in contrast to previous WWDC events when seemingly every new major hardware and software announcement was leaked ahead of time. Interestingly enough, there’s one fascinating rumor that emerged last year only to have since fallen off the radar completely. This past October, John Gruber dropped an interesting nugget of information on our heads, claiming that he heard from sources in the know at Apple that “mockups of iMessage for Android have circulated within the company, with varying UI styles ranging from looking like the iOS Messages app to pure Material Design.” Apple may very well be contemplating what a world with iMessage on Android would look like, but then again, Apple contemplates all sorts of things that never see the light of today. Gruber’s track record notwithstanding, there’s little reason to believe that Apple will ever release iMessage for Android. If anything, any and all of the arguments in favor of such a move are fundamentally unpersuasive for a variety of reasons. Don't Miss: How the iPhone 8 will look next to the iPhone 7, the Google Pixel and other top phones Where’s the money? Apple doesn’t venture into other ecosystems unless there’s serious money to be made, or barring that, a strong underlying strategic objective. When Apple released iTunes for Windows, the objective was to persuade tens of millions of PC users to purchase an iPod, a strategy that worked out brilliantly. More recently, Apple released Apple Music for Android, a move that directly yields Apple cash in the form of subscription revenue. Additionally, it provides Apple with a way to more fairly compete with Spotify. iMessage on Android, however, isn’t exactly a money making proposition. Sure, there are sticker packs to be bought thanks to Apple’s dedicated iMessage App Store, but how is that going to work exactly on Android? Apple is going to have an App Store within iMessage within its Android app? It’s nonsensical. iMessage is now a platform of its own, with dedicated iOS developers spending more and more time focusing on it, and now people are expecting Apple to just drop it on the Google Play store? Additionally, there’s no clear-cut advantage to Apple from releasing iMessage on Android. Is the money Apple making or expects to make from the iMessage platform so great that it warrants releasing iMessage on Android? For a company that makes as much money as Apple does from hardware, I’d wager that the answer is no. No one cares about iMessage iMessage is great, no doubt, but the idea that iMessage is such an amazing piece of software that it alone prevents iOS users from migrating over to Android has always seemed like B.S to me. Gruber cites the following excerpt from Lauren Goode over at The Verge. As someone who vacillates between iOS and Android fairly often, but who considers a lightly cracked iPhone 6S her daily driver, I’m also considering whether the Pixel phone is the next phone to buy. All of the software I use now is available on Android: all of my top email, calendar, music, fitness, photography, task-based, work collaboration, and social networking apps are there. But one app is not, and that’s iMessage. Perhaps that may be the case for the tech elite who routinely vacillate between various premium smartphones, but it seems like a point that most smartphone users in the real world could care less about. Funny enough, the ultimate benefit of iMessage, in my opinion, is that it enables users to text from their Mac. And yet, this is rarely if ever brought up as a reason to stick with the iPhone, as if its core texting functionality itself is the be all end all. Imagine a scenario where Apple released iMessage to Android, who would download it? Why would Android users care? Is there a killer iMessage app Android users need to get their hands on? It’s pure foolishness. Especially now when popular sticker and emoji packs are available on multiple smartphone platforms, it’s virtually impossible for Apple’s iMessage to stand out and lure Android users in. Furthermore, even if we assume that iMessage is this amazing piece of software that keeps many iPhone users from straying to Android, why would Apple, in that case, make it easier for said users to switch? If iMessage works “as a glue” for the iPhone, why would Apple bother with an Android version and risk margin-friendly hardware sales? Going one step further, why would Android users who can now enjoy iMessage on their current smartphone jump over to the iPhone? My prediction is this: if Apple ever releases iMessage for Android, no one will care. Users on Android barely care about Apple Music, but we expect iMessage to get them excited? What about Apple Pay on iMessage? The only viable theory that could potentially explain Apple’s interest in rolling out iMessage for Android is peer to peer payments via Apple Pay. In the months leading up to WWDC 2016, it was widely believed that Apple was going to roll out an iMessage feature that would enable users to make payments to other iOS users via Apple Pay. The feature was obviously never announced, but it now appears that Apple may make such an announcement at WWDC next week. That said, could this perhaps explain Apple’s seeming interest in rolling out iMessage for Android? It’s an intriguing argument, but there are too many questions that need answering. Presumably, any payment service built into iMessage will rely on iOS’ exceedingly secure Touch ID feature. What happens on the Android side of the equation? How will Android users authenticate payments? Will Apple trust the security mechanisms built into Android handsets? Will Apple be willing to entertain such questions when the payoff is seemingly small and the competition is fierce? Remember, there are already cross-platform payment apps that allow Android and iOS users to send money to and fro. Rolling out such a service in iMessage is smart because there’s an installed base of hundreds of millions of iOS devices out there. Rolling out such a service and then banking on Android users to download iMessage and then enter in their financial information just doesn’t seem realistic. Apple is prone to unleashing some surprises at WWDC, but iMessage coming to Android likely won’t be one of them.

Powered by cash-cow business models, mature information-technology names such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) offer income investors compelling mixes of historical cash distributions, current yield, and dividend growth potential. These two aren't the only appealing https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/05/the-2-best-dividend-stocks-in-the-semiconductor-in.aspx?&utm_campaign=article&utm_medium=feed&utm_source=LeeEnterprises" target="_blank">dividend opportunities in the sector, but let's see what makes them some of the more compelling dividend stocks in IT today. Apple The world's largest technology company has had a capital-return program only since 2012, but its potential for sustained dividend growth is perhaps the most impressive in its industry. The key to Apple's dividend potential lies in its high-margin products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Consider, for example, that research firm Strategy Analytics recently estimated that Apple captured 79.2% of the operating profit in the global smartphone industry in 2016. That means massive cash flows for the Mac maker, and it's part of the reason Apple has accumulated a mind-boggling $158 billion in net cash  as of its most recent quarterly report. Moreover, the launch of the highly anticipated iPhone 8 later this year is likely to trigger an upgrade cycle that should drive record earnings and further fill Apple's coffers. Potential moves into massive global markets, including healthcare,    augmented reality,  virtual reality,  and smart homes,  should serve as future catalysts to drive sustained growth for Apple. So while Apple's shares yield just 1.48% today, the company's winning business model, strong leadership, and globally recognizable brand should facilitate consistent dividend growth for investors well into the future. Image source: Getty Images. Cisco Systems Paying much more than Apple shares today, router giant Cisco Systems  stands well above the S&P 500's 1.9% current yield, with its 3.4% showing. Like the Mac maker, Cisco is in the early stages of its dividend history, but its initial progress has been impressive. Since initiating its cash distributions in 2011, Cisco has raised its annual dividends per share from a $0.24 starting point to $1.04 last year. That progress translates into a compound average growth rate of 28% per annum. The company already increased its quarterly dividend for 2017 by $0.03 per share to $0.29,  further extending the company's perfect streak of consecutive annual increases. Better still, all signs suggest that Cisco will be able to maintain its impressive dividend performance in future years. Cisco's payout ratio currently stands at 54% of net income, and it carries $35.5 billion in net cash on its balance sheet. Those stats alone suggest that Cisco can continue to increase its dividend payments for many years. Being at the heart of one of tech's largest trends should also drive Cisco's results higher in the years to come. Its routers make it a likely beneficiary of the continued rise of the Internet of Things, which the company has estimated should develop into a $19 trillion  market over the next 10 years. But even if that estimate proves to be too optimistic, Cisco has enough going for it that it should still be able to support sustainable dividend growth over the long term.   10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The event is an opportunity for developers to attend workshops with Apple engineers and hear about the latest updates to the software running on iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, Apple TVs and other devices. The event always opens with a keynote session on the first day, where Tim Cook and other senior executives from the company announce any major updates to the software platforms. Rumour has it that Apple may also be planning to unveil some new gadgets at this year's WWDC, so even if you aren't a software developer, it could be worth tuning in. Here's what we know so far about what Apple has in store. Read More Apple WWDC 2017 WWDC 2017 conference rumours When is WWDC 2017? Apple Siri smart speaker release date Latest news iOS 11 Apple is expected to unveil a new version of the software that runs on iPhones and iPads, called iOS 11. Details about the new software are scant, but the new operating system is likely to come pre-installed with Apple's video-editing app Clips, which was first unveiled in March. The app lets users add animations, Prisma-style filters and other effects to their video clips, and combine them with photos and music, without the need for complicated editing tools. Apple is also rumoured to be working on an iMessage app for Android, in an bid to challenge WhatsApp's dominance of the instant messaging market. (Photo: Apple) Other rumoured features include changes to Siri, to make it sound more human, a new "dark mode" for helping to reduce eye strain, and some iPad-specific updates, such as expanded support for the Apple Pencil.

Little is known about what the new version of macOS - thought to be called macOS 10.13 - will offer. One rumoured feature is a new file system called APFS, which was introduced to iOS devices in March. APFS is more efficient at optimising how storage is used by the operating system and apps, and also includes additional features like strong encryption. Read More Thirty-year old prototype Mac SE brought back to life by Apple 'geniuses' watchOS 4 Apple released a new version of watchOS last September, alongside the Apple Watch Series 2. Known as watchOS 3, the update included new apps, new watch faces, a new dock, new activity sharing, a new Breathe app, and a range of navigation and performance improvements. It is thought that WWDC could see Apple introduce more improvements, such as an app that tracks your sleep. However, it is unlikely to be another major update. tvOS 11 Apple is expected to introduce a new version of the streaming device that's capable of playing 4K content at some point this year. But the company could also use WWDC to show us how it aims to catch up with competitors like Roku and Amazon , which have been gaining market share at the expense of Apple's streaming box. Bloomberg reported earlier this year that Apple discarded a number of ideas before shipping the latest version of Apple TV, including previously-reported efforts to turn the streaming device into a full-blown replacement for traditional cable boxes. Apple also looked into shipping the current Apple TV with 4K capabilities, according to Bloomberg, but eventually decided against it because it wanted to preserve its profit margins - a decision that may have hurt the device's sales. Amazon's Fire TV, which retails for $60 less than Apple TV, does support 4K video playback. Read More iPhone 8 'could cost more than $1000' - making it Apple's most expensive handset yet Siri smart speaker Apple is rumoured to be working on a voice-activated smart speaker that will go head-to-head with Amazon Echo and Google Home . Based on Apple's own "intelligent personal assistant" Siri , the speaker will not only play music but act as a hub for the smart home, allowing users to control appliances, locks, lights and thermostats by issuing voice commands. One report from CNET also suggests it will have a built-in camera and facial recognition sensors, allowing it to automatically pull up a user's preferences, such as the music and lighting they like. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a track record of leaking accurate information on Apple products, there is an "over 50% chance" the new speaker will be unveiled at WWDC. Google Home (Photo: Reuters) Kuo added that the device will most likely start selling in the second half of 2017, in order to compete with the new Amazon Echo models expected to launch around that time. "We expect Apple's first home AI product will have excellent acoustics performance (one woofer + seven tweeters) and computing power (similar to iPhone 6/6S AP)," Kuo said in a research note obtained by MacRumors . Amazon Echo Look is the smart selfie camera that criticises your fashion choices "Therefore the product is likely to be positioned for: (i) the high-end market; (ii) better entertainment experience; and (iii) higher price than Amazon Echo." Another prolific Apple leaker, Sonny Dickson, said Apple's smart speaker will be similar in appearance to a Mac Pro, with a concave top, built-in controls, and speaker meshing covering the majority of its surface. The device will run a variation of iOS, according to Dickson, and feature technology from its Beats range of audio equipment. Beats already makes a portable speaker called the Beats Pill, which pairs with a smartphone, tablet or computer over Bluetooth and boasts 12-hour battery life. But with voice control being built into just about everything at the moment, it's no surprise Apple could be planning to up its game in the audio department. iPad Pro Although WWDC tends to focus on software, Ming-Chi Kuo claims there is a greater than 70% chance that Apple will introduce the long-rumoured 10.5-inch iPad Pro at the event. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro is rumoured to have a body that's similar in size to the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but with much narrower bezels, meaning the display takes up almost all of the screen. A new iPad Pro could also feature upgraded processors, improved cameras, and improved hardware and software features - perhaps including a second-generation Apple Pencil. MacBooks Finally, there have been some rumours that Apple could update its MacBook lines at WWDC. According to a report from Bloomberg , Apple is considering new models of the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro with new Kaby Lake processors, and is even considering reviving the MacBook Air.

It's also a chance for Apple to reveal some of the things it's been working on in the last year and what it's planning for the future. And, given how secretive Apple is the rest of the time; the conference is an important mark in the calendar for tech fans. Apple has confirmed that WWDC will run from June 5-9 in San Jose, California. When is the Apple keynote? Apple's WWDC 2017 will take place between June 5 and June 9. In previous years, Apple has held the event in San Francisco, However, this year, it will be held at the McEnery Convention Centre in San Jose, California. (Photo: Apple) The Apple boss will take to the stage on June 5th at 10am Pacific time - which translates to 6pm here in the UK.

Apple App Store on iphone (Photo: VHX) iPhone 8 hands-on video offers a glimpse of what Apple's next device could look like Because WWDC is a developer's conference, the announcements will focus on software rather than hardware. Apple is expected to unveil the next versions of its mobile and desktop operating systems. The former will likely be called iOS 11 while the latter is rumoured to be called macOS 10.13. Alongside this are possible improvements to the watchOS and tvOS that cover the Apple Watch and Apple TV products. We may get brand new OS versions or simple refinements and upgrades to the existing packages. The big rumour is that Apple will unveil an Amazon Echo-like smart speaker that uses the Siri voice assistant from the iPhone. Read More Is the Steve Jobs hype over?

The event is often all about software, but we’re hearing some rumblings that we could see some hardware news as well, perhaps in the form of a completely new product. Our best guess is the Siri speaker, which would serve as Apple’s Siri-driven smart home hub, a competitor to Google Home and Amazon Echo. Although we’ve heard rumors about a 10.5-inch iPad Pro as well. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 155.45 +2.27 +1.48% Herbalife Ltd HLF ▼ 73.92 -0.19 -0.26% Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA ▲ 124.13 +0.16 +0.13% TPG Telecom Ltd YST ▼ 3.67 -0.10 -2.58% While we’re short on substantiated rumors this year, we will be on the ground covering the event live starting at 10am PT/1pm ET on Monday (June 5). But for now, here’s what we know (or think we know), based on how certain we are: Highly likely iOS 11 iOS is rumored to receive a complete overhaul, but we doubt that’s going to happen. Instead, you should expect updates to Messages, new features in Photos, and enhanced stylus support. We’ve heard musings that apps like Mail and Safari could even use a stylus similar to Samsung’s S Pen for mobile annotations. This could be highly useful if Apple’s social network/chat app is a thing. Apple is rumored to be working on a social networking app similar to Snapchat or Instagram with an emphasis on sharing photos and video — with doodles, stickers, and the like — with friends. Adding a “dark mode” would be a big hit too. This is less a feature at this point, and more a setup for the upcoming OLED iPhone screen. Much like Apple Watch, the company could use dark mode as a way of conserving battery by not having to light all the pixels on the phone. Load Error Another rumor, which we can’t be sure about, is the rumored peer-to-peer payment system. If true, this would be Apple’s entry into a market dominated by Venmo and Square Cash, and could ultimately prove to be a huge boon to Apple Pay. An all-encompassing payment system on a mobile device is something we’ve been dreaming about for years, and this could actually be it. We can also expect some iPad Pro-specific updates. Of these, I think we’re most likely to see drag-and-drop support, better multi-tasking, and perhaps multi-user support. This is, after all, the future of computing — or so Apple says. macOS 10.13 The changes to macOS are expected to be incremental in nature, much like the past two updates. It seems we’re overdue for a game-changing new feature or perhaps a visual refresh, but it doesn’t seem as though WWDC 2017 is where it’ll happen. Instead, you can expect the usual polish feature updates and a coat of polish, although Mail seems to be the most likely native app to receive some sort of overhaul. Fingers crossed. tvOS 11 and watchOS 4 Not much going on in the rumor mill surrounding these two, although it seems likely Apple will announce it’s buried the hatchet with Amazon, and we’ll get Prime Video on AppleTV (finally). As for Watch, I’d expect additional usability upgrades to better make use of existing feature. Seems likely Apple Music Jimmy Lovine, in an interview with Bloomberg, hinted at an Apple Music refresh that emphasizes more video content. The timing seems to measure up. Two Apple original shows are scheduled to release this year: Carpool Karaoke (August 8) and Planet of the Apps, which we’ll possibly get a launch date for on Monday. Siri speaker Apple doesn’t have a horse in the smart speaker race dominated by Amazon and Google. Plan on Tim Cook remedying that by introducing a speaker powered by none other than Siri. It’s said to feature virtual surround sound for high quality audio in smaller spaces that might not be a logical fit for a 5.1 or 7.1 surround set up. It’ll also function as a hub for HomeKit, the smart home system Apple’s been touting since last year. 10.5-inch iPad Pro This one could just as easily have gone into the next category, a section where we’re hearing a lot of buzz, but not all that sure about the legitimacy of it. Given the reliability of Apple analyst Ming Chi Kuo, I’m inclined to add it into the “likely” category. According to Kuo, Apple has been working on a 10.5-inch iPad Pro that reportedly encompasses the same footprint of the 9.7-inch version due to its tiny bezels. Whether this model is a bridge between the existing two sizes, or intended to be a replacement for one (or both) remains to be seen. Still, though, WWDC isn’t typically when we hear about new iPads, so I certainly have my reservations here. Then again, the company did release an off-schedule iPad refresh to the standard model in March, so it’s hard to say. MacBook and/or MacBook Pro I thought we’d probably see updates to the MacBook (and Pro) this fall, but it could happen at WWDC instead. If so, expect something in line with a spec bump –perhaps to new Kaby Lake processors, and the option to upgrade to 32GB of RAM — rather than new MacBooks, It’s also possible we’ll see a mid-life spec bump, and a complete refresh next spring. Possibly? Mac Pro refresh This one is doubtful, but it’s not impossible to be a surprise move pulled off by Apple after admitting its mistake with the “trashcan” Mac Pro. I still think it’s more likely the company holds true to its word and we see this more toward the middle or end of 2018 though. MacBook Air The Air has sort of languished in a state that leads most to believe it’ll be discontinued. Some are actually larger than new MacBooks, which seems to suggest they’re no longer needed. Thing is, the MacBook Air is still selling surprisingly well, although that’s probably due to it being the only Apple laptop under $1,000. Rumors suggest it may get a spec bump to Kaby Lake and perhaps more RAM. We’d also love to see a switch to USB-C, but it doesn’t seem Apple is all that motivated to keep the Air around for the long haul, so it probably isn’t happening. But if we’re going to wish for new features, we’d be remiss if we forgot the paltry 1440×900 resolution the current Air is sporting. What is this, 2010? Probably not iPhone SE The timing lines up perfectly to release a new iPhone SE, but it’s probably not going to happen. This fall, at the iPhone event, Apple is rumored to be releasing three new iPhones, and you’d have to assume the SE would be one of them. Plus, it’s the 10th anniversary of the mobile device, so one would assume Apple would go big here and not want to cut into sales by releasing the SE a few months before its big event. iMac The iMac is also due for an update, but it seems increasingly unlikely you’re not going to see it at WWDC.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Currently the digital assistant integrates with apps from just six categories: ride sharing, messaging, photo search, payments, fitness and auto infotainment. The move will make Siri more competitive against other assistants, such as Amazon’s Alexa, which is capable of handling some 12,000 different tasks. Apple has taken criticism for lagging behind other tech giants in the AI space, and next week it looks to close the gap. In addition to announcing improved app support for Siri, Apple is also expected to unveil an Echo-like speaker featuring the assistant. Reports have said that it is cylinder in shape, like the latest Mac Pro, and it features a high-end sound system and a dedicated touch panel. Apple’s WWDC keynote begins on Monday, June 5 at 10am PDT. Be sure to join us as we cover the event, and all subsequent announcements, live.

Morris Jun 03, 2017 Bozoma Saint John, one of the most visible Apple executives not named Tim Cook or Jony Ive, will leave the company, according to a new report from business news website Axios. Saint John, head of Global Consumer Marketing for Apple Music, was one of Fortune’s 40 Under 40 last year after making a splash with a presentation showcasing Apple Music at its World Wide Developers Conference. She also spoke at Fortune's Most Powerful Women: Next Gen summit. Apple has not yet responded to a Fortune inquiry about the departure. Apple declined to comment on the original Axios report. Saint John’s departure would be a significant blow to Apple’s battle for mindshare among music services. Prior to moving to Apple, Saint John was a music-industry rainmaker who helped engineer Beyonce’s 2013 Super Bowl appearance and promotional deal with PepsiCo, at which Saint John served as head of music and entertainment marketing. After joining Apple as part of its 2014 acquisition of Beats, Saint John helped bring together Mary J. Blige and Empire star Taraji P. Henson for a widely discussed commercial series. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Apple Music made significant strides against competitors including Spotify and Pandora during Saint John's tenure at the company. In December 2016 Apple reported 20 million paying subscribers, a substantial increase from the 9 million it started the year with though still well behind Spotify. One marketing company claims Apple's total users went on to more than double this year thanks to a free trial promotion, though that analysis is disputed. The departure of Saint John, who was born in Ghana, would also have implications for Apple’s efforts toward diversity in staffing. Like the rest of the technology industry, Apple has received its fair share of scrutiny for the perception that it’s dominated by white men. (For example, of the 18 people listed and photographed on the Leadership page of Apple's website, 15 are men.) Though the company's overall racial inclusiveness is not too shabby compared to its peers, only 32% of all Apple employees were women as of mid-2016.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Foxconn insider drops avalanche of information about the iPhone 8, new MacBooks, Apple’s smart glasses and more Yoni Heisler BGR News June 3, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share In absolutely fascinating thread, a Foxconn insider took to the Apple subreddit earlier today and dished out a treasure trove of information regarding upcoming product launches and refreshes. And while skeptics might reasonably point out that anyone can proclaim to be an ‘insider’, this particular user verified his identity with moderators after supplying requisite evidence and supporting documentation. The entire thread is enthralling and provides us with a rare sneak peek at Apple’s relatively secretive supply chain. The thread is currently live and will continue to be updated until tomorrow morning. In the meantime, we’ve pored over hundreds of comments to glean some of the more interesting information available. Don't Miss: AT&T is basically giving away cable TV to wireless customers So without further ado, let’s dive right in. First up, we have Apple’s rumored smart glasses. Rumors regarding Apple’s interest in manufacturing a pair of smart glasses first surfaced late last year, with a purported launch date in the 2018-2019 time frame. According to our fearless leaker, Apple’s smart glasses may come in three colors — crystal, champagne and black — and will be available in varying sizes for both men and women. Based on the bill of materials, the Foxconn insider speculates that the product would probably cost somewhere in the $600 range, that is assuming that it actually gets released. Unfortunately, word is that Apple’s smart glasses initiative might be delayed, if not cancelled altogether. When asked about the likelihood Apple’s smart glasses might be cancelled, and why they are so unique, the leaker responded: 65%. Very unique design, if it can be done properly will be like what the iphone did 10 years ago. When asked a follow-up question about why Apple’s smart glasses would be revolutionary, the Foxconn leaker flatly stated it will deliver augmented reality to the masses. Up next, we have the iPhone 8, arguably the most anticipated iPhone model since Steve Jobs introduced the original 10 years ago. Not to fear, the Foxconn insider notes that all of the rumors and alleged leaks pointing to an iPhone 8 design with a fingerprint sensor on the back are nothing more than “misinformation.” That said, we can look forward to an iPhone 8 featuring Touch ID on the front of the device itself, albeit under the screen. 3GB of RAM, as previously rumored, was also confirmed. What’s more, the leaker adds that the iPhone 8 will come with support for Lightning as opposed to USB-C. Nonetheless, fast-charging will be an option. Aesthetically, the Foxconn leaker says the final design will look similar to this. The leaker later added that the final design will more or less look similar to the design featured in the middle below. Regarding the upcoming iPhone 7s, that device will reportedly not support wireless charging. Third, we have some Mac hardware to contend with. On the iMac front, it appears that Apple has some spec enhancements lined up for later this year with a “full hardware design” and smart keys feature being targeted for a 2018 release. As far as notebooks are concerned, Apple is prepping updates to the entirety of its notebook line, including the MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air, and the MacBook. Read More Regarding Apple’s rumored Siri-based speaker, it will reportedly house an A9 processor and will be about the same size as Apple’s trashcan Mac Pro design. Seemingly corroborating previous reports, the Foxconn leaker believes that while Apple may introduce the product next week at WWDC, it won’t likely launch until later in the year. As to whether or not the device will include a screen, the leaker notes that Apple tested three different designs, one of which did not have a screen. In other words, we’ll probably have to wait until Monday to know for certain. Clearly, Apple has some interesting products in the pipeline and we’ll keep you updated once the Foxconn insider returns and answers more questions.

But that hasn’t stopped the rumors. on Monday will hold its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Jose, Calif. While the show has historically focused on software, like Apple’s iOS and macOS operating systems, several recent rumors suggest hardware like new iPads and a new smart home hub may feature prominently on stage. But there’s more going on than just WWDC. Apple CEO Tim Cook has responded to this week’s decision by President Donald Trump to remove the U.S. from the Paris climate accord. And at long last, Apple has shared the premiere date for its upcoming Web series, Carpool Karaoke. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter Read on for this week’s biggest Apple headlines: Apple on Monday could unveil a new smart home hub that would let users control smart home devices like light bulbs, set reminders for events, and interact with music playlists. The device would be powered by Apple’s virtual personal assistant Siri and will come with high-quality (and loud) speakers, Bloomberg reported this week, citing sources. While Apple will reportedly unveil the device at the show, it likely won’t release the Siri-powered gadget until later this year. The smart home device could be announced alongside new iPad Pro models, including one with a 10.5-inch screen. Existing iPad Pro models have 9.7- and 12.9-inch screens. Apple could be to blame for the widespread Nintendo Switch shortage, according to a Wall Street Journal report this week. The Journal‘s sources said that suppliers of memory, liquid-crystal displays, and other components are filling Apple’s orders before Nintendo’s, forcing the video game company to wait for components for its popular Switch game console. Nintendo has said that Switch supply will remain low through the end of the year, and if supply chain sources are correct, Apple may be the reason. One of Qualcomm’s top engineers has left the company to join Apple. The iPhone maker, which is embroiled in an international dispute with Qualcomm, recently hired Esin Terzioglu to work in an undisclosed capacity at the company. Terzioglu previously led Qualcomm’s communications chip business. After President Trump announced this week that he would withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, Apple’s CEO reiterated his company’s commitment to the environment. He said that “climate change is real,” adding that he was “disappointed” by the president’s decision. Cook is said to have called the president at the White House earlier this week to lobby him to stay in the Paris Climate agreement. This is Fortune's weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news this week. To see last week's roundup, click here. One more thing…Apple’s long-awaited Carpool Karaoke series will debut on Aug. 8. The series will be available on Apple Music, which started as a music-streaming service, but also accommodates videos and streaming shows. Apple had reportedly planned to premiere the show in the spring, and, in April announced that it would be delayed until later in 2017.

In a letter to employees obtained by Mashable, Apple's top executive expressed his "disappointment" with the decision and said he tried, unsuccessfully, to talk the president out of it earlier in the week. SEE ALSO: 8 things Trump said about the Paris Climate Agreement that are total BS "I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement. But it wasn't enough," Cook wrote. Like other business leaders, Cook promised Apple would continue to invest in renewable energy and other initiatives aimed at reducing the environmental footprint of the electronics giant. Apple has previously pledged to clean up its supply chain and said it intends to stop mining rare earth metals — commitments Cook also reiterated in his letter.

Mac Rumors reports that four devices have been registered under iOS 10, suggesting that this could include the iPad Pro 2 and the 10.5-inch variant that are being expected. Of course, there are other pieces of evidence supporting these claims. Apple fans are pretty much confident right now that the two Pro variants mentioned above are making an appearance sometime soon, if not next week. There are little known details about each one, but leaks and murmurs provide a good picture of what we can expect on their reveal. 10.5-inch iPad Pro Will Not Be Bezel-less The 10.5-inch iPad Pro is just that – a tablet with the capacity of an iPad Pro with a 10.5-inch display. This is new in a sense that the others in the lineup have 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch screens. But it should not be too different inside except for the current-gen parts like the A10X processor that will also arrive in other variants. It will also likely adopt the True Tone display from its 9.7-inch sibling. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] According to Phone Arena, the bezels will be considerably slimmer, but not to the point of ditching them completely as we previously believed. And no, the 10.5-inch screen will not be crammed into the 9.7-inch iPad Pro’s chassis. The new variant is still expected to be bigger than its sibling, but not by a lot since the bezels will be reduced to accommodate the larger screen. The Inquisitr also previously reported that Apple might be thinking of embedding the fingerprint sensor on the screen so that the physical home button can be removed. However, reports now believe otherwise. The home button is likely staying with the Touch ID at the front of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro. The fan-made render below is pretty much what we expect to see once it has been officially revealed. 10.5-inch iPad Pro | Updated Render pic.twitter.com/5j4T614nO9 — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 23, 2017 iPad Pro 2 Refreshed With Slight Improvements The iPad Pro successor is long overdue but it looks like it is finally coming alongside the new iPad Pro variant in WWDC. Not much changes are expected to happen, but at the least, we can look forward to the A10X processor and the True Tone display like the 10.5-inch model. We may also see reduced bezel sizes to keep the facade of all iPad Pros uniform. The home button and Touch ID are also likely to remain on the same spot. What might be the biggest change to come to iPad Pro 2 are added Apple Pencil functionalities with an enhanced Pencil as well. Small adjustments like new stereo speakers and re-positioning the mic are also expected on both models. Two Other iPad Pros Expected As Well The two iPad Pros registered under iOS 10 are now accounted for, but what about the other two? As aforementioned, four devices have been spotted, which means there is a high possibility that four variants are going to be introduced in WWDC 2017. Looking at previous rumors, the other two models could be the iPad Pro Mini version, really just the iPad Mini reconfigured for the enterprise market, and a refreshed 9.7-inch iPad Pro, which is also now due. Likewise, they are not going to be modified heavily – just a couple of updates. [Image by Apple] However, four new tablets will make for a rather crowded lineup what with the 9.7-inch iPad 2017 unveiled in March. Although it is for the more casual users rather than professionals, does Apple really need four devices with almost the same capabilities in different screen sizes? What do you think? Do you believe there are more tablets other than the 10.5-inch iPad Pro and the iPad Pro 2? We’ll find out in WWDC 2017 on June 5-9 in San Jose, California.

April is National Oral Cancer Awareness Month. This cancer can affect anyone, regardless of whether or not they drink or use tobacco.

Dr. Dennis Simmons, owner of Brite Smiles Dental Care stated, "We want to make sure that the public is aware of the dangers of oral cancer. And we want to help them with early detection by offering the test at no charge. For the summer, we're offering Free Oral Cancer Screenings to patients who refer a family member or a friend to our office as a new patient. Their family member or friend will get a free Cancer Screening also! Give us a call for more details!" Dr. Dennis Simmons graduated from the University Of Minnesota School Of Dentistry in 1976, receiving the Class Honor in prosthetics – dentures partial and full.

Rating:  4.5 Typical Price:  £779.00 Pros:  Best battery life on the market; Gorgeously curved, premium-grade metal and glass design; water and dust proof; lightning-fast processing power; well-optimized and polished software package; superb camera and display; great audio quality Cons:  UI has some missing bits and gimmicks; fingerprint scanner placement not left-hand friendly; lacks higher-tier onboard storage (128GB) model; gorgeous curved glass design can be tricky to hold and may be fragile - a case is recommended, which sort of diminishes the aesthetics Verdict:  A really rather fantastic phone which sets the bar for 2017 very high indeed. It's super expensive, but it's packed with amazing technology and the overall package is highly rewarding to use. Best of all it has unbelievable battery stamina facebook twitter google+ Say what you want about Samsung, but the company sure knows how to design a good-looking phone. Last year’s Galaxy S7 EDGE was a fantastic looking beast. Ditto the Note 7 before that went south. Increasingly, it is Samsung – not Apple – that is leading the pack with respect to overall design and finish. Sure, Apple’s coming back this year with a rejigged design for its iPhone 8 – a design we’ve been waiting three years to see. But will it be enough to stop the double threat of Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8? Competition is stiff in the Android space at the moment. LG’s G6 has been making a lot of friends since it first launched, and things will almost certainly get more ferocious in the second half of the year with the release of new Pixel phones, Apple’s iPhones, a new OnePlus release and also updates from HTC and Android’s smaller, bit-part players. Latest Samsung Galaxy S8 deals: As of right now, though, the Galaxy S8 – and Galaxy S8 Plus – are the hottest handsets on the planet. The handsets that are designed to help Samsung retain its number one status as King of The Phone Market in 2017/18. According to a report from Korean publication The Investor, the Samsung Galaxy S8 range has sold five million units worldwide in less than a month. Officially, detailed figures are being kept under wraps, but the paper reports having spoken to a Samsung rep, who said "combined" sales are "going smoothly around the globe" and "are already beyond 5 million units". Combined of course meaning both the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+; previously reports indicated there was more or less a 50/50 split in terms of consumer interest in the different size models. New details from The Investor suggest that Samsung is selling Galaxy S8 units at twice the rate it did Galaxy S7 series devices for this time last year, at least according to the word of an unnamed Samsung official the publication spoke to. Essentially, from date of first sales the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S7 took 75 and 74 days respectively to hit the 10 million landmark sales figure; from the current pace of sales, the Samsung official says the Galaxy S8 should make that goal in half the time. I’ve just spent a little over two weeks with the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus now and we're ready to tell you just what it's like to get to grips with day-in, day-out. Hunker down with a cuppa, as this review’s a long one. So without further ado, let's crack on... Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Design & Build Good or bad smartphone visual design is, of course, subjective, and it’s fairly safe to say that anyone who’s been unimpressed by Samsung’s aesthetic to date is probably not going to be swayed by the Galaxy S8+. Likewise, fans of the firm’s prior devices will be just as happy with the latest edition as they were with what came before. The main thing is that the Galaxy S8 series has only become curvier and more streamlined than its already notably curved predecessors; the corners are completely smoothed and rounded, while the curvature of the edge display follows a continuous line from front to back where it meets a perfectly symmetrical rear panel, with only a thin sliver of bodywork separating the two. The top and bottom edges are also curved but it’s not as pronounced and doesn’t curve the display itself along these edges. Holding the phone it’s very apparent that you’re gripping what virtually amounts to a solid piece of curved glass - yes there’s a metal frame holding it together, but it’s barely noticeable. This actually presents the first stumbling block for the Galaxy S8+; in my time with the device I never felt entirely safe holding onto it; it’s slippery as anything and the edges are so wafer thin coupled with the curved slippery glass surface. Samsung allegedly tweaked the edge curvature to improve grip but I don’t really feel this has been successful and I’d strongly recommend some kind of case to improve grip more substantially and prevent drops. That particular gripe aside, the Galaxy S8+ feels incredibly solid in terms of its construction; there is zero wobble or flex in the frame or component panels, and it’s got a nice bit of heft to it without being heavy. You’ve also got the reassurance that it’s an IP-rated water resistant handset, so there’s no fear in taking it near the wet stuff. Aesthetically I rather enjoy the Galaxy S8+ design, it’s still got that quasi-industrial style that is so popular just lately with the punched speaker grille and emphasis on metal and glass, but the added curviness does lend it a certain unique presence that is very futuristic and elegant. Our review unit is the black coloured model, which Samsung has made entirely black; the glass, the metal surround, the fittings and furniture. Everything is black. This again gives it a very sci-fi, 2001: A Space Odyssey obelisk-like appearance. It’s a “stealth” phone, the kind of thing Batman might design. However, the shiny glossy glass does also show up fingerprints a fair bit, particularly on this black model. It won't stay pristine for very long. Of course you can get other colour options which are not quite so extreme and feature metallic trim that’s a bit more visible. Here the detail of the visual design is a bit more apparent. Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Display Samsung has been playing the long game as far as display technology is concerned. It started investing heavily in OLED while everyone else was saying it was too complicated or expensive, even though many could see it would outclass LCD if done properly. The firm also started developing flexible OLED way ahead of everyone else and is now starting to reap the benefits of that as a market leader. Rivals such as Apple are now looking to source flexible OLED from Samsung's factories. Samsung’s history with OLED hasn’t always been smooth, there have been some tough learning experiences - early on the firm’s screens came under flak for some instances of poor colour calibration and pixelation due to earlier PenTile technology. But it persevered, and is now the undisputed ruler of the OLED market, which also virtually puts it in position as the dominant force in the display market too - OLED is now widely recognised as superior to LCD, so much so that Apple and many others are jumping on the bandwagon. For anyone who has seen the Galaxy S7 EDGE or the Galaxy S6 EDGE in person, the display of the Galaxy S8+ will be familiar territory. It curves around the edges of the handset just like before, and it has an Always On function so that even when in sleep mode it’ll show the time, date, and some notifications while barely consuming any power at all. However, as the bodywork has expanded on this model, the display size and ratio has also increased. The display is now a 6.2in Super AMOLED - nearly as big as the Galaxy Note - but the screen pushes out to much more of the front fascia, indeed, the phone’s front is virtually all screen with an 84% screen-to-body ratio and an 18:9 aspect ratio. As the screen and aspect ratio has expanded, the resolution has increased accordingly to 1440 x 2960 WQHD+ (3K) at 529 pixels-per-inch (ppi). The image quality is what we’ve come to expect as typical for a Samsung flagship. In a word; superb. It’s incredibly sharp with no pixelation or blurring to be found. Text in particular is very crisp. It also features a full 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut, the very same one used on 4K TV sets and certified by the UHD Alliance for Mobile HDR Premium. In short, if content has been produced for 4K UHD Premium TVs, it’ll look as good on the Galaxy S8+. A new high saturation “Deep Red” OLED display technology Samsung has implemented here means the Native Colour gamut has a wider range too, well over 100% coverage for both DCI-P3 and sRGB. This, together with the excellent brightness levels (as much as 20% brighter than the Galaxy S7 and peak brightness over 1,000 nits) makes outdoor use in bright sunlight a breeze. All of the previous standout features from Samsung’s Galaxy S7 display have returned, including the excellent adaptive brightness and contrast, user-adjustable colour profiles, performance and power saving modes, and the acclaimed personalised auto brightness control feature. The customisable EDGE display features, which allow you to configure quick access shortcuts along the curved screen edges, has also been expanded. It’s quicker and easier to set up, and you can add applications, contacts, and a selection of smart editing tools, all on three customisable and swipe-able panels; it’s a bit like having a whole separate selection of homescreens hidden in the display edge. From using the phone I can certainly say the colour is rich and vibrant, in Samsung’s typical style. Contrast is also fantastic with inky deep blacks and viewing angles are insanely wide. The long and the short of it is this is a gorgeous display with fantastic visual quality and smooth touch input. I can’t really imagine anyone getting tired of ogling or prodding this screen after any length of time, and it’s highly tailorable to your needs as the viewer. You really can have it your way by tweaking the settings however you please. We should note that some users in Korea have complained that the Galaxy S8 has a red hue to the display and tweaking the display colour settings doesn’t seem to fix it. Samsung’s official response so far is to issue the following statement: “It is not a quality problem and it can be adjusted with the phone itself. If the color still appears to be reddish, customers can change it at the service center.” It’s our understanding that this isn’t a problem on every unit, but it is something we’ll be keeping an eye on and will update you with as more info emerges. Update: According to The Korea Herald, Samsung has now acknowledged the red-tint display problem and is working on a fix, the firm issued a statement as follows: "Because there are some complaints about the red-tinted screens, we decided to upgrade the software next week for all Galaxy S8 clients." Samsung also issued instructions to its Service Centres regarding the issue, saying, "There will be an additional update to make color revisions more minutely at the end of April" Samsung has released another statement on the subject of the red-tint OLED display issue while conducting a conference call. The company's statement was reported by Korean source The Investor. Samsung revealed it has undertaken inspections of Galaxy S8 units, presumably red-tinted screen models returned by early adopters in Korea. The firm said thatin light of these inspections it remains confident about the handset quality and its quality control for production. "Due to the nature of Super AMOLED displays, there can be natural differences in color. Users can optimize the color depending on their preferences." In other words, this is just part and parcel of the technology which, using an organic component in the Organic Light-Emitting Diode, seems to have some degree of unpredictability. Samsung further added that the software update it has promised will give the user greater control in calibrating and optimising their colour settings. Hopefully this means you can actively re-configure the screen to remove the red-tint rather than just mitigating it slightly to a lesser degree. As of April 27, Samsung has now begun rolling out the promised update to fix the red-tint screen issue. The update has starting landing in Samsung's home region of South Korea, where the problem was first noticed and where distribution of handsets first began. The firm previously said it would deliver the update before the end of the month, and it seems it is taking the issue and its promised quite seriously. Galaxy S8 owners will see the update prompt for version G950NKSU1AQDG, while Galaxy S8+ units will have version G955NKSU1AQDG. The update adds new features to the Adaptive Display mode menu which give the user finer control of colour calibration and tuning. The Screen mode menu also has a new EDGE colour balance setting as well. "Samsung has apparently promised to replace affected devices if their owners aren't satisfied with their colors after applying this update," reports GSMArena. "Unfortunately the full screen color balance adjustment only works in Adaptive Display mode, so if you want a calibrated setting and the red tint gone, it looks like you're out of luck - so you may want to take advantage of that 'free replacement' promise from Samsung." The update began rolling out in South Korea, but has now landed in Europe as of April 29. Handsets in the UK and Germany have now started receiving the software update, which is sized at  426MB. Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Battery Life Long battery life is pretty much the Holy Grail for many smartphone users these days. There are plenty of flagship-grade smartphones which offer relatively good battery life, and a few which offer excellent battery life. It’s not too rare now to find devices such as Samsung’s Galaxy Note series, the Huawei Mate 8 and 9, the bigger iPhone Plus models, and Google’s Pixel XL which will still see you sitting comfortably at somewhere around the 70%-76% range for the battery charge after watching a two hour movie on full brightness. This sort of usage tends to translate into being able to watch films pretty much for eight hours straight on a single charge. Likewise, you tend to end up with a phone that’ll last days, or even a good chunk of a week if largely left idling, ticking away between 7%-10% per day. But this will probably last a day and a half at most if you’re like most of us and are often giving it a poke for some reason or another throughout your typical day. You can bring that down further again if we’re talking a lot of intensive stuff like gaming. So where does the Galaxy S8+ and its 3,500mAh setup fit into this? Well for the two hour movie test using Mad Max: Fury Road, on full brightness, with the film downloaded to storage, and Wi-Fi and other connectivity switched off, it went from 100% charge to, get this, 86%. Yes you read that right, a two hour film on full brightness only cost 14% of the battery charge. This is madness. I kid you not I have never seen anything quite like this in my time of reviewing smartphones. I reckon upwards of 10 hours of movie playback is not at all unrealistic here. You can easily expect a couple of days of normal smartphone use on a single charge, in some cases perhaps three, and if you leave this phone alone save for a few calls or the occasional email, web browsing session or message, it will last you a good three or four days, possibly more. In short, the Galaxy S8+ has the best battery of any smartphone I have ever tested. It just keeps going. I've pretty much only had to charge it a couple of times since I got hold of it. Granted, I am sure you will still be able to burn through it in a day if you really push things, but let’s be real here, no smartphone will survive on a single charge if you insist on playing Super Mario Run or Star Wars Lego from dawn until dusk, only taking breaks to watch YouTube in between.  But for most standard users this is a dream come true. This is a phone you can rely on to be alive and kicking from when you leave the house in the morning right through to the next day, and you don't have to be too careful with it to achieve this, as long as you don't rinse it like crazy. At the very least this kind of battery usage makes it easier to plan around. I have not been caught short by the Galaxy S8+ leaving me high and dry unexpectedly as so many other phones are liable to do. Latest Samsung Galaxy S8 deals:   Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Camera The much-rumoured dual-lens camera for the Galaxy S8+ hasn't come to pass, sadly, which did leave me wondering how much attention the phone's imaging capabilities would receive. To be clear, however, Samsung camera hardware has impressed me for some time now; the last handful of flagships have always sported very capable cameras which, for me, had the perfect combination of "right stuff". What do I mean by this? Well for one thing Samsung stopped chasing the megapixel rating, instead opting to increase the pixel size, and crucially go for better apertures. It started off with wide f/2.0 but has gradually improved this to where we now stand with an f/1.7 aperture on a 12MP sensor - nice and open, letting in lots of light and detail. But this alone isn't enough to ensure good quality photography. Several iterations of Samsung's hardware have been plenty capable, but with the last generation it introduced what was, at the time, a unique feature; dual-pixel phase detection autofocus. The Samsung Galaxy S8+, like its predecessor, is still one of only a few handsets to use this technology, and it really makes a difference in terms of focusing speed and capture speed. This means the image is captured very quickly after focusing (also very quickly), so that the wide aperture doesn't let in too much light and cause blurring, overexposure, and other undesirable consequences. In other words, the Galaxy S8+ is fine tuned down to fractions of a second so that it's optimised to take a photo in the best way possible. Together with Samsung's wonderfully simple and user-friendly camera UI, this also means it's very easy to use by all comers, not just photography buffs - another pillar of what I'd consider the "right stuff" for a mass-marketed  flagship. It really is easy to just point, click, shoot, and capture amazing quality photos in next to no time. Naturally, there is also the now the required "Pro" mode for experts to fine tune things like exposure, ISO, focus, and white balance, amongst many other settings. So what's the result? Well as you can see the images speak for themselves. The colour is rich and vibrant in Samsung's typical style, but the detail, sharpness, and dynamic range are all fantastic. The handset particularly excels at close-in shots and there's no need to tweak the settings to Macro mode in order to achieve this; standard Auto mode will do it just fine with a quick tap-to-focus on the subject before hitting the shutter button. I'm pretty blown away by how crisp everything is. The Auto features also seem to be very intelligent in adjusting for different lighting conditions; plenty of snaps in less-than-ideal light, which on any other phone might come out a bit dull or far too over-exposed, seemed to adjust and get things just right to make a fantastic, crisp photo with excellent range and colours which pop. This also means the phone excels in low-light and night-time shooting. The sunset shots below show this in an outdoor scenario, but the photo of the wine bottles was taken indoors, in the evening, in a hallway with no windows; I was to all intents and purposes, in the dark while taking it. What's more, even with the flash on Auto, the phone didn't bother to use it, and it obviously knew it didn't need to - despite all this the photo looks like a perfectly normal daytime shot in a reasonably well-lit room. In truth, I am not sure I've seen a phone that handles low-light and night-time shooting this well before. It's much, much better than the Huawei Mate 9's dual-camera which I've been using on my holiday, and which was rather disappointing in low-light. The front camera - the first in the world to feature autofocus - is plenty capable too, and also excels at close-ups. Check out the lion statue below which was taken on the 8MP front snapper, which also features the same f/1.7 aperture as its rear-mounted sibling. Naturally things aren't quite as sharp as the main sensor, but they're still damn impressive and should offer you some of the most detailed selfies available. Maybe too detailed, as you won't be able to hide any blemishes quite so easily without heavy use of filters and post-processing! Overall I'm tremendously impressed with the Galaxy S8+ camera. I wasn't expecting big changes from Samsung with the dual-camera being axed, and in truth, it has not changed the setup extensively from its predecessor. However, what small tweaks that have been performed have been very careful and precise, and they've made a huge difference to the overall quality and shooting experience. Top marks here. Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Hardware Our review unit is the international SM-G955F Galaxy S8+ model, which is the edition powered by Samsung's 64-bit Exynos 9 8895 octa-core processor. This CPU features four 2.3GHz  Exynos M2 "Mongoose" cores and four 1.7GHz ARM Cortex-A53 cores, under ARMv8 microarchitecture on 10nm FinFET semiconductor fabrication. It also packs  a Mali-G71 MP20 GPU clocked at 546MHz and 4GB of LPDDR4X RAM. All of those fancy words and numbers boil down to the fact that it's equipped with one of the top three mobile processor designs in the world at time of launch. Some reports from the states suggest that the US model, running a 10nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, is getting slightly higher performance results. But after a certain point of high-end hardware and the extensive software optimisation we've seen in recent years, it seems to stop making much of a difference; at least as far as the end user experience is concerned. Indeed, this is the reason that Apple has stopped revealing much of what it does to its processors between new iPhone models - as long as it maintains the same high standards of software performance, consumers don't seem to care. Other OEMs appear to be catching on too. There were similar apparent disparities in performance between the Galaxy S7's various processor variants, again both Exynos and Snapdragon editions. However, extensive testing by various online experts and pundits ended up with a general consensus that there wasn't much in it. I suspect the same may turn out to be true here, though naturally I should temper this by recognizing it as an assumption, and pointing out the fact that I haven't had a go with a Snapdragon 835-based model; and probably won't have the opportunity to do so with it being a US-exclusive. All that said, the long and the short of it, which I must boil things down to, is this; does this phone's performance behave in a way I'd expect of a brand new Samsung flagship, in 2017, based on the latest processing hardware? Does it feel as fast and responsive as it should, as per what we've come to expect from the brand? And to these questions, the answer is yes.  Android 7.0 Nougat is overlaid with Samsung's newest UI and it's clear that an immense amount of effort has been made here to ensure the smoothest and most fluid experience possible. You won't find any snagging or stuttering at all, and app load speeds are incredibly quick, near-instantaneous; quicker for those which don't immediately ping for data from the internet. It is one of the fastest and most responsive handsets I've used for some time, in particular the touch input feels significantly more refined than most rivals. It doesn't balk at multitasking either, happily racking up app after app in the background, and the memory seems intelligent enough to keep switching smooth when restoring a hibernating app. One of the more intensive things you can ask of a phone is gaming. Let's face it, these days the flashiest games with the best graphics are generally shameless brand cash-ins and/or massive pay-to-win micro-transaction farms with very little substance. The fun and innovative titles tend to lean more to the simple, retro, artistic or even pixel-based graphics and aren't really that demanding anyway. But I digress. I tried out a handful of titles of varying levels of graphical intensity; CATS: Crash Arena Turbo Stars, Nonstop Chuck Norris, Ninja Arashi, and Dawn of Titans. Most of these ran like a charm with no hiccuping, and unlike older phones on less efficient CPUs there was very little heat on the back panel. However, I should point out that Dawn of Titans was the most graphically demanding title and the only one the phone struggled with, both in loading times and in some snagging during play. It wasn't clear whether this was an issue with the phone or possibly poor optimization on the part of the game developer, an all too common problem. So I got hold of a few more demanding games to test the theory; CoverFire and Gangstar Vegas ran much smoother but were not quite as heavy on the high-end textures, particles and post-processing effects. Warhammer 40,000: Space Wolf, Star Wars: Force Arena and N.O.V.A Legacy, on the other hand, were a bit more flashy and ran perfectly fine. N.O.V.A Legacy in particular was buttery smooth and just as impressive graphically as Dawn of Titans, which put my concerns about performance started by the latter to rest once and for all. As a final note, you can see from running Geekbench benchmarking tests the Galaxy S8+ outpaces a lot of the competition... Moving away from the CPU, the phone's audio via the speakers is quite impressive in quality and maintaining this at high volumes. I also found the off-centre positioning of the rear fingerprint scanner has finally brought me round to the back panel position which I'd previously hated. It is definitely a natural place for the forefinger to rest, though I should mention this is as a right-handed user; I doubt the same could be said for lefties as your finger must cross the camera lens and it's a bit of a stretch. The Type-C USB port is a welcome sight to make charging a bit less fussy, but the charging speed is also noteworthy as it's pretty damn quick. It also seemed to me that the dual-band Wi-Fi onboard was particularly robust in terms of connection quality. The handset also has full GPS connectivity, 4G LTE, NFC, and Bluetooth 5.0. For onboard storage 64GB is decent, but I can understand some power users wondering where the 128GB edition is considering the size of some apps and content these days - it's in China, matter of fact, along with 6GB of RAM. Expansion is welcome via microSD with support for up to 256GB, which is great for content that is supported this way on Android, but it's not a one-size-fits-all fix for people who'll find 64GB lacking. Update: We're now seeing news that Samsung will soon launch a new edition of the Samsung Galaxy S8+ in India - this is the 6GB RAM, 128GB storage variant already released as an exclusive in China and South Korea. Aside from the RAM and storage this is identical to the existing international model and still uses the Exynos processor. Until now, Samsung has consistently launched these larger storage and higher RAM capacity models only in South Korea and China, both for the Galaxy S7 series and the Galaxy Note 7, so this is the first time it's also been extended to India. While we'd like to think the 128GB Galaxy S8+ will make its way to Europe too. This is by no means a done deal, however, it is nice to see that Samsung is open to expanding the distribution, so it is a possibility, however remote. Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Software & UI As I outlined above, the performance here is great, this is an incredibly well optimised software package and runs about as well as stock Android Nougat does on the Pixel series. ---------------------------- Update: Samsung has begun issuing an urgent update over-the-air to Galaxy S8 series handsets. The update aims to fix a DQA issue (Device Quality Agent) which is affecting handsets in the US and Canada following the day-one software update. The issue means that users are constantly fending off pop-up warnings between a minute and 30 seconds apart which state "DQA keeps stopping". You can manually update via the Galaxy App Store too. Another update is now being rolled out as of May 25, this one to address the Bluetooth connectivity issues some users have been experiencing. The rollout has started in the UAE but it will expand to other regions in short order. "The update fixes a bug that caused the devices to reboot while controlling music playing through a wireless speaker," reports GSMArena. "In addition, the update also includes some SD card-related fixes, as well as the Android security patch for May." The above Bluetooth fix update is now rolling out in the UK; the 620MB file is available over-the-air to Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ handsets. In addition, the update kills a big which caused the Galaxy S8 to reboot when controlling music through a wireless speaker. Some changes have been made to microSD support and the May Security Patch is bundled-in too. ---------------------------- But it's not just the performance that impresses, I'll cover the other good stuff before getting on to my gripes and grumbles. A lot of the positive points are returning features; things like the Always-On display showing notifications, and the date and time even when the phone sleeps; and it really doesn't sap your battery life in a noticable way at all. Likewise, the multitasking is what we've come to expect from the most recent iterations of Android with very clear and smooth functionality, but Samsung's addition of split-screen applications also makes a welcome return and works brilliantly. As an aside, I rather like the fact that the screenshot capture has automatic sharing and editing features built-in to a pop-up. By default the Samsung UI has the traditional app drawer shortcut in the low bar switched off, which is kind of annoying, but it's easy enough to go into Settings and toggle it back on. It does, however, appear to be fixed in the lower right corner. The notifications drop down has all the best Android bells and whistles, whether in the homescreen or lock screen; that means full expandable notifications functionality, something still sorely missing from many other Android handsets and UI overlays. In the main homescreen mode it also has a full set of quick settings shortcuts with multiple swipable screens that are customisable. Because Samsung has added more and more functionality with every successive phone, the Galaxy S8's Settings menu is pretty vast, but this is undoubtedly one of the cleanest and tidiest Settings screens I've seen for some time with a white background, a sharp, thin font, and simple colour-coded icons with neat and succinct little summaries for each sub-menu. While many busy Settings screens, even some of Samsung's in the past, have made it very easy to get lost and confused, it's not really an issue here. On top of that, Samsung has added a bunch of prompts at the bottom of the menu screens where you can get help and guidance if you are struggling to find what you need. The Samsung UI is highly customisable via the use of themes, and Samsung has its own Theme store embedded inside Bixby, including static wallpapers alongside the animtated ones which move with your phone, like the default "Galaxy" one. However, at this stage some of the themes aren't optimised for the "Infinity Mode" of Samsung's new display, so they won't necessarily look their best. Right, now, let's talk about Bixby. Ahead of our review we had this notification from a Samsung spokesperson: "All Bixby functionality, bar Voice, will be available at launch. This includes Home, Reminder and Vision. Bixby Voice will be available in Korean and U.S English later this spring, and will expand to more languages globally over time." So in other words, here in the UK we don't have the Voice component of the Bixby assistant and we don't know when it will be added.  Bixby is continuously present and can be accessed either via the dedicated Bixby button or by swiping from the left of the homescreen. In its current state it's rather a lot like the old Samsung news feed but with an array of widgets and a few added extra bits for the reminders and calendar stuff. If you want voice control, however, you're going to have to resort to Google Assistant, which is already onboard and can be accessed via a long press of the Home key. Once set up it also works via the "OK Google," voice command. Bixby Vision is also usable, although it seems somewhat hit and miss. I tried getting the handset to recognise a couple of other phones I had lying around and it didn't really catch on. A copy of a Hellboy graphic novel did manage to get the phone to point me to several online shopping vendors where I could buy it, however. So far my only grumbles are as follows: The "EDGE" functionality is welcome, but does still feel a bit gimmicky. I like having the extra shortcuts overlay, but you don't really leverage the curvature of the screen to do this, it could just as easily come from another gesture swipe from the edge of a flat display. What's more, it only uses one side of the screen, the other one is dedicated to Bixby. Lastly on this subject, nothing is really displayed along the curved EDGE like the time or date or any of the app shortcuts. There doesn't appear to be that "bedside" functionality. Bixby, without voice, is kind of redundant. While this is undoubtedly the cleanest, most Android-y, and best optimised Samsung UI to date, there is still an element of Samsung stamping its stamp on things somewhat arbitrarily. I mean in the sense that so much of the UI is based around swishy fancy-pants gestures rather than straightforward control familiar to the average user. Even things like the default setup hiding the app drawer smacks of a Huawei-style move of reminding you you're on a brand device at the expense of making the UI as streamlined and accessible as possible, and this is something that plays out in a broader sense too. It's easily possible to whittle away these layers down to a much purer Android experience, so on the whole I like the Samsung UI, but to get there you have to know what you're doing, and not every buyer necessarily will, and may end up frustrated or not having the most optimised user experience for themselves. Samsung Galaxy S8+ Review: Verdict Having said the immediately above, those few bullet-pointed gripes at the end of the UI section are just about my only dislikes with the Galaxy S8+, and they are minor, somewhat nitpicky I'll readily admit, and oh so easily looked past in practice when using this phone on the daily. By now you may have gathered I'm rather fond of this phone. My overall impression is very positive. I liked using it, I found it easy and seamless, rather refreshing really. It feels thoughtful and clever, though one or two bits are still glaringly missing, we are promised they'll be patched in later. From a hardware perspective it's an absolute diamond. The camera is incredible and you really must try this, even if you've no intention of buying this phone I heartily encourage you to get down to a showroom and try the camera out if only to show you what's possible and what we should be expecting of future flagships as some kind of baseline. Meanwhile, on the display and processor front, Samsung continues to push boundaries and deliver excellent quality. And on the subject of design and build, well, it's a matter of taste but I think Samsung has gone from strength to strength and here has delivered something very refined indeed. The real icing on the cake, however, is that battery life. It's just phenomenal. This is easily the best phone on the market when it comes to battery life, so if you're looking for a handset that will go the distance - look no further.

Apple This 82-Year-Old Woman Is WWDC’s Oldest Attendee Leena Rao Jun 03, 2017 Retired banker Masako Wakamiya was frustrated by the lack of mobile games that catered to the elderly, who have a tougher time keeping up with the action-packed games that are popular with teens. So the 82-year-old from Japan started taking online tutorials to learn how to write software code. "I didn't see any apps for the elderly, so I decided to create my own," Wakamiya told Fortune. Wakamiya, who first started using computers when she was 60-years-old, ultimately created a game in March that is based on the Japanese doll festival, Hinamatsuri, a holiday that celebrates the health and well-being of girls. And to appeal to older players, its pace is slow and its narrator speaks slowly. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Wakamiya will be the oldest developer attending WWDC, Apple's annual developer conference that starts Monday in San Jose, Calif. Like many of her fellow attendees, Wakamiya's free app, called Hinadan, is available in Apple's App Store, and she is eager to create more. In contrast, the youngest attendee at this's year's WWDC is Yuma Soerianto, a 10-year old boy from Melbourne, Australia who started coding at age six by following online courses on Code.org and from Stanford University that he found on Apple iTunes U, which provides free college courses online. In four years, he has created four apps for Apple's App Store, including Weather Duck, a weather app for kids. During his nearly 20-hour journey to San Francisco for the conference, Soerianto created another app that lets users easily calculate the sales tax on what they're thinking of buying. Wakamiya and Soerianto are attending WWDC this year as part of an Apple scholarship program that gives hundreds of free tickets to developers worldwide who create apps for Apple devices. Apple has been making a big effort to increase diversity at WWDC, which like most tech conferences, has mostly attended by white and Asian males. This year's WWDC is the most international yet, according to Apple, and has the most students from elementary, middle and high schools. But the company declined to provide any numbers around the increase in international attendees or students. Still. Apple feels it's making progress. "I feel like we are really starting to making a change," Esther Hare, Apple's senior director of developer marketing at Apple, said in an interview with Fortune. The scholarships are also part of Apple's push to get younger people to use Apple products and services. In 2016, Apple released a new iOS app called Swift Playgrounds that teaches children and young adults how to create mobile apps using Apple's own developer language, Swift. A few weeks ago, Apple announced that it had created a course for learning Swift at six U.S. community colleges. For Apple, the benefit of attracting young engineers to develop iOS apps is similar to convincing them to use the latest iPhone and MacBook. The company wants to attract loyal developers who will create interesting apps for iOS and expand the technology giant's mobile app ecosystem. These developers can also be evangelists for Apple's services. It's already happening with 10-year-old Soerianto. In August 2016, he created his own YouTube channel called “Anyone Can Code," where he posts video tutorials about how to create iOS apps using Swift. "It used to be that you were cool if you had the latest and greatest thing, and now it's cool to actually be creating the greatest thing," said Hare. But it's not just youth that Apple is looking for. "We need developers from all different backgrounds," Hare added, which is why she's excited about Wakamiya's passion for creating apps. Although she only debuted her first app a few months ago, Wakamiya says she already has other ideas for mobile apps. And she hopes to learn more about how to write the code for it during the coming week at WWDC. "Technology has now become my new hobby, " Wakamiya said.

Problem Solving | 07 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (4) Colonel Mustard in the Library with the Shift Key by Adam C. Engst I love a good mystery… as long as it has a solution. The case of the Library’s changing modifier key had me stumped for a while, but thankfully, our buddy Rob Griffiths figured it out. Starting with OS X 10.7 Lion, Apple hid the home folder’s Library folder (~/Library) to prevent users from meddling in it and causing trouble (see “Dealing with Lion’s Hidden Library,” 20 July 2011). We’ll ignore for the moment the question of whether this was a good move. To access that folder, you had to hold down the Option key and choose Go > Library in the Finder. If you were sufficiently irritated by having to do this, as many of us were, there was a Terminal command you could run to reveal the ~/Library folder within Finder windows permanently. (Remember, there are multiple Library folders in macOS; ~/Library is the one in your home folder. Oddly, Apple leaves /Library and /System/Library visible, even though users should never mess around in them.) In OS X 10.11 El Capitan, Apple pulled back a bit on pretending that we users weren’t capable enough to work in ~/Library, adding a Show Library Folder checkbox in the View Options window for the home folder. That checkbox appears only when your home folder is displayed in the frontmost Finder window, and if you’re in column view, you might need to select a folder inside the home folder. When that checkbox is selected, ~/Library appears in Finder windows, but Library does not appear in the Go menu unless you hold the Option key down too. In macOS 10.12 Sierra, Apple made it so that checkbox adds Library to the Go menu too, and in 10.12.3, also added a keyboard shortcut — Command-Shift-L. However, Sierra is also where things started to get funky. For many people, including me, the old Option key trick stopped working in Sierra. That wasn’t a problem for me because I had permanently revealed my ~/Library folder long ago and seldom used the Finder’s Go menu. But I did notice that Option had stopped showing the Library menu item, and when Kirk McElhearn wrote a blog post about how the key had changed to Shift in one of Sierra’s minor updates, I was pleased to discover that, indeed, the Shift key now worked to show the Library folder in the Finder’s Go menu. I didn’t explore further because Kirk’s solution worked fine for me, and it solved Tonya’s confusion over the loss of the Option key trick as well. Thinking I was sharing a neat little trick, I mentioned it briefly in an email message to Take Control readers. Little did I realize the can of worms I was opening. Several people replied to say that Shift did not work for them, and Option still did. Lauri Reinhardt, who does support for Take Control, tested before passing those messages on to me. She found that, while the Shift key worked initially, after she toggled the Show Library Folder checkbox in the View Options window, Shift stopped adding Library to the Go menu, and Option started working again. Nothing she could do would make the Shift key work anymore. I confirmed that Shift still worked on both my iMac and my MacBook Air, toggled the checkbox on my iMac, and found exactly what Lauri had. A new test account showed that Option really was still the right key, but why had it been Shift for a while? Madness! I was stumped, so I tracked backward from Kirk’s post to Michael Tsai’s initial Twitter thread and then followed a link to a post by Rob Griffiths that explained the situation. Rob’s discovery was that relaunching the Finder (Control-Option-click its Dock icon and choose Relaunch) puts the Finder in a weird state where the Shift key takes over from the Option key. I was able to reproduce that as well. Doubly weird — this state persists across restarts! It’s a bug, and Rob reported it, so we hope Apple will fix it in a future macOS update. My suspicion is that this weird Finder state, which may date back to the Sierra betas, can be triggered in ways other than relaunching the Finder. Quitting or force-quitting the Finder from within Activity Monitor doesn’t seem to do it, but I can imagine other scenarios that might leave the Finder in an unusual state — a kernel panic, for instance, or a loss of power to the Mac. Over years of usage, it’s easy to see something like this happening to many people. Regardless, the practical upshot of this minor mystery is as follows: Sierra Power Users: If you’re running Sierra and you want ~/Library to be visible in Finder windows and in the Go menu, select your home folder, choose View > Show View Options, and select Show Library Folder. Regular Sierra Users: If you don’t mind getting to ~/Library via the Go menu in Sierra, open the Go menu and press the Option key to reveal the Library menu item. If the Option key doesn’t work, use the instructions in the previous bullet to show and then hide the Library, after which Option should work. OS X Users: Those using 10.7 Lion through 10.11 El Capitan should either use Option with the Finder’s Go menu or enter this Terminal command to make ~/Library show up in Finder windows permanently. chflags nohidden ~/Library/ Finally, why might you want to work in ~/Library? Lots of reasons, but in 2012, Ted Landau wrote an article for Mac Observer about the top six reasons to visit the Library folder. It’s old but remains essentially correct. Still, as Ted says, don’t mess around with files in ~/Library if you don’t know what you’re doing — you can cause real problems.

Nothing wrong with it that I can see. Reply steve12  2017-04-10 21:22 Don't forget about Command-Shift-Period. That's the finder's one size fits all show/hide hidden files toggle. For me it's easiest to keep the hidden out of site until I need something, then reveal them all do my thing, then hide them again. Reply Lester  2017-06-03 11:36 As far as I know, Command-Shift-Period works only for "Open" and "Save" dialog boxes, doesn't it? Years ago I found a script you can save as a Service to have this shortcut working in all Finder's windows. Reply  Search   Unless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2017 Adam C.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Huawei Competitions GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: Nintendo Switch OnePlus 5 iPhone 7 deals Galaxy S8 LG G6 iPhone 8 Home / News / Mobile App News / Report – Apple to make Siri play nice with more apps Report – Apple to make Siri play nice with more apps by Joe Roberts 03 June 2017 0 shares Read Comments After announcing last year that Siri was to be made compatible with third-party apps, Apple is reportedly set to expand that compatibility at WWDC 2017 next week. As Reuters reports, Apple will announce plans to make Siri work with a wider variety of apps, in an attempt to challenge the popularity of rival services such as Amazon's Alexa. Citing "engineers and artificial intelligence industry insiders," the report claims Apple will expand the categories of apps with with its virtual assistant will work, from the current six to an unknown number. Related: iPhone 8 The current six categories of apps are ride-hailing and sharing, messaging and calling, photo search, payments, fitness, and auto infotainment systems. It remains unclear how many new categories will be added, but Reuters claims Apple will look to retain some control by focusing on "a small amount of features," rather than adding a load of new categories. The report comes following rumours this week that the company will also announce new hardware to rival the likes of the Amazon Echo smart speaker and Google Home. Apple is rumoured to be working on a rival to the Amazon Echo Siri is expected to power the as-yet unconfirmed device, which according to reports has entered the manufacturing stage – though none of this has yet been confirmed by Apple. The firm's developer conference is set to get underway on Monday, so we're expecting to hear more about Siri's new functionality then – though at this point there's no guarantee of Reuters report's accuracy. Still, it would make sense for Apple to expand Siri's compatibility with third party services, especially if the company is looking to compete with Amazon and its popular Alexa assistant. Alexa can currently handle around 12,000 tasks – much more than Siri is currently capable of. The reason? Apple is said to be refining Siri's ability to respond to more conversational language before it opens up the assistant to more services. Whatever the case, it seems more and more companies will be focusing on developing their AI assistants in the coming year, so stay tuned for the latest, and check back Monday for all the developments from WWDC. Let us know what you think of the report in the comments. 0 shares Read Comments Seymour Cat June 4, 2017, 11:27 am Siri doesn't even control Apple's own apps properly. Years ago I could use Siri to navigate around audiobooks in Apple's own app. If I wanted to repeat the last 20 minutes, Siri could do it. Three years ago Apple broke this, and despite multiple new ios versions it remains broken to this day. If this is how Siri works with Apple's own product, think how rubbish it will be with 3rd party software.

Technology wants to help you get some rest By Paul Gilster Correspondent LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story I hope you sleep better than I do. It’s now 3:25 a.m. and, because lying in bed with insomnia makes a night interminable, I’m in my home office writing this column. Writing at this hour isn’t unusual for me because insomnia has dogged me my entire life. The irony about what I’m writing now is that my subject is how digital technology can help people sleep better. I didn’t choose the topic because of my own situation but because of the flurry in activity in this market sector, which turns out to be larger than I had realized. Did you know that industry forecasts for the size of the sleep-aids market reach as high as $80 billion by 2020? And this year, the annual tech blowout called the Consumer Electronics Show set aside an exhibition area just for sleep technology. Get this: They’re already calling the sector “Big Sleep.” To me, “The Big Sleep” is the title of a Raymond Chandler novel and the wonderful Humphrey Bogart film that grew out of it. In my current bleary-eyed state, the idea that tech can get me off to dreamland seems like an idle fancy. I did, however, pick up a Kobo Aura One e-reader in the hope that its adjustable light – screening out blue, working in red tones as the hour got later – would make a difference. If that had worked, I wouldn’t be writing at this hour. Can Beddit make a difference? Beddit makes a sleep monitor that connects to an iPhone. It’s in the form of a long strip of fabric that goes onto the mattress, positioned under the bottom sheet so that your heart rate can be picked up by it. Apple liked Beddit enough to buy the company, which implies to me that it will emerge as part of Apple’s broader play in the health care market. Beddit ($150) in now available in most Apple stores. If raw data can put you to sleep (sort of like counting sheep?), maybe Beddit has an edge. It will send enough information to your iPhone to give you a painstaking readout of your night’s activities. That would include sleep time (about an hour for me tonight), how long it took you to fall asleep (right away, but then a quick wake-up), the amount of deep vs. light sleep and numbers like “sleep efficiency.” But hey, I knew almost all that without a Beddit. So what do you do with all these data points? Technology has completely outrun utility in some areas, and this is surely one of them. Because users can take notes on the Beddit app, it can remind them that a yowling cat kept them awake between 11 and 12, something that was presumably obvious. Beddit’s graphs are slick, but do I really need to be told that I spent a lot of restless time in bed before getting up this morning? Or is it still night? My own recommendation, not that anything works for me, is Rain Rain. It’s a wonderful app that lets you select from a vast selection of white noise choices like ocean waves or trains. I’d also recommend keeping an eye on new mattresses. Casper is a young online company now negotiating with Target over how best to sell its mattresses, part of a wave of mattress startups with innovative ideas. At the top end, the Sleep Number 360 mattress provides a “smart bed” with biometric sleep tracking, foot warming and snoring detection. Did you know there is a National Sleep Foundation? I always assumed a conference with these guys would be a pretty quiet affair as they tried out all the new gadgets, but I notice they paired up with CES in the recent tech show. Maybe the sector really is getting ready to pop. We know that the tech world is, if nothing else, trendy and the entrance of Apple, the trendiest company of all, tells me that we’ll soon be quoting our “sleep efficiency” numbers to our envious friends. Brace yourself for a market onslaught. The people who buy all this stuff are probably not going to be insomniacs themselves, but early adopters afflicted with the big data bug. So does collecting all that data really induce sleep? “Big Sleep” may help us find out. Paul A. Gilster is the author of several books on technology.

Wait in the wings while all of the other companies fuck up while trying to innovate, and then, just when it seems almost too late, introduce a product that does the same thing as everybody else’s product, but better. This is bound to be true with the rumored Siri speaker. The idea is oddly exciting. It’s widely believed that, on Monday, Apple will reveal this so-called Siri speaker. The voice-controlled device is supposed to be a lot like the Amazon Echo or the Google Home, except, you know, it’s an Apple product. That means it will look great, work great, and cost a great sum of money. According to rumors, that also means that the gadget will lack some of the flashy features of seen in the current contenders on the market. The Siri speaker probably won’t have a touchscreen, like the new Amazon Echo Show. It probably won’t have a built-in wi-fi router, like the rumored Google Home hardware update. Your Move, Apple It feels like it’s 2001. Tons of companies had released tons of MP3 players, and they all sucked.…Read more That’s kind of the point, though. Apple is famous for releasing first generation products that do just enough, really well. Just think about the original iPod, which celebrates its sweet 16 this year. The market was flooded with problematic MP3 players by the time Steve Jobs announced Apple’s magical solution in October 2001. Jobs himself explained how companies small and large were trying and failing to build music players. Advertisement “They haven’t found the recipe,” Jobs said at that event, moments before revealing the iPod. “No one has really found the recipe yet for digital music.” Now get ready for the good shit. “And we think,” Jobs continued, “not only can we find the recipe, but we think the Apple brand is going to be fantastic, because people trust the Apple brand to get their great digital electronics from.” You can just imagine those exact same words coming out of Tim Cook’s mouth on Monday to describe Apple’s entry into the smart speaker market. Lots of companies, large and small, have tried to sell an internet-connected, voice-controlled speaker for the home. None of them are awesome. Amazon’s had the most success with Echo, largely because it was the first mega tech company to introduce a viable option. Echo gained steam as a smart home hub, too, because Amazon let virtually any company develop the capability to work with Alexa, Amazon’s half-decent, artificially intelligent assistant. And despite its relative dominance in the information space, Google’s smart speaker, blandly named “Home,” has struggled to take a bite out of Amazon’s market share. So here comes Apple. If the Cupertino kids do announce a new piece of hardware at the WWDC conference this year, it will almost certainly be some sort of smart speaker. People are calling it the “Siri speaker,” because such a device would use Siri’s computer brain power to respond to voice commands and questions. We can also expect an upgrade to Siri, perhaps a new version that can distinguish between different voices and maintain multiple user profiles. (Google Home already does this, and Amazon is expected to release the feature soon.) Otherwise, the Siri speaker will probably do the same things as the Home and the Echo—only, hopefully, better. After all, Apple is increasingly admitting that it’s a luxury brand. For a smart speaker, that would mean that the sound quality would far surpass the tin-can tones of an Echo. Some rumors claim that Apple actually wants to take on Sonos in offering high-quality wireless audio throughout the home with exceptional acoustics and the processing power of an iPhone 6. Meanwhile, we have to expect Apple to flex its dominance in the privacy and security spheres. As too many people clutch their pearls over the idea of an Echo recording all of their conversations, the market is definitely primed for a safe-seeming smart speaker. It will also—Jony Ive voice—be an extraordinarily beautiful object. A design porn shot from an iPad Pro promotional video (Image: YouTube) But this all begs the question: who’s going to buy this new Apple object? It’s not immediately obvious that people need a smart speaker in the same way that they needed a smartphone when Apple released the iPhone ten years ago. Then again, nobody needed a smartwatch when the Apple Watch came out and now it’s the number one product in the category. Is it because the Apple Watch is the very best wearable computer? Who knows. Do people trust the Apple brand to build great digital electronics? A lot of them do, yes. Even more powerful than that, however, is the fact that a lot people will buy a new gadget simply because Apple made it. Call them fanboys or girls or whatever you want, but Apple loyalists are fucking loyal. Advertisement Sponsored Steve Jobs programmed them to be. From the early Mac days, the late visionary excelled at convincing people that electronics were their friends. After all, way back in 1984, the original Macintosh computer gave its own robotic but revolutionary introduction speech. “I’d like to let Macintosh speak for itself,” Job said, and the computer did. The crowd went wild. We don’t know what will happen at WWDC 2017. If Apple does announce a smart speaker, maybe Tim Cook will invite Siri will make the announcement herself (itself?). There’s a good chance the device won’t be available until the fall, a move that would echo Google’s announcing the Home last spring for a fall release. Of course, Apple might also let us all down and announce some boring new iPad update or no new hardware at all. Advertisement But if Apple does decide to join the smart speaker circus, the company will almost certainly do it as Steve Jobs would’ve wanted. The gadget will be simple. It will be beautiful. It will work. It will sort of suck, but that’s why you have to stick around to buy the second generation—and the third and the fourth until infinity.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR Why Daqri has spread its bets with augmented reality technology Dean Takahashi@deantak June 3, 2017 8:02 AM Above: Daqri's smart helmet. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Brian Mullins, CEO of Daqri, has been obsessed with augmented reality technology for many years. And now AR has finally grown up. We could see that at Augmented World Expo this week in Santa Clara, Calif., where all the major tech companies — Google, Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft — and many others had augmented reality technology on display. The event drew more than 4,700 people, compared to 3,850 a year ago and just 200 about seven years ago. It also drew 212 companies, compared to 120 last year. Daqri showed its smart AR helmet for bikers, a heads-up display for cars, and its own pair of smart glasses for enterprises. I met with Mullins there to talk about how far the tech has come and how far it may have to go. We talked about the company’s smart helmet, its heads-up display for cars, and why it hired Seamus Blackley, co-creator of the Xbox, and acquired Blackley’s research lab to commercialize an interesting new 3D printing technology dubbed “software defined light.” Mullins is intrigued about what Apple might announce in AR and how the technology could fundamentally change how we interact with the real world. “We spent a lot of time talking about what it could do, showing what it could do. Now, okay, how do we get it in everyone’s hands? How do we scale it?” he said. Here’s an edited transcript of our interview. Above: Brian Mullins, CEO of augmented reality helmet maker Daqri. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi VB: You’ve watched the space develop for a long time and seen progress. How do you feel about the pace of change and how the tech is catching up with what everybody wants? Mullins: It’s the seventh year I’ve come to the show. To see it grow up from a couple hundred people to today — all the main players, not just in AR, but in technology are represented. The discussion is going beyond “What could it do?” and “When will it be valuable?” to “We’ve proven that this helps workers learn faster, retain more, reduce costs. We can demonstrate the ROI. How are we going to deploy it at scale? How do we connect it to the IT organization?” Everything from device management software to creative workflows with products like CAD systems…how are these customers going to buy thousands of units? How do we fulfill that? All the questions an industry needs to address in order to turn the corner and ramp and address demand. That’s the phase AR is in right now. We spent a lot of time talking about what it could do, showing what it could do. Now, okay, how do we get it in everyone’s hands? How do we scale it? Some of that is — we can’t expect enterprise customers to look at AR and say, “I’ll adapt my business to this.” We have to adapt the way we sell AR and make products to those enterprises, to what they need to deploy for their workforces. It’s an exciting shift to see the conversations change, to see the players here. Our partnership with Dell — that’ll open us up to a large channel of people who have historically been interested in AR and now have a way to buy it and roll it out. VB: How did you approach separating out what’s cool about AR and what actually helps people solve a problem? Mullins: When you have something that’s cool and could solve a lot of problems, you run the risk of making something that excites people but doesn’t really have a use. There’s a lot to learn there about focusing on a minimum viable product or minimum viable platform that could create AR products that pay for themselves, that meet ROI needs and can be used for other things as well. It turns out that the advantage is it works well to help people learn things. You can learn faster than with any other form of training. This is proven in independent studies. Just having it isn’t enough. You have to wrap it in a solution. You have to connect it with things like 360 from Autodesk or Teamcenter from Siemens, so these content workflows that our customers have invested in are available in the AR right away. We’ve been able to make those connections and deliver a product that can create the ROI today. It’s like looking at the screen on an early iPhone. Today you look at an iPhone and think, “That’s what a smartphone should be.” But if Apple waited to make that, it would have been a waste. You could make the industry out of the first iPhone and let it grow up. That’s where AR is today. Some people think they have to wait until the end state, but it’s ready today to solve problems and create value. Let’s get it in customers’ hands and iterate on future versions and continue to evolve the product. Above: Daqri is creating augmented reality headsets and helmets. Image Credit: Daqri VB: We had a panel of AR creators at our GamesBeat summit talking about all the different futures they foresee. What do you see in the future around things like displays? John Underkoffler’s company is making use of very big displays. Some people say that displays will go away entirely with good enough images on a pair of glasses. Mullins: Certain types of displays you don’t need, but experiences will change to support it. Mimicking a display in AR will probably never be as good as a physical display. However, the benefit of it being virtualized could outweigh that, and the perceptible differences can be smoothed out. The question is, if I can have anything I want in real space, would I want it to look like a display, or do I change it completely into something more intuitive? Do I have a screen with an email icon and a little notification on it, or do I have a 3D model of a piece of mail sitting in front of me? I can physically intuit certain things by seeing a 3D model. We won’t necessarily virtualize every screen, but it’ll affect where we need them. You’ll see new types of display technologies that are embedded. You’ll be able to interact with them seamlessly. You won’t always have a pair of AR glasses on. You get in the car and take them off, the car picks up. When I go home and settle in my living room, maybe there’s a different type of retinal projector installed there that makes it so I don’t need glasses or a physical screen to have an AR experience. That’s down the road, but it’s important to think about those modalities if you’re talking about a post-screen world. VB: Intel was talking about how we’ll have a passenger economy arrive once we have self-driving cars. It’s another opportunity for displays. Mullins: Absolutely. For a pretty good percentage of the population, when you look down at a screen while you’re in a car you get sick. One of the only ways to remove that sensation is to use AR in the car, so the screens are there but the content registers to the real world. Your sense of balance can interact with this content out there and not cause motion sickness. That’s where AR is going to bridge the gap in situations like that. You look at the HUD in a car today, the opportunity of putting content on windscreens or side windows, and then you think about when this car drives itself. The average American commuter spends 43 minutes on the road every day. That’s a valuable amount of time to interact with technology. Above: Daqri’s helmet Image Credit: Daqri VB: If you’re not driving, maybe you want to spend even longer in the car. Mullins: Maybe. If you’re getting work done or enjoying interactive time, maybe you don’t have to think about living 20 minutes from the office. Maybe it opens up new places to live. If the freeways are less crowded because the cars are better at balancing the traffic, maybe we redesign how we build certain cities. VB: What do you think of where everyone else is in the AR industry, how much progress is being made? Mullins: We’re excited about our smart product line: the smart helmet for industrial field workers and the smart glasses for enterprise workers and the smart HUD in cars. It’s opening up to a larger market. The show floor isn’t open yet, but it’s always a great side-by-side to see all the devices and try them on. We’re learning a lot. The industry is learning a lot — what you need, what the important specs are. It’s about experience. Translating from old displays and other methodologies hasn’t always worked right. Everyone is driving toward a more vertical field of view, but the real question is, what’s the field of view that’s not distorted? The distortion creeps up very quickly in different types of displays. If you have that, it’s not useful. Just having wider fields of view isn’t necessarily the goal. You need to focus on distortion and contrast and visibility in sunlight so you can use it anywhere. We’re starting to adopt ways of talking about things and designing products to make sure they’re valuable to customers. But there’s a long way to go. VB: Do you hope Apple can impact the industry in a good way? Mullins: I’m hoping all the major mobile platforms will have a positive impact. We play in an enterprise space. We don’t think AR is one size fits all. A lot of the environments and customer needs are always going to require specialization to address them. It’s a long time before you see a mass adoption of a consumer product at a price point that does what people need it to do. But you look beyond that — at what point is it also so good that you can take it to work? You’re talking about a 10-year proposition there, much like the way mobile phones grew up. They started as briefcases and bricks. They went into your car, and your car phone was amortized over the life of the vehicle. Ultimately, that built an infrastructure and people started to get personal phones. Then we had the smartphone and now everybody’s got one, but it took decades. It felt like overnight everybody had a smartphone, but no. It’s not going away overnight either. It won’t be replaced right away by a pair of glasses. The promises being made by some companies going after the consumer space won’t be realized at the price points. If you look at the VR industry, they’re setting a very high bar for content. That’s good for the industry in general, but it makes it a moving target to some extent. As you start to see triple-A game titles roll out in VR — one or two this year, and more next year — that’s going to drive more adoption. VR will become more comfortable and consumers will have expectations of it. That’ll inform what consumer AR becomes. You’ll finally get to the devices consumers need over the next three to five years. Then you have to drive adoption on top of that. It’s exciting, but it’s a long road ahead. Above: Daqri is also working on augmented reality heads-up displays for cars. Image Credit: Daqri VB: Are you interested in some of the talks coming up here? The Vuforia guys had something interesting on Project Chalk, annotating things in AR. Mullins: With AR and computer vision, a lot of these things are going to start to become native. You asked me about what Apple will do for AR. It’ll build in computer vision and additional sensors directly into the hardware. To access AR, it’ll be natively in the Apple tools. It’ll be done partially in hardware, so it’ll be better than third-party software running on an iPhone. That’ll change the developer ecosystem quite a bit. You won’t necessarily need to go through a tool like Unity and export through an AR library to iOS or Android or another platform. You’ll go Unity directly to native, whether it’s Tango or something in iOS. It doesn’t necessarily impact on the enterprise the same way, but you’ll start to see where those capabilities are done better in hardware than in software. Then developers won’t necessarily have to use third-party tools to wrap them up. VB: In your long-term, then, you might focus on making sure you can do cool software applications, as opposed to being a hardware company? Mullins: From our perspective, making the helmets and glasses and automotive components — we’re in a different customer base, but we have the same technology road map as someone like an Apple for cell phones, and perhaps someday wearable devices. We’re doing that today, where our computer vision and mapping are all at the hardware level too. You don’t need any third-party wrappers to work on a Daqri platform. That’s important. VB: If the hardware gets produced at some point by all the big companies, though, and they provide a base platform, do you design your products for that platform instead of designing separate pieces of hardware? Mullins: If you look at our automotive customers today, they make the car. They license the technology for the HUD in it. That’s something Daqri does, providing the flexibility to work with customers to get technology in their products. There will be a lot of uses of AR outside of mobile phones and outside of just consumer wearable devices that we see facilitating for people integrating AR into other applications. VB: So the smartphone isn’t the one and only thing that exists in this future. I suppose if you have AR, at some point the smartphone doesn’t need to exist. Mullins: That’s a real question. When you look at historically — Apple enters a space when it’s established. They’ll do what they do. Others will try to get in, but whether a cell phone company can adapt to become an AR company — you saw a lot of players that were established in tech that didn’t necessarily make the leap to mobile. They missed it. The landscape is very different. There will be a lot of uses in enterprise, and a lot of established tech players that make devices — whether it’s phones or computers today — will try to get into the space. But they’ll face the same transition hurdles they faced with getting into smartphones. Some of them did a great job of it and others ended up leaving the space.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Stocks That Feel Like Microsoft in 1986 These three promising businesses could be poised to offer life-changing gains for investors. Steve Symington, Sean Williams, and Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSymington) Jun 3, 2017 at 11:00AM There are few stocks that have created fortunes as staggering as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Had you bought just 50 shares of the computer software and console gaming giant shortly after its IPO in 1986 -- let's say at $28 per share (keep in mind the stock has split nine times since then) -- you'd have over $1 million today, even without reinvesting dividends. If you had opted to use your dividends to buy more shares along the way, you'd have over $1.5 million sitting in the bank. Of course, this raises the question -- are there any stocks on the market today that feel like Microsoft in 1986? We asked three top Motley Fool contributors to weigh in to that end. Read on to learn why they think Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), and Intercept Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ICPT) fit the bill. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. A revolutionary display and lighting technology Steve Symington (Universal Display): There's little doubt that Universal Display's flagship phosphorescent organic light emitting diode (OLED) technology is the next big thing in the display market. OLED displays not only boast incredible brightness and contrast, but also are impossibly thin, energy efficient, cool to the touch, and can even be made flexible and semi-transparent. By licensing its massive OLED-centric patent portfolio and selling its proprietary emitter materials to original electronics manufacturers, Universal Display is poised to benefit as OLED adoption grows. At the same time, OLEDs are already being used in tens of millions of smartphones and tablets from many of the world's leading electronics manufacturers. Most notably, Samsung Display has long stood alone as Universal Display's single largest customer. If supply chain rumblings and industry watchers are any indication, however, Apple should be poised to introduce its first OLED iPhone later this year in celebration of the 10-year anniversary of its most popular product line. This would mark a coup, of sorts, as Apple moves away from LCDs and expands its use of OLED from "just" the tiny displays in its less impactful Apple Watch. What's more, LG Display, which is Universal Display's second-largest customer, is in the process of ramping up manufacturing capacity for its high-end OLED televisions, announcing earlier this year that it will invest an additional $4.3 billion into both its OLED production facilities and OLED research and development. Over the longer term, we should also see an increase in novel OLED lighting solutions from manufacturers that are currently in their early stages of development, including LG, Konica Minolta, Acuity, and Philips. Here again, OLED lights are cool to the touch and offer even, beautiful light, as opposed to the spot light sources provided with today's typical LED lighting products. Finally, keep in mind that Universal Display only recently initiated its first dividend at $0.03 per share. That won't amount to much with Universal Display stock sitting above $117 per share, as of this writing. But management has made it clear they view this as "a good place to start," and will increase their payout as the OLED industry continues to progress. For investors willing to buy now and watch that happen in the coming years, I think Universal Display could still be poised for incredible, "Microsoft-like" returns. Video games are big business Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Activision Blizzard): Leave aside the fact that it's already a $43 billion company, and you'll be free to notice a few tantalizing similarities between Activision Blizzard today and a young Microsoft. After all, the video game developer enjoys a leading position in a growth industry with massive profit potential over the long term. For an idea of that dominance, consider that its portfolio of franchises, including Call of Duty, Hearthstone, and Overwatch, helped the company attract record player engagement in the past year as gamers dedicated 40 billion hours to interacting with its products. Even though it has been public for years, Activision Blizzard's business in many ways is only getting started. Its acquisition of King Digital Entertainment just added over 300 million active users that the company is now learning how to market to through in-game advertising and micro transactions. Meanwhile, the stampede towards digital purchasing and downloading of big-budget games is raising profit margins, as in the fact that video games are becoming year-round properties rather than launch-driven, short-term events. In other words, Activision's content is growing far more valuable thanks to fundamental shifts in its industry. Like Microsoft in those early days, the developer is staring at a few large opportunities right now, all of which could significantly boost its addressable market. These include eSports, consumer products, and mobile advertising, in addition to whatever new video game franchises Activision has in its pipeline for the coming years. This biotech stock has all the hallmarks of Microsoft's dominance, within its niche indication  Sean Williams (Intercept Pharmaceuticals): Few people knew when Microsoft went public in 1986 that it would become a dominant force in computer operating systems, and finding the next Microsoft is no easy task. However, if you'll humor me and allow me to cross sectors, I do see some similarities between Microsoft in 1986 and Intercept Pharmaceuticals today. Microsoft's operating system holds dominant market share, and there are very few alternative options for desktop and laptop users. The same may soon be said for Intercept's drug Ocaliva, which is currently approved to treat primary biliary cholangitis, but is more importantly being studied as a treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH, also known as fatty-liver disease, has no cure or Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies, yet it impacts between 2% and 5% of the adult U.S. population. By the next decade, it'll be the leading cause of liver transplants. The first drug that can fight NASH, and potentially even reduce liver fibrosis, could become the go-to therapy, just as Windows is the go-to operating system. The intriguing data on Ocaliva comes from the FLINT 2b study, which was reported all the way back in 2014. Data from FLINT showed a two-point-or-greater reduction in the NAFLD Activity score in 46% of patients taking Ocaliva, compared to just 21% of patients taking the placebo. What was exceptionally encouraging was the 35% mean score benefit in liver fibrosis, which was almost double that of the placebo at 19%. Currently, Ocaliva is moving onto its pivotal phase 3 REGENERATE trial.  Like Microsoft, Intercept isn't the only fish in the pond. Genfit has a competing NASH drug known as elafibranor in the phase 3 RESOLVE-IT trial. There's a clear advantage to being the first-in-class NASH drug on pharmacy shelves, so the race is clearly on.  What sort of sales are we talking about here? If Ocaliva demonstrates both NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement (the REGENERATE trial only requires one or the other be met for the primary endpoint to be a success) and is approved by the FDA ahead of Genfit's drug, Ocaliva has peak annual sales potential that could approach $9 billion per year. Given that drugmakers are usually valued at many multiples of their lead drug, Intercept's stock could soar, much like Microsoft did.  Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Six years ago, it was the first major tech company with a voice assistant. Now Amazon's Echo and Google's Home smart speakers are finally making the assistants mainstream, while Apple's Siri flounders. Next week at WWDC, Apple may try to get back in the game by announcing a Siri smart speaker. CEO Tim Cook and other Apple executives will show previews of the next iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV operating systems during a Monday keynote address in San Jose, California. There are also rumors the company will announce a new smart speaker and updates to its Mac and iPad lines. WWDC stands for World Wide Developer Conference, though some Apple fans insist on calling it "dub dub." The annual three day event is an opportunity for software developers to come and learn more about making apps for Apple products. Here's a taste of what we can expect on Monday. Updates for iOS and macOS This is when Apple traditionally gives everyone a sneak peak at the next operating systems for iPads, iPhones and Macs. It gives developers time to make programs before fall's big iPhone releases. This is the iPhone's 10 year anniversary. In addition to releasing a special iPhone update later this year, a bigger than usual iOS update would also make sense. Beyond a visual overhaul, Apple could include updates to Apple Music and some core apps like Maps. Last year it tried to make Messages young and hip. The Snapchat-ification of iOS could continue, with more sharing features. Look for some iPad Pro specific updates, like expanded Apple stylus powers that would allow doodling and annotating in more apps. Rumors are thin for the recently renamed macOS, but fixing iTunes would be a real crowd pleaser. Siri came to the Mac last year. Apple could add more features and third-party integrations to the voice assistant, possibly part of a larger Siri overhaul. New crossover features could make it easier to bounce back between iOS and macOS, similar to what Microsoft and Google are doing with their own operating systems. Apple's own Siri smart speaker The biggest buzz this year is for an all new type of hardware, the first since the Apple Watch. A Siri smart speaker could be announced on Monday, though likely not available until later in the year. Like Amazon's Echo and Google's Home, an Apple speaker would use always-listening technology to make Siri omnipresent in the home. Apple has been stingy about opening Siri up to third-party developers, and the assistant has suffered because of it. At the very least, Apple does excel at beautiful design. The company could turn out something more striking than Amazon's utilitarian black tube or Google's air freshener. A bigger iPad Pro Apple is rumored to be working on a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, with a screen that inches even closer to the edges of the device. It's a minor bump, but could be a hit with iPad Pro fans. Software updates for Apple Watch and TV The younger siblings of the Apple hardware world, the Apple TV and Apple Watch are also due for some software updates. In the past, these updates have been solid improvements to the products, if a little lacking in flash. New MacBooks Apple hasn't forgotten about its laptops. The company is expected to upgrade the MacBook Pro and 12-inch MacBook Air with new, faster processors. The MacBook Air has been neglected by the company in recent years, but an affordable update to the smallest member of the MacBook family could help Apple with its push to reclaim the education market.

There are a lot of things that we can expect from this event, from iPhone to Mac to Siri-controlled speaker. Usually, it’s a show that focuses on iOS and MacOS. However, rumor has it that the company is going to share some hardware news as well, making it more engrossing than usual. Regarding software, the company will announce the latest updates to its iOS and MacOS, as well as watchOS and tvOS. Every year, Apple releases updates for these platforms in June. The iOS will have an updated user interface. Although details about it aren’t clear, one possibility could be that there will be a dark mode feature that changes the interface form white to black. It’s not just for visual purposes, but it could save battery life. This feature is almost the same as in the Apple Watch. Bloomberg reported that the updates for iPad would have support for a stylus. Some of its apps might be updated to enable users to use a pen when using them. It could mimic the abilities of S Pen styluses in Samsung. The Pro iPad may improve its multitasking capacity by offering a drag-and-drop feature. It may also support multiple user accounts. Apple may also provide lots of updates for its apps. Last year, the company announced some changes to its apps. So, it would not be a surprise to see that it would continue pushing those updates this year. Siri Updates Industry experts expect that the company will expand Siri services. It has stared to open Siri to developers through its Apps Extensions in iOS 10. The Sirikit APIs cover set of functions, but it’s limited to payments, messaging, ride booking, and fitness apps, among others. In this year’s event, Apple may expand Siri access beyond the app categories. It’s taking a slow approach, but it’s adding more categories to the list. Users now can ask the digital assistant to grab an Uber ride or control their fitness tracking software. However, they can’t purchase anything the way they do with Alexa assistant. The nature of Siri’s augmentations is unclear. But one thing is for sure. Apple wants to have an answer to Alexa and other competition virtual assistants that have brown in popularity. Peer-to-Peer Payments Apple is reported to have a payment service that could compete with Square Cash and Venmo. But details of it aren’t clear yet. Some are saying that it’s going to be a feature of Apple Pay; others stated that it would be a feature in iMessage. According to Jimmy Iovine during his interview with Bloomberg, Apple Music will have a new design to offer better video. Apple’s original shows will come out soon. So, that feature isn’t surprising. On August 8, we’ll finally see Carpool Karaoke and hear Planet of the Apps on Monday. How about macOS? For many years now, the company hasn’t made massive updates to macOS. However, we can expect Apple to keep polishing it and add new features. Last year, the company introduced Siri to macOS. This year, it might get more powerful. Every year, an operating system for Apple Watch and TV have seen many changes. However, there are no details yet as to what to expect from these platforms. But, surely, the company would keep changing them to improve the user experience. Apple TV executive believed that the future of Internet TV would become more interactive. Thus, it’s more likely that the tvOS would enable developers to produce more interactive apps. It’s been reported that Amazon Prime Video would run on Apple TV. Siri-Controlled Speaker We’ve reported about it that Apple has started manufacturing this speaker that could compete with Amazon Echo and Google Home. It’s likely that Apple will announce it on Monday. We can expect changes to Siri this year. Apple will allow app developers to use this new device. It may adopt a similar model on how it distributes apps for its smartwatch. Developers can build features for Siri into the heart of the mobile app. The rumored Siri-controlled speaker will have virtual surround sound so it can have a better audio quality than its competitors. It can also function as a hub for Apple HomeKit. This integration may be enough for it to stand out from its competition. Thus, if you have an iPhone, this speaker is the easiest way for you to get started with the speaker. 10.5-Inch iPad Pro It’s not certain yet. But analysts are saying that the company is working on a bigger iPad Pro that has a size of 10.5 inches. It may have the same sizes as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. However, it’ll have a larger screen size. MacBooks It’s time for Apple to provide updates for MacBooks and MacBook Pros. Since Kaby Lake is out, Apple must start updating its laptops to support it. Kaby Lake offers more power and battery life. The Pro could have an option to have more RAM. But it’s not certain yet. The MacBook Air hasn’t been updated for two years. It looks like the company would watch it die. However, the sales have remained strong. Bloomberg reported that it’s going to receive updates that would include support for Kaby Lake processors. MacMini Users of Mac mini are hoping the hardware would get an upgrade. Likewise, Apple TV enthusiasts would want it to get upgraded to 4k. But all of these are still unlikely. How about VR and VR functionalities? Apple hasn’t announced anything yet. Google and Facebook have stated they’re going to embrace VR and AR more. But it’s not clear if Apple would do the same. However, it could include some augmented-reality-feature to its iPhone Camera app. If it would happen, it could show that the company is, indeed, dipping its toe in this area. At this year’s event, its smartphones may be off the table. iMacs, too, may not be included. The company may have promised new Mac Pro; it’s not going to arrive until next year. These are just expectations. Let’s see what it would unveil this Monday.

Source: Shutterstock As Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) prepares to host its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) with its shining city on a hill, and with the spaceship now called Apple Park almost complete, the world’s most valuable company ($808 billion and climbing) should be proud to the point of arrogance. And, it is, too. This may be why smart people, such as our Tom Taulli, are worried about Apple as an investment. Good news seems baked-in, he writes, and there are risk factors. There always are, though. Apple’s gains so far in 2017 have practically matched those of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which everyone says rules the world. And, they have outpaced those of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), which everyone says rules the Internet. Apple must be ruling the universe, then, right? Right? Developers, Developers The WWDC is not supposed to be a hardware event. It is meant for Apple’s developers who want to know what new applications they might develop soon for the Macintosh, iPhone, its TV services and the Watch. But, European filings indicate there will be hardware next week. The event is due to focus on the iPad tablet, which badly needs a refresh, although there are rumors of a Siri Speaker that will compete with the Amazon Echo, at a higher price point.  The maturity of its primary market, however, can be seen in its latest ads, already online, which directly target Google’s Android operating system, claiming iOS performs better, with better security and privacy. It needs to, if it is to justify a price tag that can be $500 more than a good Android phone. The New iPhone Good analysts like InvestorPlace’s Vince Martin think Apple will remain stuck in neutral until its new iPhone hits the market and proves its worth. You can expect that phone in the fall, with an edge-to-edge screen, a fingerprint sensor in place of the home button, dual cameras and speakers, along with a flip case that lets it be used as a PC replacement. Employees are being told to be at their posts from September 17 to November 4 to serve the rush. UBS is expecting a massive rush, enough to send the stock up 24%, to $190 per share, which would equate to a market cap of well over $1 trillion. UBS expects millions of iPhone 8s to jump off shelves at $730 each, with 40% of that price flowing to Apple’s net income. It’s these expectations of a “super cycle” that have kept AAPL stock rising through 2017. Apple investors have become accustomed to seeing 20% of revenue flow to net income, with operating margins of 25%. UBS is expecting that to rise.

According to a new revelation by Chinese site iPhoneros, the iPhone 8 will compete with the likes of Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6 displays with an elongated 18.5:9 aspect ratio screen. The move makes sense as this aspect ratio allows manufacturers to increase the size of a smartphone display while keeping it narrow enough to hold one-handed and still use the keyboard comfortably. However, for this, the app makers will have to redesign their user interfaces while navigation at the top of the display (like the back button in iOS) becomes harder to reach. The handful of images also showed the upcoming iPhone 8 with rear-placed Touch ID placed directly below the Apple logo. The placement matches earlier leaked drawings, showing the vertical camera design, camera flash placement, among other design information. As for the legitimacy of these leaks, iPhoneros claimed that the pictures that came from a Chinese source have provided correct images in the past and “never sent us false information.” more from tech After Ransomware, India hit by new ‘Fireball’ malware; among worst affected Jun 04, 2017 07:37 IST Toyota-supported flying car hopes to light the Tokyo 2020 Olympic flame Jun 03, 2017 20:11 IST Nurturing Recruitment-Ready Students Promotional Feature Recommended for you Read more Apple set to expand Siri, taking different route from Amazon’s Alexa iPhone 8 to have bezel-less display, fingerprint sensor goes to back: Report India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Pune Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper interactives Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini Studymate Englishmate HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 1 Huge Winner From Apple Inc.'s Next iPhone This successful Apple supplier looks to extend its winning streak by boosting its dollar content inside the next iPhone. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 3, 2017 at 9:30AM In just a few months, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to launch three new iPhone models -- direct successors to the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus phones that are currently in the market as well as a more premium model packed with interesting features and functionality that won't be present in the "standard" models. There have been many unofficial leaks about the new iPhone models, indicating some of the new features and functionality that'll be in the phones as well as potential supply chain winners in the new phone. Image source: Apple. In this column, I'd like to go over a confirmed winner from Apple's next-generation iPhone models: Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). A big content increase Here are three clear ways that an Apple supplier can benefit from the ramp up of a next-generation iPhone: Share gain: Apple often has multiple suppliers for a given iPhone component, a practice that lowers Apple's risk while at the same time giving it bargaining power. One way that a supplier can boost its Apple-related business performance, then, is to increase its share of Apple's orders for a given component. Content growth: With each generation, Apple adds more features and capabilities to its phones. If a component supplier can provide Apple with differentiated components that add substantial new features, there's a chance that it can get paid extra for that component relative to what it provided into a prior-generation phone. Broad iPhone growth: To the extent that a next-generation iPhone outsells the previous one in the marketplace, a component vendor that has managed to keep its share (as a percentage of total new iPhone units shipped) and dollar content flat should enjoy revenue growth. Given that the upcoming iPhone models are, in aggregate, widely expected to outsell their predecessors, investors in Apple suppliers should already expect reasonable year-over-year growth in component revenue. What's interesting, though, is that Broadcom CEO Hock Tan signaled on the company's June 1 earnings call that the company expects the next-generation flagship smartphone from its "large North American smartphone customer" to drive "a substantial increase in [Broadcom's] total dollar content" from what he says are the eight Broadcom products that will be in the device. What does this content increase mean for the consumer? The "substantial increase" in Broadcom dollar content in the new iPhone likely means that the new device will see significant improvements in both cellular capabilities as well as a boost in Wi-Fi/Bluetooth capability. It also appears to confirm the rumors that Apple will use a Broadcom wireless charging solution. In terms of cellular capabilities, I expect that the main addition will be carrier aggregation on the uplink, which should translate into faster upload speeds. Given that the new devices will likely use Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) XMM 7480 modem for some models and a Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) MDM9645 for others, I don't expect an improvement in peak download speeds from the 450 megabits per second that the iPhone 7/7 Plus are capable of. As far as Wi-Fi/Bluetooth capability is concerned, the same source (research from J.P. Morgan) that suggested that the new iPhone models would use a Broadcom-based wireless charging solution also claims that the new iPhone will support Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity. I wouldn't be surprised, then, to see Apple adopt the same Broadcom connectivity chip that's currently used in the Galaxy S8 (which includes Bluetooth 5.0 capability). All told, this increase in content means better wireless performance (always a plus for a device that's so heavily dependent on connectivity to be useful) and wireless charging, which, if implemented correctly, could be a convenient feature.

I was hoping to find a number of new features in their international classes that would confirm new Siri services added to their standard list that is known today. While there was no home run to be found that would relate to a new home device specifically, there were two interesting entries.   Today, Siri can make a reservation at a restaurant but not a hotel. The new entry under international class 09 covers making hotel reservations. The other new item is under the "remote control for" category and under that list it now includes "smart glasses" which was also added to Apple's smart glasses patent back in January 2017 and another earlier this month. You could check out the class details in our report as there could be more to discover. Our report also includes two jumbo graphics below.   Apple is likely to update their Siri icon class coverage once their new device comes to market later this year. The other classes the icons were filed under include #35 and #42. Class 35 covers basic advertising and marketing while class 42 covers IT services, browsing and retrieving information.   Apple's Siri Icon was filed under International Class 09 as noted in full below. Apple's European registered patent number is 016063372         Posted by Jack Purcher on June 03, 2017 at 06:59 AM in 2.

But that hasn't stopped the rumors. Apple on Monday will hold its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Jose, Calif. While the show has historically focused on software, like Apple's iOS and macOS operating systems, several recent rumors suggest hardware like new iPads and a new smart home hub may feature prominently on stage. But there's more going on than just WWDC. Apple CEO Tim Cook has responded to this week's decision by President Donald Trump to remove the U.S. from the Paris climate accord. And at long last, Apple has shared the premiere date for its upcoming Web series, Carpool Karaoke. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter Read on for this week's biggest Apple headlines: Apple (aapl) on Monday could unveil a new smart home hub that would let users control smart home devices like light bulbs, set reminders for events, and interact with music playlists. The device would be powered by Apple's virtual personal assistant Siri and will come with high-quality (and loud) speakers, Bloomberg reported this week, citing sources. While Apple will reportedly unveil the device at the show, it likely won't release the Siri-powered gadget until later this year. The smart home device could be announced alongside new iPad Pro models, including one with a 10.5-inch screen. Existing iPad Pro models have 9.7- and 12.9-inch screens. Apple could be to blame for the widespread Nintendo Switch shortage, according to a Wall Street Journal report this week. The Journal's sources said that suppliers of memory, liquid-crystal displays, and other components are filling Apple's orders before Nintendo's, forcing the video game company to wait for components for its popular Switch game console. Nintendo (ntdoy) has said that Switch supply will remain low through the end of the year, and if supply chain sources are correct, Apple may be the reason. One of Qualcomm's top engineers has left the company to join Apple. The iPhone maker, which is embroiled in an international dispute with Qualcomm, recently hired Esin Terzioglu to work in an undisclosed capacity at the company. Terzioglu previously led Qualcomm's communications chip business. After President Trump announced this week that he would withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, Apple's CEO reiterated his company's commitment to the environment. He said that "climate change is real," adding that he was "disappointed" by the president's decision. Cook is said to have called the president at the White House earlier this week to lobby him to stay in the Paris Climate agreement. This is Fortune’s weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news this week. To see last week’s roundup, click here. One more thing...Apple's long-awaited Carpool Karaoke series will debut on Aug. 8. The series will be available on Apple Music, which started as a music-streaming service, but also accommodates videos and streaming shows. Apple had reportedly planned to premiere the show in the spring, and, in April announced that it would be delayed until later in 2017.

Apple's annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) kicks off Monday in San Jose, where we expect to hear about the new versions of iOS and MacOS, and perhaps One More Thing. We'll have hands-on coverage from the event floor that day, but for now, here are some of the most prominent rumors and likely announcements making the rounds in the lead up to the keynote. iOS 11 and MacOS 10.13 The only true surefire bets for WWDC are new versions of Apple's mobile and computer software platforms. Most Apple consumers will end up with some or all of the announced features depending on which products they use, and developers are eager to hear what they'll have to work with, so these will be the stars of the show. Expect the usual updates to core apps like Safari and Mail, with productivity enhancements across the board. Exact feature additions will read more like a wish list since little is known or confirmed currently, but maybe we'll see announcements like conference calls in FaceTime. Improvements for watchOS and tvOS should also be on display, mainly in the form of more integration into the two main platforms. Increased Siri functionality and unification across the platform might play a big part in the conference, too, especially if the next rumor turns out to be true. Siri Speaker Apple's answer to Alexa (and more recently, Google Home) has been long expected, and it seems like this could be the year we finally see one. Whether this is something consumers are itching for remains to be seen—no doubt many interested in a voice assistant have given in and purchased an Amazon Echo or Google Home by now, but the Apple ecosystem could be enough of an incentive to buy. Either way, Bloomberg reports that a Siri speaker has already entered production, so there's a good chance we see it on Monday. That said, Apple could wait to debut the speaker later in the year, which would be closer to its expected shipping date. If reports are true, it will differentiate itself from the Echo and Google Home with features like virtual surround and, as mentioned, integration with the already ubiquitous lineup of Apple products in millions of homes. MacBook and MacBook Pro Refreshes The standard MacBook and MacBook Pro lines were given some love in 2016 with modest redesigns and, in the case of the Pro, the introduction of the Touch Bar. As such, any announcements about these two lines at WWDC will likely include minor component updates, such as the latest generation Intel processors, rather than major physical or feature changes. There have been some industry rumblings to support this speculation, but it may turn out this traditionally software-focused event saves its MacBook overhaul for a product that might need it a little more attention. New MacBook Air? The Air remains an all-time favorite laptop for many, despite Apple's relatively infrequent updates to the line. It's appealing as the cheapest (comparatively) entry in Apple's laptop line, and did not receive the 2016 refresh its counterparts did. An "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" approach makes some sense here, but the most recent MacBook Air was released in 2015, and if Apple skips another upgrade, 2018 is an awfully long wait in computer time. If it does arrive, expect a USB-C only approach, since even the "thicker" 2016 MacBook dropped the larger standard USB ports. The 1,440-by-900-display resolution would almost definitely receive a boost, since it was already on the low side in 2015, and its great battery life may very well creep even closer to 20 hours. Refined iPad Pro If the existing 9.7- and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models don't do it for you, how does something in the middle sound? Thanks in part to analyst expectations (as reported by Mac Rumors), there's plenty of buzz suggesting a 10.5-inch iPad Pro will be revealed at WWDC that similar in size to the 9.7-inch model. The extra screen space will be made possible by much thinner bezels—nearly edge-to-edge—so that Apple can fit a larger screen in a smaller body. In fact, it may replace the 9.7-inch version altogether, since it's essentially the same size with a bigger display. Odds are this won't be the only upgrade: The usual component updates like better cameras, a new processor, and maybe a new Apple Pencil would fill out the rest of this announcement.

Apple announced developers have earned over $70 billion since the App Store went live in 2008. Taking the tech giant's 70/30 revenue split into account, that means customers have spent over $100 billion in App Store purchases. Apple didn't stop with an earnings number boast as it also revealed App Store downloads grew by over 70% in the past 12 months, and active paid subscriptions are up 58% since the same time last year.

The Wall Street Journal.3:51 UP NEXT Video by CNBC Editor’s note: The opinions in this article are the author’s, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft. Load Error Apple is not the U.S. stock that is currently recommended by the greatest number of newsletter editors. Believe it or not, it’s IBM (IBM) , which for years has represented in many investors’ eyes the kind of old, stodgy and washed-up company that nimble firms like Apple (AAPL) run circles around. But a surprisingly large number of market-beating newsletters editors I monitor think that view is unfair. In essence, they argue that IBM is a growth company that trades like a value stock. Many of the newsletter editors credit IBM’s “Watson” for much of the company’s growth potential. Gray Cardiff, editor of the Sound Advice newsletter, describes Watson as IBM’s artificial intelligence “super computer that can ‘think’ like a human.” Notes Cardiff: “Watson cognitively scans a world of data and applies relevant information to what it learns about a company’s business and systems to create new revenue streams, reduce expenses, and make existing operations more efficient. We have only begun to see and imagine the uses of artificial intelligence. IBM is the leader in that field and on a solid path to provide a growing abundance of opportunities in the months and years ahead.” John Buckingham, editor of the Prudent Speculator newsletter, adds that “the growth opportunity for the company’s Strategic Imperatives is high. Watson continues to impress with deployments in Health Care, Internet of Things and Financial Services.” Despite such optimism, IBM stock in out of favor and trades solidly in the value camp. Its price/earnings ratio based on trailing 12 months’ earnings is 12.6, compared to almost double that for the S&P 500 (SPX) . IBM’s P/E based on estimated earnings for the next 12 months is even lower, at 11.1.© Provided by Dow Jones & Company, Inc. The newsletter editors also are impressed with IBM’s high dividend yield — 3.9% currently — that provides investors with a nice cushion during the time those editors think it could take for the rest of the market to discover the stock’s potential. Also impressive to them is that, with IBM’s recent 10-cent increase in its quarterly dividend, the company has now raised its dividend in each of the last 22 years. Kelley Wright, editor of Investment Quality Trends, bases his recommendation of IBM on its dividend yield. In fact, he calculates that the stock wouldn’t become overvalued until it’s trading at $462 — which represents more than a triple from where IBM is trading today. Moreover, each of these advisers recommending IBM has a market-beating track record. John Buckingham’s Prudent Speculator, for example, has beaten the broad stock market by 1.7 percentage points annualized over the past 30 years. Though my performance monitoring service has been tracking Gray Cardiff’s and Kelley Wright’s newsletters for less time, they also have beaten the market: Wright’s market-topping margin over the past 20 years annualized is 2.6 percentage points, while Cardiff’s over the past 15 years is 1.7 points. For the record, I should emphasize that the newsletter editors I monitor don’t actively dislike Apple. Many are recommending it also. They just like IBM more.

Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close Amazon and Google currently dominate the home hub market. (AP File Photo/Jeff Chiu)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Speculation over what Apple will do to compete in the home hub market is spinning up ahead of Apple's annual developer's conference, where many analysts expect Apple will confirm the project. And what will be the Apple home hub's distinguishing feature? It may be sound quality, according a report from Bloomberg. The Siri-infused speaker will really focus on producing quality surround sound and may also have a feature that can measure the room it's in and adjust its sound accordingly, the report said. While there were not any details on how this room-adapting feature works, it sounds similar to one already on Sonos speakers, called TruePlay, which uses the microphone in an iOS device to measure a room. Apple declined to comment on the report. Focusing on sound quality would give Apple an advantage, particularly given its historical strength in music, if it moves to another front in its war against Google and Amazon. Both firms already have smart speakers on the market that integrate with their own services, but are somewhat lacking when it comes to sound quality. Still, it will be stiff competition. Both Google and Amazon are continually adding features to their devices and the voice assistants they house. Google, at its own developers conference, announced that its Google Home will work with more devices, thanks to a Bluetooth connection, as well as even deeper integration with its own services. And Amazon on Thursday announced that its Echo line of smart home hubs now lets users further customize their reminders and timers on the device -- a small but useful update for two core uses of these devices. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) Apart from focusing on sound quality, Apple will also have to find ways to leverage its own ecosystem of services -- iTunes, the App Store, HomeKit, Siri and more -- to convince potential buyers that its hub is right for them. It's not yet clear how it will do this, though Bloomberg reports there will be "deep integration" with Apple services. However, contrary to prior reports from analysts, the Bloomberg report said there will not be a screen on Apple's home hub. That could mean it won't compete, as expected, with Amazon's recent Echo Look -- a home hub that allows for video calling and potentially threatens Apple's FaceTime. Still, Apple has laid some groundwork in the home hub space before, by allowing some smart home devices such as light bulbs to be controlled through its Apple TV, and prominently featuring its own apps for the living room. A smart speaker that builds on what Apple TV has offered would give users more flexibility to decide where to place their home hub.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 2 Top Dividend Stocks in Information Technology Singing the income-investing praises of IT stocks Apple and Cisco Systems. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Jun 2, 2017 at 4:58PM Though dividends are more associated with growth companies, the tech industry has seen a number of its largest players become dividend dynamos in recent decades. Powered by cash-cow business models, mature information-technology names such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) offer income investors compelling mixes of historical cash distributions, current yield, and dividend growth potential. These two aren't the only appealing dividend opportunities in the sector, but let's see what makes them some of the more compelling dividend stocks in IT today. Apple The world's largest technology company has had a capital-return program only since 2012, but its potential for sustained dividend growth is perhaps the most impressive in its industry. The key to Apple's dividend potential lies in its high-margin products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Consider, for example, that research firm Strategy Analytics recently estimated that Apple captured 79.2% of the operating profit in the global smartphone industry in 2016. That means massive cash flows for the Mac maker, and it's part of the reason Apple has accumulated a mind-boggling $158 billion in net cash  as of its most recent quarterly report. Moreover, the launch of the highly anticipated iPhone 8 later this year is likely to trigger an upgrade cycle that should drive record earnings and further fill Apple's coffers. Potential moves into massive global markets, including healthcare,    augmented reality,  virtual reality,  and smart homes,  should serve as future catalysts to drive sustained growth for Apple. So while Apple's shares yield just 1.48% today, the company's winning business model, strong leadership, and globally recognizable brand should facilitate consistent dividend growth for investors well into the future. Image source: Getty Images. Cisco Systems Paying much more than Apple shares today, router giant Cisco Systems  stands well above the S&P 500's 1.9% current yield, with its 3.4% showing. Like the Mac maker, Cisco is in the early stages of its dividend history, but its initial progress has been impressive. Since initiating its cash distributions in 2011, Cisco has raised its annual dividends per share from a $0.24 starting point to $1.04 last year. That progress translates into a compound average growth rate of 28% per annum. The company already increased its quarterly dividend for 2017 by $0.03 per share to $0.29,  further extending the company's perfect streak of consecutive annual increases. Better still, all signs suggest that Cisco will be able to maintain its impressive dividend performance in future years. Cisco's payout ratio currently stands at 54% of net income, and it carries $35.5 billion in net cash on its balance sheet. Those stats alone suggest that Cisco can continue to increase its dividend payments for many years. Being at the heart of one of tech's largest trends should also drive Cisco's results higher in the years to come. Its routers make it a likely beneficiary of the continued rise of the Internet of Things, which the company has estimated should develop into a $19 trillion  market over the next 10 years. But even if that estimate proves to be too optimistic, Cisco has enough going for it that it should still be able to support sustainable dividend growth over the long term.   Andrew Tonner owns shares of Apple.

Campos A Filipino multilevel marketing company is bent on pushing the Philippines as the upline in the distribution of cutting-edge skin resilience products. Forever Healthy Products Inc. started distributing a proprietary product known as Imuregen and Apple stem cell product eight months ago.  “We are a proud MLM company. There’s a good reason why distributor-based marketing is one of the best ways in this  country to provide opportunity to people. With little capital, just give them the opportunity and it will change their lives. We want all Forever Healthy distributors to be the upline in all of our products. We believe that our products are the best in their categories and that they will help improve the lives of many Filipinos, first as anti-aging supplements and as livelihood for those who want to earn a living,” said Forever Healthy president and chief executive Leon Katz. Forever Healthy has developed naturally sweet oral preparations to help initiate the anti-aging process using a special proprietary and patented ingredient derived from a very special apple tree in Switzerland. The apple tree, a very rare specie, now has only three known trees left. From it comes the so-called anti-aging ingredient called mallus domestica. Forever Healthy Products Inc. president and chief executive Leon Katz The malus domestica or domestic apple variety in Switzerland  is a very rare apple tree. Its anti-aging capabilities were discovered when it was mixed side by side with other apples that, after a few months have withered and rot, but the Swiss malus domestica remained as fresh as if it was picked that same day. “This is an apple story that is not traditional. Our story came from an apple longer living than the rest, which was an important ingredient in the formulation of our products. We have this in preparation for over three years now but we  started to officially distribute the products about eight months ago,” Katz said. The stem cell from the apple tree was proven beneficial to health especially the skin. It is being used by Mibelle, a European bio-research company that specializes on cosmetics. Mibelle devised the  beauty serum used by former US First Lady Michelle Obama. Sales, Katz said, had been good since the launch eight months ago. In fact, month-on-month sales in April increased 45 percent. “We’re doing great every week. Month by month we are seeing that dramatic growth. Every month is a record-breaking month,” he said. After the Philippine launch, the company aims to penetrate the American and German markets within the year. “From here, we’re planning to go global. What is significant is that Forever Healthy is a Filipino company. It’s not Malaysian, not American but a Filipino company. We started here because we want to change the lives of many here,” Katz said. Topics: Forever Healthy Products Inc. , Leon Katz Related stories: No related stories matched this topic.

On his Backchannel blog, Levy tells the story of how Muffly and Steve Jobs planned the trees that would be planted at Apple Park, including Muffly’s recollection of the first time he saw the mockups of the building: Jobs took him to a room that had foam-core renderings of the proposed new Apple headquarters — a verdant space with lush greenery (80 percent of the space is landscaped) dominated by a huge ring-like building where 12,000 people would work. “I was like, whoa, this is crazy,” recalls Muffly. “And I’m looking at it and my brain is like, it’s the mothership!” Muffly was impressed with Jobs’ extensive knowledge of trees native to Silicon Valley: Jobs knew his trees, too. “He had a better sense than most arborists,” says Muffly. “He could tell visually which ones looked like they had good structure.” On a visit to Jobs’ house in 2011, Muffly saw this in action. They were in Jobs’ backyard garden, and in a neighbor’s yard there were two varieties of trees that Muffly wanted Jobs to choose between. “There was a kind of tree that I wanted to use and one that was more common,” says Muffly. “I asked, Steve, which of those two trees do you prefer? He liked questions like that. And he looked up and he pointed to the one I wanted. I said, Thank you, Steve. That was a good answer.” Like other aspects of Apple Park, the scale of the landscaping is immense with roughly 9,000 trees planned. What I like most about Levy’s piece though, is that it adds a face, personality, and story to those huge numbers.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: June 4, 2017 3:39 pm Apple is gearing up too host its annual developer conference at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. The 2017 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference will begin June 5 and ends June 9. Related News Apple WWDC 2017: Look for signs when Tim Cook takes the stage Apple WWDC 2017: iOS 11 to Siri speaker, everything to be announced Apple set to expand Siri, taking different route from Amazon’s Alexa Apple is all set to host its annual developer conference at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. The 2017 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) will begin June 5 and ends June 9. At its developer conference, the Cupertino technology giant is expected to announce a slew of updates on hardware as well as software side. There will be updates around iOS, MacOS, webOS, tvOS and watchOS. On the hardware side, reports have speculated that Apple might refresh its entire MacBook line-up. Further, the company could showcase a new 10.5-inch iPad model, and announce upgrades to 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros. The most important announcement could come in the form of a new Siri-powered home speaker, which will compete with the likes of Google Home and Echo. In a previous report, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had predicted that Apple’s new speaker could cost more than the likes of Echo. Ahead of the WWDC 2017, let us take a look at all the hardware products expected at the conference: Apple’s Siri-powered speaker Reports have suggested that a Siri-powered speaker, similar to Google Home and Amazon Echo could be announced at WWDC as well. According to a Bloomberg report, the iPhone-maker has started manufacturing Siri-controlled smart speaker, though it won’t be ready to ship until later this year. Apple’s new device will offer virtual surround technology, and deep integration with Apple’s product line-up, which might give it an edge over rivals. The speaker won’t just provide a hub to automate appliances and lights via Apple’s HomeKit system, but also strengthen Apple’s network of services. According to a Bloomberg report, the iPhone-maker has started manufacturing Siri-controlled smart speaker, though it won’t be ready to ship until later this year. “Apple will also likely let third-party services build products for the speaker. Last year, Apple opened up Siri on the iPhone to the likes of Uber Technologies Inc. and Facebook Inc., allowing a user to order a ride or send a WhatsApp message with a voice command,” the report reads. Apple’s Siri-powered speaker will likely come with multiple tweeters, a woofer and computing power comparable to an “iPhone 6 or 6s”, according to Kuo. Apple is said to fit the device with camera, which will use facial recognition technology to identify people in close proximity of the speaker. Apple MacBooks Apple will refresh its MacBook line-up with faster Intel Kaby Lake processors. To recall, new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros with Touch Bar were announced in 2016. Apple’s 13-inch MacBook Pro is available in variants with and without Touch Bar, while 15-inch MacBook Pro can only be bought in one option – with Touch Bar. However, a lot of professional users weren’t happy with the hardware of Apple’s MacBook Pros. Microsoft called the line-up a “disappointment”. It looks like Apple wants to woo back its customers with a faster processor. Apple will refresh its MacBook line-up with faster Intel Kaby Lake processors. To recall, new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros with Touch Bar were announced in 2016. Apple’s 12-inch MacBook along with 13-inch MacBook Air could get an upgrade as well. Recently, a report in French website Consmac revealed that Apple has registered five new ‘personal computers’ bearing model numbers A1289, A1347, A1418, A1419 and A1481. The new Mac computers are expected to be the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros. These model numbers are said to be of computers running macOS 10.12. Reports in the past have revealed that shipping time-frame for the 15-inch MacBook Pro with OLED Touch Bar were refreshed, suggesting updated device is on the way. Now the device will be made available between June 6 to June 8 in the US. Apple iPads New iPads are on the cards as well. According to Consmac report, five iOS devices with model numbers – A1670, A1671, A1701, A1709, and A1843 –  were spotted in a regulatory filing by Apple. Separately, Kuo has predicted new Apple iPads this year. Kuo expects Apple to announce a 10.5-inch iPad model with an all-new design and edge-to-edge display. Apple could upgrade its 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros as well. The two models could get significant upgrades in terms of design, processor, specifications, and more. Finally, device with A1843 is labeled as a wireless keyboard, details of which are missing at this point.

SAN JOSE, Calif. >> With iPhone sales slowing and the last new Apple product released two years ago, expectations are building for what the company will reveal next week at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Some Apple watchers are counting on artificial intelligence. With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing AI in their conferences over the past two months, market analysts believe it is Apple’s turn. As the race for artificial intelligence heats up in Silicon Valley, some worry that Apple is already behind the game. “If Apple skips AI, I would consider that a significant miss on their opportunity,” said John Jackson, a Boston-based analyst for IDC. “Apple is late to this game. There is no other trick up their sleeve around this.” Apple, long known for its secrecy, declined to discuss specifics of the event but emailed a statement that its global developer community has earned more than $70 billion since the App Store launched in 2008. Rumors and early reports indicate the Cupertino tech giant might release a new iPad Pro, and according to Bloomberg, a Siri-controlled home speaker to challenge Amazon Echo and Google Home. Gene Munster, a venture capitalist at Loup Ventures and a longtime Apple watcher, said a home speaker would be a step in the right direction for Apple. “Artificial intelligence is fundamental to every company now,” Munster said. “We knew Apple was going to improve on Siri, and (the speaker) seems to line up. It makes logical sense.” In addition to the Siri speaker, rumors of a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, an updated MacBook Pro and a new iOS 11 have circulated on the internet. The five-day conference to be attended by more than 5,000 developers — who each paid $1,599 after winning a lottery — is moving from San Francisco to San Jose, where it will be held for the first time since 2002. Apple CEO Tim Cook will give the keynote speech Monday morning. His speech will be streamed live on Apple’s website.

The event is often all about software, but we’re hearing some rumblings that we could see some hardware news as well, perhaps in the form of a completely new product. Our best guess is the Siri speaker, which would serve as Apple’s Siri-driven smart home hub, a competitor to Google Home and Amazon Echo. Although we’ve heard rumors about a 10.5-inch iPad Pro as well. While we’re short on substantiated rumors this year, we will be on the ground covering the event live starting at 10am PT/1pm ET on Monday (June 5). But for now, here’s what we know (or think we know), based on how certain we are: Highly likely iOS 11 iOS is rumored to receive a complete overhaul, but we doubt that’s going to happen. Instead, you should expect updates to Messages, new features in Photos, and enhanced stylus support. We’ve heard musings that apps like Mail and Safari could even use a stylus similar to Samsung’s S Pen for mobile annotations. This could be highly useful if Apple’s social network/chat app is a thing. Apple is rumored to be working on a social networking app similar to Snapchat or Instagram with an emphasis on sharing photos and video — with doodles, stickers, and the like — with friends. Adding a “dark mode” would be a big hit too. This is less a feature at this point, and more a setup for the upcoming OLED iPhone screen. Much like Apple Watch, the company could use dark mode as a way of conserving battery by not having to light all the pixels on the phone. Another rumor, which we can’t be sure about, is the rumored peer-to-peer payment system. If true, this would be Apple’s entry into a market dominated by Venmo and Square Cash, and could ultimately prove to be a huge boon to Apple Pay. An all-encompassing payment system on a mobile device is something we’ve been dreaming about for years, and this could actually be it. We can also expect some iPad Pro-specific updates. Of these, I think we’re most likely to see drag-and-drop support, better multi-tasking, and perhaps multi-user support. This is, after all, the future of computing — or so Apple says. macOS 10.13 The changes to macOS are expected to be incremental in nature, much like the past two updates. It seems we’re overdue for a game-changing new feature or perhaps a visual refresh, but it doesn’t seem as though WWDC 2017 is where it’ll happen. Instead, you can expect the usual polish feature updates and a coat of polish, although Mail seems to be the most likely native app to receive some sort of overhaul. Fingers crossed. tvOS 11 and watchOS 4 Not much going on in the rumor mill surrounding these two, although it seems likely Apple will announce it’s buried the hatchet with Amazon, and we’ll get Prime Video on AppleTV (finally). As for Watch, I’d expect additional usability upgrades to better make use of existing feature. Seems likely Apple Music Jimmy Lovine, in an interview with Bloomberg, hinted at an Apple Music refresh that emphasizes more video content. The timing seems to measure up. Two Apple original shows are scheduled to release this year: Carpool Karaoke (August 8) and Planet of the Apps, which we’ll possibly get a launch date for on Monday. Siri speaker Apple doesn’t have a horse in the smart speaker race dominated by Amazon and Google. Plan on Tim Cook remedying that by introducing a speaker powered by none other than Siri. It’s said to feature virtual surround sound for high quality audio in smaller spaces that might not be a logical fit for a 5.1 or 7.1 surround set up. It’ll also function as a hub for HomeKit, the smart home system Apple’s been touting since last year. 10.5-inch iPad Pro This one could just as easily have gone into the next category, a section where we’re hearing a lot of buzz, but not all that sure about the legitimacy of it. Given the reliability of Apple analyst Ming Chi Kuo, I’m inclined to add it into the “likely” category. According to Kuo, Apple has been working on a 10.5-inch iPad Pro that reportedly encompasses the same footprint of the 9.7-inch version due to its tiny bezels. Whether this model is a bridge between the existing two sizes, or intended to be a replacement for one (or both) remains to be seen. Still, though, WWDC isn’t typically when we hear about new iPads, so I certainly have my reservations here. Then again, the company did release an off-schedule iPad refresh to the standard model in March, so it’s hard to say. MacBook and/or MacBook Pro I thought we’d probably see updates to the MacBook (and Pro) this fall, but it could happen at WWDC instead. If so, expect something in line with a spec bump –perhaps to new Kaby Lake processors, and the option to upgrade to 32GB of RAM — rather than new MacBooks, It’s also possible we’ll see a mid-life spec bump, and a complete refresh next spring. Possibly? Mac Pro refresh This one is doubtful, but it’s not impossible to be a surprise move pulled off by Apple after admitting its mistake with the “trashcan” Mac Pro. I still think it’s more likely the company holds true to its word and we see this more toward the middle or end of 2018 though. MacBook Air The Air has sort of languished in a state that leads most to believe it’ll be discontinued. Some are actually larger than new MacBooks, which seems to suggest they’re no longer needed. Thing is, the MacBook Air is still selling surprisingly well, although that’s probably due to it being the only Apple laptop under $1,000. Rumors suggest it may get a spec bump to Kaby Lake and perhaps more RAM. We’d also love to see a switch to USB-C, but it doesn’t seem Apple is all that motivated to keep the Air around for the long haul, so it probably isn’t happening. But if we’re going to wish for new features, we’d be remiss if we forgot the paltry 1440×900 resolution the current Air is sporting. What is this, 2010? Probably not iPhone SE The timing lines up perfectly to release a new iPhone SE, but it’s probably not going to happen. This fall, at the iPhone event, Apple is rumored to be releasing three new iPhones, and you’d have to assume the SE would be one of them. Plus, it’s the 10th anniversary of the mobile device, so one would assume Apple would go big here and not want to cut into sales by releasing the SE a few months before its big event. iMac The iMac is also due for an update, but it seems increasingly unlikely you’re not going to see it at WWDC.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

The impossible becomes a reality in one simple move. The best way to play Apple’s coming historic moment. Also recommended: Blue chip stocks get small-cap makeover. It’s getting tougher than ever to pay up for pricey stocks. As I write, the S&P 500 is trading at 19.7 forward earnings — just below a 10-year high. Of course, that’s not to say that bargains can’t be found in the market or that some stocks haven’t earned a premium valuation. But as senior analyst Jonathan Rodriguez pointed out last week, the lack of volatility in the stock market presents investors a unique opportunity. He revealed a little-known trading strategy that helps investors bypass lofty stock valuations and significantly increase their returns over stocks, too. Today, he’ll dive even deeper and show you exactly how to grab these gains… Ahead of the tape, Louis Basenese Chief Investment Strategist, Wall Street Daily Why Low Volatility Is Your Friend, Not Foe I’m sure you’re constantly hearing financial talking heads warning about the “dangers” of low market volatility (low vol). Granted, it’s true that investors should keep an eye on the force of market moves. But make no mistake, low vol offers far greater rewards than risks. One such reward is the stock replacement strategy. As you recall, this strategy uses long call options in place of stocks during periods of relative calm in the market. This strategy is incredibly useful for investors who want to cash in stock gains near a market top — but still want exposure to any potential upside. It’s also great for investors who want to forcefully multiply their returns on stock moves. Either way, now is the perfect time to implement the strategy. As I noted in last week’s column, there are two ways you can do it… An in-the-money (ITM) call option. (Current stock price is above the option’s strike price.) An out-of-the-money (OTM) call option. (Current stock price is below the option’s strike price.) Here’s what a stock replacement strategy might look like on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), which is well on its way to becoming the first $1 trillion company in history. Technique #1: ITM call Exclusive Content Trump's Set to Send this $0.24 Stock Exploding Higher! Investors in this tiny company will love Trump for what he’s about to do. This is your chance to turn $100 into a retirement fortune. But hurry... This entire situation will change after August 1. Click here for the details. Right now, Apple is trading around $154. The stock trades at about 15 times forward earnings but also at a whopping 3.5 times forward sales. That’s a 78% premium to the S&P 500 and 14% above Apple’s five-year average. But thanks to low market volatility, options on the stock are reasonably priced — if not a little on the cheap side. A quick look at an options chain will show you that ITM calls are more valuable than those that are out of the money. Without getting into the weeds of option pricing, this is because ITM calls have intrinsic value. If you execute a call option that’s in the money and purchase the shares, you can immediately turn around and sell them for a profit. Calls that are out of the money require the underlying stock to rise above the strike price before a trader earns a profit on the shares. Now, you may recall that I drew your attention to an option’s “delta” last week. Put simply, delta is the correlation between the price of an option and the price of the underlying stock. The more valuable an option is, the higher its delta will be. Why is a high delta important for call options? Well, the higher an option’s delta, the more closely it tracks the underlying stock’s moves… Take a Bigger Bite out of Apple The Apple $120 calls expiring in January 2018 presently cost about $35. This means that one option (a contract to purchase 100 shares of stock) runs investors $3,500. Compare that with buying 100 shares of Apple outright, which would cost $15,400. So the option represents an $11,900 discount to owning shares and leverages investors more than four times to the stock’s gains. But where does delta come in? Well, the options boast a delta of 0.92. So every $1 move in Apple’s shares would generate a move of about $0.90 for the call options — a very tight correlation. These calls break even at expiration as long as the stock remains above $155 ($120 strike price + $35 option premium). That’s just slightly higher than the stock is trading right now. With a move in the underlying shares to $191 — a mere 24% gain — the option doubles in value. Better still, using a 50% stop loss on the trade risks just $1,750 of capital with the option. Using the same stop on the stock would deliver a loss of $7,700. Not a bad way to juice your upside on stocks and lower your risk at the same time. OK, let’s recap… The chief advantage of ITM calls over OTM options is that ITM calls benefit from a higher delta. Meaning that they earn more for every uptick in the underlying stock. The key downside is that ITM options are significantly more expensive than OTM calls. However, investors are well compensated with a much higher reward-to-risk ratio. Next week, we’ll break down OTM calls in more detail.

"There is no way to monetize the watch whatsoever," he said. Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You SAN FRANCISCO: As Apple prepares to show off new features for the iPhone and other devices at its developer conference Monday, the company is grappling with an uncomfortable issue: Many of its existing features are too complicated for many users to figure out. At last year's conference, for example, Apple's top software executive, Craig Federighi, demonstrated how users could order food, scribble doodles and send funny images known as stickers in chats on its Messages app. The idea was to make Messages, one of the most popular apps on the iPhone, into an all-purpose tool like China’s WeChat. But the process of finding and installing other apps in Messages is so tricky that most users have no idea they can even do it, developers and analysts say. DoorDash, a food-delivery app that Federighi displayed on stage as a model of the new feature, dropped its Messages app for group orders a few months after releasing it because it drew little interest. "While we didn't end up moving forward with it, we're excited about other ways we’re making delivery faster and more efficient," Andy Fang, a founder of DoorDash and the company’s chief technology officer, said in a statement. A similar lack of enthusiasm among users and developers has limited adoption of the iPhone's 3-D Touch feature, where a long, hard press on an app sometimes offers additional options such as viewing an email without opening it. And sales of the Apple Watch have been hampered by the steep learning curve it requires of users, who must master pushing, turning and tapping various parts of the watch and a related iPhone app. "There's just so much stuff," said David de Min, chief executive of Velapp, a startup based in London. "They are trying to cram things in." Velapp has just released a video recording app that uses 3-D Touch to help users select the best parts of a video while recording it. But de Min said that few other developers were using the technology, in part because iPhone users were unaware of it. "It's not something you can really see," he said. "People don't understand it." Apple, which declined to comment for this article, makes many updates that are popular with users, from changes to the Siri voice assistant to automatically transcribed voicemail messages. At this year's Apple Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose, California, the company is expected to introduce improved Mac computers and iPads, software updates for all of its hardware and a voice-activated speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. With Apple adding fewer major features in recent years, customers have been slower to upgrade their devices. App developers are also pausing in what had been a race to embrace Apple's latest innovations. Eliran Sapir, chief executive of Apptopia, an analytics firm, said that new apps were being introduced at half the rate they were a year ago. Apple TV apps are hot, he said, but developers are fleeing Apple Watch. "There is no way to monetize the watch whatsoever," he said. The slow uptake of apps for Messages and 3-D Touch is evident in the numbers. There are 5,000 regular apps and 30,000 sticker apps for Messages, according to Randy Nelson, head of mobile insights at Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Only about 3,600 of the 2.5 million apps in the iOS app store promote their compatibility with 3-D Touch. "You get your new iPhone and you don't know that 3-D Touch and apps in Messages even exist," Nelson said. Although stickers account for 97 of the top 100 Messages apps, he said, some users are so confused that they post app reviews like, "I downloaded these Disney stickers. How do I use them?" That is not exactly in line with the simple "it just works" philosophy that Apple built its business on. Chalen Duncan, a graduate student in emerging media at the University of Georgia, was so frustrated by the interface for stickers and apps in Messages that he redesigned it and posted his version online. "At its core, it's a discoverability issue," said Duncan, who worked part time on Apple's telephone tech-support team during college and hopes to get a design job there in the future. "People just don’t know the stickers exist." He said he had to teach his friends how to install and use Messages stickers by sending them multiple screenshots. "A lot of people will think it's their fault, and it's really the designer's fault," he said. "People want apps to be easy to use."

Apple News Expected Soon Share This Tags Apple is expected to announce plans next week to make its Siri voice assistant work with a larger variety of apps, as the technology company looks to counter the runaway success of Amazon.com’s competing Alexa service. But the Cupertino, California, company is likely to stick to its tested method of focusing on a small amount of features and trying to perfect them, rather than casting as wide a net as possible, according to engineers and artificial intelligence industry insiders. Currently, Apple’s Siri works with only six types of apps: ride-hailing and sharing; messaging and calling; photo search; payments; fitness; and auto infotainment systems. At the company’s annual developer conference next week, it is expected to add to those categories. Some industry-watchers have also predicted Apple will announce hardware similar to Amazon’s Echo device for the home, which has been a hot-seller recently. Apple declined comment. But even if Siri doubles its areas of expertise, it will be a far cry from the 12,000 or so tasks that Amazon.com’s Alexa can handle. Apple vs Amazon The difference illustrates a strategic divide between the two tech rivals. Apple is betting that customers will not use voice commands without an experience similar to speaking with a human, and so it is limiting what Siri can do in order to make sure it works well. Amazon puts no such restrictions on Alexa, wagering that the voice assistant with the most “skills,” its term for apps on its Echo assistant devices, will gain a loyal following, even if it sometimes makes mistakes and takes more effort to use. The clash of approaches is coming to a head as virtual assistants that respond to voice commands become a priority for the leading tech companies, which want to find new ways of engaging customers and make more money from shopping and online services. Siri vs Alexa Now, an iPhone user can say, “Hey Siri, I’d like a ride to the airport” or “Hey Siri, order me a car,” and Siri will open the Uber or Lyft ride service app and start booking a trip. Apart from some basic home and music functions, Alexa needs more specific directions, using a limited set of commands such as “ask” or “tell.” For example, “Alexa, ask Uber for a ride,” will start the process of summoning a car, but “Alexa, order me an Uber” will not, because Alexa does not make the connection that it should open the Uber. After some setup, Alexa can order a pizza from Domino’s, while Siri cannot get a pie because food delivery is not — so far — one of the categories of apps that Apple has opened up to Siri. “In typical Apple fashion, they’ve allowed for only a few use cases, but they do them very well,” said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, maker of an intelligent assistant app. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company does not comment on its plans for developers. Amazon said in a statement: “Our goal is to make speaking with Alexa as natural and easy as possible, so we’re looking at ways to improve this over time.” Side dish, not entree Apple’s narrower focus could become a problem, said Matt McIlwain, a venture capitalist with Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group. The potential of Apple’s original iPhone did not come to light until thousands of developers started building apps. McIlwain said he expects Apple to add new categories at its Worldwide Developers Conference next week, but not nearly enough to match Alexa’s number of skills. “To attract developers in the modern world, you need a platform,” McIlwain said. “If Apple does not launch a ‘skills store,’ that would be a mistake.” Neither Siri nor Alexa has a clear path to making money. Siri works as an additional tool for controlling traditional apps, and Apple pays money to owners of those apps. Alexa’s skills are free, and developers are not paid. At the moment, because of their limits, voice apps are “a side dish, not the entree,” according to Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

Apple declined comment. — Reuters picSAN FRNCISCO, June 3 — Apple Inc is expected to announce plans next week to make its Siri voice assistant work with a larger variety of apps, as the technology company looks to counter the runaway success of Amazon.com Inc’s competing Alexa service. But the Cupertino, California company is likely to stick to its tested method of focusing on a small amount of features and trying to perfect them, rather than casting as wide a net as possible, according to engineers and artificial intelligence industry insiders. Currently, Apple’s Siri works with only six types of app: ride-hailing and sharing; messaging and calling; photo search; payments; fitness; and auto infotainment systems. At the company’s annual developer conference next week, it is expected to add to those categories. Some industry-watchers have also predicted Apple will announce hardware similar to Amazon’s Echo device for the home, which has been a hot-seller recently. Apple declined comment. But even if Siri doubles its areas of expertise, it will be a far cry from the 12,000 or so tasks that Amazon.com’s Alexa can handle. The difference illustrates a strategic divide between the two tech rivals. Apple is betting that customers will not use voice commands without an experience similar to speaking with a human, and so it is limiting what Siri can do in order to make sure it works well. Amazon puts no such restrictions on Alexa, wagering that the voice assistant with the most “skills,” its term for apps on its Echo assistant devices, will gain a loyal following, even if it sometimes makes mistakes and takes more effort to use. The clash of approaches is coming to a head as virtual assistants that respond to voice commands become a priority for the leading tech companies, which want to find new ways of engaging customers and make more money from shopping and online services. Path to the money Now, an iPhone user can say, “Hey Siri, I’d like a ride to the airport” or “Hey Siri, order me a car,” and Siri will open the Uber or Lyft ride service app and start booking a trip. Apart from some basic home and music functions, Alexa needs more specific directions, using a limited set of commands such as “ask” or “tell.” For example, “Alexa, ask Uber for a ride,” will start the process of summoning a car, but “Alexa, order me an Uber” will not, because Alexa does not make the connection that it should open the Uber “skill.” After some setup, Alexa can order a pizza from Domino’s, while Siri cannot get a pie because food delivery is not — so far — one of the categories of apps that Apple has opened up to Siri. “In typical Apple fashion, they’ve allowed for only a few use cases, but they do them very well,” said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, maker of an intelligent assistant app. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company does not comment on its plans for developers. Amazon said in a statement: “Our goal is to make speaking with Alexa as natural and easy as possible, so we’re looking at ways to improve this over time.” Side dish, not entree Apple’s narrower focus could become a problem, said Matt McIlwain, a venture capitalist with Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group. The potential of Apple’s original iPhone did not come to light until thousands of developers started building apps. McIlwain said he expects Apple to add new categories at its Worldwide Developers Conference next week, but not nearly enough to match Alexa’s number of skills. “To attract developers in the modern world, you need a platform,” McIlwain said. “If Apple does not launch a ‘skills store,’ that would be a mistake.” Neither Siri nor Alexa has a clear path to making money. Siri works as an additional tool for controlling traditional apps, and Apple pays money to owners of those apps. Alexa’s skills are free, and developers are not paid. At the moment, because of their limits, voice apps are “a side dish, not the entree,” according to Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Amazon was wise to not commit to an economic model at such an early state, Etzioni said. “Once a successful economic model for developers emerges, people are going to gravitate to it.” — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Smart cities to take centre stage at CES 2018 Snapchat’s ‘Spectacles’ go on sale in Europe A new era for Nokia Apple set to expand Siri, taking different route from Amazon’s Alexa (VIDEO) Five powerhouse gaming PCs seen at Computex 2017 A new era for Nokia Will Samsung's new notebooks write a new chapter?

The technology giant’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) begins on Monday, where chief executive Tim Cook could also reveal a new iPad and additions to the MacBook laptop and Mac desktop computer lines. Reports claim the Cupertino-based firm may also use the event to introduce a smart home speaker featuring its virtual assistant Siri, designed to compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home. The voice-activated hubs have become extremely popular with consumers, and rival Microsoft has already revealed plans to enter the market with a speaker containing its own virtual assistant, Cortana. Cook will deliver the keynote address to open the event, which traditionally is used to discuss forthcoming updates to iOS, which powers the iPhone and iPad, as well as desktop computer operating system MacOS. The updates often provide a preview of what to expect from Apple’s next iPhone – due to be announced in September and which will mark the 10th anniversary of the phone’s launch. Rumours have also suggested a new line of Mac desktop computers and an update to the MacBook laptop could be discussed. Updates to the Apple Watch, including possible new health and fitness tracking features, are also likely to be among the announcements in California.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Science & Health Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Apple iPhone 8 is still months away, but Samsung and LG are already scared of it Launches of new Galaxy S8 and LG G6 variants suggest that Apple's Korean rivals are already scared of the upcoming iPhone 8, which is still months away. Kukil Bora   June 3, 2017 12:20 IST Apple's iPhone 7 as seen on its official website.Apple The launch of Apple's iPhone 8 later this year will certainly set off a fierce battle in the premium smartphone segment. But, if a new report is to believe, the Cupertino-based tech giant has already won the mind game by apparently forcing two of its rivals to come up with new strategies in anticipation of a tough competition after the new iPhone is released worldwide. Multiple reports have indicated over the past few days that Samsung and LG are going to launch additional variants of their 2017 flagship smartphones. While Samsung recently said that it would introduce three new colour variants for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, LG is also reportedly planning to launch "Pro" and "Plus" variants of the LG G6 with upgraded onboard storage. According to The Investor, the two South Korean companies have decided to launch new variants of these handsets as they are gearing up for the upcoming iPhone 8, which is expected to feature exciting new features to take on Android competitors. Rumours are rife that Apple could introduce the iPhone 8, along with two upgraded versions of the iPhone 7, in September. Citing industry sources, The Investor report also said that "Rose Gold" would be one of the new colour options for both the Galaxy S8 handsets that are currently available in five colours, including black and gray. The company is also likely to launch a refurbished version of the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 sometime this month. The LG G6 device is displayed at the LG stand at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, March 1, 2017.REUTERS/Paul Hanna When it comes to LG, the company is said to be preparing for the launch of new 32GB and 128GB variants of the G6, in addition to the existing 64GB model. The new variants are expected to be launched later this month. A radically-designed iPhone 8 The iPhone 8, which will mark the 10th anniversary of the Apple smartphone, is highly expected to feature a radical redesign, with an edge-to-edge display shunning the top and bottom bezels. If turns out to be true, the new design will also allow Apple to ditch the traditional physical home button and have the Touch ID fingerprint sensor built directly into the display. New iPhone 8 renders leaked in CAD file With an edge-to-edge display, the iPhone 8 is expected to be similar in size to the 4.7-inch iPhone, but with a larger OLED display measuring 5.5-inch. Some reports have also suggested that the new device could feature a 5.8-inch display while offering 5.15 inches of it as usable area and leaving the rest for virtual buttons. With a 10-nanometer A11 chip, the iPhone 8 is also likely to be much faster than its predecessor. The device is also speculated to come with additional features like wireless charging and biometric capabilities like facial and gesture recognition. The iPhone 8 could also include significant improvements in terms of cameras. Rumours have it that the phone's front-facing camera may include 3D sensing capabilities while there could also be a vertically positioned dual camera setup on its back. However, all these are pure speculation as Apple hasn't made anything official about its next-generation iPhone. Let's wait for the company to make the iPhone 8 official to see how many of these rumoured features actually make it to the device. Stay tuned for more updates!

But the Cupertino, California company is likely to stick to its tested method of focusing on a small amount of features and trying to perfect them, rather than casting as wide a net as possible, according to engineers and artificial intelligence industry insiders. Currently, Apple's Siri works with only six types of app: ride-hailing and sharing; messaging and calling; photo search; payments; fitness; and auto infotainment systems. At the company's annual developer conference next week, it is expected to add to those categories. Some industry-watchers have also predicted Apple will announce hardware similar to Amazon's Echo device for the home, which has been a hot-seller recently. Apple declined comment. But even if Siri doubles its areas of expertise, it will be a far cry from the 12,000 or so tasks that Amazon.com's Alexa can handle. The difference illustrates a strategic divide between the two tech rivals. Apple is betting that customers will not use voice commands without an experience similar to speaking with a human, and so it is limiting what Siri can do in order to make sure it works well. Amazon puts no such restrictions on Alexa, wagering that the voice assistant with the most "skills," its term for apps on its Echo assistant devices, will gain a loyal following, even if it sometimes makes mistakes and takes more effort to use.The clash of approaches is coming to a head as virtual assistants that respond to voice commands become a priority for the leading tech companies, which want to find new ways of engaging customers and make more money from shopping and online services. Path to the money Now, an iPhone user can say, "Hey Siri, I'd like a ride to the airport" or "Hey Siri, order me a car," and Siri will open the Uber or Lyft ride service app and start booking a trip. Apart from some basic home and music functions, Alexa needs more specific directions, using a limited set of commands such as "ask" or "tell." For example, "Alexa, ask Uber for a ride," will start the process of summoning a car, but "Alexa, order me an Uber" will not, because Alexa does not make the connection that it should open the Uber "skill." After some setup, Alexa can order a pizza from Domino's, while Siri cannot get a pie because food delivery is not - so far - one of the categories of apps that Apple has opened up to Siri. "In typical Apple fashion, they've allowed for only a few use cases, but they do them very well," said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, maker of an intelligent assistant app. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company does not comment on its plans for developers. Amazon said in a statement: "Our goal is to make speaking with Alexa as natural and easy as possible, so we're looking at ways to improve this over time." Side dish, not entree Apple's narrower focus could become a problem, said Matt McIlwain, a venture capitalist with Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group. The potential of Apple's original iPhone did not come to light until thousands of developers started building apps. McIlwain said he expects Apple to add new categories at its Worldwide Developers Conference next week, but not nearly enough to match Alexa's number of skills. "To attract developers in the modern world, you need a platform," McIlwain said. "If Apple does not launch a 'skills store,' that would be a mistake." Neither Siri nor Alexa has a clear path to making money. Siri works as an additional tool for controlling traditional apps, and Apple pays money to owners of those apps. Alexa's skills are free, and developers are not paid. At the moment, because of their limits, voice apps are "a side dish, not the entree," according to Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Amazon was wise to not commit to an economic model at such an early state, Etzioni said. "Once a successful economic model for developers emerges, people are going to gravitate to it."

When Kenneth Apple was questioned, he also lied and said he could not recall the owner of the company that won the micro-dairy contracts. “Kenneth Apple intentionally misled us,” Pollack said. Apple was indicted in December 2015 for wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the U.S., obstruction of justice, and making false statements. In July 2016, a federal jury in Virginia found him guilty on eight of nine charges. Evidence at trial showed that the micro-dairy units did not meet Iraqi Ministry of Health requirements, which was Apple’s responsibility. Last month, Apple was sentenced to 50 months in prison and ordered to pay approximately $2 million in restitution and forfeit more than $550,000. In November 2015, Apple’s son pleaded guilty to his role in the scheme and cooperated with authorities, testifying against his father in court. Special Agent Josh Lovett, also part of the investigative team—along with the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command—noted that one of the worst aspects of the case was that the micro-dairies could have benefited the Iraqi people. “The Iraqis were all for this,” he said. “They put up a substantial amount of money to get these micro-dairy systems and to train their people to use them.” But because of the fraudulent manner in which the contracts were awarded, and the company’s failure to meet Iraqi Ministry of Health requirements, the dairy devices were never used. “There was actually a company in Iraq that could have done this work,” Lovett said. “And this contract could have helped them. But it never happened because of the fraud.”     Print       Email Published: 21 hours ago on June 3, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: June 3, 2017 @ 6:31 pm Filed Under: English, FBI, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Intelligence, MIL OSI, MIL Security Intel OSI, Open Source Intel, Security, Security Intelligence, United States of America NEXT ARTICLE → FBI Deploys Cyber Experts to Work Directly with Foreign Partners ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE Joint Cyber Operation Takes Down Avalanche Criminal Network About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts Statement from the Mayor on London terror attack Paris climate agreement ‘still best avenue’ for solutions, says Forum SPC – No watches are valid as of Sun Jun 4 02:42:02 UTC 2017 SPC – No MDs are in effect as of Sun Jun 4 02:42:02 UTC 2017 SPC Jun 4, 2017 0100 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook © 2017 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

It's trickier than I'd like, but doable. When Apple redesigned the iPhone and iPad's Music app to focus on your music collection, iCloud Music Library, and Apple Music, it removed all traces of a previously-highly-placed item: iTunes.   Yes, streaming music is all the rage, and for good reason — with offline play and customized playlists, your music library is bigger and more interesting than ever before. But if you still like occasionally owning music, the iTunes app is where you'll do your purchasing. One frustrating side-effect of this change: It's now much more difficult to buy a song you've found and love on Apple Music. There's no direct way to "Open in iTunes," even if a song or album isn't supported in Apple Music at all. (I see you, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1.) Instead, when you stumble across non-streamable media in the Music app, you'll be greeted with a depressing alert informing you of its unavailability on your device. Rather than having to manually open the iTunes app and search every time you want a song, however, there's an easier way — all thanks to a few enterprising folks on the Internet. How to open an Apple Music song in iTunes (the easy way) If you own the Workflow app, you need only install a quick and easy workflow to make this happen. On your iPhone, open the Open in iTunes Store workflow (courtesy the Workflow Gallery). Tap Get Workflow. Select Open. Press Done. Open the Music app and navigate to the song you'd like to open in iTunes. Firmly press on the song to open its 3D Touch menu (or tap on the song, then tap the More (…) button). Tap Share Song. If you've never used workflow before, tap the More (…) button at the bottom of the screen, then enable the Run Workflow switch and press Done. Press the Run Workflow button. Press the Open in iTunes Store button. If it's your first time using this workflow, you may have to press Run Workflow to give the app permissions, then return to step 6. Your song should open in iTunes. Once you've gone through this once, you can open any future Apple Music songs in iTunes by doing the following: Open the Music app and navigate to the song you'd like to open in iTunes. Firmly press on the song to open its 3D Touch menu (or tap on the song, then tap the More (…) button). Tap Share Song. Press the Run Workflow button. Press the Open in iTunes Store button. Your song should open in iTunes. How to open an Apple Music song in iTunes (the hard way) If you don't want to mess around with Workflow (though we highly recommend it), you can essentially do this manually: Open the Music app and navigate to the song you'd like to open in iTunes. Firmly press on the song to open its 3D Touch menu (or tap on the song, then tap the More (…) button). Tap Share Song. Press the Copy button. Open Safari. In the URL bar, paste the copied link and add the following text: &app=iTunes. Press Open. The song should display in the iTunes Store. How to open an Apple Music song in iTunes — or just about any other streaming service If it's not just iTunes you're looking to connect with, but other streaming services, you can use Matt Abras's free SoundShare app to make that happen. SoundShare uses Facebook to connect multiple different services together; once set up, you can access iTunes with the click of a button. SoundShare - Download now! Questions?  Let us know below.

Should you jailbreak your iPhone? By Russell Holly Friday, Jun 2, 2017 at 10:00 am EDT 21 Comments Russell is a Contributing Editor at iMore. He's a passionate futurist whose trusty iPad mini is never far from reach. You can usually find him chasing the next tech trend, much to the pain of his wallet. Reach out on Twitter! Jailbreaking is absolutely still a thing, but is it a thing for you? There are a couple of good reasons people consider jailbreaking an iPhone. Maybe you've upgraded to the next model and the previous iPhone is still good enough to play with, or you saw a YouTube video with a cool feature you can only get by jailbreaking. Whatever the reason, there's usually a moment right before you look up how to jailbreak your iPhone where you consider whether it's something you should actually be doing. This FAQ is for that moment when you are faced with whether you should or should not risk the unknown and jailbreak your phone. Here's everything you need to know about making that decision! What exactly is jailbreaking? Basically, it's a process that allows you to modify parts of the operating system Apple does not allow you to modify. With a jailbroken iPhone, you can install apps and mods from third-party repositories that allow you to change the size of your apps on the homescreen, tweak the colors of iOS menus to suit your liking, and even control the kind of information that is sent from your phone when interacting with other apps. Why aren't these things in the App Store? Apple has very specific rules about how apps are allowed to behave on your iPhone in order to be allowed into the App Store. If you want an app that shows a countdown to WWDC on your lockscreen, Apple would not allow it in the App Store because that app modifies a part of iOS that Apple thinks shouldn't be modified. In the past, jailbroken apps have become so popular that Apple has added those features directly into the OS as a way of encouraging people to avoid jailbreaking. Apple can't, or won't, do this for every jailbreak app. So, there are respositories full of unique features that you can only get on your iPhone if you are willing to jailbreak it. Do all of my normal apps still work? For the most part, yes. Remember, iOS apps are largely built as individual things without a lot of shared resources. It's one of the ways Apple has been able to guarantee a certain level of security in iOS for so long. That having been said, there are jailbreak apps designed to modify other third-party apps and those can occasionally break things. Sometimes developers implement protections which render their apps inoperable if specific jailbreak mods are detected, which is occasionally difficult to understand and work around. How can I tell if my phone can be jailbroken? The big thing to look for when it comes to jailbreaking is your iOS version. Every iPhone gets notifications to install the latest version of iOS when it is available, and those latest versions usually include new security from Apple to prevent whatever was being used previously to cause a jailbreak to happen. Currently, the iOS version that can be jailbroken is 10.2. If you have a version higher than this without a backup to a previous version of iOS saved somewhere, you will not be able to jailbreak your phone at this time. What about my iPad? Yes! You can jailbreak an iPad, an iPod, and an iPhone with the same basic experience. It's worth pointing out there are significantly more jailbreak apps and mods made with the iPhone form factor in mind, so like the App Store not everything on the iPhone looks great on the iPad or iPod. All you really need to do is explore! Is jailbreaking dangerous? Any time you modify an operating system and intentionally subvert Apple's policies for keeping you safe, you're taking a risk. Using jailbroken apps aren't like using App Store apps, because Apple isn't policing these repositories to guarantee your safety. If they're policed at all, it's by individual users. Basically, jailbreaking is a trust exercise. You are trusting the people building these apps and mods to have your best interests at heart, and with that kind of trust comes obvious risks. You aren't automatically at risk if you jailbreak, but you are actively disabling things that had previously been keeping you safe. So should I do this or not? Ultimately, deciding to jailbreak comes down to answering a handful of questions for yourself. Are you somewhat disillusioned with your iPhone and the way it works? Do you enjoy tinkering with new apps and possibly unfinished features? Are you technically minded enough to fix something on your phone if it breaks? If you answered yes to these three questions, jailbreaking is something you'd probably enjoy and you should go check it out. Make absolutely sure you have a backup of your current iPhone setup somewhere just in case you need to go back to the way things were, and then go have a blast! Any questions?

Reader comments Should you jailbreak your iPhone? 21 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating Planetary Paul In principle, when you break your iOS device you're on your own regarding security on your device. You have to ask yourself: Am I that good at security to keep myself immune from any attacks I just opened my door for? 0 2 days ago Reply GreenDize12 Been jailbreaking since iPhone OS 3.2 (iPad), and iOS 4.0.1 (iPhone), and I have yet to encounter security issues Rene the Conspiracy theorists overreacts about.

No need for a risky jailbreak. 0 2 days ago Reply DannyJJK There's nothing risky about Jailbreaking, as long as you don't download anything strange (which follows with using your Mac or Windows computer as well) 0 11 hours ago Reply lkrupp If you see yourself as “needing” to jailbreak just go over to Android and stop the posturing and chest thumping. iOS is not for you. 0 2 days ago Reply tjolley11 100% disagree. Much prefer iOS over Android for a host of reasons, but Apple is being obstinate on many issues for no other reason than they can. I absolutely will NOT use iOS unless it is jailbroken. Here are a list of incredible useful 'jailbreaks' that virtually every iOS user would love to have and use every day if they could, and there is no reason Apple can't add them at any time: 1. Folders within folders. Really Apple? No nesting of folders? Why not? I only want a single folder for 'Games', but I want to be able to have them further broken down by categories - like board, card, action, etc. I don't want 10 screens of games, when a single screen of folders within a games directory will do. Oh! And let me choose how many mini-icons to display on that folder please. Your insistence on trying to show 9 really small icons is a hideous disaster. Let me only show 1, 2 ,4 representations of what is in the folder. 2. Let ME choose the number of rows and columns on my home page. Thanks. I like 5 columns and 6 rows on my home screen. In conjunction with folders within folders, I have everything on a single screen 3. Let ME choose how many items to have in my dock. I find 7 to be a good number for me 4. Actually USE force Touch for folders. I use an app that lets me use force touch on folders and it pops up the first 4 apps inside the folder (Number can be set). So I am able to place my 4 most-used apps at the top of a folder, then Force Touch the folder and launch the app. Much quicker than tapping into the folder and launching. 5. Force touch to clear all notifications. What a concept. Let me use force touch on notification screen to clear ALL notifications at once. 6. Date in Status Bar. Really? I have to Jailbreak to do this STILL? 7. Detailed Battery usage. Really? jailbreak for such simple and meaningful information? 8. Kill all background apps with a single tap. Yes, you DO need to kill background apps a lot - there are a lot of poorly written apps. A simple way to kill them all is a big time saver. 9. iTouch throughout the OS. No-brainer. too bad you can only use your finger print for passwords throughout the OS and across apps by jailbreaking 10. Guest user account. Great way to let others use your phone while also securing your private info. Easy to do. Apple won't do it, Jailbreakers will. And the list goes on. There are amazing things you can do to make your phone work so much better and faster that Apple could easily implement but won't. 0 2 days ago Reply libra89 Excellent comment! I seem to always miss the jailbreak window every time I think about doing it. Such a bummer. 0 2 days ago Reply DannyJJK Just keep up to date with Twitter feeds or similar, then you'll know as soon as 0 11 hours ago Reply Derrick4Real Sounds like a perfectly reasonable response if those things are important to you. Me however, there isn't anything you've mentioned in that list that has been a concern for me. I guess I simply don't care enough about those things. Now that ******, Music app that's just convoluted eyecandy for people that don't have lots of music and want to be sold expensive streaming services? Yeah, that app i fricken hate.

But the Cupertino, California company is likely to stick to its tested method of focussing on a small amount of features and trying to perfect them, rather than casting as wide a net as possible, according to engineers and artificial intelligence industry insiders. Currently, Apple's Siri works with only six types of app: ride-hailing and sharing; messaging and calling; photo search; payments; fitness; and auto infotainment systems. At the company's annual developer conference next week, it is expected to add to those categories. Some industry-watchers have also predicted Apple will announce hardware similar to Amazon's Echo device for the home, which has been a hot-seller recently. Apple declined comment. But even if Siri doubles its areas of expertise, it will be a far cry from the 12,000 or so tasks that Amazon.com's Alexa can handle. The difference illustrates a strategic divide between the two tech rivals. Apple is betting that customers will not use voice commands without an experience similar to speaking with a human, and so it is limiting what Siri can do in order to make sure it works well. Amazon puts no such restrictions on Alexa, wagering that the voice assistant with the most "skills," its term for apps on its Echo assistant devices, will gain a loyal following, even if it sometimes makes mistakes and takes more effort to use. The clash of approaches is coming to a head as virtual assistants that respond to voice commands become a priority for the leading tech companies, which want to find new ways of engaging customers and make more money from shopping and online services. PATH TO THE MONEY Now, an iPhone user can say, "Hey Siri, I'd like a ride to the airport" or "Hey Siri, order me a car," and Siri will open the Uber or Lyft ride service app and start booking a trip. Apart from some basic home and music functions, Alexa needs more specific directions, using a limited set of commands such as "ask" or "tell." For example, "Alexa, ask Uber for a ride," will start the process of summoning a car, but "Alexa, order me an Uber" will not, because Alexa does not make the connection that it should open the Uber "skill." After some setup, Alexa can order a pizza from Domino's, while Siri cannot get a pie because food delivery is not - so far - one of the categories of apps that Apple has opened up to Siri. "In typical Apple fashion, they've allowed for only a few use cases, but they do them very well," said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, maker of an intelligent assistant app. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company does not comment on its plans for developers. Amazon said in a statement: "Our goal is to make speaking with Alexa as natural and easy as possible, so we’re looking at ways to improve this over time." SIDE DISH, NOT ENTREE Apple's narrower focus could become a problem, said Matt McIlwain, a venture capitalist with Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group. The potential of Apple's original iPhone did not come to light until thousands of developers started building apps. McIlwain said he expects Apple to add new categories at its Worldwide Developers Conference next week, but not nearly enough to match Alexa's number of skills. "To attract developers in the modern world, you need a platform," McIlwain said. "If Apple does not launch a 'skills store,' that would be a mistake." Neither Siri nor Alexa has a clear path to making money. Siri works as an additional tool for controlling traditional apps, and Apple pays money to owners of those apps. Alexa's skills are free, and developers are not paid. At the moment, because of their limits, voice apps are "a side dish, not the entree," according to Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Amazon was wise to not commit to an economic model at such an early state, Etzioni said. "Once a successful economic model for developers emerges, people are going to gravitate to it."

(Make your mind up will you?) Going from Apple-powered devices to Google's platform is either ridiculously easy or rather taxing, depending on your current setup. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Do you Google? Good news if you're already heavily invested in the Google ecosystem on your iPhone. You can switch to Android in an hour or two and keep your evening free for seeing friends or browsing Netflix. Otherwise, better cancel those evening plans. Those of you who spend all your time in Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Maps for iOS can simply install those apps on your brand new Android device, sign in using your Google account credentials, and pick up where you left off. The same applies for Google Photos and Google Drive. Google Drive can handle contacts and calendars for you. Image: Google Unlike Apple, Google doesn't have a dedicated app to help you defect to its mobile OS, but it does have a website with a lot of the information you're going to need: essentially you're instructed to use Google Drive to copy over contacts, photos, videos and calendar entries, which we'll cover in more detail below. If you're thinking about switching from iOS to Android in the future, or like to swap mobile OSes on a regular basis, then Google's cloud-centric services make the task much easier — so your best off keeping all your data there. By contrast, the only official Apple app you can get on Android at the moment is Apple Music. Messages and emails Extricating yourself from iMessage is perhaps the biggest challenge facing those jumping ship to Android. iMessage doesn't work on Google's platform, and there's no way to export all your message history into a comparable Android app. You're going to have to say goodbye to iMessage, but you can at least ensure a clean break. As soon as you know you're making the move go into your iOS and navigate to Messages in Settings and turn iMessage off, then go to FaceTime in Settings and turn that off too. Apple's full instructions are here. If you have some precious iMessages or plain old SMSes you can't leave behind, you'll need to rely on third-party software and some rather convoluted processes to back it all up. iSMS2droid promises to import messages from an unencrypted backup you made in iTunes on your computer into Android. If you don't need the backup on your phone, then PhoneView (macOS) and CopyTrans (Windows) are two of many tools that will let you browse your old missives to your heart's content. It's goodbye to iMessage. Image: Screenshot As for emails, Apple's system supports IMAP, so you can carry on checking your iCloud emails through Gmail on Android if you're not having a fresh start and giving up your old email address completely. Tap the drop-down arrow on the Gmail app menu, choose Add account, and follow the configuration instructions provided by Apple. It's the same process if you're using any other kind of email app on your new Android device, like Outlook from Microsoft. The only requirement is that it supports the popular IMAP protocol. You have a couple of other options if putting your iCloud account directly into Gmail doesn't appeal. You can have all your Apple iCloud emails automatically forwarded to your new Gmail address, by going into iCloud Mail on the web and setting up forwarding — you can even delete the originals after they're passed on. Alternatively, you can export all your old emails using Mail on a Mac just in case you ever need them again, then close down your Apple account. Contacts and calendars As long as you just want to make a one-way, one-time switch from iOS to Android, then Google Drive for iOS makes the process of moving contacts and calendars over simple enough. Once you've got the app installed on your iOS device, open the menu then tap Settings and Backup. Choose the data you want to transfer across to the equivalent Google accounts, tap Start Backup and you're on your way — everything from iOS and iCloud gets picked up. Make sure you're on wi-fi, and the iPhone is plugged in during the switchover. Also note, that any previous backups you've done will be overwritten. macOS can help make switching calendars easier. Image: Screenshot If you want a two-way sync, which you might if you're using your Android phone with an Apple laptop, then it's a lot more complicated. The best option, really, is to switch to using Google contacts and calendars as much as you can, and then adding your Google account to the relevant apps in macOS (Add Account from the main app menu in both cases). Even then you need to make sure you're always adding events to the Google calendars (or contacts) and not the iCloud ones for them to show up on your phone. If you absolutely must keep both Google and iCloud services running concurrently, and syncing with each other, then you'll need to put your trust in a third-party app for macOS or Android. Photos and videos Since Google Photos came into the world it's actually pretty easy to get all your personal photos and videos moved over to Android, via Google's servers, as long as they're all still on your iPhone: Install Google Photos for iOS, opt to back everything up, and away you go. You can either pay Google for storage and keep everything at full resolution, or accept some resizing (images max out at 16 MP, videos at 1080p), and store as many photos and videos as you like on the web, free of charge. The process is even more straightforward if you use the Google Drive app as we described in the section above, and Google Photos even supports Live Photos these days, using those extra few frames of animation to create a GIF for you. The only negative is that the albums you've created in iOS don't get copied over (everything appears as one long list of pictures), so you need to create them again. Google Photos can transfer images and videos. (Image: Google) All that is easy enough but if you've got photos in iCloud you've moved off your iPhone then you might have a problem or two on your hands. As we explained in our full guide to the topic of switching between Apple Photos and Google Photos, just about the only option open to you is downloading them all from iCloud to a macOS or Windows machine then uploading them again using a Google Photos client. It's a little convoluted but it's manageable, and it's a lot easier than using the export options in iCloud on the web, which are practically non-existent. If you don't have a computer to act as the middleman between iCloud Photo Library and Google Photos then you're stuck — you'll have to borrow a laptop from someone. Music and movies As we now have Apple Music on Android, getting your iTunes music on your Android device is no longer the exercise in frustration it once was. As far as tunes you've actually purchased directly from iTunes, it's probably the best option out there, though you do need to have signed up for an Apple Music subscription to be able to use the app and get at your purchases. Otherwise, it depends on where your music is and how it's stored. Any plain old MP3s you were syncing to your iPhone from iTunes can be uploaded to Google Play Music instead (50,000 of them can be stored for free), or you can use something like DoubleTwist, which is just about the leading choice if you want to keep on using iTunes alongside Android for your music. If you're signed up for Spotify you just need the Android app. Apple Music, now on Android. Image: Screenshot Likewise, if you've been accessing all your movies and TV shows through Netflix, Plex or Google Play Movies & TV then you just need to find and install the relevant app for Android and you're ready to go. All these services let you stream to multiple devices from a single account, so you can carry on using your iOS device if you need to. However, any videos you've purchased from iTunes won't run on Android at all — there's just no app to do it unless Apple ever gets around to making one. Several tools out there will do the job of removing iTunes DRM for you, but since we're getting into murky legal territory with that, we'll leave you to discover them for yourself. If you've invested hundreds of dollars in an iTunes digital library then you can still watch it on macOS, Windows, and the Apple TV, but not Android. Apps and games Generally speaking, all the apps you use on your iPhone are going to be available on Android as well, though there are a few exceptions — like Overcast and Day One. In terms of paid-for apps, you're going to have to pay for them all again, unfortunately, though something like a Spotify subscription buys you access on both Android and iOS. Whether all your data (from documents to saved games) moves over with you is another matter and worth checking up on before you make the switch. If you're in any doubt, get in touch with the developer directly to see what the situation is (you might be out of luck with anything that relies heavily on the iCloud storage system). Some paid-for iOS games, like Alto's Adventure, are free to play on Android. (Image: Noodlecake Studios Inc) We can't give you a guide to everything out there, but think about your productivity, fitness, and banking apps. Assess how much data is stored locally and what's going to happen to it. If you can, keep your old iPhone and new Android phone running alongside each other for a while until you're certain everything's been moved over successfully without too many bumps in the road. You might not believe it if you've read everything that's above, but moving from iOS to Android is actually much easier than it used to be, thanks mainly to an increased focus on cloud services (even, belatedly, from Apple itself). As long as you take your time, and don't live your life inside iMessage, you don't have to feel daunted by the task. WATCH MORE: Tech News & Life Hacks Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

Ongoing secrecy around the NBN, a project that’s likely to cost more than A$50 billion, makes it impossible for the public in most cases to know when and what quality service they will receive. Further, new research shows the NBN rollout was politically motivated and socioeconomically biased from the beginning. It is perhaps time to remind ourselves of the ups and downs of the project that was once announced as a dream national infrastructure project for the 21st century. This requires a ten-year journey back in time, before we can figure out what needs to be done next.

More importantly, they’re speaking out. Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Disney’s Bob Iger, are just three top executives who have condemned the decision. The leaders of many of America’s biggest businesses have done the same. CEOs Think Trump Is Wrong On Thursday evening, Tim Cook tweeted: Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver. — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) June 2, 2017 In a letter to employees leaked to the press, Mr. Cook also said: I know many of you share my disappointment with the White House’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement. But it wasn’t enough. Elon Musk tweeted multiple times on the topic, including: Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 Mr. Musk had participated on two different presidential advisory councils on business. The same is true for Bob Iger, Disney’s CEO. He tweeted: As a matter of principle, I’ve resigned from the President’s Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal. — Robert Iger (@RobertIger) June 1, 2017 Mr. Iger followed that with a more formal statement issued under the Disney corporation: Protecting our planet and driving economic growth are critical to our future, and they aren’t mutually exclusive.  I deeply disagree with the decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and, as a matter of principle, I’ve resigned from the President’s advisory council. Corporate Entities Other business leaders publicly critical of the move include Jeff Immelt of General Electric, Lloyd Blankefeld of Goldman Sachs, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Brad Smith and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Jack Dorsey of Twitter, venture capitalist Mark Cuban, Aaron Levie of Box, Mark Benioff of Salesforce, Sundar Pichai of Google, Brent Saunders of Allergan, Kevin Plank of Under Armour. Laurene Powell Jobs—the widow of Steve Jobs—said before President Trump pulled out of the agreement that doing so would be a “colossal mistake.” IBM released a more general statement that it was committed to protecting the environment whether or not the U.S. pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement. HP, Intel, and Amazon did the same, as did Morgan Stanley. Even Shell Oil tweeted its support for Paris, while Conoco Phillips and ExxonMobil have supported the agreement beforehand. The Harvard Business Review listed another 15 or so companies who want the U.S. to stay in the agreement. President Trump frequently and loudly trumpets his business experience as a qualification for office. But many of the world’s top business people have condemned the decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement.

All it does is to provide cover for Trump to do whatever he wants. June 2, 2017 at 6:37 EDT PM mikefmiller June 3, 2017 Would be nice to see some real thinking by you guys. Paris had no real enforcement mechanism and was never ratified. Will let China and India continue spewing. When the “business leaders” care more for REAL CHANGE and not REAL PR maybe they can help. US develops and delivers the best technology for producing clean energy. Helping get foreign polluters to employ should be real goal. Apple and Tim have no legs to stand on promoting LGBTQ rights when they suck up to countries where persecution is still the law. Let’s see them refuse to sell product there. Otherwise they cede the moral ground. June 3, 2017 at 9:09 EDT AM Russ Hilton June 3, 2017 Well said mikefmiller. People should learn what is in the Paris accord before forming an opinion, but somehow the facts do not matter. Tim Cook should use Steve Jobs as an example, even though Steve Jobs was liberal he was more concerned with producing the best equipment possible. With the last debacle with Apple experiencing possible worst Macbook Pro’s after a four year wait, he needs to concentrate more on repairing the damage he has done to Apple’s reputation. I am waiting to see if the next offering is any better. I have a 2007 Macbook that still eats Microsoft for lunch and has never crashed or had a virus, which is normal for Mac’s. I believe they have no moral ground to stand on at Apple. June 3, 2017 at 10:57 EDT AM Fastflyer June 3, 2017 Rent seekers gotta do what they do. June 3, 2017 at 1:15 EDT PM MacTechFreak June 3, 2017 This is all a PR stunt by “Americas Smartest Business Leaders”. I know Mr Chaffin is not a fan of President Trump and this constant spewing of political agendas and ideas on Tech sites is really getting old. I don’t care about your political affiliation lets just write about and produce innovative tech. Not everyone buys into your ideas about climate change and other “so-called” world ending issues put together and pushed by Democrats. I really wish I could filter the writers on certain websites rather than having to choose to not read or support a great tech outlet like Macobserver because of such writers like Brian Chaffin. June 3, 2017 at 1:42 EDT PM Substance June 3, 2017 As others have said, if you pay any attention to the details of the Paris accords you will find that it has no teeth AND the only country making any sacrifices is the United States. It’s not only a terrible deal for the US in relation to the rest of the world, it admits that it could at best only make a 0.05 degree celsius impact on global mean temperatures by 2100. Not to mention that the US never officially agreed to the deal, that would require approval from the Senate, which never happened with the Paris accords. Trump is right to pull out of the Paris Accords (that we never actually joined). It gives the US leverage to get a better deal for the US, arguably a deal that actually helps the environment. That of course requires you to believe that man-made climate change dogma, which if you do even a little bit of your own research you’ll find is far from the slam dunk that it’s made out to be. June 3, 2017 at 6:00 EDT PM Lee Dronick June 3, 2017 Well I disagree with President Trump on this, this and most every decision of his though there has been or two things he gets right. During the campaign he talked about the financing of ISIS and how stopping it would help stop their actions; the problem is from my perspective is that some big players are laundering their money and making a big profit doing it. As to the businesses making statements about such matters. Well corporations are people too and as such they can say what we want regardless if others like it or not. June 3, 2017 at 8:17 EDT PM svanthem June 4, 2017 A cherry-picked MIT study. A president who wants to bring back the coal industry. Defunding of EPA. Real thinking indeed. June 4, 2017 at 8:40 EDT AM KennethLeeNJ June 4, 2017 I really am tiring of leftist political agenda advancement being disguised as Tech Journalism. America’s brightest business leaders? I don’t know how bright you have to be to throw away billions of dollars — paying off nations to continue polluting while you accept targets that hamstring our businesses and our economy. The pronouncements of “Climate Change is Real” are red herrings. One can believe in Climate Change and take steps to fight it (witness the US’s already significant reductions) without an ill-advised global agreement that stacks the deck against the US. This is, in reality, a TREATY….and Obama should never have entered into it without the approval of congress. Just another example of his attempts to ignore and thwart the constitution. The Tech Leaders Chaffin quotes are being just as ingenuous in addressing this matter as they are regarding H1B visas (flooding the market with job seekers from abroad to keep wages artificially low, and take jobs from qualified American citizens). June 4, 2017 at 9:26 EDT AM masterconductor June 4, 2017 No one is stopping these business from improving their carbon footprint. When did they need the government’s approval to pollute less? And so what? The Paris accord was non-binding, we could have stayed in and done diddly-squat–but it was signed, that’s the important part right? You know what would be far more effective? Apple, Microsoft, Goole, and Tesla get together and work with the power company to build a solar collector. Do they have the money for that? Yep. Could they do it. Yep. What do they really want? Government subsidies. And just so you don’t think that I am pro-fossil fuels–I don’t think any oil or gas company should be receiving any subsidies either (or any privately owned business for that matter). June 4, 2017 at 4:30 EDT PM Lee Dronick June 4, 2017 “No one is stopping these business from improving their carbon footprint.” Correct, no can stop them walking their talk. 👉 The company launched a massive clean energy program in October 2015. The goal was to convert all of its energy use in China to clean power sources. Apple clobbered past that goal and is now working toward 100% renewable energy worldwide. “In 2016, 96 percent of the electricity used at our global facilities came from renewable energy, reducing our carbon emissions by nearly 585,000 metric tons. We’re 100 percent renewable in 24 countries — and all of Apple’s data centers,” Lisa Jackson, Apple Vice president of environment policy, said in an annual letter released earlier this year. Jackson served as the administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency from 2009 to 2013.” June 4, 2017 at 5:02 EDT PM Lee Dronick June 4, 2017 D’oh! i forgot the link http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/22/technology/apple-clean-energy/index.html June 4, 2017 at 5:04 EDT PM Lee Dronick June 4, 2017 Well, they are not coal fired boilers: http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2017/04/23/exclusive-apple-backing-two-huge-oregon-renewable.html June 4, 2017 at 5:06 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

By: Reuters | Published:June 3, 2017 10:41 am Apple is betting that customers will not use voice commands without an experience similar to speaking with a human, and so it is limiting what Siri can do in order to make sure it works well. Related News Apple WWDC 2017: Look for signs when Tim Cook takes the stage Apple WWDC 2017: iOS 11 to Siri speaker, everything to be announced Apple WWDC 2017: Refreshed MacBooks, Siri-powered speaker, and more announcements expected Apple Inc is expected to announce plans next week to make its Siri voice assistant work with a larger variety of apps, as the technology company looks to counter the runaway success of Amazon.com Inc’s competing Alexa service. But the Cupertino, California company is likely to stick to its tested method of focusing on a small amount of features and trying to perfect them, rather than casting as wide a net as possible, according to engineers and artificial intelligence industry insiders. Currently, Apple’s Siri works with only six types of app: ride-hailing and sharing; messaging and calling; photo search; payments; fitness; and auto infotainment systems. At the company’s annual developer conference next week, it is expected to add to those categories. Some industry-watchers have also predicted Apple will announce hardware similar to Amazon’s Echo device for the home, which has been a hot-seller recently. Apple declined comment. But even if Siri doubles its areas of expertise, it will be a far cry from the 12,000 or so tasks that Amazon.com’s Alexa can handle. The difference illustrates a strategic divide between the two tech rivals. Apple is betting that customers will not use voice commands without an experience similar to speaking with a human, and so it is limiting what Siri can do in order to make sure it works well. Amazon puts no such restrictions on Alexa, wagering that the voice assistant with the most “skills,” its term for apps on its Echo assistant devices, will gain a loyal following, even if it sometimes makes mistakes and takes more effort to use. The clash of approaches is coming to a head as virtual assistants that respond to voice commands become a priority for the leading tech companies, which want to find new ways of engaging customers and make more money from shopping and online services. PATH TO THE MONEY Now, an iPhone user can say, “Hey Siri, I’d like a ride to the airport” or “Hey Siri, order me a car,” and Siri will open the Uber or Lyft ride service app and start booking a trip. Apart from some basic home and music functions, Alexa needs more specific directions, using a limited set of commands such as “ask” or “tell.” For example, “Alexa, ask Uber for a ride,” will start the process of summoning a car, but “Alexa, order me an Uber” will not, because Alexa does not make the connection that it should open the Uber “skill.” After some setup, Alexa can order a pizza from Domino’s, while Siri cannot get a pie because food delivery is not – so far – one of the categories of apps that Apple has opened up to Siri. “In typical Apple fashion, they’ve allowed for only a few use cases, but they do them very well,” said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, maker of an intelligent assistant app. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company does not comment on its plans for developers. Amazon said in a statement: “Our goal is to make speaking with Alexa as natural and easy as possible, so we’re looking at ways to improve this over time.” SIDE DISH, NOT ENTREE Apple’s narrower focus could become a problem, said Matt McIlwain, a venture capitalist with Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group. The potential of Apple’s original iPhone did not come to light until thousands of developers started building apps. McIlwain said he expects Apple to add new categories at its Worldwide Developers Conference next week, but not nearly enough to match Alexa’s number of skills. “To attract developers in the modern world, you need a platform,” McIlwain said. “If Apple does not launch a ‘skills store,’ that would be a mistake.” Neither Siri nor Alexa has a clear path to making money. Siri works as an additional tool for controlling traditional apps, and Apple pays money to owners of those apps. Alexa’s skills are free, and developers are not paid. At the moment, because of their limits, voice apps are “a side dish, not the entree,” according to Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Amazon was wise to not commit to an economic model at such an early state, Etzioni said. “Once a successful economic model for developers emerges, people are going to gravitate to it.” More Related News Apple expands Swift Playgrounds, its educational coding app to robots, drones Donald Trump pulls US out of Paris climate deal: Elon Musk to Tim Cook, top reactions from tech CEOs For all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App Tags: Apple Apple WWDC 2017 Siri No Comments.

But smartwatches are part of a crowded and competitive market, and some brands have fallen away, such as the Microsoft Band or the discontinued Moto 360. Many high-end smartwatches have sought to emulate the success of fitness trackers, offering abilities such as heart rate monitoring, GPS and water resistance. Others have gone down a luxury route, trying to match the style of traditional timepieces. The Telegraph has broken down some of the best smartwatches for different uses to help pick a timepiece that is right for you. Should I buy a smartwatch? There has never been a better time to buy a smartwatch. Many of the teething problems in the technology have been dealt with and smartwatches have now moved beyond early adopters to become a genuine tech and style statement. The best smartwatches rival cheaper sports watches for fitness tracking performance, although you can still find good deals on the popular Fitbit and Garmin devices.  And smartwatches offer significantly to levels of connectivity with your smartphone, from answering calls to voice control, while more advanced models can offer 4G connection and contactless payments. Which smartwatch operating system is best? There are three main smartwatch operating systems, most of which offer similar capabilities but with some distinctions. Given that your smartwatch will spend lots of its time connected via Bluetooth to your smartphone, you will want to make sure you have a degree of cross compatibility, although most operating systems now work with all smartphones, whether they run on Android or iOS. WatchOS: The latest WatchOS 3 for Apple smartwatches is lightning fast with upgraded fitness apps and useful features such as theatre mode (which stops your watch waking up accidentally). It is a great system, but is best used alongside and iPhone. Android Wear: The 2.0 edition of Android Wear was a step up  with new functions including Google voice control, Android Pay and the ability to make 4G calls. It is used on most new smartwatches. TizenOS: Used for Samsung smartwatches, it has an intuitive interface and design, but is best suited to Samsung devices. It does have 4G, but currently only in the US. Do I want to use my smartwatch for sport? When buying a smartwatch you will want to consider whether you want it as a fitness aid or a fashion statement. There are some differences between smartwatches and fitness trackers. Fitness trackers often have less functionality when it comes to reading and responding to texts or emails. But plenty of smartwatches are tailored for outdoorsy types and fitness fanatics, with step and calorie counters linked to your smartphone. If you want a smartwatch for sport you should also consider one with a more durable watch face, silicon straps and waterproofing. If you prefer a smartwatch as a style accessory plenty come with leather and other materials as straps, and there are a number of watch brands that now make smartwatches, although you will pay premium for the best materials. How much should I pay for a smartwatch? Realistically, a good budget smartwatch should cost around £100 to £150. Fitbit's Blaze is probably the best cheap smartwatch, although it is simple in design and doesn't have all the features of the Android Wear operating system. Mid-range smartwatches will run between £200 and £300. At this level you should be getting Android Wear 2 software or an Apple Watch. More expensive smartwatches of £300 and up will have voice control and luxury features such as deep waterproofing. Many will also be a fashion statement to compete with the best traditional brands. Bear in mind that this technology is still developing and, like your smartphone, you may end up having to replace your smartwatch every few years, unlike the lifetime of service you could get out of a traditional watch. Other things to look out for in a smartwatch: Screen size: A screen that is too small may be fiddly to use, a screen that is too large may be heavy and chunky. Some smartwatches come in more than one size to fit different wrists. Battery life:  This is the main sticking point for many smartwatch users. Battery life can vary hugely and is unimpressive compared to any normal watch. Ideally you want at least two days of charge with limited use, with regular use you may see a lot less. Processor and storage: Most smartwatches will have similar processors that do not make huge levels to difference to performance and many come with 4GB of storage as standard. Below are some of the best smartwatches you can buy now. The latest LG Watch Style has been left out as it has not yet been released in the UK, while the Moto 360 and Microsoft Band are also out as the manufacturers have put a hold on their smartwatch ranges. The history of wearable technology 01:26 Under £250 Sony Smartwatch 3 Credit: Sony Display: 1.6 inch Operating system: Android Wear Battery life: up to two days This impressive budget smartwatch filled in a lot of the gaps left by earlier cheap devices, fitting the bill on key smartwatch capabilities without compromising on price. This Sony watch has GPS, a compass, waterproofing, calls and 4GB of internal memory for storing music on the go and works with Android Wear for all the apps you need from Facebook notifications to emails. It has Google's voice control, although not the Google Assistant of more expensive brands and later updates to Android's operating system mean this watch could become less useful. It's also not the most stylish device compared to other brands. Pros: Cheap, GPS, compass, big screen Cons: Chunky design Price: £89.99 in green, £139.89 in black Buy now Fitbit Blaze Credit: Bloomberg Display: 1.25-inch Operating system: Fitbit software Battery life: up to 5 days Fitbit's Blaze is a useful little smartwatch idea at a great price. However, unlike other models it does lack the functionality of the Apple Watch or Samsung Gear, with few native apps, and with the Apple Watch proving such a good fitness tracking device the Fitbit has a lot of competition. But for almost £200 less than Apple's premium model, the Fitbit does punch above its weight. If all you need is simple tasks, such as answering or dismissing calls, all packed with Fitbit's activity tracking expertise this smartwatch is a good bet. Pros: Made for sport and running, sleep tracking, Fitbit app, battery life Cons: No voice control, limited smartwatch functionality Price: £139.95 with John Lewis, £159.99 with Fitbit Buy now Fossil Q Credit: Fossil Display: 1.4-inch Operating system: Android Wear 2.0 Battery life: 24 hours Updated with Android Wear 2.0, the new Fossil Q smartwatch can cover the ground you need with texts, alarm, calendar alerts and a fitness tracker, as well as an LED flashlight and Google voice control to perform some simple tasks. While it does have a nice traditional look, it is actually a very bulky watch on the wrist at around 14mm, while the average 24 hour battery life is not brilliant. The leather strap does make this watch quite attractive, but means it needs some protection from water and the elements. Pros: Traditional design, plenty of custom builds,  Google Assistant voice control Cons: Fairly limited battery life, chunky Price: £188. 72 with Amazon, £229 with House of Fraser Buy now Huawei Watch Credit: Huawei Display: 1.4 Operating system: Android Wear Battery life: one and a half days If you want a smartwatch that looks more like a traditional timepiece then the original Huawei Watch is still a great bet, and now comes in as a relatively budget option in the world of smartwatches. Compared to recent new releases such as the Samsung Gear S3 it is good value and was the best Android watch around on its initial release. You can choose between leather straps or stainless steel, however the leather option will be more vulnerable to water damage. It has a sharp, circular screen with high 400 x 400 resolution. It can also be upgraded to Android Wear 2.0, which will offer more Google voice control. Pros: Premium look and good screen quality Cons: Now two years old, not waterproofed Price: £219.99 Buy now Asus Zenwatch 3 Credit: Asus Display: 1.39-inch Operating system: Android Wear 1.5 Battery life: up to two days The Asus Zenwatch is a good looking device. With the option of leather straps and a bold, bright 1.39 inch face with 400 x 400 resolution it is easy to look at. It has reasonable fitness monitoring ability and can act as a mouthpiece for taking calls on your phone. However, the current lack of an Android Wear 2 update means there are many limits such as no Google Assistant voice commands (although it does support the simpler Google Now) and limited waterproofing.   Pros: Good looks and bright screen Cons: Lacking in latest operating system Price: £229 Buy now Under £300 Apple Watch Series 1 Credit: Bloomberg Display: 1.65-inch Operating system: watchOS Battery life: 18 hours regular use, up to two days While it does lack some of the more advanced features of the Series 2 such as extra waterproofing and GPS, the Apple Watch Series 1 is still a premium smartwatch. It has the easily navigable watchOS and the functionality of Siri, as well as Apple Pay. The Apple Watch is now also considered one of the top fitness watches you can buy, with intuitive fitness tracking apps and a heart rate monitor.  While Apple says its battery life should be 18 hours with regular use, most people will easily get two days out of the watch if you limit use to time checking and the odd workout. Pros: Almost as good as the Series 2, significantly cheaper Cons: Not as waterproofed and no GPS Price: £269 Buy now Samsung Gear S3 Credit: Samsung Display: 1.3-inch Operating system: Tizen Battery life: up to 4 days Samsung's latest Gear S3 watch has a classic look and plenty of features to make this a brilliant smartwatch. On this smartwatch you can rotate the bezel to perform tasks such as responding to calls or reading messages, although its touchscreen is slightly on the smaller side for a fairly large watch. It can also use S Voice for voice control to make a call or send a text, and it features Samsung Pay. It has GPS and a solid battery life, meaning you will only have to take it off for charging every few days. It comes in two designs with a rugged "frontier" version and a smart "classic" look. However, the Gear S3 does only have water resistance to a distance of 1.5 metres, limited compared to the Apple Watch Series 2. Pros: Great battery life, innovative bezel for quick functions, S Voice control Cons: Smaller screen and limited water resistance Price: £295.00 Buy now Huawei Smartwatch 2 Credit: Huawei Display: 1.2 inch Operating system: Android Wear 2.0 Battery life: up to two days Huawei's 2017 watch outing mirrors some of the design elements of the original Huawei Watch, although the availability of its "classic" design is currently limited in the UK. As well as standard apps, Google Assistant voice control and the ability to make Android Pay contactless payments, the Huawei Watch 2 is one step ahead with integrated 4G connectivity, allowing you to make calls directly from your watch away from your phone. Downsides include battery life which, for a watch that costs this much, is a little low. It is only splash resistant and lacks GPS functions that are part of its main rival in the Apple Watch Series 2. Pros: 4G option, classic look, voice control Cons: Limited water resistance, no GPS, expensive for 4G Price: £269 from Amazon (no 4G) £299 from Amazon (with 4G), £379 from Currys (with 4G) Buy now Luxury smartwatches Apple Watch Series 2 Credit: Bloomberg Display: 1.65-inch Operating system: watchOS Battery life: 18 hours regular use, up to two days The Apple Watch Series 2 is still one of the best smartwatches you can buy with tonnes of great features and running on the smooth watchOS. It has a brighter OLED (organic LED) display than its predecessor and is water resistant up to 50 metres. Other great features include a heart rate sensor, accelerometer and built-in GPS. It is, however, hit by a hefty price tag, and although the design appeals to some it is not the most stylish timepiece around. For something a little different you can pay more for a stainless steel case and metallic strap, but this pushes the price up to nearly £700. Pros: Water resistant, sharp screen, watchOS, GPS Cons: Expensive, battery life, no sleep tracking Price: £396 for aluminium case, £699 with stainless steel case and Milanese loop Buy now Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 Credit: TAG Heuer Display: 1.39 inch Operating system: Android Wear 2.0 Battery life: 25 hours with regular use Luxury Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer was never going to be the cheapest option. If you are willing to shell out more than £1,000 on a smartwatch then you can with the Connected Modular 45. It has a striking look, while its modular flexibility makes for great customisation, although this in a sense loses the more iconic look of some Swiss watches. It has GPS, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, although no 4G (which is likely to become standard on the more expensive smartwatches). It also has no heart rate monitor, making it a little less useful for fitness fans. If style is your main concern, the Tag Heuer ticks the boxes, but with smartwatches likely to keep evolving it may be too much of an investment just yet. Pros: Premium build and design Cons:  Price: £1,200 from Tag Heuer, £5,700 (with diamond studded bezel) Buy now Best technology you can buy grid   Share this article Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest Related Topics TAG Heuer Android Apple Watch Smartwatches Apple Show more Technology latest 05 Jun 2017, 12:01am Comment: As AI moves on, it's time for Apple's Siri to grow up James Titcomb Premium 04 Jun 2017, 11:13am When is WWDC 2017 and what will Tim Cook and Apple announce? 04 Jun 2017, 11:12am WWDC 2017: iOS 11 best features and release date, plus everything we know about Apple's new software 03 Jun 2017, 7:30pm Price comparison site Kelkoo takes Google to High Court over abuse of search dominance 03 Jun 2017, 6:00am The British scientists on the brink of changing the human race forever Premium 03 Jun 2017, 3:09am A wizard idea?

Back to the Future single-handedly turned the DeLorean into a collectible car. Scrubs made musician Colin Hay into a household name. And haven’t you always wanted to have what Meg Ryan was having in that scene in When Harry Met Sally? If you saw something in a movie or a TV show, there’s a good chance you’ll find it on one of these sites. Sure, some of it is sponsored product placement, like Apple’s efforts to make you buy its gadgets How Apple Owns Hollywood, and Makes You Buy Its Products How Apple Owns Hollywood, and Makes You Buy Its Products It seems that any film -- no matter what genre -- features an Apple product. In fact, Apple products constantly pop up in Hollywood movies. As we're about to explore. Read More . But so what? As long as it’s actually cool, let’s find out what that thing is. 1. Food: Binging With Babish Andrew Rea loves cooking. He also loves movies and TV shows. So, Rea started a YouTube channel where he recreates famous dishes from what he watches. And as the proverbial cherry on top, he named it Binging With Babish, after The West Wing‘s character Oliver Babish. Rea is brilliant at recreating the recipes. He pays attention to the description of these fictional items, like Eggs Wodehouse from Archer or Homer Simpson’s Moon Waffles. And then he sets about making it in his kitchen, with top-notch video production. Don’t watch this one on an empty stomach. Binging With Babish is not particularly helpful to help you learn how to cook.

Or maybe you want to look as hot as the cast of Suits. Actors have wardrobe specialists to dress them up, so if you want to imitate their style, head to one of these two sites. Both FilmGarb and Worn On TV have been around for some time now. While FilmGarb covers both movies and TV shows, Worn On TV is all about the idiot box. Of the two, Worn On TV is a bit better to browse. You can select the show you want, and even the characters from the show. That will give you a list of photos, and one click will take you to buy it.

If something from a movie caught your eye, chances are that FilmGarb will tell you the product and where to get it. 3.

TuneFind is a far more comprehensive database, covering almost any movie or TV show you can think of. It has also been around for a long time, and has an active community of users.

Cars: IMCDB Movies and TV shows have immortalized some cars in our memory, like the Gran Torino from Starsky and Hutch or James Bond’s Aston Martin DB5. But what about the lesser-known cars? Tom Hardy spent the whole of the movie Locke driving a car, but what car was it? What was Mr. Wolf driving in Pulp Fiction? And sometimes, you see a car in the background or a small scene, like the one Keanu Reeves commandeers in Speed. IMCDB can answer any car question from any film.

He provides unique big picture analysis of the complex world of Microsoft. Jason takes the small clues and gives you an insightful big picture perspective through storytelling that you won't find anywhere else. Seriously, this dude thinks outside the box. Follow him on Twitter at @JLTechWord. He's doing the "write" thing! Microsoft is one of the world's most recognized brands. Sadly that recognition has not translated into widespread consumer success. The company is part of the "background" of many of our lives. That's both a blessing and curse. The blessing is Microsoft's products and services help many of us get things done. The curse is that Microsoft's presence is often like the white noise used to lull people to sleep. Conversely, Apple and Google are like hit songs that are intentionally turned on, cranked up, and for which the lyrics are memorized and sung in sync with the artist. These companies are synced with consumers in a way Microsoft is not but needs to be. For instance, Microsoft's premiere product, Office, is the industry's status quo for productivity. It's how we get work done. But for many, it's an uninspiring and boring necessity. Apple's premiere product, the iPhone, and various phones running Google's Android, however, are fun. They make users feel good and are part of their personal expression. Apple and Google have what many call "cool factor." Microsoft? Well, it's getting there. Microsoft has money to burn, resources galore and is a globally recognized brand. Microsoft also ranked ninth in the 2016 Top 100 Millennial Brands: Moose Tracker Report. This was above number eleven ranked Google but below number one ranked Apple which is also the most valuable company. So why can't Microsoft seem to emerge from a position of background noise and leap to the forefront of what consumers want? The personal computing disconnect Personal computing is Microsoft's forte, and 88.75 percent of homes and businesses that use PCs use Windows PCs. That fact is a legacy of Microsoft's heyday when the company's PC dominance in the enterprise trickled into the consumer space. Smartphones are now the go-to "computer" for many personal computing tasks. Smartphones function as an access point to a horde of personal information making them the most personal object most of us carry. They're also the portal to the broader ecosystems of the providers of mobile platforms. This portal has helped Apple and Google, the two companies that dominate the mobile space, cement themselves in the collective minds of the masses. Daily, billions of users interact with Google's and Apple's ecosystems in ways that feel good and personal, not required and functional, which is often Microsoft's plight. Microsoft isn't oblivious to its poor consumer rapport. It's made multiple, but failed, attempts to bring its enterprise success to the consumer space. Microsoft flops: Kin, Kinect, Windows Phone and Zune Here are several areas where Microsoft failed in the consumer space. Microsoft Kin After two years of development and a strategic acquisition of Danger Incorporated, Microsoft in 2010 launched the social network-focused Kin smartphone. It was targeted at the trend-setting 18- to 30-year-old demographic. The phone was only on the market for 48 days when it was unceremoniously discontinued. It briefly returned as a cheaper but also unsuccessful feature phone. In-fighting within Microsoft resulted in the project falling under different leadership, a change in the original vision and a delay to market, and all of that is blamed for Kin's demise. Microsoft Zune Launched in 2006 Microsoft's Zune was the company's answer to Apple's iPod which launched five years earlier. Apple's significant lead continued with its 2007 launch of iPod Touch two years before the 2009 Zune HD. In addition to consumer mindshare, Apple garnered developer and other support which supplied Apple's ecosystem with millions of apps and accessories that supported the iPod's market position. Unable to compete, the Zune was discontinued in 2011, five years after its launch. Kinect Microsoft's Kinect, which used a natural user interface of motion-detecting and voice interaction was introduced in 2010 as part of Xbox 360. In 2011, the Kinect SDK was announced as well as the Kinect for Windows program. There was a lot of anticipation as hundreds of companies around the world had shown interest in building apps for Kinect. Though the Kinect 2.0 received deeper Universal Windows Platform (UWP) integration and Windows Hello capabilities late last year, the initial fervor for the myriad uses of the technology in various industries has significantly diminished. And the consumer-facing gaming aspects for Kinect have all but fizzled out. Windows Phone After an enduring presence in the enterprise-focused smartphone space since the early 2000s, Microsoft finally entered the consumer smartphone market three years after the iPhone and two years after Android in 2010. Windows Phones' fluid and unique OS never caught on with consumers. Limited marketing and distribution, "breaks" in the platform on its way to OneCore, poor developer support, a lack of inspiring flagships, and the buggy Windows 10 Mobile have been the platform's plight. A reputation for having no apps, the vocal discontent of disenchanted fans and consistently negative press have poisoned the waters for Windows phones among consumers. Windows phone isn't dead These flops and a history of early innovation with little to no consumer-facing follow through have hampered Microsoft's consumer success. Microsoft could have beat the iPad and Siri to market, for instance, based on early investments in tablets and AI. It's not all bad Microsoft introduced Xbox in 2001, and despite competition from Sony's PlayStation, unrelenting investments made it a consumer success. Similarly, unyielding commitment and drive turned the failing Surface into a category-defining (2-in-1 PCs) billion dollar business and one of the industry's most respected brands. TV marketing ads, network TV product placements (for example, Black-ish) and corporate partnerships such as the contract with the NFL position Surface beside Xbox in the consumer consciousness. Despite NFL commentators' references to Surface as an iPad, Microsoft is gaining "cool points." The Surface is still in a battle for "prime time," however. ABC News reporters "use" the Surface, kind of. Throughout the news segments, Surfaces remain untouched on the news desk, behind the iPads that the reporters actively use. Hopefully, Microsoft can get ABC to move from displaying Surfaces to using them on national television. Still, the brand has expanded to include the college student-focused Surface Laptop, and the Apple's creatives-stealing Surface Studio. The former has yet to be tested in the market, and the latter has piqued the interest of its intended target. Furthermore, Microsoft has added and will be bringing new features to Windows 10 such as Paint 3D, Mixed Reality, system-wide inking and more, which the company hopes will appeal to consumers. Microsoft's Mixed Reality wearable computer, HoloLens, is arguably the coolest product it has created. If it were ready for the consumer market, the company would doubtlessly be considered cool. Alas, the next iteration of HoloLens has been pushed out to 2019. Part of pop culture Despite Microsoft's Xbox and Surface success and potential with Mixed Reality, to the average consumer, the company doesn't occupy the same space as Apple or Google. As the leading search engine, "Google" has become a verb in our dialogue when it's time to, well, Google something. Apple's former CEO Steve Jobs through vision, standards for quality and marketing genius, imbued the company and its products with an intangible value that the media and consumers "feel" to this day. Additionally, movies about this iconic leader are an expression of the influence he and Apple had on the world. Microsoft needs to do more with its 'do-more' vision Microsoft doesn't have the pop culture appeal of Google and Apple. As a "do-more" company, it has focused on providing businesses and individuals with the tools to do more. Its enterprise-focused legacy has taught the company to exist "in the shadows" as the platform or infrastructure that helps others get things done. This mentality and associated marketing methods don't work in the sensory, in-your-face consumer space. Successful consumer-facing companies aggressively tell consumers why they need a product, how it'll improve their lives, and convince them it solves a problem they didn't know they had. Beyond Xbox and Surface, Microsoft lacks the aggression and stamina its rivals have in this regard. Microsoft leads in innovation but is slow to turn ideas into products, allowing competitors to beat it to market. The One Microsoft initiative was supposed to enable greater nimbleness by restructuring teams. That hasn't fully materialized. Microsoft's struggling to reach consumers at a point in history when personal computing has never been more consumer influenced. Will Microsoft have the aggression and stamina to market its student-focused Surface Laptop against the MacBook? What about Surface phone or a consumer-focused HoloLens? Sadly, until Microsoft is ready to "do more," it may always covet that elusive cool factor.

Millenials see Microsoft as a dinosaur. Just llke the PC revolution overtook old school IBM, the mobile generation has eclipsed the Windows generation at the consumer level. Kids use Chromebooks and Apple products at school, Android phones and iPhones. Students can bunde and over-priced Macbook into their student loans and over pay over time for their shiny fashion accessory. Xbox gets a pass because it isn't regarded as Windows to the console crowd, Windows means mom and dad doing their taxes or grandma on Facebook. Most of all Windows is associated with business and work, ugh, no one young and cool likes that. 0 1 hour ago Reply LaVike I'm not sure "cool factor" will do it.  Maybe "a clue" would!  MSFT doesn't get the consumer at all and does not cater to them.  Taking an Azure ad out in Business Weekly is what MSFT understands.  They don't understand how an "influencer" might be able to bring people into their fold much less have a strategic marketing campaign.  They have tried and some of their efforts have been very interesting but they don't stick with it.  Maybe a "set of cajones" might be needed more than "cool factor". 0 4 hours ago Reply cool8man The Microsoft Band 2.0 is a really cool little device. Apple Watch looks like a giant nerd watch by comparison, seriously I'm embarrassed whenever I see people wearing an Apple Watch. It just gives me flashbacks to calculator watches. The Microsoft Band is way better than a cheap looking Fitbit or Garmin fitness band too. Surface Studio is also cool, I just wish I could afford it. HoloLens isn't cool looking yet, but they are way ahead of the AR competition in design. If they switch HoloLens over to Snapdragon and can shrink it down to something more stylish they could have a major success on their hands. Much of the acceptance and cool factor of devices comes down to marketing. Surface Pro was sort of borderline in terms of design, but Microsoft's enormous $500M 5-year marketing budget and partnership with the NFL pushed Surface Pro into mainstream acceptance. If they get HoloLens into a more stylish design and convince the NFL to start using HoloLens on the sidelines you have a serious opportunity for Microsoft to mainstream another mobile computing product. 0 5 hours ago Reply bluekalo Nice article. Microsoft is not consumer centered 0 9 hours ago Reply TechFreak1 I would disagree about Windows phone not catching on with consumers, sure the gains in market share was slow but that's what happens when you cut off users and oems. Wp7->Wp8 kernel switch from CE. Wp8->WM10 loss of features that made Windows phone a joy to use. Plus US carriers didn't help the situation. Every where else Windows phone was gaining alot of momentum until Microsoft swung that massive axe to Nokia's D & S acquisition. Lastly, XES that was the gateway in making Microsoft "cool". But again lack of foresight and unwillingness to take risks by the management speaks volumes imo. Ballmer didn't bat and eye when he spent money maintaining consumers who had faulty xbox consoles (RRoD). Unrelenting investments is what made Bing, Xbox and Surface into what it is. They could have done the same with Windows Phones and XES.

I agree: if Microsoft took some cues from Apple and Google, they could have been more successful. The article overall? Mind...blown! 0 20 hours ago Reply mikedoeslife As has been noted here by a lot of people, the Microsoft and Windows brands are so heavily stigmatised by decades of allowing people to have the impression that the company's only goals were to turn us all into worker drones, and to make us use comparatively ugly interfaces with now iconic crash issues.  What Microsoft is doing these days is great stuff, but it needs to do some dramatic marketing and PR to really get people over the line. I'm really not sure MS can ever match Apple for cool factor, to be honest. After all, Jobs was considered a genius, and even though he was a **** person, he gave off this aura of utter coolness and driven focus. He had an exceptional aesthetic, and so much of Apple's history is steeped in the importance of consumer appeal. Microsoft has only started understanding that in the past 10 years at best.  Compare Jobs with the likes of Gates and Ballmer... yeah, Gates has proven to be one of the most incredibly respectable and thoroughly thoughtful people of his generation, but that doesn't change the fact that for decades he was seen as a bit of a knob.  Ballmer was a maniac, enough said there.  So, yeah. I don't know what Microsoft can do to win more fans, but... as much as "Apple is amazing omfg!" is ingrained in a generation of consumers, so is "eeeww Microsoft is for geeks". Not an easy thing to overcome.    0 1 day ago Reply Gregory Newman Folks Microaoft's bread and butter money comes from and still comes from it's  Buisiness/Enterprise services software. Ballmer failed to deliver mobile smartphones that sold well but Left Microsoft's Businees / Enterprise money making machine intact and it is growing in some area's such as it's cloud services. Microsoft itself seems to be going back to the Days of Windows phone 7 and 8 where it just made the softwre for Windows smart phones but it's OEM partners made the physical smartphones it appears for now Microsoft wil not make a classic shaped smart phone. it's OEM partner will do that. I think Microsoft's Mobile's Surface Mobile devices= The Surface laptop. Surface Book laptop/Tablet Hybrid and Surface Pro Tablet/Laptop Hybrids are where Microsoft will continuie to be successful. the Surface brand devices are a Billion dollar plus successful business for them. I think Microsoft will indeed produce a  2 screen Surface Mini Tablet / Smartphone hybrid. Indications are Microsoft has a special division of Windows 10 mobile to make it's interface design and Apps. I think this will be Microsoft's last new Hybrid device. I predict Microsoft will market them on a multi nation level like it did with the new Surface Laptop and new 2017 Surface Pro and sell enough of them on a World wide basis to make a profit. This device will not be for everyone but will sell well enough to survive because a lot of people world wide want a smart good Windows Tablet. I hope how they market this new 2 screen Mini tablet smart phone hybrid as a small fun filled consumer Music/Video media player, Mini Busisness production Tablet & Smartphone 3 in one device. It will be a Challenge for Microsoft to make Apps for this 2 screen Mini Tablet How ever it will Run full Windows 10 Desktop OS or Windows 10 on ARMS CPU  OS and ether way be able to run UWP Apps and  run Millions of titles of Full Win 32 X86 Desktop PC Programs. This Means if a person buys one they wont have a USELESS device. The Windows desktop PC Win32 X86 Desktop PC programs in the beginning will be it's main source of Apps and there are Millions of PC Programs for it to use untill enough UWP Apps are in it's store.   0 1 day ago Reply RK928 If I ever saw those 3 dudes in the photo I'd run as fast as I could in the opposite direction, so they can start with that. 0 1 day ago Reply Generalheed I also partially blame it on Microsoft focusing on the wrong market locations. For example with Windows Phone, instead of going for the premium phone market like the US, they instead made a bunch of cheap low end phones and tried to push those in developing nations while in the US, they stopped producing flagship phones for awhile which was perceived as a lack of commitment from Microsoft. And when they did finally produce a flagship phone like the Lumia 950, they carrier locked it to AT&T. The same problem also happened to Intel Atom smartphones. Instead of including a 4G modem and selling Intel powered phones in the US and other 1st world markets, they once again try to focus on developing markets. We all know what happened to Intel Atom smartphones after that. Never caught on and failed to the point where Intel completely dropped it's mobile efforts. Apple didn't succeed by first targeting iPhones towards developing markets. Android didn't succeed with cheap phone's either. It was the big flagships like Samsung's Galaxy line that put it on the radar. Microsoft, and Intel too, should've focused on the high-end premium flagship phone market in the US first. 0 1 day ago Reply @wp8fan Agree! Have said for years keep Joe B AWAY from the public.

Microsoft biggest problem even with the enterprise is communication.  You cannot get a team at Microsoft to come out with a clear explanation for anything. as a consumer when i buy a product i want to know what i can do with it right now, not what i could probably do with it. This is Microsoft fault this also seeps into their marketing. People, in general, are not educated on what Microsoft products can do, Microsoft then gives the communication portion to its fans and its partners.    Why did the xbox one not be a roaring success like the playstation, the exact same reason horrible communication and then horrible follow-ups to questions asked.    One additional thing that Microsoft needs to address is to show users why they want their product. needing a product and having to use a product are two very different things, one is out of love and the other is out of desperation. Microsoft is in the desperation camp. no one really needs a Microsoft product and Microsoft is doing its best to not want people to love them. even after the so called phone reboot, they will have lost the war and the followers and there will be no reason to want their product.  0 2 days ago Reply sdreamer Um.. put someone hip to present these things...

The Band.  SERIOUSLY ... nothing on the market even today could match what it had to offer.  Where is it ?  Simply dumped.  Why ?  Yeah, they had some manufacturing quality control issues, but those could have been resolved.  A few refinements would have helped, but they were also doable.  The problem ?  Microsoft had them in the stores and a few other places, but basically, unless you went searching for them, they were a secret.  I've had most of the alternatives, and NOTHING comes close to what the Band could do.   Perhaps the biggest problem is the marketing department doesn't get it.  Surface does not need to be compared to Apple products.  Trying to one up Apple is a waste of time.  Sell it on it's uniqueness, and what it does.  The Surface Pro is unlike any other device when you look at ALL it can do ... so why compare it ?  Focus on what it does best !   The biggest problem I see with Microsoft right now is they are letting down their existing client base, especially in the corporate world.  Everything is focused on change, and creativity, but companies large and small want to make transitions slowly and without everything falling apart.  I constantly get calls from clients with problems caused by periodic OS updates .. when something that worked perfectly ( ie. networking ) suddenly has major problems ... and no one at MSFT is providing any quality answers on how to resolve them.  Consumers are also employees ( and employers ), and they will look first at what they use at work for their personal needs ... and if it is creating headaches on the job, they look elsewhere.   What does Microsoft need to do ?  They need to get into the real world of semi-technical consumers, and see what people really want on a daily basis, and focus on that rather than all the creative stuff that some of us love, but is beyond the majority of those who have money to purchase these devices. 0 2 days ago Reply signal-2-noise It's just not the "cool factor" in their tech that's lacking, look at the human models in that cover photo.

Really wish they would port ONE game over - Kinect Party, Truly fun game for groups of kids. 0 2 days ago Reply Machine Overlord I'd like to add to Jason's welldone article and bring some more historical perspective, which I think is important. Apple While Apple is wildly successful today with it's iPhone-based platform, this wasn't always the case. Today's success for Apple started with the iPod, which took them 25 years to "discover". For Apple's first 25 years of existence, it was just a niche computer maker that struggled to be relevant. Even to this day, Apple's original core product, the Mac, has struggled to make much headway, holding the same single digit market share that it has held for decades. The iPod morphed into the iPod Touch, which morphed into the iPhone, then the iPad. Today, Apple's primary product is the iPhone. The iPad is slowly fading away, just as the iPod has. Without the iPhone, Apple would again be a niche computer maker struggling to be relevant because I would argue most of its Mac sales today are due to the success of the iPhone. Take the iPhone away and Apple again becomes irrelevant. Google Google is an advertising company. Roughly 90% of its revenue comes from selling advertising. Every product that Google creates is geared towards collecting user data to be sold. In 2007, Google purchased Android, which it subsequently allowed developers to use for free. This is the only reason Android became successful. It didn't become successful because it was originally good. Originally it was crap. The iPhone was originally crap as well. And I would argue up until the last few years it was crap. But it was free, which allowed every low rent device maker to turn out cheap, crap devices that most people could afford and that carriers could make massive profits on. And that was great for Google, because it gave them a massive platform from which to collect even more user data to sell. But to this day, the only device maker that makes any meaningful profit at all on Android is Samsung. There is profit for the carriers and app/service sales, but not in the devices themselves. Microsoft As Jason pointed out, Microsoft's history has been in the enterprise, and it will remain so. Neither Apple nor Google have any meaningful presence in the enterprise, other than iPhones and Android phones, and likely never will. The enterprise is a much more complex market than the consumer market. Enterprises demand much more robust systems, security, backwards compatibility, integration, etc., all things that neither Apple nor Google can provide at enterprise scale. Apple's success is the iPhone. Google's is advertising. Microsoft's is Windows, Office, Visual Studio, MS SQL Server, Intune, Xbox, Azure, and a host of other products, none of which Apple or Google have competitors for, and again likely never will. Microsoft has struggled in the consumer space because up until recently it has never been a consumer company. From day one both Apple and Android were consumer companies. They have decades of experience in the consumer, consumption market. They have little to no experience in the enterprise and productivity markets. Microsoft is just the reverse. So how does Microsoft become cool? I'm not sure it should. The idea that the iPhone and Android will remain the successes they are today is I think foolhardy. Looking back at the history of consumer electronics there are very few succcess of the day that even exist today. Things will change, and I think Microsoft is driving that change, but it is a longer term game. You might say, well Windows has been successful all these years, so perhaps Windows will become irrelevant at some point. Perhaps, but I don't think so, because unlike OSX, for example, Microsoft has spent the last few years completely re-writing Windows, completely changing its usability, its scalability. Windows can now run on desktops, laptops, tablets, Xbox, mobile, IoT, HoloLens, Surface Hub. OSX can run on Macs. It takes a completely separate operating system to run on the iPhone, and yet another to run on the iPad. Same goes for Google. Convergence is the future. The lines of what we call a "computer" continue to become blurred. Microsoft is leading the way with this convergence. Will it ever become cool? I don't know. But what I do know is that cool tends to be a fad. Fads don't last. 1 2 days ago Reply Migi2015 So Microsoft is 42 years in and can't get their first iPod.

Google has its ad business, and Microsoft has a whole host of businesses. Apple is almost completely reliant on the iPhone. One trick ponies tend to lose their edge at some point. 0 2 days ago Reply Generalheed On the contrary, you could also say Apple is 42 years in and still couldn't successfully break into the laptop and desktop market.

I bought theSurface RT when it first came out. I was so excited to get it. When I showed it to people I almost always got the same question: "Is that one that has the keyboard that clicks on?" Now, why would I get that questions? It s simply because of the commercial where the kids danced around and click the keyboard ontop the Surface. That was considered "cool." It was cool because of marketing. It created the buzz. The buzz is what established the cool factot. This is contrary to the belief that products can sell themselves.

Microsoft has tried for a long time to get users from all platforms.  They did the "it works on all devices but is best on Windows!" but didn't stick it out.  I think that's their problem.  Constantly here, and on other sites, we see people who are disinfranchised with them.  Especially "Windows fans" who really want to stay with them, but no longer have a choice.  Slowly, I'm running out of choices to stay with Microsoft.  And it's all their fault. 0 2 days ago Reply Gabriel Hernandez5 Thats why I think Microsoft should continue building smartphones but with an Android cloned OS, smartphones aren't going to dissapear anyrime soon.

Should Microsoft make a Windows phone with impressive hardware like they did with Surface, it'd probably get a lot more attention. 0 1 day ago Reply jmreuter Oh Lord, spare us from the "cool" nonsense.  Cool is fine if you want to be in the fashion business.  Follow that if you want to see how fickle it is.  Every time Microsoft tries to be "cool" they do it by copying, including copying the *worst* aspects of the others.  And when they change their existing products to be more "cool" they inevitably make them worse and, somehow, more buggy than what they started with. At work, I want to be productive and efficient, not cool.  Windows 7 was excellent at that.  The original Windows 8 screwed that up entirely.  Windows 10 if finally getting back to where they were with Windows 7. At home, I'm probably playing games, so it has to work and be fast.   Or I might doing something like photo and video downloads and edits, where again I want to be productive.  If I'm paying bills or other home chores, I'm likely just using a browser.  It just has to work, on whatever device.  Initially, about half of the time Edge didn't work.  Now it is worse: for some sites Edge fails, for others IE fails, so I have to use both, and try to remember which one to use for any given site. Windows Phone 7 was brilliant with it's hub idea--since abandoned.  But they also copied the worst aspect of iPhone in that you had to tether it to the Zune app, just like iPhone / iTunes, which everyone hates.  Stupid.  Zune HD was outstanding, as was the Zune player on Windows Phone 7, just too late.  And with Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 the replacement media playing environment was truly horrible; it would have been an embarrasment even as an intro college project.  How on earth did they go from something quite good to that?  With Groove they are finally getting back to what they had 5 years ago. When I'm mobile I'm trying to get something done; other than phone calls, it might be email, messaging, photos and photo sharing, social media, etc.  I just needs to work, without fights and reboots.  5 years ago it just worked.  Today it doesn't.  No fashion statement makes up for something simply not working.   0 2 days ago Reply AdamInTx This!!!

I think that if they also added a focus on the "gaming" crowd, by building the first ever gaming phone, they could finally on board the right people to achieve that "Cool Factor" that you so cleverly explain on this article. You could start slow, low key, with a killer piece of hardware (their ultimate mobile device), with the ability to play your current library of games - real games: Forza, Halo 5, etc. - on the go.

I've read rumours that the next mobile reboot might use boring icons like iOS and Android. Why is the general public so set in 25 year old UI design? It's time to evolve! I always used to say that Windows 8 / Windows Phone was like Marty McFly playing 80's heavy metal guitar in 1955.

I've long been in a tiny minority.  Microsoft has not only been slow to respond to trends (worse, with exception of the Surface Pro devices, have never been a trend-SETTER), they chase so many rabbit trails and then reboot their efforts there's no confidence in long-term sustainability.  I think we're about to witness it again with mobile.  Microsoft is the Incredible Hulk/Spiderman of the tech industry...so many retries at something, with a lot of money wasted and squandered consumer support. 4 2 days ago Reply xFalk I agree that there is nothing "fun" about an iPhone or Android phone, or really any phone for that matter.  It's the marketing that builds the perception of fun and that is what sells the devices. 1 2 days ago Reply Pappale not only marketing, applications are very important for the huge amount of average users, next group are geeks who want to see the newest HW so for both groups the only options are iPhones and Androids.

That said I'd agree that consistency is not there for all of their products. Apple has been very slow to response last couple of years for their entire portfolio. I'd argue it's worse now but it still pays off due to their (past) image. I'm not sure people see Google HW devices as that cool.

Same with Kinect.  My main TVs (three in total) that has an Xbox attached all have Kinect.  And Kinect works flawlessly for me.  It's no flop to me.  Again, just because Microsoft gets lazy and refuses to market their products wisely doesn't mean the products are flops.  It's the selling and promoting of the products is where the issue lies.  Windows Phone which should have been named something else IMO, was hampered by the name itself.  WP was at 10% in some countries and seem to be gaining ground until Microsoft decided to abandon all that was good with WP OS.  They got rid of the ME tile.  Rooms.  Panoramic Photo Hub.  Zune Music.  Kids Corner.  Reduction in integration of social sites in the People Hub.  Leader of the Camera in a cell phone.  And finally instead of leading they incorporated those useless Hamburger menus removing the ease of the ... ellipsis.  These things worked well!  They weren't flops!  They just won't marketed correctly IMHO. 0 2 days ago Reply vincentwansink It's true.  You can't rightfully call something a flop if it isn't marketed at all.  I guess you could say the promotion of the product was a flop, even if the product itself was brilliant. 1 2 days ago Reply Dillan K They may have been technically sound, but they were all market failures.

The Xbox was known as the DirectX box (Microsofts internal name for it)before they took the name of Xbox... It's a Windows core with DirectX in a nutshel. As for Mobile devices, the KIN failed because of a lot of Microsoft's politics but, one of the other big issues was Verizon wireless. They were exclusive on the KIN/KIN2  but, they insisted that it was a smartphone and put a mandatory $29.99 a month data plan, it got out of the range of most yonger people.  It was dead on arival because of this. If Windows was NOT a needed thing for PCs (If you read the story of how Bill Gates started Microsoft, you would know he was smart but, he was in the right place at the right time...), and another company created "Windows" Microsoft would be a low volume, or even failed company in a competive market. No matter the billions they spend on Marketing, they really have no clue on how to hit the "hip" consumers, they have always have lost this anagle.

Of course you don't have to read it if that's your desire. There are many other writers or topics here you might prefer. Just let the title of the piece and author by line be your guide if that’s what you wish. :-) Now I noticed your discontent with this and other pieces revolves around the erroneous notion that I am shilling for Apple and Google. Please review the dozens of articles I've written since I began writing for the site in 2015 www.windowscentral.com/author/jason-ward where you will clearly see that is not the case. One of the things that makes writing analysis for any company helpful is viewing that company within the larger context in which it exists. No company, not even Microsoft, exists in a box. Decisions made by other companies, consumer behavior, market forces, trends, technological advances, laws, government actions (remember the DOJ ruling against Microsoft?) and more affect the success and failure of a company's endeavors, even Microsoft's. For example Microsoft was in the mobile phone business long before Apple or Google. It had even achieved over 40% market share at one point. Clearly that level of market dominance is no longer the case. Why? Did Microsoft suddenly stop offering its mobile OS in 2007 or was there a force outside of Microsoft that began to affect its position in the mobile space? Of course we know that the latter is true. Apple introduced the consumer-facing iPhone which turned Microsoft's enterprise-focused efforts on its head. Microsoft had to scramble in response to what Apple and subsequently Google, via Android, brought to the market. Hhammack you can't tell one story without including (at least in part) the other. The same applies in various areas where Microsoft competes with other companies. Whether its offering a Music service - Groove vs Apple Music vs Google vs Spotify, Browsers: Edge vs Chrome vs Safari, OSes: Windows vs MacOS vs Chrome vs Android, productivity suites, cloud services, digital assistants, the list goes on. Talking about what the competition is doing provides context as to WHY Microsoft is doing WHAT it is doing and what is may do next and why. Rest assured, Microsoft is certainly taking about what rivals are doing behind the hallowed walls of Redmond. :-) So no I'm not shilling. :-) I'm telling the story as it should be told, by intelligently including information that provides context to the focus of the content. For any analysis and its communication to be most effective you have to look at the broader context not only the content, or subject that is the focus. I hope that helps you understand why I include information about what other companies are doing and why Windows Central hired me to write for the site. :-) 1 1 day ago Reply Long Xuyen MS continually makes one huge mistake in my not so humble opinion.

Having launched it they managed to make sure almost no one at Microsoft ever used it again. If they really loved the offer instead of seeing it merely as a necessary offer they might get somewhere. Do remember things like Zune and Kin were US only. Another problem for Microsoft is they need to morph into a global company. Apple and Google have done that. Microsoft not so much. With double figure Lumia sales in Europe during 2015 they abandoned their best selling markets first.  0 10 hours ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner
News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Apple Valley: 'Security issues' prompt Bright Futures to hire safety officers Friday Jun 2, 2017 at 12:01 AM Jun 2, 2017 at 9:29 PM Charity Lindsey Staff Writer @DP_CharityMatthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Facing mounting criminal reports, a state investigation and a threatened business license, Bright Futures Academy (BFA) recently announced it has hired a private security firm, “a move aimed at reducing the number of calls to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department” here. The nonpublic school’s Apple Valley campus has been provided with “two additional safety officers” from Burbank-based Blue Nite Protection Agency. The move comes in response to concerns that the “campus has generated a disproportionate number of calls to the Sheriff’s Department,” Bright Futures Academy President Betti Colucci said. Between late December 2015 and early March 2017, deputies responded to 132 calls for service at the school, according to Apple Valley Station Capt. Frank Bell. That prompted the town to announce its intent to revoke BFA’s business license. “We realized that many of the calls were unnecessary,” Colucci said. “...by hiring Blue Nite, we will have the extra manpower to resolve most of our security issues in-house, thus drastically reducing the need for sheriff's deputies to come to the school.” She added the school “has removed the few students responsible for most of the calls, and has tightened its intake process to screen incoming students more carefully.” BFA plans to appeal the town’s proposed revocation at the June 13 Town Council meeting. Although the school originally said in its appeal letter that it would seek a full-time officer for the campus from the Sheriff’s Department, Colucci said the cost quoted “was prohibitive for a special needs school” like theirs. Assistant Town Manager Lori Lamson said the Council “will consider all the facts ... including the additional security recently hired” and that the school is still under investigation by the California Department of Education. As a nonpublic, nonsectarian school (NPS), BFA uses state funds to serve students with various intellectual and emotional disturbance disabilities. The school requires certification from CDE, which was recently suspended, putting a freeze on enrollment, according to CDE spokesperson Bill Ainsworth. Earlier this month, Greg and Tasha Patterson attended a meeting BFA’s administration held for parents at the Apple Valley campus in the wake of the suspension. Their 15-year-old son, Mykayle, is autistic. The Pattersons said some parents at the meeting expressed a desire to separate autistic students, like Mykayle, from those with behavioral issues or emotional disturbance disabilities. “Why should our kids have to suffer? That makes no sense,” Tasha Patterson said. “Maybe actually hand pick those who want to learn and separate them (from) the ones who lash out.” Tasha Patterson disagrees with BFA’s BFA's hiring decision. She said the issue is that staff “can’t control those kids.”   “They want to spend all this money on security guards when you can really save your money for field trips to people who are willing to speak with these kids,” she said. “Someone who’s been there and done that, and can relate to them ... Now you’re making it seem like they’re in prison.” Colucci said that because the school already has “a high ratio of teachers, administrators and aides to students,” the addition of Blue Nite’s presence “has been a seamless and positive development.” Parents were informed during the meeting that BFA is “working on” separating students, according to the Pattersons. Under the current model, if combining children with disparate needs and disabilities isn’t the norm, it’s at least “a commonality among non-public schools,” according to Janae Holtz, CEO of Desert/Mountain Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA), a support services office for special needs students that contracts with local districts and private schools. “I would say that the majority of non-public schools carry caseloads with all types of disabilities ... That’s pretty common,” Holtz said. “So to serve only the students on one side of the spectrum, especially in the High Desert where our resources are pretty limited, that becomes almost impossible to run a business in my opinion.” The Hesperia-based Altus Academy is the only other NPS in the High Desert, according to Holtz. She acknowledged a center focused specifically on autistic students’ needs would benefit the High Desert, but added that “programs where you have both types of children on the campus” can work within the right structure. “Teaching kids how to get along with other types of people is very important, as well,” Holtz said. “Socialization is important. It's about the right timing for that education, though.” According to Holtz, all actions related to exceptional needs students are determined by their Individualized Education Program (IEPs), such as relocating students for any reason — including when the CDE suspends certification. “If a parent didn't want a student to remain at Bright Futures ... they would actually contact Bright Futures because the school is responsible for the IEP,” Holtz said. “It has to be an appropriate placement and the IEP determines that.” When asked if contracting through SELPA to send students to BFA would change if the school’s business license were revoked, Apple Valley Unified School District officials said simply that the district “will continue to work with (SELPA) to serve all of our students, just as we have in the past.” Crystal Hernandez — a parent of a special needs child who was recommended by AVUSD to attend BFA before she decided against it — said she moved to the San Gabriel Valley “because the special education system in the High Desert just isn’t the greatest.” “There’s a lot lacking. It seems like the schools just get away with doing the bare minimum and it’s partly because of (a lack of) parent involvement, I think,” Hernandez said. “Schools want to cut corners by not hiring necessary supportive staff.” Still, some parents fiercely defend BFA, including Katie Lozano, the mother of 10-year-old Marcus, a student with Asperger's syndrome, high functioning autism and cerebral palsy who was struggling in a public AVUSD school. “These districts don’t want to deal with our kids so we have no place for them,” Lozano said. “I think (Bright Futures) has given him a lot of support, a lot of guidance, whereas in the district, he didn’t feel accepted.” “But I’m an involved parent,” Lozano added, saying she fears for the students whose parents are not as concerned with what happens to their children at school. “I also feel bad for the parents because a lot of them don’t have the support or guidance and are at the mercy of the district,” Lozano said. “They need to be educated.” Charity Lindsey may be contacted at CLindsey@VVDailyPress.com or 760-951-6245.

Music Bozoma Saint John, Global Consumer Marketing for Apple Music, Said To Be Leaving… By Arron Hirst 3rd Jun 17 4:06 am Share Tweet You may remember Bozoma “Boz” Saint John for her passionate on-stage demo of Apple Music and its (then new) redesign, at last year’s WWDC … But with just days to go until this year’s developer get-together, Apple Music‘s Head of Global Consumer Marketing is said to be on the way out. While the exact reasoning for Saint John’s reported exit from heading up Apple Music’s global marketing arm is unknown at this time, several have pointed to the executive landing a position elsewhere as the most likely reason for the decision. Bozoma’s exit -whilst not yet official- would come as a shock for a number of reasons, not just because of the marketing executive’s obvious and wholly infectious on-stage personality, but also given her position and status within the company itself – which recently saw her sit alongside Jimmy Iovine and Eddy Cue, (both of whom sit on Apple’s leadership team), for one of the streaming service’s TV spots fronted by James Cordon. “It’s no surprise that Apple appointed Saint John as the head of marketing around one of its highest profile services, Music, as she has built an impressive career around connecting musicians and artists with brands,” Fortune said at the time. She also placed 67th on the Billboard Power 100, back in February. Reports of Saint John’s now expected exit from the Cupertino firm were first published by Politico’s Axios who said Friday that the former Pepsi marketing exec “plans to leave the company,” citing that when asked Apple “declined to comment.” If true, Bozoma Saint John’s exit from Apple Music –and possibly the company as a whole– will arrive just weeks after Apple’s former Head of Human Resources, Denise Young Smith, was appointed to her new role of Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion. / Image Credit: Fast Company, Complex Mag Continue Reading You may also like... #WWDC: 62 Ways To Say “To Be Announced”… (with Emoji) Here’s What’s Moving in #NEWMUSIC — This Friday [LISTEN] McEnery Convention Center Dripped in WWDC Signage [PHOTOS] Now On iTunes U.S: 10-Movie Bundles for $19.99 ea.

How Spelling Became a Sport /link/how-spelling-bees-became-sport via theoutline.com When thinking about celebrity sportspeople, we oftentimes go to athletes like Serena Williams or Lebron James, but every spring a very different kind of sporting champ graces ESPN and various TV shows. The Scripps National Spelling Bee (which started as a promotional event in 1925) somehow made its way into the professional sports industry—thanks to its first airing on ESPN in 1994. Full of suspense, drama, and sometimes fainting, tears and tantrums, it has plenty in common with traditional sports and yet it's entirely different.

And the target year happens to be 2117. Appropriately named "Mars 2117," the project aims to be a multinational effort according to program director Saeed Gergawi. For such an effort to work, transportation to the planet and sustainability efforts would need to be developed. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, the UAE's Vice President and Prime Minister, is spearheading it all, with hopes to bolster the Emirates science and technology developments, inspire the youth and reduce reliance on oil.

While the concept seems heavy, the approaches taken by many of the young creatives are playful, colorful and clever. From goggles called "Face Brace" which aid users in re-learning how to make eye contact to "The FOMO* Breather" which lets users know about social events occurring nearby, the creations are funny and tinged with pathos.

The World's First VR Calligraphy Installation /link/worlds-first-vr-calligraphy-installation via mashable.com Running through 3 June at the Taiwan National Palace Museum, "The Spirit of Autobiography" allows visitors to try their hand at recreating Chinese calligraphy—only, in virtual reality. Billed as the first calligraphy VR experience, the exhibition offers guests a headset and they then proceed to a Chinese pavilion and situate themselves in an empty room where a calligraphy pen awaits. Characters appear in the air and one must then trace them—perfectly (otherwise, users have to repeat the process until the lines are exact). The installation uses technology by Computex and it's an exciting way to learn the motions behind one of the most exquisite forms of writing. Essential Products, the Anti-iPhone, and the Future of Tech /link/essential-products-andy-rubin via wired.com With a few important mantras—one being "simple is always better"—Sidekick- and Android-creator Andy Rubin has launched a new tech company today.

Today two products (both set for a summer release) have been announced: an edge-to-edge and top-to-(almost) bottom screen smartphone called Phone which has no branding, and a smart-home hub "that Rubin hopes will bring order to the endless standards, protocols, and systems wrought by the Internet of Things." With the hope to connect with products already in existence, and to eventually create an open-source and infinitely extendable platform, Rubin's new venture is certainly interesting if not bold.

Beyond "Sesame Street," Henson's legacy is remarkable—"The Muppets," "Fraggle Rock," "The Dark Crystal" and "Labyrinth" continue to inspire. Many of the pieces on display have been kindly donated by the Henson family. Read more at Curbed. Beautiful Mosques Around the World /link/beautiful-mosques-around-the-world via nationalgeographic.com 26 May marked the beginning of Ramadan—an important time for around one-quarter of the world's population. Mosques (or "masjids" in Arabic) serve as places of worship for Muslim people, but also—much like churches and shuls—as places to learn, have community events and more. National Geographic created a slideshow of some of the world's most stunning mosques, and whether a religious person or not, it's easy to see that they are worthy of admiration. Says Alexandra E. Petri, "From Timbuktu to Washington DC, these holy marvels provide incredible historic, cultural, and religious commentary, illustrating a city’s identity within the Muslim world and as a destination all its own."

Best Space Books for Kids /link/best-space-books-children via space.com It's important (especially for little girls and young women) to encourage our youth to engage with science, though this isn't always easy. The editors at Space.com are constantly on the hunt for great, entertaining and educational books about space exploration and space science—for children and adults, too. From Chris Hadfield's "The Darkest Dark" which tells the story of exploration and fear, to Leland Melvin's memoir "Chasing Space," there are plenty of titles in their recent list of reads that will appeal to youngsters—and the young at heart. Magic Mushrooms are the Safest Recreational Drug /link/magic-mushrooms-safest-drug via theguardian.com According to this year's Global Drug Survey, magic mushrooms are the safest recreational drug. Of the 12,000 surveyed people who took mushrooms, just a minuscule 0.2% of them sought medical aid. More dangerous, drugs like LSD, cocaine and MDMA had a rate five times higher. Founder and consultant addiction psychiatrist of the Global Drug Survey, Adam Winstock says that the most dangerous thing about mushrooms is, in fact, people picking and ingesting the wrong kinds. He says, "Death from toxicity is almost unheard of, with poisoning with more dangerous fungi being a much greater risk in terms of serious harms." But that's not to say magic mushrooms aren't entirely safe to munch on every day, Winstock says that alcohol and unfamiliar places can cause confusion, fear and panic—which can lead to dangerous situations or injury.

Marc Newson's $12,000 Collaborative Hourglass for Hodinkee /link/marc-newson-hodinkee-hourglass via hodinkee.com Esoteric and mesmeric are two words industrial designer Marc Newson uses to describe his new collaborative product (with watch expert website HODINKEE) an hourglass. It's far more than these descriptors however. This time-counting apparatus documents 10 minute cycles, and does so with roughly 1.3 million copper-coated nanoballs fighting their way through a hand-blown glass neck. The sounds produced along the way mimic a lush rainstorm. It's a multi-sensory reimagining of a classic timepiece. The unit has been produced in a limited edition of 100, at $12,000 a piece. To reimagine the nostalgic with a luxuriant infusion, as they have done here, should appeal to anyone with an appreciation of time and design. Maisie Cousins' Nudes- and Nature-Smothered Solo Show /link/maisie-cousins-flowers-photography via dazeddigital.com We've long-been fascinated by Maisie Cousins' photography—blending nature, sex, nudity, beauty and celebrating sexuality. Her first-ever solo show, called "grass, peony, bum" has just opened at London's TJ Boulting Gallery and she spoke with Dazed Digital about her incredible knack for balancing the opulent, sultry and grotesque. She tells the publication, "Nature is always beautiful and also disgusting. Even the most beautiful people leak, bleed and shit." For the show, Cousins also asked perfumer Azzi Glasser to create a fragrance in response to her artwork, "Honestly, it feels like such a natural, progressive step. I think scent is so sexy and also so heartbreaking. I was dating someone who wore a common cologne and after we broke up I could smell it on everyone on the underground all the time, it made my heart hurt. It’s inescapable."

But the process of finding and installing other apps in Messages is so tricky that most users have no idea they can even do it, developers and analysts say. DoorDash, a US food-delivery app that Federighi displayed on stage as a model of the new feature, dropped its Messages app for group orders a few months after releasing it because it drew little interest. Related Content The Frightful Five: There's no escape from these companies Have Apple and Microsoft traded places? "While we didn't end up moving forward with it, we're excited about other ways we're making delivery faster and more efficient," Andy Fang, a founder of DoorDash and the company's chief technology officer, said in a statement. A similar lack of enthusiasm among users and developers has limited adoption of the iPhone's 3-D Touch feature, where a long, hard press on an app sometimes offers additional options such as viewing an email without opening it. And sales of the Apple Watch have been hampered by the steep learning curve it requires of users, who must master pushing, turning and tapping various parts of the watch and a related iPhone app. Advertisement "There's just so much stuff," said David de Min, chief executive of Velapp, a startup based in London. "They are trying to cram things in." Velapp has just released a video recording app that uses 3-D Touch to help users select the best parts of a video while recording it. But de Min said that few other developers were using the technology, in part because iPhone users were unaware of it. "It's not something you can really see," he said. "People don't understand it." SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Link The Messages app is confusing for many iPhone users. Photo: The New York Times Apple, which declined to comment for this article, makes many updates that are popular with users, from changes to the Siri voice assistant to automatically transcribed voicemail messages. At this year's Apple Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose, California, the company is expected to introduce improved Mac computers and iPads, software updates for all of its hardware and a voice-activated speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. With Apple adding fewer major features in recent years, customers have been slower to upgrade their devices. App developers are also pausing in what had been a race to embrace Apple's latest innovations. Eliran Sapir, chief executive of Apptopia, an analytics firm, said that new apps were being introduced at half the rate they were a year ago. Apple TV apps are hot, he said, but developers are fleeing Apple Watch. "There is no way to monetise the watch whatsoever," he said. The slow uptake of apps for Messages and 3-D Touch is evident in the numbers. There are 5,000 regular apps and 30,000 sticker apps for Messages, according to Randy Nelson, head of mobile insights at Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Only about 3,600 of the 2.5 million apps in the iOS app store promote their compatibility with 3-D Touch. "You get your new iPhone and you don't know that 3-D Touch and apps in Messages even exist," Nelson said. Although stickers account for 97 of the top 100 Messages apps, he said, some users are so confused that they post app reviews like, "I downloaded these Disney stickers. How do I use them?" That is not exactly in line with the simple "it just works" philosophy that Apple built its business on. Chalen Duncan, a graduate student in emerging media at the University of Georgia, was so frustrated by the interface for stickers and apps in Messages that he redesigned it and posted his version online. "At its core, it's a discoverability issue," said Duncan, who worked part time on Apple's telephone tech-support team during college and hopes to get a design job there in the future. "People just don't know the stickers exist." He said he had to teach his friends how to install and use Messages stickers by sending them multiple screenshots. "A lot of people will think it's their fault, and it's really the designer's fault," he said. "People want apps to be easy to use."

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « In an Effort to hurt iPhone 8 Sales in Korea, Samsung Plans to Flood the Local market with Refurbished Note 7s | Main | Apple wins Design Patents for Siri Icons in China and EU Confirming that Siri will Work with Future Smart Glasses » June 02, 2017 AI-Industry Insiders: Apple's new Siri Device will take a Different Path to Market than Amazon's Alexa   Earlier today Patently Apple posted a report titled "The Tech World will be glued to Apple's WWDC Keynote looking for their Response to the Smart Home Speaker Device Craze." Before the big event, Reuters is now reporting that artificial intelligence industry insiders have confirmed to them that Apple will indeed introduce a new Siri-centric device that will take a different path to market than Amazon's Alexa.   Reuters notes that "Currently, Apple's Siri works with only six types of app: ride-hailing and sharing; messaging and calling; photo search; payments; fitness; and auto infotainment systems. At the company's annual developer conference next week, it is expected to add to those categories.   But even if Siri doubles its areas of expertise, it will be a far cry from the 12,000 or so tasks that Amazon.com's Alexa can handle.   The difference illustrates a strategic divide between the two tech rivals. Apple is betting that customers will not use voice commands without an experience similar to speaking with a human, and so it is limiting what Siri can do in order to make sure it works well.   Amazon puts no such restrictions on Alexa, wagering that the voice assistant with the most "skills," its term for apps on its Echo assistant devices, will gain a loyal following, even if it sometimes makes mistakes and takes more effort to use.   The clash of approaches is coming to a head as virtual assistants that respond to voice commands become a priority for the leading tech companies, which want to find new ways of engaging customers and make more money from shopping and online services.   Matt McIlwain, a venture capitalist with Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group chimed in by saying that "To attract developers in the modern world, you need a platform. If Apple does not launch a 'skills store,' that would be a mistake." For more on this, read the full Reuters report here.   I've gotten the impression for some time now that the press thinks that Apple is rushing a product to market for Siri blindly so as to "catch up" with Amazon's echo. Apple has been working on a new device for Siri for some time. A patent originally filed in Q2 2016 provided a patent figure showing a new speaker device in context with Siri. The patent was about allowing Siri to coordinate iOS devices within the home or office to work in sync to perform a particular task. The patent was only made public in April. Another patent was filed in 2015 covering a new Siri architecture allowing two digital assistants communicate with each other. Yet another 2015 patent covered how Siri would be given a new visual system to understand gestures, activities and more.   A year ago Patently Apple posted a report titled "Forbes Misguided View is that Apple has missed the AI Revolution."  Some in the press remain stuck on the notion that Apple is somehow behind in the AI game just because they don't hype it up like their competitors do at press events. What great achievement have Apple's competitors pulled off that puts Apple in danger of being left behind? The Echo isn't making any money from it and I doubt that Google Home does either. So this false narrative and persistent view in the press is propaganda, a fallacy, a mental hiccup that needs adjusting.    While it's not the iPhone 8 event, Monday's WWDC keynote is likely to be one of the most exciting in years. And like myself, I'm sure that you can't wait for it to begin.        About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Digital Trends Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 review Xiaomi’s affordable Mi Pad 3 is a tablet everyone can enjoy Share Xiaomi's Mi Pad 3 excels at the essentials, but is overshadowed by Apple’s cheap new iPad. Xiaomi's Mi Pad 3 excels at the essentials, but is overshadowed by Apple’s cheap new iPad. Xiaomi's Mi Pad 3 excels at the essentials, but is overshadowed by Apple’s cheap new iPad. Highs Hits the tablet size sweet spot at 7.9-inches High-resolution screen Attractive design Lows Frustrating software and operation quirks Mediocre camera DT Editors' Rating 6.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Tablet Reviews > Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 review By Andy Boxall Posted on 06.02.17 Research Center: Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 Do tablets still have a place in the world? They’re not the trend they once were, and even Apple — the one company making tablets that sell in any quantity — has dropped the price on its 2017 entry-level iPad model to encourage people to buy or upgrade. At $330, the iPad is an all-around affordable option, but you’ll have to search for an Android tablet if you want something cheaper. Xiaomi has released a new version of its Mi Pad, called the Mi Pad 3. It’s an iPad Mini-sized device with Xiaomi’s MIUI user interface over the top of Google’s operating system. It’s cheaper than the iPad Mini 4 and the new iPad, at around $270; but you’ll have to import one if you want it in the U.S. Is it worth the import? No. While there’s nothing horribly wrong with the Mi Pad 3, its small quirks and issues do not justify the $270 price tag, especially when the new iPad is just $60 more. Let’s take a closer look. This looks familiar What does the Mi Pad 3 look like? Well, picture an iPad Mini 4 without the Apple branding, and you’re pretty much there. The two are shockingly similar. The 6.9mm thick aluminum body has a flat back with a camera lens in the top right, the corners are smooth and rounded, and the overall dimensions are almost identical. The screen is the same size at 7.9-inches, as is the 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution. Andy Boxall Andy Boxall Andy Boxall Andy Boxall There are some differences. The dual speakers are mounted on the back of the tablet, facing away from you when looking at the screen, and the sleep/wake button is on the side of the body, not the top. It doesn’t have a fingerprint sensor, or any physical home button — instead the Mi Pad 3 uses capacitive navigational icons below the screen. We miss the tactility of a physical home button, largely because  the Android keys aren’t especially responsive, and do require very precise taps to operate. It’s a comfortable device to hold, and those with average or larger hands will have no problem holding it in one hand, thanks to its low weight. The texture on the back is pleasant to touch, but although the Mi Pad 3 is beautifully made, there is a slight flex in the center of the aluminium back panel. It’s not enough to cause concern, but enough to notice when it’s pressed. There’s little to fault the way the Mi Pad 3 looks, mainly because it’s very close to the established and attractive style of the iPad Mini. It’s not something that overly concerns us — styling it after something hideous would do that — and we find the smaller 7.9-inch tablet size to be convenient, while still being suitably larger than our phone to make using it worthwhile. Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 Compared To Apple iPad 9.7 Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 Chuwi Hi12 Windows 10 2-in-1 Dell Venue 8 7000 Nvidia Shield Tablet Apple iPad Air 2 LG G Pad 7.0 Dell Venue 8 Pro Apple iPad Mini 2 Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 (8-inch) Smart Devices SmartQ U7 Barnes & Noble Nook HD+ Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus Amazon Kindle Fire Acer Iconia Tab A100 Crisp screen that needs better color calibration Xiaomi’s Mi Pad 3 has a 7.9-inch, 2048 x 1536 pixel, IPS LCD screen on the front, which is good enough for a 326 pixel-per-inch density, and a wide 178-degree viewing angle. It’s very bright, and we rarely needed to increase the brightness over 50 percent, which is good for battery life. There’s a reading mode for nighttime use, which lowers the amount of sleep-damaging blue light emitted by the screen. It’s easily activated from the Android notification shade, and adds a yellowish look to the display, but there’s a slider to adjust the degree of intrusion. Dig through the menu and you’ll find an unusual black and white mode, which not only extends the battery life, but does a decent job of reducing eye strain when reading. The Mi Pad 3’s size really does make it a great video-consuming machine. The screen’s color and contrast can be tweaked under a separate menu, and we found it was worth taking the time to calibrate. Out of the box, in standard configuration, the whites didn’t appear crisp enough; but things improved when the display was switched to “cool.” Everyone will see it differently, which is why we welcome the chance to tailor the display’s look to our own taste. Playing HD video from Netflix and Crunchyroll produced great images filled with color, and while we enjoyed the viewing experience, the 4:3 aspect ratio adds black bars to the top and bottom of most videos.  Still, the Mi Pad 3’s size really does make it a great video-consuming machine. It’s not too big that it’s annoying to hold, but is still much more watchable than a 5.5-inch screen on a phone. Text looks excellent — crisp and well-defined — especially when browsing the web and reading ebooks. The screen looks great, but we have one annoyance. The tablet doesn’t compensate for your palm resting on one side while scrolling with another finger. At first, it’s like the touchscreen isn’t working at all, then you realize it’s because the hand you’re holding the tablet with is also touching the edge of the screen. Remove it, and everything’s fine. Other times, it can activate certain features. It depends on how you’re holding the Mi Pad 3 — so doesn’t happen all the time — but when it does it’s highly irritating. Fluid software, few tablet-friendly apps Our Mi Pad 3 came with Android 7.0 Nougat installed, complete with an Android security patch from February, and Xiaomi’s global MIUI version 8.2, so everything is in English. Google Play and associated apps came pre-installed on our imported Mi Pad 3, along with a variety of standard apps including a calendar, a weather app, a calculator, an FM radio, and a browser. Surprisingly, the tablet offers a slightly different user experience to a Xiaomi phone. Because it’s very smooth, and MIUI is supremely uncluttered, the tablet has a very Apple-like feel to it. The menus aren’t messy and it’s not filled with superfluous apps, making fast, daily use a pleasure. The most obvious additional feature Xiaomi has added is a widget page, viewable by swiping right on the main home screen. The widgets can be altered to your preference, making it a handy and attractively presented shortcut page. Using Netflix, YouTube, popular games, Google apps, and several big-name social network apps downloaded from the Google Play store provide a tablet-friendly experience, but stray too far from the best known apps, and things aren’t so good. You don’t even have to look that hard either, the Instagram app doesn’t feel like it has been adapted for use on a tablet very well, for example. The more obscure, or dated, your favourite app is, the less likely it’ll look that fantastic on the Mi Pad 3. This isn’t a problem with the device, but a problem with Android on tablets as a whole. There are other quirks unique to the Mi Pad 3. Even though it runs Android 7.0 Nougat, there’s no split window multi-tasking available with MIUI 8. Adequate performance Xiaomi previously used an Intel processor for its Mi Pad tablet, but this time it has chosen a MediaTek chip — the MT8176 — to power its slate, along with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage space. It’s not a common processor, having been used in few mainstream tablets sold in the U.S. and Europe. Put through some benchmarking workouts, the scores are uninspiring. In our general use, the MediaTek chip performed adequately, happily powering games such as Danmaku Unlimited in HD mode, and casual titles like Crossy Road. Graphically-intensive and faster-paced games like Reckless Racing put some strain on the tablet, and slow downs did occur. Put it through some benchmarking workouts, and the scores are uninspiring. AnTuTu returned a score of 74,646, and 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme gave it just 749. The Intel Atom-powered Lenovo Yoga Book managed 1,192, for comparison. Unfortunately, there’s no MicroSD memory expansion, and 32GB of internal memory isn’t very much. Be prepared to slim down movie and music collections stored on the device itself, or stick with streaming services. There is a 3.5mm headphone socket though, and the 6,600mAh battery is charged through a USB Type-C port. We’ve been using the Mi Pad 3 for almost two weeks, and it has needed charging twice, not including the initial charge. Leaving it on standby overnight saw around 7 or 8-percent of the battery disappear. Mediocre camera The rear camera on the Mi Pad 3 is packed with 13 megapixels, autofocus, and an f/2.2 aperture. It’s highly unlikely the Mi Pad 3 will ever be someone’s primary camera, and it’s probably a good thing. The pictures it takes are only acceptable, and nothing more. Colors do pop, and plenty of detail is revealed zooming in on close-up images; but it doesn’t have an HDR mode, and overcast skies were washed out. Around the front, there’s a 5-megapixel camera with the same aperture, and it’s good for video calls and selfies. Warranty, availability, and price The Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 isn’t sold in the U.S. or Europe, and must be imported through a specialist. Our review Mi Pad 3 was supplied by Geekbuying, a well-known importer of Chinese electronics. At the time of writing it costs $270 with free shipping. The tablet was sent to us with a courier, did attract a small customs charge in the U.K., and arrived securely packaged. Geekbuying offers a one-year warranty on the products it sells, including tablets, but doesn’t cover them if there has been water damage, mistreatment, or abuse. It’ll repair returned hardware for free within the warranty period, and has a warehouse in California that can be used instead of sending the device back to China. To take advantage of this, a $3 charge has to be paid at checkout during the original purchase. There’s also an English-speaking customer service helpline available. Our Take Unlike the company’s smartphones and their lack of wide U.S. network support, the Mi Pad 3 is a premium Xiaomi product everyone can enjoy, and its screen is great for video and reading. Is there a better alternative? The Mi Pad 3’s natural competitor is the Apple iPad Mini 4, which is at least $130 more; however, potential tablet buyers should really be looking at the new 2017 9.7-inch iPad, which starts at $330. That’s close enough to the Mi Pad 3’s price to make it attainable, and the iPad has a far more varied catalog of fully tablet-compatible apps that makes it a wiser choice if you’re planning to use the device a lot. We’d strongly recommend the iPad. If you’d prefer not to buy an Apple product, our favourite Android tablet at the moment is the Galaxy Tab S3, but this is more than twice the price of the Mi Pad 3. Outside of this, the world’s awash with mediocre to average Android tablets, including the $300 Samsung Galaxy Tab A and the Asus ZenPad Z10, or even the $135 Amazon Fire 8. We wouldn’t recommend any of them in particular, and feel the Mi Pad 3 is a more premium device that’s at least on a par with the Galaxy Tab A, provided you’re happy to import one. How long will it last? The Mi Pad 3 isn’t water resistant, but the body is well-built and the metal back won’t shatter if it gets accidentally knocked. That said, if you’re planning on handing the Mi pad 3 over to your kids, you may want to find a sturdy child-proof case. Xiaomi isn’t the fastest with supplying Android version updates, as they usually require its UI to be reworked first, which takes time. This does change if you’re happy to use Xiaomi beta releases though, but we doubt everyone will be happy to do so. Tablets aren’t the same as phones, and rarely need replacing. A three-year old tablet is far more capable than a three-year old smartphone. Many tablet owners just want to play video, browse the web, and check social media accounts. For this, the Mi Pad 3 will last for some time. Should you buy it? No. There’s nothing horribly wrong with the pretty, fast, and capable Mi Pad 3, but with Apple offering the new iPad for only $330, there’s not much of a reason to go for the Mi Pad 3. If Apple is a dirty word in your household, then it’s a different story, and the Mi Pad 3 stacks up nicely against the many similar options out there.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Weekly Rewind: Apple’s Siri speaker, solar… Weekly Rewind: Apple’s Siri speaker, solar startups, Charlize Theron’s ‘Atomic Blonde’ By Lulu Chang — Updated June 2, 2017 12:11 pm Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: A lot can happen in a week when it comes to tech. The constant onslaught of news makes it nigh impossible for mere mortals with real lives to keep track of everything. That’s why we’ve compiled a quick and dirty list of this week’s top 10 tech stories, from what to expect from WWDC to a Tesla-inspired pet carrier — it’s all here. Apple’s ‘Siri speaker’ may debut as early as next week It seems as if we’re just a few days away from Apple unveiling a Siri-enabled speaker similar to Amazon’s range of Echo devices and Google’s Home offering. The Cupertino company has started manufacturing the device, “people familiar with the matter” told Bloomberg this week, and it could be shown off during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference which kicks off in San Jose, California, on June 5. However, anyone keen to get their hands on the Siri-controlled smart speaker may have to exercise some patience, as the sources said it won’t be ready to ship until “later in the year.” Read the full story here. First clip from Charlize Theron’s ‘Atomic Blonde’ is as brutal as it is beautiful The first trailer for Charlize Theron’s upcoming film Atomic Blonde did not skimp on the action, so it’s no surprise that the first full clip from the July movie is one long, frantic, and impressively brutal fight sequence. But if that’s the sort of scene you can appreciate, the clip really is a fantastic thing to behold. Directed by John Wick co-director David Leitch (who’s also helming the upcoming Deadpool sequel), Atomic Blonde casts Academy Award winner Theron as a secret agent who will use anything at her disposal to complete a mission. The film’s script was penned by Kurt Johnstad (300, Act of Valor), and is based on the graphic novel The Coldest City, created by writer Antony Johnston and illustrator Sam Hart. Read the full story here. This Tesla-inspired pet carrier lets your cat seethe in style Pet carriers are usually more functional than fashionable, but Waul Studio wants to change that. Inspired by a Devon Rex cat named Marvin who looks like a “little alien,” the team decided to make an ergonomic pet carrier that suited him. Waul Studio debuted a carrier that resembles a spaceship on Kickstarter in May, and the campaign quickly exceeded its initial goal. The futuristic product doesn’t just look unique — it is designed to be more comfortable for both the pet that rides in it and the person who carries it. One of the upgrades animals will appreciate is an interior space that is designed to keep them entertained. Not only can they see outside the clear door, but there is also a built-in toy at the front of the carrier. A swirl-patterned ball in a track, the toy is meant to attract the animal’s attention and maintain it. Read the full story here. Amazon’s new retail bookstores have all of the books, but none of the charm Large book chains like Barnes & Noble have been shutting down bookstores for a decade now, which makes it a peculiar day when a new bookstore opens up in the heart of New York City. Even odder, it’s a physical store from Amazon, the online retailer whose Kindle ebook reader is a prime culprit in bookstore declines in the first place. But Amazon is always up to the task of transforming traditional experiences into opportunities that require you to use technology. Opening a physical bookstore may seem strange in 2017, but it’s no different than the release of Dash buttons or the opening of Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh food outlets. Amazon isn’t just on the web these days, it’s everywhere. Sadly, it has yet to learn what makes a bookstore great. Walking into NYC’s first Amazon Books location — the seventh bookstore it has opened nationwide — the 4,000 square foot space is packed with books, but barely feels like a bookstore. Sure, there are rows of books separated by genre, from Young Adult novels to cookbooks; and the space looks big, carrying thousands of titles, but it feels as packed as a train car during rush hour. The maze of bookshelves and extremely tiny seating area leaves no room to hide and zone out with a stack of comics or relax and absorb yourself in the prologue of a new novel.

Squeeze more out of your workouts with the best compression gear While many of the popular shooting sleeves we’ve seen slowly dominate NBA fashion as of late may be purely for aesthetic purposes, there are numerous pieces of compressive clothing on the market that come with actual kinesiological functionality. Compression gear increases blood flow to the muscles and may even minimize lactic acid build up, allowing you to recover faster while minimizing soreness during and after a workout. Although MIT researchers are already working on the next generation of microbial-enhanced “living clothing” to boost performance, there are plenty of compression garments currently available. From products designed to keep you cool during a workout, to responsive fiber networks designed to aid mobility and joint support, here are seven of our favorite pieces of compression gear.

Audi snags the first automated vehicle testing license in New York Fresh off its announcement at CES 2017 of a self-driving car by 2020, Audi said Wednesday that New York state had approved its application to test autonomous vehicles. The license is for Society of Automobile Engineers (SAE) Level 3 vehicles, which is reserved for cars capable of automated driving at highway speeds if certain conditions are met. To satisfy New York state regulations, two trained engineers will be in the car at all times, one in the driver’s seat and another in the back. These engineers will monitor the system and ensure the car is operating safely. So far, the company says the company has logged “thousands of miles” in its concept cars without an incident. Audi is the first automobile manufacturer to win a license to operate autonomous cars in the state, less than a month after Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the state would begin accepting applications. The test period runs through April 1, 2018, but comes with some fairly onerous stipulations to participate. Read the full story here. Switzerland’s new ‘air-scrubbing’ plant sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere A company in Switzerland recently unveiled the world’s first commercial so-called “air-scrubbing” plant designed to capture atmospheric carbon dioxide. At the 2015 Paris climate conference, 195 countries adopted the legally binding global climate deal aimed at limiting the rise in temperature to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit and air-scrubbing technologies are pivotal to this overall objective. The first of its kind direct air capture (DAC) unit utilizes 18 Climeworks carbon dioxide collectors on top of a waste utilization plant, KEZO, to filter CO2 from the atmosphere. This concentrated CO2 is then supplied to a greenhouse — located just a quarter mile down the road — where it is used as fertilizer to grow tomatoes and cucumbers. The DAC itself is powered by low-grade waste heat generated by the KEZO complex.

Google uses ‘Wonder Woman’ to inspire next generation of female programmers A recent study co-published by Google and Gallup states that just 48 percent of girls between seventh and 12th grade are “very confident” they could learn computer science, compared to 65 percent of boys. Clearly there’s an imbalance that has pervaded the field. And although tech companies have made strides in terms of representation, there’s still much work ahead. Even Google, it must be said, has come under fire in recent years for failing to do enough to fix the lack of diversity within its walls — especially where equal pay is concerned. And that brings us to this week. On Friday, Wonder Woman hits theaters, and Google is using the opportunity to take action. Read the full story here. Dragonflies are being genetically engineered into cybernetic drones Cybernetic insects may sound like something out of dystopian fiction, but they’re being developed in labs around the world. And their uses may be more beneficial than you’d expect. Some researchers have proposed remote-controlled insects for surveillance, while others think they can help sniff out explosives and aid in search and rescue missions. Up until now, these insects have mainly been controlled by firing electrical impulses through electrodes plugged into the little invertebrate — a technique that’s been effective but clunky and energy hungry.  Now engineers at Draper and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) at Janelia Farm have begun work on DragonflEye, a project to develop a more sophisticated technique that may usher in an evolution for cybernetic insects.

Startup’s solar roof is cheaper, more efficient, and easier to install than Tesla’s solar tiles The solar roofing competition is heating up, and one company in particular is looking to challenge Tesla head-on. Californian upstart Forward Labs has its own solar roof design, and not only is it cheaper than Tesla’s, but it allegedly installs in half the time as well. Technologically speaking, Forward Labs’s solar roof is slightly different than Tesla’s. The startup’s innovative design uses monocrystalline solar cells, which have a higher energy density than most other solar products. As such, these solar cells can achieve 19 watts per square foot compared to 11W per square foot for other solar cells. Aesthetically, the overall design of the Forward Labs roof is notably different from Tesla’s as well. The Tesla roof is designed to mimic the classic rooftop shingle model, with each solar shingle made from three basic layers: a solar cell, a masking film, and a top layer of tempered glass. Conversely, Forward Labs’s design uses a single, fully-integrated standing-seam metal design with a similar tempered glass top layer. Read the full story here.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple, Inc.'s WWDC: What to Expect Expect new software. But new hardware could steal the show. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Jun 2, 2017 at 9:07PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to kick off its 2017 Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) on Monday morning, at 10:00 a.m. PDT. As Apple does every summer, the week-long event will begin with a keynote to make software announcements -- and possibly some hardware announcements, too. Ahead of Apple's important event, here's a preview of some key areas to watch next week. Image source: Apple. Software The one area where Apple will definitely make some announcements is software. Each summer, the company uses WWDC to show off new features for operating systems, including iOS, MacOS, TVOS, and WatchOS. Beyond a preview of its upcoming operating system updates for iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, one area of software that may get more attention than usual this year is Siri. At the core of Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) efforts, the smart assistant is arguably falling behind AI voice assistants from other tech giants. Siri particularly needs to get up to speed as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to prove consumer interest in voice-activated smart speakers with its line of Echo devices. During the holiday season last year, Amazon said sales of its Amazon Echo products were up more than 900% compared to the same period in 2015. Further, Amazon said Echo and Echo dot were the best-selling products on Amazon during the entire year of 2016. Services As Apple continues to attempt to shift investor attention toward the company's thriving services business, Apple's most important services are likely to get some attention during the company's keynote. Apple Music's Jimmy Iovine recently told Bloomberg that Apple wants to make TV programs more centric to Apple Music. Perhaps Apple will announce a refresh that does a better job of promoting original video programming, just as Apple prepares to release Carpool Karaoke in August. "Carpool Karaoke." Image source: Apple.https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/05/carpool-karaoke-the-series-debuts-august-8-on-apple-music/ Beyond Apple Music, Apple has been rumored to be looking into a peer-to-peer payment system, which could possibly integrate with Apple Pay. Maybe Apple will announce this feature on Monday. Hardware If speculation in the ever-active rumor mill ahead of WWDC is onto something, Apple could make one announcement that could steal the show on Monday. The company is rumored to be joining the smart-speaker hype with its own Siri speaker. While the details about the rumored product haven't surfaced, it's likely it will play a key role in extending the reach of Apple's HomeKit, or its app for operating smart devices. Of course, the product would likely also seamlessly integrate with Apple Music and other Apple software and services. By debuting a Siri Speaker at WWDC, Apple would be able to get developers on board with creating third-party apps for the speaker. Developers have proven to be integral to Amazon's Echo speakers. Amazon said in its most recent quarterly update that the Alexa Skills store now offers more than 12,000 skills for Echo. Apple will need healthy developer participation for a Siri Speaker to be a hit with customers. While important details about Apple's smart speaker, such as price, whether it has a display, or what it might look like, remain unknown, Bloomberg asserted earlier this week that Apple has already started production of the new device. Apple will livestream its event on Monday morning. Stay tuned at The Motley Fool for a look at what Monday's announcements mean for Apple's business. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

 Apple will open Siri to new kinds of apps at next week's conference, but it won't try to match Amazon's wide breadth Reuters Jun. 2, 2017, 8:41 PM 11,322 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook AP By Stephen Nellis Apple is expected to announce plans next week to make its Siri voice assistant work with a larger variety of apps, as the technology company looks to counter the runaway success of Amazon.com Inc's competing Alexa service. But the Cupertino, California company is likely to stick to its tested method of focusing on a small amount of features and trying to perfect them, rather than casting as wide a net as possible, according to engineers and artificial intelligence industry insiders. Currently, Apple's Siri works with only six types of app: ride-hailing and sharing; messaging and calling; photo search; payments; fitness; and auto infotainment systems. At the company's annual developer conference next week, it is expected to add to those categories. Some industry-watchers have also predicted Apple will announce hardware similar to Amazon's Echo device for the home, which has been a hot-seller recently. Apple declined comment. But even if Siri doubles its areas of expertise, it will be a far cry from the 12,000 or so tasks that Amazon.com's Alexa can handle. The difference illustrates a strategic divide between the two tech rivals. Apple is betting that customers will not use voice commands without an experience similar to speaking with a human, and so it is limiting what Siri can do in order to make sure it works well. Amazon puts no such restrictions on Alexa, wagering that the voice assistant with the most "skills," its term for apps on its Echo assistant devices, will gain a loyal following, even if it sometimes makes mistakes and takes more effort to use. The clash of approaches is coming to a head as virtual assistants that respond to voice commands become a priority for the leading tech companies, which want to find new ways of engaging customers and make more money from shopping and online services. Path to money Amazon's Alexa-enabled Echo Dot Steve Kovach/Business Insider Now, an iPhone user can say, "Hey Siri, I'd like a ride to the airport" or "Hey Siri, order me a car," and Siri will open the Uber or Lyft ride service app and start booking a trip. Apart from some basic home and music functions, Alexa needs more specific directions, using a limited set of commands such as "ask" or "tell." For example, "Alexa, ask Uber for a ride," will start the process of summoning a car, but "Alexa, order me an Uber" will not, because Alexa does not make the connection that it should open the Uber "skill." After some setup, Alexa can order a pizza from Domino's, while Siri cannot get a pie because food delivery is not - so far - one of the categories of apps that Apple has opened up to Siri. "In typical Apple fashion, they've allowed for only a few use cases, but they do them very well," said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, maker of an intelligent assistant app. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company does not comment on its plans for developers. Amazon said in a statement: "Our goal is to make speaking with Alexa as natural and easy as possible, so we’re looking at ways to improve this over time." Side dish, not entree Apple's narrower focus could become a problem, said Matt McIlwain, a venture capitalist with Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group. The potential of Apple's original iPhone did not come to light until thousands of developers started building apps. McIlwain said he expects Apple to add new categories at its Worldwide Developers Conference next week, but not nearly enough to match Alexa's number of skills. "To attract developers in the modern world, you need a platform," McIlwain said. "If Apple does not launch a 'skills store,' that would be a mistake." Neither Siri nor Alexa has a clear path to making money. Siri works as an additional tool for controlling traditional apps, and Apple pays money to owners of those apps. Alexa's skills are free, and developers are not paid. At the moment, because of their limits, voice apps are "a side dish, not the entree," according to Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Amazon was wise to not commit to an economic model at such an early state, Etzioni said. "Once a successful economic model for developers emerges, people are going to gravitate to it."

Saint John, also known as "Boz," joined Apple when the company acquired Beats Music in 2014. She came into the public spotlight at the 2016 Worldwide Developers Conference, where she demonstrated new Apple Music features on stage. Since then, Saint John has spoken at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit, starred in an Apple Music ad alongside Eddy Cue, Jimmy Iovine, and James Corden, and represented Apple Music in interviews along with Larry Jackson and Zane Lowe. It is not clear where Saint John, who formerly worked at Pepsi, will be heading after she leaves Apple. Her reason for leaving is also unclear, with Apple declining to comment on the news. 112 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) patrick001 2 days ago at 06:36 pm I cautiously enquire why you think this?

Rating: 15 Votes JGIGS 2 days ago at 06:10 pm If I remember correctly, she had a good stage presence and kept my attention. With that being said, Apple Music app on the iPhone and Mac need a clean slate so maybe this can be good? She was head of marketing so not really responsible for the software. Rating: 13 Votes jdillings 2 days ago at 08:54 pm Good riddance. I agree. She was horrible. She was another lousy exec that Apple got from buying Beats. Now let's hope Jimmy Iovine is next to leave. [doublepost=1496462804][/doublepost] All I can say though is that when she was on stage, I had to cringe when she tried getting everyone to clap or dance along to some song she played... :eek: It was as cringeworthy as Cue's dancing. The only Apple exec who doesn't embarrass himself/herself is Hair Force One. Rating: 12 Votes Glassed Silver 2 days ago at 07:32 pm People said that about Forstall too. Perhaps there is a pattern here… :eek: To be frank, I really have to eat crow here and laugh about my former self who celebrated his departure. Nowadays I really wish he'd come back and take over. He might have had his disagreements with he who shall not be named, but he strikes me as one of the better visionaries for the company. I don't know him personally, but just the fact that he was let go by the guy who changed Apple's direction so very much leads me to believe that he was in the way. I doubt it was Apple Maps only, because in the end the launch of a service or product probably still needs Tim's signature as well. [USER=454744]@TOPIC[/USER]: Didn't like her appearance on last year's WWDC, but I'm sure that she's been very good at her other jobs. As for Apple Music and iTunes marketing, I think that one had some very positive changes from before, but also some bad ones. Overall I think that a good talent is leaving Apple and I wish her the very best for her future career. Glassed Silver:ios Rating: 11 Votes Ghosts 2 days ago at 05:46 pm Good riddance.

Climate Deal Decision Watch These NSFW Deadpool Bloopers While We Wait For The Sequel What To Expect From Apple WWDC 2017: iOS, Siri Speaker And MacBooks Michael Nunez Jun 3, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple feature ios 11 macbook macbook air macos siri video feature wwdc wwdc 2017 Share On Tuesday, Apple's annual developer conference, WWDC, kicks off, and that means we will soon learn more about the company's newest and most exciting products. This year, the event runs from June 5 to June 9 (June 6 to June 10 in Australia) and is expected to serve as the launching point for major updates to iOS and macOS, as well as some new hardware. Image: Apple This will be the first time in roughly 15 years that Apple will not be hosting the event at the Moscone West Convention Center in San Francisco. Instead, the event will take place at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. We'll be on the ground at the conference, so be sure to check back for our coverage beginning Tuesday morning. There's plenty to be excited about this year, so let's dive right in. A new iPad Pro Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz WWDC is typically centred around software like iOS and macOS, but this year we're expecting some hardware too. The extremely credible KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says there's a good chance Apple will announce a new iPad Pro at this year's conference. The new iPad Pro is rumoured to have a 10.5-inch screen that will fit comfortably between the existing 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models. It will also reportedly feature a new design with slimmer bezels. There's no indication of exactly how much the new device will cost — but there's a very good chance it will be priced similarly to existing models (starting at about $850). Siri speaker Image: Apple The new iPad Pro isn't the only piece of hardware expected to debut at the conference. Kuo also predicts that Apple is planning to launch a smart speaker to compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home. In a research note viewed by MacRumors, Kuo reportedly said there is "over [a] 50 per cent chance" that Apple will announce its new smart home speaker and begin selling them later in the year. Kuo said the speaker will likely produce excellent sound quality and will positioned for a higher end market (that is, it will be more expensive) than the Amazon Echo. Adding to swirling rumours, the extremely credible Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman reported this week that Apple "started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker". Gurman reports that the speaker will differ from the Amazon Echo and Google home by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration into Apple products. The speaker will essentially serve as a hub to automate smart home devices through Apple's (currently underdeveloped) HomeKit platform. It will also help lock customers into Apple's walled garden as people begin to add more automation to their homes and subscribe to services like Apple Music. Gurman also reports that the speaker will have advanced acoustics that give it an edge over competing products such as the Echo and Google Home, and that Apple considered adding virtual surround sound technology similar to Sonos Trueplay. It will also have comparable hardware to the Sonos Play:5 according to Kuo's research note, which says the speaker will have one subwoofer, seven tweeters, and computing power similar to the iPhone 6/6S. By comparison, as Mac Observer points out, the Echo only has one woofer and one tweeter. The Sonos Play:5 only has three woofers and three tweeters. In short, the soon-to-be-announced Siri speaker sounds much more powerful than Google Home or Amazon Echo. New MacBook and MacBook Pros Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz It looks all-but-certain that we'll be getting a new MacBook lineup at the conference. French website Consomac is reporting that it found a Russian-language regulatory filing in the Eurasian Economic Commission database that points to at least five new models running macOS Sierra launching soon. In addition to the filing, Bloomberg reports Apple will be releasing a new MacBook lineup to stave off competition from Microsoft's striking new Surface Laptop. The new MacBook Pro will get a bump to the latest seventh-generation Intel Core processors, giving it a significant hardware boost. One of the more remarkable rumours is that Apple could revive the 12-inch and 13-inch MacBook Airs by giving them a nice hardware bump, according to Bloomberg. Analysts aren't expecting any major design changes to either the MacBook or MacBook Pro, but say the new MacBook Air could have a new look. John Gruber reported in April that Apple is working hard on a "completely rethought" Mac Pro with a modular design. The new design is supposed to accommodate high-end CPUs and GPUs, and make it easier for people to update the computer with new components on a regular basis. The company is also working on pro displays to ship with the new desktops. Unfortunately, Gruber reports that the next-gen Mac Pros "will not ship this year", meaning they likely will not make an appearance at WWDC. A first look at iOS 11 Image: Gizmodo Don't get your hopes up for new iPhone models. They probably aren't coming until later this year. What you can expect at WWDC, though, is a big focus on Apple's new mobile operating system, iOS 11. We don't know much about the OS ahead of the show, but we're expecting a bunch of updates that focus on artificial intelligence. A sketchy rumour from Israeli publication the Verifier suggests that Siri will add contextual learning and better integration into Apple services like iMessage and iCloud. Other updates to the operating system, according to 9to5Mac, could include features like group FaceTime, meaning that you'll be able to video conference multiple people from your phone. There's also a rumour that iMessage will add multi-person calls, making it easier to have up to five people join a single call. The most dramatic changes will be specifically tailored to the iPad. 9to5Mac reports that things such as multi-user login are to be added to the operating system, while other blogs like MacRumors suggest Apple is working on expanded Apple Pencil support for the iPad Pro. Updates to macOS, WatchOS and tvOS Last year, Apple decided to drop the "X" from its desktop operating system's name, instead calling it simply macOS. As part of the update, Apple started integrating even more iOS features into the desktop with things such as Siri for Mac and Apple Pay for the web. This year, we're expecting to see the second iteration of macOS (10.13), but there aren't any hard details about what exactly. We should also see updates to other operating systems including WatchOS for the Apple Watch and tvOS for the Apple TV, according to the Telegraph. This essentially means that every operating system in the Apple ecosystem will receive a significant update, and that seems like a reasonable expectation considering the event is specifically tailored to get developers excited about building apps for Apple products. As always, we'll be covering the conference as news breaks, so be sure to check back here June 6 to June 10 for more info about the latest updates.

Here's what they had to say. NYPD Fails To Convince Court Its Deafening Sound Cannon Is Just A 'Communication Tool' Sidney Fussell 03 Jun 2017 1:00 PM On Wednesday, a US federal judge ruled that the sound emitted from the NYPD's Long Range Acoustic Devices -- portable sound cannons that blast noise -- could be considered a use of force, contrary to the police department's claims. The LRAD can blast sound as loudly as 136 decibels. That's louder than a jackhammer or a jet engine and above the 120 db threshold for immediate human hearing loss. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

Having already crushed Apple and Samsung in China, the world's third most popular smartphone manufacturer has its sights set on Down Under. With the highly impressive Mate 9 already leaving its mark, Huawei has again thrown its hat in the ring with its latest Android phones - the P10 and P10 Plus. DESIGN The P10 and P10 plus have 5.1-inch and 5.5-inch LCD displays, offering 1920x1080 and 2560x1440 pixels, respectively. Shifting away from the design of the Mate 9, Huawei's latest flagship looks very similar to Apple's 2014 iPhone 6S - great news for those who like the iPhone design but not iOS. The fingerprint scanner has been removed from the rear of the device and placed below the display, where it also doubles as a physical home button. While this is supposed to make the device easier to hold, I prefer the button the back as it offers more screen space and the option of pull down notifications. It has smooth, curved corners, minimal side bezels and is available in gold and blue and black. While it might look very similar to an iPhone, the P10 is different as it has chosen to keep the headphone jack and also the USB-C charging port. Huawei has also opted to keep full-metal body on the rear of the device unlike some of its competitors that use glass. CAMERA Continued below. Related Content SpaceX launches first recycled supply ship Fran O'Sullivan: English must send Trump a message Trump ditches Paris - what it means for NZ Like its predecessor flagship smartphone, the Leica-branded dual camera set up is one of the best aspects of the device. Located flush at the top left of the device is the dual camera set up, which has a 12MP RGB sensor working alongside 20MP monochrome shooter. Both sensors capture images independently and them combine them into one photo - this is supposed enhance detail and contrast. One of the improvements with the camera is the f/1.8 aperture of the P10 Plus - f/2.2 on the P10 - which claims to bring brighter photos regardless of the shutter speed. Unfortunately, the camera still does have it's struggles under very poor lighting. The camera app is excellent and offers more experienced snappers to shoot in a "Pro" mode, where users can customise settings like shutter speed, white balance and ISO. Huawei's P10 and P10 Plus also offer a front-facing 8MP camera, which includes a Leica-branded portrait mode. Shooting in portrait will use new facial tracking software that detects more than 190 points on the human face to ensure the camera focuses for the best shot. Portrait mode also combines the fake bokeh effect and beauty mode seen on other devices from the Chinese manufacturer. Both devices also shoot 4K video. EVERYTHING ELSE Both models offer Huawei SuperCharge, which can take the battery from 0 to 25 per cent in 15 minutes or 0 to 88 per cent in an hour. Sadly the 3,200mAh of the P10 does not offer the greatest lifespan per charge, although it is also far from the worst on the market. If battery is a huge issue, you would be better to go for the Plus, which has an impressive 3,750mAh power pack. Unlike the iPhone, Samsung and Sony flagships, the P10 and P10 Plus are not water and dust resistant, which could be a deal breaker for those who find extra comfort in the setting. While the phone is durable, includes a clear protective case in the box - bound to please those wanting to showcase the colour of the device. In terms of functionality, both phones use Google's Android 7.0 Nougat OS customised gently with the Huawei Emotion 5.1 user interface. All in all, the P10 and P10 Plus showcase why Huawei has become a force to be reckoned with in the global smartphone market. While I will likely return to my S8 for daily use, I feel these devices would be the perfect fit for someone wanting a different alternative to the iPhone, without confusing them too much. The Huawei P10, P10 Plus cost AU$899 (NZ$935) and $1099 (NZ$1145) respectively. - news.com.au By Matthew Dunn Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Moe Slah Fresh leak sheds new light on the iPhone 8’s display Yoni Heisler @edibleapple June 2nd, 2017 at 7:12 PM Share Tweet All eyes will be laser focused on Apple’s WWDC announcements next week, but that’s not to say that the influx of iPhone 8 rumors will ground to a halt. On the contrary, the frequency of iPhone 8 leaks has only increased over the last few days alone. What’s more, we’re now starting to get a firmer grasp on the precise dimensions of Apple’s next-gen iPhone. Don't Miss: Samsung’s about to launch a new version of the Galaxy S8 Earlier today, prolific leaker Benjamin Geskin published a new schematic which sheds some more light on the exact dimensions of the iPhone 8’s display. As previously rumored, the iPhone 8 design will feature an edgeless OLED display with the Touch ID sensor embedded into the display itself. While some leaked schematics have pointed to an iPhone 8 with a Touch ID sensor embedded on the back, it’s now widely believed that those schematics were early iPhone prototypes that Apple has since abandoned. #iPhone8 Display Size (5.66-inch with rounded corners, full 5.8 approximately) pic.twitter.com/osFzoKtuty — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) June 2, 2017 The drawing above appears to align closely with similar iPhone 8 rumors we’ve seen over the past few days and should be a close approximation to the device Apple will actually ship later this year. Indeed, a number of other credible sources have also relayed that the iPhone 8 will feature a display in the 5.8-inch range. This coalesces with other reports claiming that the iPhone 8 will feature a display similar in size to the iPhone 7 Plus, albeit in a form factor similar to the iPhone 7. Though there has been speculation that the iPhone 8 will be the exact same size as the iPhone 7, more recent reports suggest that the iPhone 8 design will be just a tad larger, in terms of height, width, and thickness. The following photo purport to show what this size difference will look like, with the iPhone 8 being positioned in the middle. And in case you missed it yesterday, the following photo provides us with a clearer understanding of what the iPhone 8 design will look like when measured up against a slew of other top tier smartphones, including the Galaxy S8 and the Google Pixel. Image Source: OnLeaks For even more context, the following render gives us an even better idea as to what the final iPhone 8 design is going to look like, though it’s extremely unlikely that the two flaps below — to the left and right of the camera — will be used as illustrated below.

The update for iPhones and iPads could come with features for Siri and Apple Music. Read: Siri Speaker To Be Unveiled At WWDC, Apple Already Manufacturing Device Overseas — Report Here’s a roundup of expected iOS 11 features and other rumors: Siri For iOS 11, Apple is rumored to be revamping Siri with contextual learning abilities and deep integration with iMessage and iCloud, Israeli site the Verifier reported in March. The virtual assistant is expected to get an improved level of artificial intelligence. Siri reportedly will be able to follow through with voice commands, have the ability to learn a user’s habits and offer action options based on context of content, somewhat resembling Samsung’s voice assistant Bixby. Siri also will be more productive in iMessage by giving users restaurant recommendations and allowing people to make reservations or book an Uber within the app. For iCloud, Siri is expected to identify connections among multiple devices under an Apple ID account. iOS 11’s Siri boost will help Apple compete with other artificial intelligence technology, including Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant. It was reported this year that Apple has 1,000 engineers working on augmented reality in Israel. Another report also backed the claim that Apple would revamp Siri this year. Apple Music iOS 11 reportedly will come with an improved Music app to propel Apple’s original video content above other streaming services. The company has already been pushing original content on Apple Music. Apple recently released its exclusive documentary on former One Direction singer Harry Styles on Apple Music, and last week it released the trailer for the upcoming documentary about Bad Boy Records, the label founded by Sean Combs. The movie, called "Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A Bad Boy Story," is set to be released June 25 on Apple Music. The company also announced its first show, “Carpool Karaoke: The Series,” will release in August. Read: iPhone 8 Rumors: Alleged Images Of Apple Smartphone Show Touch ID On Back Of Device, Matte Black Model Apple is expected to release as many as 10 original shows and documentaries by the end of this year, including will.i.am’s "Planet of the Apps" and documentaries about hip-hop label Cash Money Records and music impresario Clive Davis. The new Music app on iOS 11 reportedly will work to direct users to original content. FaceTime iOS 11 also will revamp FaceTime by allowing group calls, the Verifier said in January. The FaceTime boost will help Apple against competitors like Skype and Facebook Messenger. iOS 11 To Disrupt Apps? Although iOS 11 could bring new features that would improve iPhones and iPads, another report said the update might terminate support for 32-bit apps, which could make those apps and older games unable to run. You can watch WWDC’s keynote address on June 5 to see if Apple releases information on the upcoming update.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Apple’s Siri is expected to remain limited to a small set of tasks Reuters June 2, 2017 4:55 PM Above: The Apple logo on the side of the company's new retail store in downtown San Francisco, Calif. on May 21, 2016. Image Credit: Ken Yeung / VentureBeat (Reuters) – Apple is expected to announce plans next week to make its Siri voice assistant work with a larger variety of apps, as the technology company looks to counter the runaway success of Amazon’s competing Alexa service. But the Cupertino, California company is likely to stick to its tested method of focusing on a small amount of features and trying to perfect them, rather than casting as wide a net as possible, according to engineers and artificial intelligence industry insiders. Currently, Apple’s Siri works with only six types of app: ride-hailing and sharing; messaging and calling; photo search; payments; fitness; and auto infotainment systems. At the company’s annual developer conference next week, it is expected to add to those categories. Some industry-watchers have also predicted Apple will announce hardware similar to Amazon’s Echo device for the home, which has been a hot-seller recently. Apple declined comment. But even if Siri doubles its areas of expertise, it will be a far cry from the 12,000 or so tasks that Amazon.com’s Alexa can handle. The difference illustrates a strategic divide between the two tech rivals. Apple is betting that customers will not use voice commands without an experience similar to speaking with a human, and so it is limiting what Siri can do in order to make sure it works well. Amazon puts no such restrictions on Alexa, wagering that the voice assistant with the most “skills,” its term for apps on its Echo assistant devices, will gain a loyal following, even if it sometimes makes mistakes and takes more effort to use. The clash of approaches is coming to a head as virtual assistants that respond to voice commands become a priority for the leading tech companies, which want to find new ways of engaging customers and make more money from shopping and online services. Path to the money Now, an iPhone user can say, “Hey Siri, I’d like a ride to the airport” or “Hey Siri, order me a car,” and Siri will open the Uber or Lyft ride service app and start booking a trip. Apart from some basic home and music functions, Alexa needs more specific directions, using a limited set of commands such as “ask” or “tell.” For example, “Alexa, ask Uber for a ride,” will start the process of summoning a car, but “Alexa, order me an Uber” will not, because Alexa does not make the connection that it should open the Uber “skill.” After some setup, Alexa can order a pizza from Domino’s, while Siri cannot get a pie because food delivery is not – so far – one of the categories of apps that Apple has opened up to Siri. “In typical Apple fashion, they’ve allowed for only a few use cases, but they do them very well,” said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, maker of an intelligent assistant app. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company does not comment on its plans for developers. Amazon said in a statement: “Our goal is to make speaking with Alexa as natural and easy as possible, so we’re looking at ways to improve this over time.” Side dish, not entree Apple’s narrower focus could become a problem, said Matt McIlwain, a venture capitalist with Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group. The potential of Apple’s original iPhone did not come to light until thousands of developers started building apps. McIlwain said he expects Apple to add new categories at its Worldwide Developers Conference next week, but not nearly enough to match Alexa’s number of skills. “To attract developers in the modern world, you need a platform,” McIlwain said. “If Apple does not launch a ‘skills store,’ that would be a mistake.” Neither Siri nor Alexa has a clear path to making money. Siri works as an additional tool for controlling traditional apps, and Apple pays money to owners of those apps. Alexa’s skills are free, and developers are not paid. At the moment, because of their limits, voice apps are “a side dish, not the entree,” according to Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Amazon was wise to not commit to an economic model at such an early state, Etzioni said. “Once a successful economic model for developers emerges, people are going to gravitate to it.” (Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Peter Henderson and Bill Rigby) VB Recommendations Why shortcuts for Google Home are a total waste of time Are chatbots just another fad?

It seems HTC agreed, because its new flagship, the HTC U11, is here and it's better in almost every way. Priced at $649, the HTC U11 features a big, bright, 5.5-inch screen; markedly faster performance; and a camera that rivals the best from Samsung and Apple, all while sporting a gorgeous, gem-like design. But the highlights don't stop there, because the U11 packs a total of four microphones, two voice assistants (with a third on the way) and built-in pressure sensors that let you open apps by squeezing the sides of the phone. After HTC produced a string of middling devices, the U11 is exactly what the company needed to remind people that it's still alive.  Availability In stores, the U11 is exclusive to Sprint. However, if you buy online, you can get this phone unlocked. There are carrier-specific versions of the U11 for all the big providers on Amazon or directly from HTC.com. Design: A symphony in glass There's no shortage of glass-backed phones nowadays, but I defy you to you find one (aside from the U Ultra) that looks like the U11. For the U11's back, HTC started with a single flat sheet of Gorilla Glass 3 and squashed it into progressively curvier molds to form a smooth, rounded back that looks more like sci-fi jewel scarab than a piece of consumer tech.  Below the display, you get a combo fingerprint sensor that also doubles as a capacitive-touch home button, along with two more touch buttons on either side, for Back and Recent Apps. The lock button on the right side sports a jagged texture, so you can recognize it by feel, while the smooth volume rocker sits above that. The U11's top edge features a removable SIM tray with space for a microSD card when you want to add some additional capacity to the U11's built-in 64GB of storage. Some folks may take issue with the U11's sizable bezels on top and bottom now that we live in an age of super-skinny smartphone designs. But for me, the bigger issue is that the bezels on top and bottom are different widths. Had they been the same, the phone would look a little more balanced and a bit less bulky, though with its 5.5-inch display and 16:9 aspect ratio, the U11 was never going to be a truly compact device.  Measuring 6.06 x 2.99 x 0.31-inches and weighing 5.96 ounces, the HTC U11 is practically the same size as the Google Pixel XL (6.09 x 2.98 x 0.33 inches and 5.93 ounces). However, compare the U11 to the Galaxy S8 (5.86 x 2.68 x 0.31 inches and 5.47 ounces), and Samsung's flagship feels significantly smaller and sleeker. That's despite the S8 having a total screen area that's actually slightly larger, thanks to its 18.5:9 aspect-ratio display. A simple squeeze of the U11's sides can open an app or even take a picture. Like any good flagship smartphone in 2017, the U11 boasts IP67 water resistance, so you won't have to worry about any spills or dips in the sink trashing your device.  Edge Sense: Do we really need a squeezable phone? Moto has its Moto Actions gesture commands, and Huawei has its Knuckle Sense shortcuts. But with Edge Sense, HTC might have the weirdest motion controls of them all. You don't make movements with your hands or draw letters on the screen; instead, the U11 features pressure sensors built into the sides of the phone, so a simple squeeze can open an app or even take a picture. By default, Edge Sense is set to open the camera when you squeeze the phone, but you can reprogram the feature to open pretty much any app on the device or toggle functions like the flashlight or Wi-Fi. Depending on what you choose, Edge Sense even has a bit of contextual smarts, letting you perform different tasks with the same simple action. For instance, you can open the camera on the first squeeze and then snap a pic on the second. Edge Sense's advanced settings will also let you add a second function for when you squeeze and hold the phone. The 5.5-inch QHD display delivers on the three most important qualities of a good screen: brightness, color and accuracy. The best use of Edge Sense is probably for taking a selfie, since your hands will likely be in the correct position to give the phone a little hand hug. However, I've found that even when Edge Sense's was set to its most sensitive pressure setting, trying to squeeze the phone while posing for a shot caused the device to shake more than if I had just tapped on the screen. In fact, the action of squeezing the U11 makes holding the phone that much trickier. While it didn't happen to me, because I went out of my way to be super careful, I wouldn't be surprised to hear about people dropping the U11 while trying to squeeze it.  MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market Now Display: Big and bright The 5.5-inch QHD display on the HTC U11 keeps things simple and delivers on the three most important qualities of a good screen: brightness, color and accuracy. You don't get pure blacks like you would on a phone with an OLED display (such as the Pixel or Galaxy S8), but the U11 still offers pretty solid contrast. Initially, the U11 had a somewhat cool color casting that accentuated blues and downplayed warmer tones, but a quick trip to the phone's color-temperature setting makes it easy to adjust the screen however you want. In practically no time, I had the crimson and neon green blaster bolts shooting out from the X-wings and TIE fighters in The Last Jedi trailer looking exactly how I wanted. That's a nice bit of customizability that not every phone offers.  With the adaptive brightness on, we got the HTC U11 to hit a peak output of 512 nits. That puts it a fair bit ahead the Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel XL, which hit 437 nits and 396 nits, respectively. With its stereo BoomSound speakers and noise-cancelling headphones, the HTC U11 offers the best overall listening experience of any phone on the market. The U11 also earned some of the highest marks for color accuracy we've seen in recent history, as it notched a Delta-E rating of 0.34 (numbers closer to zero are better). The S8 was equally as good, with a rating of 0.36, while the Pixel was pretty far off, at 5.88.  As for color range, the U11's LCD display didn't fare quite as well as some of its AMOLED-equipped competition. Still, with a gamut that covered 166 percent of the sRGB spectrum, the U11 wasn't that far off the respective 183 percent and 191 percent tallies of the Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel XL. Audio: Punchy stereo speakers, but no headphone jack With its stereo BoomSound speakers and included noise-cancelling headphones, the HTC U11 offers the best overall listening experience of any phone on the market. But there's one big downer: Like other recent HTC phones, the U11 lacks a headphone jack.  The U11's BoomSound setup uses the bottom-firing speaker in tandem with the earpiece to put out a truly impressive amount of sound. The feature makes phones with single-speaker setups, like the Galaxy S8, sound embarrassingly bad, and when you put the U11 up against phones, like the iPhone 7, with similar two-speaker arrangements, the U11 stills wins on both volume and sound quality. MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked Smartphones When you want to listen to things a bit more privately, HTC includes a pair of special USB-C earbuds that automatically create a personalized audio profile specifically tuned for your ears. On top of that, HTC uses the tiny mics built into the earbuds to provide true noise cancellation, which should be a big boon to anyone listening to music on a plane or train. I also appreciate how HTC includes three different size tips for its earbuds to help ensure a better fit.  The U11's 12-megapixel rear camera produced stunning shots, putting HTC on an equal footing with camera phones from Apple, Google and Samsung. But there's a downside: Even though HTC has thoughtfully included a dongle so you can still use your old-school headphones, the adaptive audio and noise-cancelling tech needs both the USB-C audio processing and HTC's custom earbuds to function. In other words, those special features won't work on third-party headphones. Cameras: New heights for HTC It seems like HTC has been promising big things from its Ultrapixel cameras forever, and on the U11, the company has really delivered. The U11's 12-megapixel rear camera produced stunning shots, putting HTC on an equal footing with phone cameras from Apple, Google and Samsung. I especially liked some of the low-light shots I got, which looked noticeably brighter and less grainy compared to images from the S8.  During the daytime, the U11 also wowed, offering a more restrained counterpoint to the super-rich and saturated shots captured by the Galaxy S8. On the front, though, the U11's 16-MP selfie cam was less compelling than I hoped. The Flower Shot A picture of a flower can tell you a lot of things about a camera, and while neither the Galaxy S8 nor the U11 nailed it 100 percent, HTC's phone still impressed. This comparison exposes the S8's tendency to oversaturate colors, which resulted in unnaturally vivid magenta petals instead of the softer pink tones you see from the U11. The S8's picture is just a tad sharper, though a few areas could be called oversharp. The Food Shot In the contest to see which phone shoots a better burger, the U11 came out on top. It's close, but the U11's pic looks warmer; features more-accurate colors; offers better details in the bun, bacon and onion rings; and simply made the sandwich look more delicious. In fact, when I asked my co-workers to pick which phone's photo they prefered, every single person chose the U11's pic. The Outdoors Shot In the last of the daylight comparisons, the S8 hit back hard with a shot that beat the U11's pic in almost every aspect: color, sharpness, detail, you name it. The S8's pic even did a better job of preserving the baby blue sky in the background. The Low-Light Close-Up Shot At night, when I took a minute to snap my growing family of plushies, the U11 showed some serious low-light skills, producing a better-exposed, less grainy picture than the Galaxy S8 did. Meanwhile, the S8's shot looked overly yellow, and without the S8's pic as a comparison, you might not even know this was a low-light shot at all. MORE: Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7 Camera Shootout: Samsung Has the Edge The Outdoors Low-Light Shot In even less light, the U11 once again wowed, with a nighttime shot that's noticeably brighter and less noisy than the S8's photo. In the S8's image, you lose a lot of detail in the darker sections in the foreground, and the overly yellow white balance give the plants a sickly, unpleasant appearance.   In general, I found that the U11 outperforms the S8 is many low-light scenarios, though results can vary. When I walked just a bit farther and took a shot of a nearby pool, the S8's shot was clearly superior, as the U11's photo showed worse exposure and white balance. Selfies With a 16-MP front cam that captures double the resolution of the Galaxy S8, you might expect the U11 to come out firmly ahead. However, that wasn't the case. Quite often, the S8's front camera produced sharper, more-detailed photos than the U11 did. Yes, the background in the U11's pic is better-exposed, but if you look at things like my hair or shirt, it's clear how much better the S8's pic is. Performance: As fast as it gets When you combine Qualcomm's powerful Snapdragon 835 processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, you get some of the best performance on a smartphone available right now. On Geekbench 4, which measures overall system performance, the U11 posted a score of 6,493; that's slightly higher than what we got from the Samsung Galaxy S8 (6,124). Meanwhile, Google's Pixel XL and its Snapdragon 821 processor performed 35 percent worse, with a score of 4,146.  It was the same story for web performance, where the U11 scored 70.52 on the JetStream 1.1 JavaScript test. The Galaxy S8 was only slightly behind, with a score of 67.5, while the Google Pixel XL was pretty far back, with a score of 55.93. MORE: Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7: Which Phone Is Really the Fastest? The U11's graphics performance was also quite impressive. On 3DMark's IceStorm Unlimited test, the U11 hit 40,946, versus 35,903 for the Galaxy S8, and just 28,182 for the Pixel XL.  Software: Two digital assistants with one more on the way HTC has maintained a pretty light touch on Android 7.1, so that its Sense UI will look instantly familiar to anyone with even the slightest knowledge of Google's mobile OS. Some small differences include the BlinkFeed news app that appears when you swipe right from the home screen; that's normally where Google Now cards live. The HTC U11 also features a more traditional icon for the app drawer instead of the minimalist app launcher you'd get on a Pixel. The one big addition HTC tacks on is its Sense Companion, which is another digital assistant that works alongside the built-in Google Assistant. The two assistants have a lot of overlapping features, including the ability to set reminders or notify you when you're near a place of interest, but Google's assistant still has the clear lead in search and answering questions.  The Sense Companion is actually more like a digital secretary, as it may remind you to recharge your phone in the afternoon so you won't run low while attending meetings at night. Or it may tell you that you need to step up your activity, after noticing a lower-than-normal step count earlier in the day. In practice, I found that just letting the Sense Companion do its thing was a helpful but not essential tool for better personal and device management. But when I had a question I needed answering, Google is still the one I asked for by name.  Coming sometime this summer (think early July), Alexa will also make an appearance on the U11. Unlike with half-baked attempts to incorporate Amazon's voice assistant into other phones, which require you to physically open an app before voicing your request, using Alexa on the U11 should be exactly the same as talking to an Amazon Echo or Dot. However, since Alexa wasn't available on our review unit, we're not sure how the assistant will perform. Battery Life: Pretty good but not great The U11 has more than enough battery life to last a full workday. However, as battery life on smartphones continues to improve across the board, the U11's longevity doesn't really stand out.  On the Tom's Guide Battery Test (continuous web surfing using Sprint 4G LTE), the U11 lasted 9 hours and 38 minutes. That's just marginally better than the 9:32 smartphone average and an hour to an hour-and-a-half less than the times for competing flagships, such as the Galaxy S8 (10:39) and the Google Pixel XL (11:11). MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery Life When it comes time to recharge the phone, the U11 features Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0, which can recharge the phone to over 50 percent in 30 minutes. Strangely though, the U11 doesn't have support for Quick Charge 4.0, even though all Snapdragon 835 devices should have support for Qualcomm's newer charging standard. Unfortunately, for those who don't want to deal with wires, the U11, does not support wireless charging.  Bottom Line HTC can keep its Sense Companion and its squeezable Edge Sense controls. Those features work as advertised, but I don't need 'em. The things that really makes the U11 stand out are its unique jewel-like design, thumping BoomSound speakers, superb performance and a rear camera that can keep pace with the best from Apple, Google and Samsung. However, even though the Galaxy S8 costs $100 more, I still have to give a slight edge to that phone, due to its more one-hand-friendly design, better display and longer battery life. The S8's headphone jack is nice, too. Still, it's a close call, made even closer by features like the U11's noise-cancelling earbuds and forthcoming Alexa integration, which could both convince you to side with the U11. And if they did, you'd be making a solid choice, because the U11 is the best phone HTC has made in the last five years. Photo credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide. Comparisons: Sam Rutherford/Tom's Guide. 8/10 Quick Take The U11 is the best phone HTC's offered in years, and the device's camera matches up nicely with that of the more expensive Galaxy S8. Still, Samsung's phone lasts longer on a charge and offers both a better design and display. $649.00 Amazon About the author Sam Rutherford @samrutherford Sam Rutherford is a senior product reviews analyst at Tom's Guide who covers smartphones, car tech and cameras.

Analysts were especially intrigued by what Broadcom is suggesting is a big jump up in the amount of revenue it will get from Apple's next iPhone. And Broadcom calmed concerns that it is looking to spend billions buying the NAND chip division of Toshiba. By Tiernan Ray June 2, 2017 6:28 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Shares of chip giant Broadcom (AVGO) closed up $19.94, or almost 9%, at $254.53, after the company yesterday afternoon beat analysts’ fiscal Q2 expectations, and forecast this quarter’s revenue higher as well. There are no ratings changes today, that I can see, but price targets and estimates are zooming higher. Among the highlights of the conference call last night was chief executive Hock Tan appearing to dispel rumors that his company was interested in bidding on the NAND flash memory-chip operations of Toshiba (6502JP). Speculation that Broadcom wanted to buy the unit was apparently one cause of friction between Toshiba and its memory-chip partner, Western Digital (WDC). When one analyst asked about the rumors, Tan said “Bottom line, do’t believe everything you read out there, please." The company’s dominant position in chips for both Samsung Electronics’s (005930KS) “Galaxy S8” and Apple’s (AAPL) presumed forthcoming "iPhone 8,” is very pleasing to the Street. John Vinh of Pacific Crest reiterates an Overweight rating, and raises his price target to $280 from $260. He notes that Broadcom is corroborating rumors of a delay in Apple’s iPhone 8, but that it’s okay because the company is poised ultimately to sell more chips into this model: Broadcom expects a below-seasonal ramp of the iPhone 8 (10% vs. 3-year seasonal average of 12.7% q/q), but anticipates better-than-seasonal growth in F4Q. This is consistent with other Apple suppliers and our concerns associated with an OLED iPhone delay. Additionally, content is expected to increase 40% driven by 8 chips in the phone. Broadcom also addressed concerns regarding competition from Qorvo in BAW filters. The Company is confident in its competitive position and expects continuous investment will lengthen its leadership in BAW filters. Canaccord Genuity’s Mike Walkley reiterates a Buy rating, and hikes his target to $272 from $250, writing that the Q2 results showed better-than-expected results for the wireless business thanks to “content gains” in Samsung’s S8. There’s more cost-chopping, less M&A ahead, he writes: "Following the completion of the Brocade acquisition likely to close by July 31, we anticipate a continued focus on improving margins and cash flows and less of a focus on new M&A." Walkley raised his estimates for this fiscal year to $17.57 billion in revenue and $15.69 in EPS, up from $16.73 billion and $14.52 per share. Mizuho’s Vijay Rakesh reiterates a Buy rating, and raises his target to $275 from $265, also clearly preoccupied with the iPhone 8 prospects. "AVGO noted a 40% y/y content increase as it ships 8 separate components to (we believe) the new iPhone, driving a significantly accelerating wireless segment into OctQ,” he writes. But it’s not just iPhone. He also notes that networking is chugging along, with "continued ramp on Cisco and hyperscale with Arista and others on 9000 Series and Hyperflex solutions positions AVGO well." Rakesh raises his 2017 estimates to $17.58 billion in revenue and $15.76 in EPS from a prior $17 billion and $14.69 per share.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish New Galaxy S8 And LG G6 Variants Reportedly Inspired By iPhone 8 By Tyler Lee on 06/02/2017 16:02 PDT It is not a secret that Apple’s iPhone has influenced a lot of smartphone makers when it comes to introducing features and design, and we guess the opposite can also be said where Apple does “copy” design and features found on other devices and software. However could Apple’s influence be so great to prompt smartphone makers to launch new variants? According to a report out of Korea via The Investor, it seems that both Samsung and LG are apparently working on variants of their current flagship handsets. With Samsung, the company is rumored to launch new color variants for its Galaxy S8 lineup, one of which is apparently “Rose Gold”. As for LG, apparently the company is planning on launching new LG G6 versions with different storage capacities in 32GB and 128GB options. Now it could be coincidental since introducing new color options and storage options aren’t exactly out of place for either company, although it is possible that the new color/storage options could be a way for these companies to keep their devices relevant and maybe attract new customers in the face of the iPhone 8. Analysts are predicting that Apple will be experiencing a super cycle in terms of sales with the iPhone 8 and that it could beat out the iPhone 6’s sales. So far sales of Apple’s iPhones have been on the decline but many believe that the iPhone 8 could turn things around. Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Rumors.

Apple also stated that in the past 12 months, downloads have grown over 70 percent. Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, said: “People everywhere love apps and our customers are downloading them in record numbers. Seventy billion dollars earned by developers is simply mind-blowing. We are amazed at all of the great new apps our developers create and can’t wait to see them again next week at our Worldwide Developers Conference.” Upon hearing that Apple has paid out $70 billion, our minds may initially turn to the initial costs of an app. One important source that contributed to the total figure was app subscriptions. Subscriptions are available to developers making apps for all 25 available categories. Apple reports that the active paid subscriptions are up 58 percent year over year. Apple said that apps in the Gaming and Entertainment categories bring in the most revenue, with hit games helping with the revenue figure. Most games are free to download but then make money from in-game perks which help the player progress through the game.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Access Your iCloud Calendar with Alexa By Jason Fitzpatrick on June 2nd, 2017 Thanks to a recent Alexa update, you can now access your iCloud calendar through your Amazon Echo, other Alexa-enabled devices, and the Alexa app. To do so, however, you’ll need to do a little tweaking behind the scenes. RELATED ARTICLE How to Link Your Google Calendar to Your Amazon Echo We’ve shown you how to link your Google Calendar to Alexa, but now we’re back to help iCloud users get the same functionality. In order to use your iCloud calendar with Alexa, you need three things: two-factor authentication enabled on your Apple account, an iCloud app-specific password just for Alexa, and, naturally, your Alexa device to accept the voice input. Step One: Create an App-Specific Password for Your Apple ID RELATED ARTICLE How to Set Up Two-Factor Authentication for Your Apple ID We won’t run through setting up two-factor authentication on your Apple account, but we do have a detailed guide on doing so here for those of you who haven’t enabled it already. Instead, let’s jump right into creating that app-specific password. Log into your Apple account at appleid.apple.com. Confirm your login by entering the two-factor identification code sent to your primary device. Once logged in, look for the section in your Apple ID control panel labeled “Security” and click on “Generate Password” as seen below. When prompted, label the app-specific password “Alexa” and click “Create”. Apple will provide you with a randomly generated alphanumeric string in the format xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx. Highlight and copy the password as we’ll be entering it in the next step of the tutorial. Step Two: Link Your iCloud Calendar to Alexa App-specific password in hand, it’s time to add your iCloud Calendar to Alexa. To do so you can either open up the Alexa app on your mobile device or you can visit alexa.amazon.com while logged into your Amazon account to access the Alexa dashboard from any web browser. (The latter is easier, since we’ll have to paste that password from step one.) Once logged into the dashboard, select “Settings” from the left-hand sidebar and then select “Calendar”. Within the Calendar menu, select the entry for Apple/iCloud. You’ll be prompted to enable two-factor authentication if you have not already done so, and to create an app-specific password. Because we’re already two steps ahead of the game, just click “Continue” to move forward. When prompted enter your Apple ID and your app-specific password and then click “Sign In”. After signing in you’ll see all your iCloud calendars, checked by default. Step Three: Configure Your Calendars, If Necessary If you’d prefer not to use certain calendars with Alexa, you can uncheck them now. Next, click on Settings > Calendar to return to the previous Calendars menu. Here, we need to make once final selection. In the drop down menu under “Alexa will add new events to this calendar:” select which of your iCloud calendars you want Alexa to use by default for any commands that add events. With that last detail squared away, we can start using Alexa with iCloud. Control iCloud Calendar by Voice Command RELATED ARTICLE How to Listen to Podcasts on Your Amazon Echo Now that the setup is behind us, it’s smooth sailing. You can access your iCloud calendar using natural language commands like you would any other Alexa function (like spooling up a podcast). While the calendar commands could definitely benefit from some flexibility (Alexa can’t answer the question “Alexa, is my weekend free?” for example), there are still plenty of things it can do. You, however, use commands like: “What’s on my calendar?” or “What’s my next event” to hear what the next scheduled event is. “What’s on my calendar tomorrow at [time]?” or “What’s on my calendar on [day]?” to get an overview of that time slot. “Add [event] to my calendar for [day] at [time].” to create an entry like “Add charity jog to my calendar for Tuesday at 2 PM.” Although the functionality is basic, it gets the job done, and allows you to check (and add to) your calendar using only voice commands. JOIN THE DISCUSSION Tweet Jason Fitzpatrick is a warranty-voiding DIYer who spends his days cracking opening cases and wrestling with code so you don't have to. If it can be modded, optimized, repurposed, or torn apart for fun he's interested (and probably already at the workbench taking it apart). You can follow him on Twitter if you'd like.

Apple has begun production of a high-end speaker with Siri-based digital assistant technology to compete directly with Amazon's Alexa-based Echo speakers and the Google Assistant-powered Home speaker, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Production is in the early stages, but the device could be unveiled as early as next week at WWDC, Apple's annual developer conference, according to the report. That would position the company to begin shipping in time for the winter holiday season. Inventec, which manufactures Apple AirPods, reportedly has landed the deal to build the intelligent speakers, and has begun expanding plant capacity to handle the demand. Apple aims to position its speaker not only as a digital assistant for the home, but also as a high-end audio device that will compete with Sonos and other leading speaker manufacturers, according to some reports. Apple already is a dominant player in the digital music arena with its iTunes music and video library. The device currently in production will have virtual surround sound technology and possibly will include sensors that automatically adjust volume based on the acoustics where the speakers are being used, according to the Bloomberg report. It also may use the company's HomeKit, which already works with Siri technology to automate the home, to act as a hub for home appliances, lights and other devices. Street Talk Speculation about the launch of a Siri-based speaker has heated up in recent weeks, following last month's report from KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo, who said there was a greater than 50 percent chance that Apple would unveil such a device at WWDC, which would give developers time to write new apps for it in time for the holiday shopping season. Apple had an installed base of 136 million iPhones in use in the U.S. as of March 31, plus another few million iPads and Apple computers. Most of the company's customers owned more than one Apple product, according to Michael Levin, a partner and analyst at Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. "It has also created a decent Home software suite that would allow whatever gadget they create to integrate its various hardware products -- smartphone, tablet, watch, computers, etc. -- into a home control system," he told the E-Commerce Times. "We expect that over time, at least a few million U.S. users would try out its new service and become a competitor to Amazon Echo and Google Home devices." Apple TV Groundwork Apple currently has some of same type of capability found in smart speakers built into its Apple TV box, noted Michael Jude, a research manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "This would likely be an adjunct device that would network to the existing Apple Home capabilities," he told the E-Commerce Times. "Apple has been angling towards a connected home capability for some time," Jude remarked. "Apple TV was sort of the opening salvo, but had a hard time getting traction because of its dependence on resolving content ownership issues," he explained. The rumored Siri-powered speaker "will extend Apple's capabilities, but will still be a less capable offering than Amazon's since it will lack the retail connections that Amazon can deliver," Jude said. "It will, however, put it at parity with Google -- perhaps ahead a little, since it will deliver iTunes and other content sources. Third Parties Key The strength of the Apple brand alone would provide the company with a competitive advantage with fans of the company, noted Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. However, unless the company were willing to open the platform up to third-party developers and hardware providers, it would lag Amazon and Google, he pointed out. "While being first to market with a home speaker device -- the Echo -- was a plus for Amazon, its real success is coming from all the third-parties that are looking at using Alexa on everything from smoke detectors to cars," McGregor told the E-Commerce Times. "Amazon also has a vast music library, book library and other retail ties to customers," he pointed out. "I would not bet against Amazon." Maturing Market Apple's move comes at a time when the core iPhone market has begun to mature. At the same time, Amazon and Google have taken a big bite out of the red hot digital assistant market. The Echo has propelled Amazon to record revenue and profits over the last couple of years, spinning off an entire new ecosystem of products that use its Alexa-based digital assistant technology. Google launched its own ecosystem of products and services anchored by the Google Assistant-powered Home speaker. It has a treasure trove of consumer search data and natural language capabilities to drive the use of Android-based mobile phones and other products based on its advanced development of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing Artificial Intelligence will Apple be next iCrowdNewswire – Jun 2, 2017 With iPhone sales slowing and the last new Apple product released two years ago, expectations are building for what the company will reveal next week at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Some Apple watchers are counting on artificial intelligence. With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing AI in their conferences over the past two months, market analysts believe it is Apple’s turn. As the race for artificial intelligence heats up in Silicon Valley, some worry that Apple is already behind the game. “If Apple skips AI, I would consider that a significant miss on their opportunity,” said John Jackson, a Boston-based analyst for IDC. “Apple is late to this game. There is no other trick up their sleeve around this.” Apple, long known for its secrecy, declined to discuss specifics of the event but emailed a statement that its global developer community has earned more than $70 billion since the App Store launched in 2008. Rumors and early reports indicate the Cupertino tech giant may release a new iPad pro, and according to Bloomberg, a Siri-controlled home speaker to challenge Amazon Echo and Google Home. Gene Munster, a venture capitalist at Loup Ventures and a longtime Apple watcher, said a home speaker would be a step in the right direction for Apple. “Artificial intelligence is fundamental to every company now,” Munster said. “We knew Apple was going to improve on Siri, and (the speaker) seems to line up. It makes logical sense.” In addition to the Siri speaker, rumors of a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, an updated MacBook Pro and a new iOS 11 have circulated on the Internet In preparation for next week’s Apple Developers Conference, the McEnery Convention Center facade gets a decorative re-skinning Friday, June 2, 2017, in San Jose, Calif. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group)  The five-day conference to be attended by more than 5000 developers — who each paid $1599 after winning a lottery — is moving from San Francisco to San Jose, where it will be held for the first time since 2002. Apple CEO Tim Cook will give the keynote speech in McEnery Convention Center at 10 a.m. on Monday. His speech will be streamed live on Apple’s website, or through the WWDC iOS app. Some experts pushed back on the notion that Apple is behind in the AI race, saying Siri is not the only AI-driven technology built by Apple. But they acknowledged that companies like Amazon and Google have made smart AI-driven devices marketable — Google identifies itself as an AI first company — as Apple has mostly worked behind closed curtains. “For the average Joe on the street, AI for Amazon is Echo and Alexa,” said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Creative Strategies. “Apple just chose not to label everything AI. Apple chose to let our experience with its devices speak for itself. But I think we are at a point where AI does matter in the advertising spiel.” In recent years, Apple has seen a decline in the sales of its main products, most noticeably the iPhone. Apple reported 50.8 million iPhones sold worldwide in the second quarter of 2017, down from 51.2 million a year earlier. Expectations are that Apple will unveil a new iPhone in the fall for the device’s 10th anniversary. Apple Watch, its latest product from 2015, saw its 2016 sales number double from the year before, according to Cook in the last earnings call. Apple does not release Apple Watch sales numbers, but some analysts have estimated about 12 million of the devices were sold last year. If reports of a Siri home speaker are correct, Apple will be entering a growing smart home market with a closing window of opportunity. Both Amazon Echo and Google Home proved to be commercial successes. At its I/O conference in May, Google announced more features to its Home speaker, including the ability to place free calls, connect with Bluetooth and control more apps like HBO Now and Hulu. Apple’s Siri speaker reportedly comes with a virtual surround sound technology that give it an edge in sound quality over its competitors, according to Bloomberg. But the biggest draw may be its compatibility with other Apple devices and services. The speaker will likely be connected to the iPhone and Apple TV and services like Apple Music and the HomeKit home automation system. Although skeptical that current Amazon Echo owners will switch over to the Apple speaker, analysts believe Apple may be able to bridge the gap. “Apple has done a great job sewing up households as Apple households,” said Jackson. “A lot of us own iPhones and MacBooks. But it hasn’t been central to their messaging. Creating this type of innovation is darn hard, so they’re late.” Full article: http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/02/apple-needs-to-show-off-new-ai-technology-at-wwdc-next-week-analysts-say/ CategoriesUncategorized Tags(North America, Apple, artificial intelligence, Artificial Intelligence Newswire, Asia, English, Europe, Facebook, Google, Latin America, Microsoft, Middle East Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Fayetteville Historic District Commission Presents 2017 Historic Preservation Award Next PostNext Public Outreach Policy at the Planning Commission Meeting Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing Artificial Intelligence will Apple be next iCrowdNewswire – Jun 2, 2017 With iPhone sales slowing and the last new Apple product released two years ago, expectations are building for what the company will reveal next week at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.

Apple Watch, its latest product from 2015, saw its 2016 sales number double from the year before, according to Cook in the last earnings call.

Some Apple watchers are counting on artificial intelligence. With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing AI in their conferences over the past two months, market analysts believe it is Apple’s turn. As the race for artificial intelligence heats up in Silicon Valley, some worry that Apple is already behind the game. “If Apple skips AI, I would consider that a significant miss on their opportunity,” said John Jackson, a Boston-based analyst for IDC. “Apple is late to this game. There is no other trick up their sleeve around this.” Apple, long known for its secrecy, declined to discuss specifics of the event but emailed a statement that its global developer community has earned more than $70 billion since the App Store launched in 2008. Rumors and early reports indicate the Cupertino tech giant may release a new iPad pro, and according to Bloomberg, a Siri-controlled home speaker to challenge Amazon Echo and Google Home. Gene Munster, a venture capitalist at Loup Ventures and a longtime Apple watcher, said a home speaker would be a step in the right direction for Apple. “Artificial intelligence is fundamental to every company now,” Munster said. “We knew Apple was going to improve on Siri, and (the speaker) seems to line up. It makes logical sense.” In addition to the Siri speaker, rumors of a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, an updated MacBook Pro and a new iOS 11 have circulated on the Internet In preparation for next week’s Apple Developers Conference, the McEnery Convention Center facade gets a decorative re-skinning Friday, June 2, 2017, in San Jose, Calif. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group)  The five-day conference to be attended by more than 5000 developers — who each paid $1599 after winning a lottery — is moving from San Francisco to San Jose, where it will be held for the first time since 2002. Apple CEO Tim Cook will give the keynote speech in McEnery Convention Center at 10 a.m. on Monday. His speech will be streamed live on Apple’s website, or through the WWDC iOS app. Some experts pushed back on the notion that Apple is behind in the AI race, saying Siri is not the only AI-driven technology built by Apple. But they acknowledged that companies like Amazon and Google have made smart AI-driven devices marketable — Google identifies itself as an AI first company — as Apple has mostly worked behind closed curtains. “For the average Joe on the street, AI for Amazon is Echo and Alexa,” said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Creative Strategies. “Apple just chose not to label everything AI. Apple chose to let our experience with its devices speak for itself. But I think we are at a point where AI does matter in the advertising spiel.” In recent years, Apple has seen a decline in the sales of its main products, most noticeably the iPhone. Apple reported 50.8 million iPhones sold worldwide in the second quarter of 2017, down from 51.2 million a year earlier. Expectations are that Apple will unveil a new iPhone in the fall for the device’s 10th anniversary. Apple Watch, its latest product from 2015, saw its 2016 sales number double from the year before, according to Cook in the last earnings call.

Of course, no one can know the future. And there have been some spectacular flubs when it comes to predicting the elements of the WWDC keynote. So why do we journalists bother? The authors of the book The Cluetrain Manifesto point out that “markets are conversations.” When informed, expert journalists talk about what Apple might discuss at the keynote, they’re not padding themselves on the back with their acumen at prognostication. Instead, as I wrote this week, they’re building on a collective, community knowledge base about what they and their readers would like to see from Apple. Sometimes those wishes are self-serving in that they tantalize the reader with a juicy headline. The conceit that the reader may find out something delicious about Apple’s plans is a powerful one. In practice, we know better. In general, the predictions by expert journalists is mostly a reflection of what they’ve learned from their readers and perhaps podcast guests since the last WWDC. This conversation can contain valuable insights for Apple, if it has a mind to listen. Of course, the other side of that coin is the legacy of Steve Jobs. We are also fond of the notion that Apple knows what we need before we know it ourselves. When the One More Thing is revealed, we gasp and declare: “Of course! Wow!” But we must also recall that the One More Thing surprise was one method Steve Jobs used to bring a company back from the dead. Today, Apple is thriving and successful. It has entered a mature stage. And, in that maturity, it’s also important for Apple to listen to customer needs even as it relentlessly moves technology forward. So when you read really great articles like “WWDC 2017: Apple Has a Lot to Talk About This Year,” by Jonny Evans and “Here’s What to Expect at Apple’s WWDC 2017 Keynote,” by Jeff Gamet, don’t focus on how wrong they might be. Instead, take these thoughts as inspiration to help you formulate your own directions and needs. And then see how those personal reflections fit with Apple’s actual keynote. In some cases, Apple will surprise. In some cases, it will disappoint. But our wisdom and perspectives evolve in the process. Next Page: The News Debris For The Week Of May 29th.

True, pundits and fans alike, when engaged in product prediction, are having an important conversation about what they would like, and Apple no doubt scans those discussions, although what they do with them is another matter. Given the long tail of product development, I don’t see Apple adjusting their rollout based on this chatter, but rather bracing themselves for impact when they observe a profound disconnect and having internal discussions about addressing those needs in future within the scope of their development pipeline (e.g. ‘No on the netbook; but how about an iPad?’). Expectations will vary across the spectrum, and some simply aren’t worth a moment’s reflection by a serious company. For example, were yours truly to express his real wish for the laptop of choice…(buckle up) it would be for a quantum device, supported by a Siri or AI interface, that is truly anticipatory. I could say, ‘Okay Siri, let’s write a grant proposal’; and she would say, ‘What shall we write about today?’, to which I would respond, ‘A proposal on phase 2 of project X’. Siri would scan my database across all hardware devices and cloud storage sites, and, nanoseconds later, reply ‘Ready’. With but a few opening keystrokes or dictated words, Siri would clue into where I’m going with this, and just like word suggestion on the iPhone – but on Incredible Hulk – busting steroids, respond with whole thought streams fit into paragraphs of prose, drawing from either my actual previous writings, works or recorded thoughts, or simply my writing style. Siri would provide me with whole thought-stream options at breakpoints; ‘Shall we go with thought option A or B?’ allowing me to select the next thought sequence, and by simply following where my eye alights and my pupil dilates with acceptance, chooses that option, and again, whole paragraphs of perfect text appear. If Siri detects stress, such as elevated blood pressure or heart rate on my Apple watch, or the release of stress hormones, she could pause and query for refinement. Moving on, my and my colleagues’ CVs are updated with our latest activities and publications, and fitted into the correct format for the application. Budgets, with my mere specification of categories and costs, auto-populate with running tallies of costs and overhead. Oh my! And by the time my coffee cools or I’m ready for lunch, whichever comes first, my proposal is done, and I can be ready for the next feat to the day. That’s my machine of choice. Now, let me put down the peyote and the opium pipe and come back to reality and the discussion at hand. You’ve rightly addressed the issue of managing expectations. To this, let me add, when it comes to Apple and anticipated products and services, we should consider two things in order to manage our expectations: trends and context. What do these mean? The first, trends, suggests that we look at the trajectory, pace, features and capabilities of a given product, and adjust expectations to the next likely step in extending those capabilities, but in keeping with precedent as to both consumer need and Apple’s history with respect to adopting newer capability. Specifically, bearing in mind that Apple practically never adopt a technology that cannot provide a consistent user experience, and is secure, however attractive it might be. Another historical precedent is that Apple are not likely to adopt a technology that will dramatically lessen battery life or performance speed. And finally, that technology must meet or beat Apple’s current security standards, without compromising that of the ecosystem. As for platform enrichment, this is the context in which evolving or new products and services are rolled out. The Apple Watch, for example, is meant to be Apple’s most personal product. It is reasonable to expect that Apple will extend the AW’s personal monitoring capability (e.g. Personal health indicators like blood glucose, specific proteins and by-products related to acute and chronic life threatening conditions), but not reasonable to expect Apple to add a new tech feature, like video recording, which could impair battery life and increase size, simply because a competitor might do so. Another example might be an emerging or unmet consumer need; like more powerful AI capability at the point of maximum impact or usefulness. Anticipate greater Siri capability and function on devices like the AW or the iPhone – devices that the user is likely to nearly always have available, but whose power and capability can be greatly extended by a more powerful but secure AI. In my view, and according to my observational experience, these two qualifiers, trend and context, allow one to not simply manage expectations, but when inevitably greeted with the unexpected, provide a rational reference frame from which to assess which consumer need has been addressed, objectively weigh its value proposition, and then make an evidence-based determination as to whether that need has been satisfactorily met, even if not in the way one might have expected. And in the last analysis, be ready to actually see, touch and play with it before declaring it to be a failure, and a portent of Apple’s impending doom. June 3, 2017 at 4:44 EDT PM ibuck June 3, 2017 JM: “the ability of these men to stick, instinctively, with a clear personal vision, and yet have the judgement, grace, and perspective to be properly corrected or adapt to a new situation when necessary. We all need to do that in our work.” Yep, not just in work, but in many, if not all, parts of our life. — By the way, good comments by wab95, especially the last 2 paragraphs. But it seems that 95% of those “reporting news and views” online regularly neglect to do that. They zoom past any possible conceptual flaw that may have driven larger screens and accompany bigger batteries—like fires that burn down cars, houses or divert flights.

By Emily Bary June 2, 2017 3:50 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Get ready to hear about what's to come with Apple's newest mobile operating system. Illustration: Sean Gallup/Getty Images Apple is about ready to kick off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), which is basically like summer camp for Apple geeks. The weeklong event begins Monday, and, as its name suggests, the conference is mainly geared toward software developers. But ordinary Apple fans and lots of reporters will be tuning in Monday at 1 p.m. ET for the big keynote address, when Apple is likely to make software and hardware announcements -- one of which could be an entirely new product. For Apple fans, the hope is the news will be enough to tide them over until Apple releases the next iPhone in the fall. Here’s a look at what’s likely to come out of the event. More from Barron’s Next Android vs. iOS: Are iPhones Really Safer? You Won’t Have to Wait for That iPhone 8 China’s Waning Loyalty to the iPhone A Siri-controlled speaker: Apple has so far missed the boat on digital home assistants, but the company might still want a shot at the market. If Apple does indeed announce a speaker on Monday, the product will not have been a well-kept secret. There have been a swirl of reports about the device lately, including one from Bloomberg yesterday, which said that while Apple might debut a home assistant at WWDC, it won’t be ready to ship them out until later in the year. Amazon’s Echo has become the market leader in the voice assistant world, though the Google Home has its fans too. Apple has a history of being late to the game and still finding a way to take over the market -- iPods and iPhones are good examples. New software: Expect to see what’s in store for iOS 11, Apple’s upcoming mobile operating system, as well as what’s to come for macOS, the Mac operating system. RBC analyst Amit Daryanani predicts that the iOS 11 will bring “a redesigned OS interface that better accommodates features of the iPhone 8 (no physical home button, etc.).” The question is how much Apple will reveal about such elements of the software, without tipping its hat too much about upcoming hardware features. (There’s been much speculation about those, as well.) New MacBooks: Those who bought the latest MacBook Pros when they arrived last fall likely weren’t expecting that a new model would come out so soon. But alas, Bloomberg reported a few weeks back that Apple would unveil a MacBook Pro with a faster processor during WWDC. In addition, the company could come out with a new MacBook and MacBook Air, as well as an iPad upgrade.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Apple Valley doesn't want you to read the fine print Friday Jun 2, 2017 at 2:56 PM Jun 2, 2017 at 2:56 PM By Bryen Wright The great Albert Einstein once said that the definition of insanity is doing something over and over again and expecting a different result. I’ve read all the information from both sides of the Measure F debate, and have concluded that voting No is best for my family and Apple Valley. The first thing I did was read the official materials put out by the town. “The estimated cost of the acquisition of the Apple Valley Water System could amount to $150 million.” Isn’t this amount nearly three times more than what government officials told their constituents when this started? And what do they have in mind with money they think will be left over? Save themselves from more deficit spending, the kind of thing a municipality with substandard financial management does? Sort of like in Flint, Michigan and Apple Valley? Next, the official documents state: “The maximum rate of interest to be paid on said indebtedness ($150 million) shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted by law, to wit, twelve percent (12%) per year. The actual rate or rates on said debt to be determined at or prior to the time it is incurred.” The town keeps telling us that this isn’t real because rates today are lower, but their language says the only date that matters is when the borrowing happens. Even if they are successful at winning an eminent domain verdict, that won’t be for at least two or three years, and interest rates are already going up. Voters should look closely at the Measure F fine print because that is the contract we all are signing if they agree to repay $150 million in debt by voting Yes. All the promises by town management stating publicly they will invest in lowering the bills "or" capital improvements. Which is it? Anyone would interpret this means either or. The problem with being so vague is currently we have surrounding cities not properly managing their water systems dealing with brown water, excessive pipe breakage, skimping on water testing, hidden fees/cost that residents don't see or think of and many more issues that Apple Valley residents don't have to deal with. Translating official ballot language into plain Apple Valley English, here’s what Measure F is: Measure F lets government borrow up to $150 million. Bonds would be repaid, plus interest, by ratepayers, through a new debt service fee added to your water bill. It allows government to force you to pay up to 12 percent interest (even though it should be much lower is still 100s of millions of dollars of interest only) on the $150 million, “daily, weekly, monthly or semi-annually.” Buried in the fine print is language that allows government to raid public funds, unrelated to water, to repay principal and interest. Apple Valley documents state they’re planning to charge expensive new water connection fees, increasing new home prices by tens of thousands of dollars. The town says there will be no tax increases, but that is just a smoke screen. No, it is not a tax. But it is a fee each customer will have to pay — sort of like a 30-year Mello Roos that will cost each customer between $15,000 and $18,000 over the life of the bond. Money out of our pockets. This information surprised me, because nothing coming from the supporters of Measure F discloses these facts. I then looked at research conducted by economic experts to see what they say about Measure F. I found two separate studies and read them from beginning to end. The first one was by Dr. John Husing, a local economist who has been recognized by the Town of Apple Valley as an “industry expert.” He’s been doing research here since 1962. Dr. Husing came to the following conclusion: “A look at the possible water costs for each customer from a revenue bond given these circumstances shows a high probability for significant rate increases. Even if the $150 million Measure F bond level is sufficient, it could cost customers an extra $502 or $620 per year equal to $84 or $103 per bi-monthly bill. Voters should be hesitant to take such a risk.” Then, I read a second study, conducted by Dr. Rodney T. Smith, a former professor at Claremont McKenna College, who specializes in the economics, finance and public policy of water resources. He wrote, “The data set forth in this paper demonstrate that if the town condemns Liberty Utilities Apple Valley by eminent domain, higher water rates for town residents are a virtual certainty for decades to come. If the goal of acquiring Liberty Utilities Apple Valley is to charge lower water rates, then the effort should be abandoned because that goal is not a feasible outcome.” Dr. Smith concluded that customer water bills would increase by $538 annually if Measure F passes. Remember my point about insanity? The reality is that every economic expert who has looked at Measure F agrees that it will cost Apple Valley families a lot more money and that the debt will be passed on to our children and grandchildren. I’m sure we’ll be hearing a lot of campaign rhetoric between now and Election Day, but none of it changes what Measure F actually does. If you vote Yes, you’re agreeing to pay at least $500 more every year on your water bill to repay $150 million in debt. That’s why our family is voting No. Measure F is debt Apple Valley doesn’t need and a debt that we cannot afford. Bryen Wright is an Apple Valley resident who ran for Town Council in 2016.

Advertisement The pace at which companies are adopting circular economy business models has been accelerating for the last two decades—and it has evolved from a specialist concept to a mainstream business strategy. Accenture Strategy recently surveyed more than 500 manufacturing companies with revenues greater than $1 billion, and found that more than 90% said they are implementing circular business models. And nearly all larger product-based companies say they’ve put in place circular supply chains for material recovery and recycling. But too often, programs remain “skin deep.” The vast majority of companies are utilizing circularity in principle, but they are failing to capture the full potential of the approach. As we look ahead to the next wave of circular business models, and as innovation continues to uncover brand-new opportunities to act sustainably and responsibly, it’s time to come full circle—transform supply chain operations and company cultures to build a network of partners, suppliers and markets that fully capitalize on circularity.   Circling Success Accenture Strategy research found that, when it comes to the elements of circular supply chains that companies are prioritizing, recycling comes out on top. But while recycling wasted materials across a company’s operations is certainly a step in the right direction, it is low-hanging fruit that only scratches the surface when it comes to squeezing value out of the circular economy. When looking at the adoption of deeper circular economy strategies—where companies are reusing or refurbishing materials they’ve recaptured at the end of life—there is significant room for improvement. While nearly all companies report products are returned for reuse or refurbishing, 75% ultimately destroy 45-75% of the recaptured products—losing all the embedded value.  And while 92% of companies surveyed say they are geared up for product life extension, only 30% to 40% are actually doing it. The survey reveals that many companies are adopting circular economy strategies because of competitive pressure, such as if a low-cost rival offers a similar part, or due to warranty issues—not with the intention of bringing large-scale change to the business by putting circularity at the forefront of supply chain operations. So most efforts don’t decouple production from primary resource use. Not only is this leading to sizable losses in cost savings and efficiencies, but it is also resulting in missed opportunities to unleash growth and profitability across the business.   First Movers Reap Significant Value Meanwhile, success stories show that first movers who go beyond basic recycling in favor of deeper, strategic approaches are achieving significant business value. For instance, Apple took quick action when it found that a number of low-cost competitors were refurbishing their iPhone products and reselling them in Asia. Rather than give up this market segment, Apple jumped right on board, refurbishing their products (even the iPhone 7) and selling them at a lower price to Asian consumers. Other recent company initiatives also reveal a promising path ahead for circular models—and underscore that the opportunity to replicate these models elsewhere is now unprecedented. More and more, companies are announcing zero waste goals—and changes to the entire supply chain function rather than just individual projects. One company that has successfully embraced the full circle approach to waste elimination in its supply chain is Dell. Dell manufactures products from plastics recovered from its own computer products—recapturing plastics in a closed-loop fashion to use in the production of new products. This results in a smaller carbon footprint and a reduction in manufacturing costs. Caterpillar’s Cat Reman program is another bright star in the full circle approach. The program offers customers the option of buying parts that have been refurbished from existing equipment to a “same as new” standard. And this means that the environment also wins. CAT recycles 134 million pounds of material annually and is approaching “zero landfill” status. There is other promising news in store—traditional barriers to adopting circular as a business strategy are quickly falling. That’s in large part thanks to digital technologies such as analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors, which are helping to eliminate hurdles in operational issues such as sorting materials and recapturing them. Materials can be traced, while loops can be closed. Accenture Strategy research found that 90% of companies believe digital technology has facilitated their ability to implement operational changes to deliver circular supply chains, product life extension or waste-to-value capabilities. In short, digital has eradicated any “excuses” for not acting.   Coming Full Circle To capture the full potential of the circular economy in supply chain operations, companies need to pursue higher—and often more complex—value initiatives. To do that, successful companies should follow these four steps: 1. Focus on driving circular business models to capture the full value of the opportunity. At any given point in time, $7 trillion worth of passenger cars are unused around the world. It’s a staggering opportunity—one that was recognized by Daimler through its subsidiary car2go. To act on something this big, it takes an expanded vision of circular that goes beyond recycling and prioritizes quantifying the full value of the opportunity for a circular transformation. 2. Break down silos. Circularity can be disruptive to any organization – requiring both strategic collaboration with suppliers and across functions such as R&D, procurement, supply chain, manufacturing and marketing. Corporate barriers are the reason why too many companies stop at recycling, which can be accomplished within a single functional silo. Companies that will gain the greatest value from circular will be those that look for opportunities that impact the very core of their operating models as well as seek to build a network of partners—both inside and outside of the company. 3. Start the circle from the top. Leadership at the very top of the company must create business imperatives, cultural changes and governance to promote circular objectives—as well as integrated goals and metrics. That requires taking traditional metrics—such as EBITDA and gross margin—and blending them with new metrics aimed at measuring the effectiveness of circularity. These include take-back quantities, the degree to which materials were effectively refurbished or reused, and resource productivity. 4. Leverage digital. Technologies, such as the IoT, radio-frequency identification (RFID) and analytics, are critical for embedding circularity across operations and company networks to increase the ability to track resources, and to monitor things like utilization and waste capacity. Digital allows companies to have a much more granular understanding of the value of materials, and to gauge the condition of assets and products—determining when they’ll need service or replacement, for example. Gaining these capabilities is quickly becoming “table stakes” to engage in a fuller circular economy supply chain. The circular economy is gaining real traction in the supply chains of most major product-based companies. Leaders in circularity spanning Apple, Caterpillar and Dell are showing first-hand the tremendous value that can be gained from making circularity a core tenet of business strategy. Once companies move beyond low-hanging fruit and adopt deeper circular business models through the four strategies outlined above, they’ll find unexpected benefits.   Sudipta Ghosh is a managing director focused on operations strategy at global consulting firm Accenture Strategy.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Huawei Competitions GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: Nintendo Switch OnePlus 5 iPhone 7 deals Galaxy S8 LG G6 iPhone 8 Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Apple is reportedly paying the public to help improve Apple Maps Apple is reportedly paying the public to help improve Apple Maps by Chris Smith 02 June 2017 0 shares Read Comments Apple is reportedly paying freelancers to help improve its homegrown Maps app. According to French blog iGeneration (via 9to5Mac), Apple is paying people 54¢ (about 40p) every time they accurately confirm or correct a place location within the app. The attacks could be as simple as heading to their nearest McDonald’s to verify the location on Apple Maps. Apple is finding those folks through a platform called TryRating. According to the report, the freelancers are able to complete up to 600 tasks a week, as long as it doesn’t exceed 20 hours of work. Apple Maps has improved dramatically since its calamitous debut back in 2012 with iOS 6, when it, among other things, directed drivers onto runways and lost the Statue of Liberty. However, Google Maps is still seen as as the best on the block. Speaking of Google, it's the second time this week one of its rivals is offering money to assist in the catch-up effort. Earlier on Friday we reported Microsoft is paying people to frequent its Bing search engine instead of Google. The program, which pays out through Microsoft Bing Rewards, has now been expanded to the UK. It enables participants to earn points that can be spent on Skype credit, Groove Subscriptions and Xbox gift cards. iPhone users, do you prefer Apple Maps or Google Maps? Share your thoughts on both below.

Climate Deal Decision Watch These NSFW Deadpool Bloopers While We Wait For The Sequel Companies Think President Trump's Withdrawal From The Paris Accord Is Stupid Matt Novak Jun 3, 2017, 7:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple climate agreement climate change donald trump google jack dorsey mark cuban paris accord president trump tim cook video feature Share President Donald Trump stood up in front of the world yesterday and withdrew the United States from the Paris Accord, a global agreement to combat climate change. The agreement had nearly universal support, but Trump said withdrawing is good for American business. But American business leaders disagree. President Donald Trump demonstrates for the cameras how little thought he gave to withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) CEOs from companies in practically every sector of American life issued statements yesterday denouncing Trump's decision. Business leaders such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney CEO Robert Iger even signalled that this was the last straw, and announced that they'd no longer act as advisers to the US president. Even before Trump's decision yesterday, the Paris Accord had broad support in the business community. On 26 April 2017 a group of companies wrote an open letter to the president, asking him to stay in the agreement. Companies as diverse as Walmart and DuPont and Intel all signed the letter. Even energy companies like ExxonMobil, Shell and Chevron also implored Trump not to drop the Paris Accord in the lead up to yesterday's announcement from the White House Rose Garden. But he didn't listen.

We can only imagine that this list will continue to grow in the coming weeks. Twenty years from now, we have no idea what the defining moment of Trump's shameful presidency will be. But with climate change already impacting the world in disastrous ways, his decision to needlessly shun the environment should at least crack the top 10. But who knows? Trump still has so much time to inflict very real damage on both the United States and the rest of the world — a world that increasingly sees America as a joke that elected a neo-fascist reality TV star as its president.

"We will keep working toward the ambitious goals of a closed-loop supply chain, and to eventually stop mining new materials altogether. Of course, we're going to keep working with our suppliers to help them do more to power their businesses with clean energy. And we will keep challenging ourselves to do even more." Co-founder and CEO of Box Aaron Levie speaks on stage on 10 November 2015 in New York City (Photo by Brad Barket/Getty Images for Fast Company) Box "Trump believes everything is a negotiation. But America's reputation and trust around the world can't be negotiated, it's earned. Or lost," tweeted Box CEO Aaron Levie.

"If the US exits international accords like the Paris agreement it will negatively impact trade, economic vitality, the state of our environment and relationships among the world community."

"For our part, we've committed that every new data center we build will be powered by 100% renewable energy.

Our call for an international agreement on this issue is more than a decade old, and we first voiced our support for the Paris Agreement in 2015 when it was negotiated," said IBM in a statement.

Nike believes that climate change is a serious global threat and that the world will need to radically redesign industrial systems and economies in order to enable a low-carbon growth economy," Nike said in a statement. "We will continue to honour the core commitments of the American Business Act on Climate Change Pledge, including reaching 100 per cent renewable energy in all Nike-owned or -operated facilities around the world by 2025, participating in the U.S. Department of Energy's Better Buildings Challenge and advancing materials innovation globally."

Comments lee978 @978lee Jun 3, 2017, 7:32am Where does Trump get his facts about economic benefits vs costs of responding to climate change? How is this even "costing" the economy anything as there are clearly benefits in jobs, manufacturing and HUGE export potential. It's one thing to deny science but now economics too. Reply 0 tonyintsv @tonyintsv Jun 3, 2017, 10:16am So all these successful business leaders can see that the Paris Accords are a good thing but the failed business leader can't? Why is that not surprising? All you need to know about Trump's business acumen is that he sent a successful Casino into bankruptcy. Reply 0 thelovedog @thelovedog Jun 3, 2017, 1:15pm Editors, Reading your ABOUT page title states, "Gizmodo loves technology + entertainment" and goes further to explain what the website is about, "We're obsessed with the gadgets, car tech, science and geek culture that change the way we live. Gizmodo covers Australian science and entertainment news with a team of award-winning journalists — and localises the best posts from the US + UK editions." All well and good, so in light of this information, why are you publishing poilitical news about Trump, surely this would be better off in the BUSINESS INSIDER arm of your publications. I come to GIZMODO to read about TECHNOLOGY and ENTERTAINMENT, not about poilitics. Regards. Reply 0 djbear @djbear Jun 4, 2017, 11:19pm If you dislike these articles.

Here's what they had to say. NYPD Fails To Convince Court Its Deafening Sound Cannon Is Just A 'Communication Tool' Sidney Fussell 03 Jun 2017 1:00 PM On Wednesday, a US federal judge ruled that the sound emitted from the NYPD's Long Range Acoustic Devices -- portable sound cannons that blast noise -- could be considered a use of force, contrary to the police department's claims. The LRAD can blast sound as loudly as 136 decibels. That's louder than a jackhammer or a jet engine and above the 120 db threshold for immediate human hearing loss. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MOBILE Latest iPhone 8 leak looks like crap Harrison Weber@harrisonweber June 2, 2017 1:39 PM We don’t know how Apple plans to redesign the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, or whatever Apple plans to call its next two (or three) phones. But there is an eclectic assortment of hints to go on just three days before Apple’s annual developer conference. Let’s review: Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone is the flagship investors have pined for. It’s apparently tailor-made for augmented reality. There will be a slimmer bezel — but how slim? It’s coming in June — or this fall, or even 2018. It’s gonna be totally clear — no, no, no. It could charge wirelessly? And most pressing: Apple magically slipped its Touch ID fingerprint scanner beneath the glass, under the screen itself — very cool! Or maybe not: A new leak suggests otherwise. Images from iPhoneros reinforce an earlier rumor that Apple has totally given up and decided to slap its fingerprint scanner on the iPhone 8’s butt. Let’s rephrase that statement as a question: Is Jony Ive trying to get fired? As 9to5Mac reports, this may just be one of many design variations Apple has tested recently, while the company figures out its production plans for the device. Apple, please don’t let this be your big update after three whole years. Let it be a fake. Just, no.

By Crystal Kim June 2, 2017 3:38 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn appeared on Bloomberg TV to talk about General Motors (GM) and his plan to unlock shareholder value, yet again. Makes sense given the auto company is holding its annual meeting next week Tuesday. We'll all find out soon enough if Einhorn's proposed dual-class share will take a step forward or go by the way of his iPrefs idea for Apple (AAPL). David Einhorn, President of Greenlight Capitol Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty Images Bloomberg TV provided Barrons.com with a transcript of the video that can be seen here. Here are the highlights from Einhorn's discussion with David Westin:  How the dual-class share will unlock value It has to do with choice.  Think of it as an ice cream stand that sells just vanilla chocolate swirl.  There's some people who like vanilla chocolate swirl, and we'll call those the GM shareholders.  But if chocolate is the dividend and vanilla is the rest of the operation, imagine if you sold chocolate, vanilla, or swirl, in any combination that you want.  That ice cream stand would attract more customers. So there's people who'd be interested in the income feature of the dividends.  They would buy the dividend shares.  And those would be new participants in the market that would come in, and they would get them, we think to a seven to nine percent yield.  And similarly, there are people who are not that interested in a dividend but want just to see the stock go up.  They would buy the growth shares, the capital appreciation shares, and we think that that would trade at about the same PE as you have right now. How GM is like Apple Look, with Apple, they had a problem with capital allocation.  They were storing lots and lots of cash.  They were returning none of it to shareholders... But instead, what they did was they changed their constraint. They previously said, we're not buying back stock, and since then, they've borrowed $100 billion. They've bought back a quarter of the stock, at less than $100.  The PE net of cash has expanded from 7 to 13, in part because Apple has a better capital allocation policy today than it did before we came in. Now GM has a similar inefficient balance sheet.  They've said that there's these constraints because they want to retain all of this money for a potential rainy day.  There's several ways to get at it.  Our purpose in electing directors is to get at that problem. Why he's short Tesla Tesla is one of many things we have in what we so call our bubble basket of stocks that we just think are mispriced and are mispriced by huge, huge amounts.  And they're sized in a way that gives us the ability to wait a fair amount of time to be proven right or wrong.  I think eventually, the mood of the market will change.  Eventually, the company will be called into account to demonstrate profitability.  I don't know when that will happen.  And the portfolio's positioned properly relative to the risk and the reward there.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Computer Stocks to Buy in 2017 Investors looking for a play on computers -- as well as their software and hardware -- should consider these three companies this year. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Jun 2, 2017 at 3:09PM In the first quarter of 2017 the PC market reported its first growth in the past five quarters, but just barely. PC sales, which include desktops, notebooks, and workstations, hit 60.3 million units in the first quarter, up 0.6% year over year according to research from IDC.  Despite this snail-like growth, there are still several solid opportunities for investors looking to snatch up the best computer stocks this year. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) are all longtime players in the computer market, and each is poised to benefit in its respective segment this year.  Image source: Apple. Apple Apple reported Mac unit sales of 4.2 million in its fiscal second quarter 2017, an increase of 4% year over year, and said the net revenue from those sales hit $5.8 billion, up 14% year over year. Apple's PC sales pale in comparison to its iPhone business, but that doesn't mean Apple should be written off as a solid computer investment.  Image source: Apple. Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call that its new Macbook Pro helped spur Mac revenues in the quarter, and that Mac business has generated over $25 billion of revenue over the past four quarters. "We're investing aggressively in its future, and we are very excited about the innovation we can bring to the platform," Cook added.  Apple will likely keep the good times rolling for its Macs this year when it releases updates to both the Pro and regular Macbook lineups next month. The company is expected to bring new, 7th-generation Intel Kaby Lake chips into both the Macbook and Macbook Pro lineups, which should boost processing speeds and increase battery life. Apple is the fourth-largest PC vendor in the world. It just raised it's dividend by 10.5% in the second quarter, and continues to prove that incremental upgrades to its Macs and other devices are more than enough to drive more growth from this longtime computer stock.  Abobe Pivoting to the software side of computer stocks, Adobe is a great example of a company transitioning from one-time software sales to recurring revenue through a subscription-based model -- and it's paying off enormously for the company.  Adobe just reported its strongest first quarter ever, with revenue up 21.6% year over year to $1.68 billion and GAAP net income jumping 56.7% to $254.3 million. The company's Digital-media segment, driven by subscriptions to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, deserve most of the credit for the stellar quarter, as it grew 22% year over year.  Image source: Adobe. Even with sales of PCs slowing down, Abobe is proving there is still substantial need for creative software that users are willing to pay for on an ongoing basis. Adobe CFO Mark Garrett indicated in a press release that there's likely more for investors to look forward to this year as well. Our solid execution and business momentum combined with strong market tailwinds give us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver strong financial results. We remain bullish about our prospects for the rest of 2017 and beyond. NVIDIA NVIDIA may not be what you consider a traditional computer stock, but the company makes the vast majority of its revenue -- about 53% -- from sales of its graphics processing units (GPUs) that go into PCs, which, I think, is a solid computer stock bonafide. NVIDIA has caught the attention of investors for its growing opportunities in driverless cars and virtual reality, but the company's GPUs are also being used to power complex data centers for artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities.  Image source: NVIDIA. Intel may dominate the server business right now, but NVIDIA's chips are already helping Facebook, Alphabet, and others take the next step into visual computing and neural network learning. NVIDIA's DGX-1 supercomputer is a prime example of this -- it can learn 12 times faster than the company's previous machine learning computers.  Aside from AI computing, NVIDIA's GPUs are the go-to choice for PC makers' graphics processing needs for gaming and virtual reality. That bodes very well for NVIDIA, as IDC has noted that PC gaming growth is helping to stabilize the broader PC market and VR is shaping up to be a nearly $34 billion business by 2022.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology The Essential Phone vs. iPhone 7 Will Shanklin June 2, 2017 How does Andy Rubin's Essential Phone compare to the iPhone 7? View gallery - 20 images Android co-founder Andy Rubin's The Essential Phone joins a crowded field of smartphones competing for the same Android enthusiast base of customers. Let's see how the Essential Phone compares to Apple's behemoth across the aisle, the iPhone 7. Size NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW Sizes aren't dramatically different, with the Essential Phone measuring 3-percent taller, 6-percent wider and 10-percent thicker. Weight The Essential Phone does, however, tip the scales at 34-percent heavier. Build Rubin says the Essential Phone is sturdier than aluminum rivals like the iPhone, with its titanium frame and ceramic back. Water resistance Even if the Essential Phone can survive drops without the use of a case, it isn't designed to withstand exposure to water. Display size The Essential Phone joins a soon-to-be-crowded group of phones with minimal bezels. Apple will join that club later this year, but for now the iPhone 7 has plenty of bezel surrounding its screen – and an inferior screen-size-to-phone-size ratio. Display resolution The Essential Phone's QHD+ screen packs in the pixels much tighter, though Apple's focus on other details (contrast, white balance, brightness) makes iPhone screen quality often transcend by a wide margin what you'd expect from their pixel counts. Processor The Essential Phone runs Qualcomm's 2017 flagship chip, the Snapdragon 835. RAM The Essential Phone doubles the iPhone's RAM, but Apple is known for doing more with less in the RAM department (in terms of how specs translate into real-world performance). Battery The Essential Phone has a much bigger battery, but with many other factors weighing into actual battery life, you can only glean so much from this. Fast charging Apple had better include fast charging in its 2017 flagships: iPhones have fallen way behind in this respect. Camera megapixels Camera quality is also impossible to determine entirely from a spec sheet; this too will need to wait for reviews. Camera aperture (rear) Apertures, which can determine the quality of low-lit shots, are very similar. Storage Apple offers three different storage tiers, while Essential sticks with one generous 128 GB option. microSD Neither has expandable storage. Fingerprint sensor Essential Phone has a fingerprint sensor on its back, while the iPhone's lives inside its home button. Headphone jack Like Apple, Essential sees the 3.5-mm headphone jack as a relic from the past. Software The Essential Phone is supposed to launch with the latest version of Android Nougat – and apparently without the custom manufacturer skins often associated with non-Pixel/Nexus Android handsets. Release You can reserve an Essential Phone pre-order now, with the first shipments scheduled to start in June. Starting price (full retail) At least on paper, the Essential Phone looks like a solid value compared to the iPhone 7 – with a much bigger screen, supposedly sturdier build and modular potential (which, right now, only includes a 360° camera). On the other hand, it's joining a group of phones already including the Google Pixel and OnePlus series that's targeting the same base of Android-enthusiast customers. And if you're invested in Apple's ecosystem and like the company's hardware-software synchronicity, it's hard to see the Essential Phone being enough to pry you away.

Photo Credit: Noah K. Murray advertisement | advertise on newsday Eli Apple didn’t know the old Landon Collins. He wasn’t around when Collins was a rookie, at times looking overwhelmed and overmatched as a starting safety in a patchwork secondary. The only Collins he saw up close was the All-Pro version that emerged last season to become a force for the Giants’ defense while Apple himself was going through his sometimes bumpy rookie year. That doesn’t mean that Apple was unaware of the jump Collins made from his first to second year in the NFL.

This year, Apple would like to follow Collins’ trajectory with his own sophomore surge. He’d like to leap from a solid but unspectacular rookie campaign to become a standard-bearer for the defense. And he’s using Collins as a bit of a road map. “You have to take a more serious approach about everything, you have to be able to be a grown man about things,” Apple said. “Landon, he does a lot of things for himself outside of football. That means getting his body right, working on recovery and stuff. That’s something I need to work on and something I’m working on now.” GiantsGiants OTAs 2017 And something he’s been working on all offseason. Training in Arizona, Apple put on nearly 10 pounds of muscle since last season ended. He was at 195 throughout college and for most of last year but now weighs 204. And while that strength will help him be a better, more physical tackler and allow him to contend with big-bodied receivers at the line of scrimmage, it has not had an adverse effect on his speed. Last week, in fact, he said the GPS chip the Giants use to track players during practices registered that he’d never been faster since joining the team as last year’s first-round pick. advertisement | advertise on newsday “It’s the truth,” he said with a grin when challenged about the reading. It was during that pace-setting practice on May 25 when Apple tweaked his hamstring, and he hasn’t been on the field with the team for any important activities since. He said he hopes to be back on the field before the offseason program ends in two weeks. Even if he’s not, his mental comfort with the defense is improving each day. “I’m 10 times ahead of where I was last year,” he said. The physical alteration, though, is what’s most noticeable at first glance. He credited the change to hard work and diet, getting rid of the junk food and telling his mother to make less fried chicken for him. But he also took it upon himself to learn how to cook a bit, took more responsibility for his actions and decisions and, as he said of Collins, tried to become “a grown man.” Apple’s physical transformation during his first offseason in the NFL also rings of Collins, although the safety lost weight instead of gaining it to come back sleeker and more agile. Giants videos None of this means that Apple automatically will follow Collins’ ascension. And he knows that. “You have to be your own self,” Apple said. “You can’t just look at one guy and be like, ‘This is how it’s going to work for me.’ But you can try to take little things that you learned from his jump and try to implement them into what you have going on.” And hopefully, Apple said, even if the paths are different, the results will be similar.

With iPhone sales slowing and the last new Apple product released two years ago, expectations are building for what the company will reveal next week at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Some Apple watchers are counting on artificial intelligence. With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing AI in their conferences over the past two months, market analysts believe it’s Apple’s turn. As the race for artificial intelligence heats up in Silicon Valley, some say Apple is already behind the game. “If Apple skips AI, I would consider that a significant miss on their opportunity,” said John Jackson, a Boston-based analyst for IDC. “Apple is late to this game. There is no other trick up their sleeve around this.” Apple, long known for its secrecy, declined to discuss specifics of the event but emailed a statement that its global developer community has earned more than $70 billion since the App Store launched in 2008. Rumors and early reports indicate the Cupertino, Calif., tech giant might release a new iPad pro, and according to Bloomberg, a Siri-controlled home speaker to challenge Amazon Echo and Google Home. Gene Munster, a venture capitalist at Loup Ventures and a longtime Apple watcher, said a home speaker would be a step in the right direction for Apple. “Artificial intelligence is fundamental to every company now,” Munster said. “We knew Apple was going to improve on Siri, and (the speaker) seems to line up. It makes logical sense.” In addition to the Siri speaker, rumors of a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, an updated MacBook Pro and a new iOS 11 have circulated on the internet. The five-day conference to be attended by more than 5,000 developers – who each paid $1,599 after winning a lottery – is moving from San Francisco to San Jose, where it will be held for the first time since 2002. Apple CEO Tim Cook will give the keynote speech Monday morning. His speech will be streamed live on Apple’s website, or through the WWDC iOS app. Some experts pushed back on the notion that Apple is behind in the AI race, saying Siri is not the only AI-driven technology built by Apple. But they acknowledged that companies like Amazon and Google have made smart AI-driven devices marketable – Google identifies itself as an AI first company – as Apple has mostly worked behind closed curtains. “For the average Joe on the street, AI for Amazon is Echo and Alexa,” said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Creative Strategies. “Apple just chose not to label everything AI. Apple chose to let our experience with its devices speak for itself. But I think we are at a point where AI does matter in the advertising spiel.” In recent years, Apple has seen a decline in the sales of its main products, most noticeably the iPhone. Apple reported 50.8 million iPhones sold worldwide in the second quarter of 2017, down from 51.2 million a year earlier. Expectations are that Apple will unveil a new iPhone in the fall for the device’s 10th anniversary. Apple Watch, its latest product from 2015, saw its 2016 sales number double from the year before, according to Cook in the last earnings call. Apple does not release Apple Watch sales numbers, but some analysts have estimated about 12 million of the devices were sold last year.

Can’t rest until you know which summer blockbuster your pals enjoyed most? If you love finding out your friends’ opinions, I have good news: you don’t have to go around asking them individually. Thanks to the power of social media polls, you can quiz your friends and get responses in real-time. Next time you have to know whether vanilla or chocolate is more popular, here’s how to collect the thoughts of those closest to you. Twitter Polls In 2015, Twitter rolled out native support for polls, and they couldn’t be simpler. Just create a new tweet on the web or mobile versions of Twitter, and click the small Poll icon at the bottom of the tweet draft. You’ll have the standard 140 characters to type out a question, and can add up to four choices for readers to respond with. Finally, you can select the amount of time the poll stays alive for. The default is one day, but you can run a poll for a few minutes or an entire week. Which of these @MakeUseOf sections is your favorite? — Ben Stegner (@stegnersaurus) May 30, 2017 Obviously, your Twitter poll will only reach your followers to start, so the amount of responses you get will depend on how large your following is 10 Twitter Tips Most Pros Don't Even Know 10 Twitter Tips Most Pros Don't Even Know Read More . As long as your Twitter account isn’t private, anyone can retweet the poll just like any other tweet. If you start a poll about a hot topic, it could quickly spread beyond your sphere. To share the poll with more people, you can also embed it like you would a normal tweet. Pasting the URL to the tweet or using the embed code will let you add it to your blog or share on other social networks. Users must be signed into Twitter to vote, however. New poll!

Or want to share your polls across more services? The ultra-simple site Straw Poll is for you. It doesn’t require any sign-up or authentication. Simply type a question for your social media poll, enter as many choices as you need, and you’ve got a link you can share with your friends anywhere. Once a user completes it, they can view the results or share it with their friends via social links. To prevent spam and duplicate answers, Straw Poll offers a few extra options. The drop-down box below the poll offers three choices for blocking duplication: IP Duplication Checking — Users can’t vote from the same IP address multiple times. This will prevent two people living in the same house from both voting. Browser Cookie Duplication Checking — Instead of checking the IP address, Straw Poll will check the user’s browser cookies to see if they’ve voted yet. This allows two people in the same house to each vote, but if someone cleared their cookies What Are Supercookies, and Why Are They Dangerous? What Are Supercookies, and Why Are They Dangerous?

If you select Allow multiple poll answers, users can check as many options as they want. This service doesn’t offer an option to end polls after a certain time.

It doesn’t require your friends to sign up, works great on mobile, and collects the data you want in a simple form.

Google Forms If you’re running an official quiz for a class assignment or something similar, you might need more flexible options and actionable data than a Twitter poll or Straw Poll provides. That’s where Google Forms comes in. This tool in the free Google Docs suite lets you create polls with different types of questions, add multiple pages, and send all the data to a spreadsheet for analysis. Head to Google Forms to get started. Like other Google tools, you can start with a blank form and build your own or use a template for common events like an RSVP, t-shirt ordering, or contact info. Question forms include: Short answer — Let someone type a sentence or two, like their name or a brief thought on a topic. Multiple choice — Standard question with multiple answers, only one of which the user can select. You can also add an Other option here. Checkboxes — You provide multiple answers and the respondent can select as many as apply. Linear scale — Set a numbered scale and ask the user to rate how often they do something or how strongly they feel on a question. Forms Options To add some flow to your poll, you can add images and YouTube videos using the right sidebar. You could ask how a particular image makes someone feel, or if they laughed at a YouTube video, for instance. Dividing your poll into sections will break it into multiple pages, and you can send users to these sections based on their answers. For instance, if you’re creating a poll to see which iPhone apps people use most often, your first page could simply ask Do you own an iPhone? If the user said No, you can specify that choosing that answer sends them to the end of the poll.

Credit: Apple More like this iPhone 8 rumors: Delayed production schedule could result in blockbuster... WWDC 2017 wish list: iOS 11 features that would take the iPhone and iPad to... Should Apple dump Lightning from the iPhone 8? The cases for and against Video WWDC 2017: Our Top 3 Predictions It’s the week before the kick-off of Apple’s product year at WWDC in San Jose. This is a week full of wish lists, rumors, speculation, and wild ideas. Next week all of that will collapse into one single truth: the reality of what’s unveiled on stage in San Jose. Gamblers know this feeling. Once the result is known, all of the probabilities collapse to the cold, hard truth of winners and losers. With that theme in mind, this is not another WWDC Wish List. Rather, consider this a report on the current odds of various WWDC predictions coming true. This is all in fun, ladies and gentlemen, so please: no wagering! Sure bets The surest bet at any WWDC is that Apple will unveil the next generation of all of its operating systems, due to ship in the fall. Yes, it’s a near certainty that Apple will announce details about the next versions of iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Another near-certainty: Apple likes to please its audience, and at WWDC (unlike the invite-only media events Apple holds the rest of the year), the audience is primarily Apple developers. So you can count on Apple making some announcements that are focused on getting whoops of applause from the assembled developers. That will likely come in a verbal commitment to professional Mac users—and pretty much every developer for Apple’s platforms uses a Mac to get their job done. Apple Expect to hear a lot about Apple services like iCloud. Apple has been hyping the growth of its Services revenue line with Wall Street a lot recently. Services are a major growth area for Apple, and while it’s easy to lose sight of them when we’re all hyped up for new hardware and software announcements, it’s hard to imagine that Apple’s various services won’t be a recurring theme of the keynote. We’ll hear about iCloud, iCloud Photo Library, and Apple Music... a lot. If you’ve been paying attention to the last couple of years of tech-industry stage events, it’s clear that the large tech companies (especially Apple) have heard the criticism that their stage presenters are overwhelmingly white and male. Apple has been slowly changing the mix of their presenters, bringing in new faces including more women and people of color. The usual suspects will be on stage, of course, but it’s not much of a bet to predict that we’ll see a bunch of new faces on stage as well. Finally, I’m not going to accept any bets about the fact that Apple will continue something it’s been doing at most of its major events for the past two years: defining what Apple Watch is good at. Since the first what-doesn’t-it-do event in September of 2014, Apple has been working to give the product more definition. Health and fitness have both been areas of focus, and I expect to see those enhanced, perhaps joined by one or two more. Apple is still in the process of defining the Apple Watch, and that process will continue. Informed speculation Go to the race track and you’ll find someone who thinks they have a hot tip or inside information about what’s to come. (Disclosure: I’ve never been to a race track, but I’ve seen “Seabiscuit” and “The Killing”—that’s good enough, right?) Rumors serve the same purpose for laying WWDC odds. Some rumors are always right, but all rumors are never right. The trick is knowing which rumors are more likely to come true. Adam Patrick Murray A new iPad Pro announcement? Seems likely. Lately the rumor mill has been bubbling about the possibility of Apple unveiling a new iPad Pro at WWDC, a replacement for the existing 9.7-inch model, with a higher-resolution screen. Normally I’d be skeptical of such claims, but the iPad Pro hasn’t been updated in more than a year and these rumors suggest this product has been ready to go for some time now. Meanwhile, fans of the iPad Pro have been restless, since the major additions of pro features in iOS 9 were followed by almost no new pro features in iOS 10. It makes sense for Apple to introduce a new iPad Pro at the same time as trumpeting its commitment to the iPad via a bunch of major new pro features in iOS 11. That’s why I think this rumor is fairly likely to come true. A bunch of laptop updates are also thick in the rumor mill, and it’s true that the MacBook is in need of an update. But the rumors also suggest that Apple might put new chips in the existing MacBook Pro models, which were just released last fall. That seems surprising—but it does fit with one of my sure-thing themes of the event, which is Apple showing a bigger commitment to its professional users, especially developers. Telling a crowd of developers that Apple is rapidly updating its pro laptops is a demonstration of Apple’s commitment, and would be met with cheers. IDG An Amazon TV deal with Apple has made the rumor mill, but is it worth mentioning during the WWDC keynote? At these events Apple loves to talk about amazing entertainment deals it’s made. The trick is, even if Apple’s willing, are its partners? It would make sense that Apple would trumpet some coup on stage, whether it’s related to its original TV series efforts, a deal with Amazon to return to the Apple TV, or a content deal in the music or video spheres. Rumor has it that the Amazon deal is a go; it just gives me pause to consider that the relationship between the two companies has been repaired to the point where Apple promotes it on stage at a keynote. Finally, there are lots of rumblings out there that a Siri Speaker might be in the offing at last. I’m lukewarm on this rumor—it could happen, but Apple could also hold off until fall, when the product is rumored to be ready to ship. But given the heat around voice assistants in general, it seems highly likely that Siri will be a star of the show. Apple can extend the SiriKit extensions it added last year that give developers direct integration with Siri, improve Siri on the Mac, and disclose new Siri features it’s been working on. If there’s a hardware tease on top of that, all the better. Tough calls It would seem like an easy call to predict that many of the features Apple introduced in the past year—dual-camera support, the Touch Bar, Messages stickers and apps—will be improved. Sometimes Apple keeps moving new technology forward—and other times it walks away for a while. A good example is iPad multitasking, which was launched with iOS 9 and was unchanged in iOS 10, and might get some work in iOS 11, or might not. Predicting that last year’s introductions will be this year’s improvements is a risky game. Adam Patrick Murray Will there be time in the keynote to introduce a new standalone keyboard with a TouchBar? I’ve seen predictions of new Apple input devices, most notably a Magic Keyboard with Touch Bar or Touch ID support. It sounds like a good idea to me, but there’s already so much hardware rumored for WWDC that it’s hard to see this as being a product Apple would devote keynote time to. The longshots Then there are the longshots. Every year something outlandish, something we would never have predicted, ends up coming true. But most of these predictions end up dead and forgotten—or filed away for predictions at a future Apple event. Without going into detail, here are my longshots for WWDC 2017. I don’t think they’re going to happen, but they could! Apple skips a cycle for one or more of its platforms, rather than incrementing its version number and declaring it a new feature. No new watchOS update, perhaps, or tvOS. This would seem to be inconsistent with Apple’s behavior, but Apple’s been doing a lot of zagging where it used to zig. macOS drops the California placenames and joins iOS in lockstep at version 11. I have a hard time seeing Apple do this, but does anyone really need to use macOS 10.13 Joshua Tree? “iOS 11 and macOS 11” sounds a lot better. This year’s the year, though. Forlorn Apple hardware gets some love. Would the Mac mini get an update? Would the Apple TV get upgraded to 4K? Would the Mac Pro, which is coming back next year, get a mention? It’s all possible, but not likely. Hints of VR or AR functionality. This stuff seems a long way off, but could Apple wrap some augmented-reality-like feature into the iPhone Camera app and show it off knowing that it’s really dipping its toe into AR? Or what about a VR strategy based around the iPhone, somehow? Unlikely, but never say never. Major new Mac features. Most macOS updates these days are about keeping the Mac platform in sync with Apple’s others. What if Apple made major changes on the Mac, with new features that made the Mac better at its job, despite the lack of connection to iOS? Look, I told you these were the longshots. But we can hope, can’t we? To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

NBA June 2, 2017 2:30pm EDT June 2, 2017 2:30pm EDT Basketball, Golden State Warriors, English, NBA Rihanna fans are upset at an Apple executive because he appeared to tell the singer to sit down. Rihanna (Getty Images) Jordan Heck Omnisport @jordanheckff Published on Jun. 2, 2017 Jun. 2, 2017 Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue is a big-time Warriors fan and had courtside seats located near Rihanna during Game 1 of the NBA Finals. At one point in the game, however, it appeared Cue told the popular singer to sit down when she gave a bow to LeBron James.  Naturally, after video spread of Cue appearing to tell her to sit down, her fans sent angry tweets at him. Some have speculated he uttered the phrase, "Tell that b— to sit down" which is why there's been such a strong response to the incident. Not everyone recognized the tech guru, but several did, and some apparently plan to boycott Apple products as a result. Oh cancelling my Apple Music subscription @cue - no one yells at Rihanna, especially not a grown white man telling her to "sit down" — Eileen Carey (@eileenmcarey) June 2, 2017 After feeling the wrath of Rihanna's fans, Cue responded to a critic about the incident. He claims he wasn't upset at Rihanna and that whatever message he was trying to relay was actually intended for someone he knows. Apple also reportedly said he "was talking to someone he knew between him and [Rihanna]. He wasn't telling her to sit down." Nothing but love for Rihanna (and KD, too!) As usual I was excited about our lead and actually talking to Marissa, 8 seats to my right. — Eddy Cue (@cue) June 2, 2017 Case solved? Not exactly. Rihanna's fans aren't buying the excuse, and are demanding an apology.  Nah you disrespected a beautiful woman and thought nobody would see it!

(@clapbackanna) June 2, 2017 If @cue doesn't apologize for his recent misogynist outburst towards @Rihanna I'm cancelling my subscription @AppleMusic — STAUNCH (@KammBe) June 2, 2017 A different angle of the incident doesn't look like he's speaking to anyone else directly. He mentioned the intended recipient was eight seats to his right, but the person eight seats to his right appears to be a gentleman in a blue shirt. Now there is a woman in a yelllow shirt sitting close to Rihanna who is also standing, so it's possible Cue just miscounted the number of seats. There's likely no way of knowing for sure what the intention here was. Cue is obviously going to defend himself by saying he wasn't directing his language toward her, and Rihanna is probably too busy doing Rihanna things to let this affect her day.  NBA Draft mistakes: Every team's ugliest, most painful regret NBA coaching rumors: Which college coaches could be ready to turn pro?

The move has led to messages from a number of tech CEOs, who have expressed their disappointment at the move. “We are getting out,” Trump said. “But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great. And if we can’t, that’s fine." Unlike Nicaragua, which believes the accord doesn’t do enough to protect the environment, and Syria, whose government struggles to take part because of sanctions, Trump's reason for withdrawing from the agreement is to “protect America and its citizens.” He says it's "very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States," and would impose "draconian financial and economic burdens." As reported yesterday, the decision has led to Elon Musk leaving the presidential councils. Not long after Trump finished his speech, the Tesla boss tweeted: “Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.” He was joined by Disney CEO Robert Iger, who also resigned from the council “as a matter of principle.” IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, however, will remain on Trump’s business advisory council. Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 Other leaders from the tech world also took to Twitter opposing the move. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who spoke to Trump on Tuesday to try and convince him to remain, wrote: “Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver.” Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver. — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) June 2, 2017 Cook also sent an internal note to his employees. “Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it. I want to reassure you that today’s developments will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment,” it read. “Our mission has always been to leave the world better than we found it. We will never waver, because we know that future generations depend on us.” 25 firms including Microsoft, Intel, Apple, and Google, took out a last-minute full-page ad in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal yesterday, promoting the benefits of the agreement. Dear President Trump, as some of the largest companies in the US, we strongly urge you to keep the US in the Paris Agreement. pic.twitter.com/ztSXyYtRrm — Marc Benioff (@Benioff) June 1, 2017 Twitter boss Jack Dorsey, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and many more used social media to attack the President’s decision. Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all. — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) June 1, 2017 This is an incredibly shortsighted move backwards by the federal government. We're all on this planet together and we need to work together. https://t.co/tLEdtG0n1o — jack (@jack) June 1, 2017 The last time CEOs rallied against Trump like this was after he introduced the immigration ban. With people now leaving his councils, and virtually every company condemning the withdrawal, the relationship between the President and the tech industry has hit a low point.

WHAT IS THE PARIS AGREEMENT? The Paris Agreement is the first large-scale global agreement to combat what scientists say is climate change, coming together at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2015 and adopted on December 12. On Earth Day of 2016, April 22, it was opened for signatures and enough European countries signed on so that the agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, four days before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. China and the United States had already committed to backing the deal in September 2016, with their greenhouse gas output accounting for nearly 40 percent of the world's emissions. To go into legal force, countries accounting for 55 percent of the world's emissions had to sign on. The deal asks that the countries signing on reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Right now 147 countries have ratified the agreement to the 197 who attended the convention.  The aim is to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius - 3.6F - this century. Part of the reason the Paris Agreement was successful was that ratifying countries can decide independently how to reduce their emissions rather than being told how much to cut by.  Counties, instead, put forward their best efforts through 'nationally determined contributions.'   The binding part of the agreement makes countries report on their progress decreasing emissions, while the actual setting of emission-reduction targets is non-binding.  The United States said it would try to reduce emissions from its 2005 level by 17 percent in 2020 and 26 to 28 percent by 2025. The nearly four minute video begins with an image of New York City that may be unsettling – the water has risen so high that many of its monstrous skyscrapers are barely peaking up from a watery grave. Fifth Avenue, Wall Street and Time Square, all of which used to be filled with hundreds of people on any given day, are shown completely empty and submerged in water. And Grand Central Station, which attracts people from all over the world, looks more like a large watering hole instead of a busy train station. Tops of skyscrapers are barely peeking out of the murky water, streets have been transformed into flowing rivers and what was once home to 8.4 million people, is depicted as a ghost town Now, a video has surfaced online that has revealed the catastrophic effects of climate change on the massive city, which could become a reality over the next 60 to 80 years. Fifth Avenue (pictured), Wall Street and Time Square, all of which used to be filled with hundreds of people on any given day, are shown completely empty and submerged in water. The video continues to show different areas of New York, all of which tell the same story, but what may be one of the most unsettling aspects is that a city that has 8.4 million residents and 50 million people visiting each year is completely empty. 'Climate change is a new marker in our history. Man can now affect the climate, we are now in the anthropocene era,' said Max. 'Fortunately we have become aware of it and we must put all possible means to ensure that future generations enjoy a better environment. 'Antoine de St Exupery said :' We do not inherit the land of our parents, we borrow it from our children.' The video entitled, ' Two ° C ' was created by to film makers 'Claire&Max' Countour, who wanted to highlight what New York City would 'look like if there was a rise in water Wall Street (pictured), located in lower Manhattan, is also predicted to be underwater.  'We considered this video as an alert so that people become even more aware of the danger,' the creators of the video shared. 'The Paris Agreement limited to 2 degrees : these 2 degrees were already dangerous, but the recent US withdrawal is unconscious.' It may be unsettling to see the once populated Time Square (pictured) completely empty and flooded  'The video was done with 2 steps : first, we deleted the people of the streets (like our precedent work in Pairs 'Hypocentre') and then we add the water,' he continued. 'The water is a 3D modelization. We choose NYC because like Paris, NYC is our 'laboratory' for our experimental films.' 'We are fortunate to be able to come regularly to NYC and we love deeply NYC.  The title of the clip, 'Two ° C', was inspired by a recent study from a team of American researchers that noted 2 ◦C global warming is dangerous and could have catastrophic effects on our world over the next couple of decades. Grand Central Station (pictured), which attracts people from all over the world, looks more like a large watering hole instead of a busy train station The video was done with 2 steps : first, the deleted the people of the streets using Photoshop and then water was added using 3D simulation software  'The IPCC , an intergovernmental panel of experts on climate change, predicted an average increase of 1 meter by 2100: their model underestimated the melting of the ice,' Claire and Max shared in a blog post. 'For James Hansen [one of the American researchers], these 2 ° would still remain dangerous because it integrates in its recent models the melting of the ice: it estimates an increase of 5 to 9m by 2080.' The video was shared online two days prior to Donald Trump making the announcement that the US was pulling out of the Paris agreement – citing it was bad for American jobs and bad for the environment. more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Time-lapse shows Jupiter in beautiful detail during Juno fly-over Watch video Scientists develop amazing new battery that recharges INSTANTLY Watch video Man assaults wife and lover after catching them in the act Watch video CCTV footage of men leading away woman before raping her Watch video This cat wants out!

India is hinging its participation on billions of dollars of foreign aid. 'The bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States,' he said. He argued later, 'The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.' The video was shared online two days prior to Donald Trump making the announcement that the US was pulling out of the Paris agreement – citing it was bad for American jobs and bad for the environment. But the video has painted a different picture and it seems to be a disaster  'This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States,' he contended. Trump said he would end the United States' participation in the United Nations' Green Climate Fund for the same reason. Although the US president listed multiple reasons to why the nation should and is leaving the agreement, many Americans are not on board with the decision and are worried what the future holds for not just their country, but for the entire world. more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Time-lapse shows Jupiter in beautiful detail during Juno fly-over Watch video Scientists develop amazing new battery that recharges INSTANTLY Watch video CCTV footage of men leading away woman before raping her Watch video Man assaults wife and lover after catching them in the act Watch video This cat wants out!

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple All the news we expect from Apple's huge developers conference Daniel Howley Dan Howley June 2, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Apple CEO Tim Cook will be on hand for the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5. (Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP) Apple’s (AAPL) massive Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off Monday, June 5 at 1 p.m. E.T., and we’re expecting a host of new announcements. These announcements will give us a view into what the company has been working on over the past year, as well as what we can expect with its upcoming iPhone 8. Apple is known for using WWDC to showcase its newest software updates. That means we’ll likely see the latest versions of the company’s iOS for the iPhone and iPad, as well as macOS for Mac desktops and laptops. Apple should also announce improvements to its watchOS and tvOS systems, and could even roll out its very own Siri speaker to compete with the likes of Amazon’s (AMZN) Echo and Google’s (GOOGL, GOOG) Home. iOS 11 Apple regularly debuts the latest version of its iOS operating system at WWDC, and this year’s event should be no different. Interestingly, while hardware leaks are the norm for Apple’s devices now, we hardly see as many software leaks hit the web. That means we don’t know very much about iOS 11 quite yet. So far, the big rumors point to major updates to Apple’s Siri voice assistant, which first landed on the iPhone in 2011. While Siri has seen a slew of updates since then, it still can’t quite match the power of Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s Assistant apps. Apple’s iOS 11 will bring updates to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and some hints as to what we might see in the iPhone 8. With iOS 11, Apple could change that by bringing Siri more in line with what modern voice assistants have to offer such as expanded voice capabilities and improved language understanding. According to The Verifier, Apple could also add group calling to its FaceTime app, which would bring it in line with Google’s Hangouts and Microsoft’s Skype offerings. Whatever updates we see for iOS 11, it’s important to keep on eye on even the smallest changes, as they could provide a hint of what the iPhone 8 has to offer. Siri speaker Outside of iOS 11, Apple’s biggest potential announcement at WWDC is the Siri speaker. There haven’t been any leaked images of the speaker, which would compete directly with Amazon’s Echo, Google’s Home and Microsoft’s (MSFT) upcoming Cortana-enabled offerings. MacRumors says that Apple device will likely include facial-recognition technology and run off of the company’s iOS operating system.Bloomberg reports that Apple has already begun manufacturing the speaker, which means it could go on sale in the relatively near future. It will be interesting to see if Apple is capable of producing a product as powerful as Amazon’s Echo, especially since the Echo allows you to purchase items directly through Amazon using only your voice. macOS The software behind Apple’s Mac laptops and desktops, macOS is also expected to see some improvements at WWD. Little is known about the next major update to macOS, though if Apple sticks to recent patterns, it will likely throw in more iOS compatibility features to ensure iPhone users and Mac users stay within Apple’s product ecosystem. watchOS and tvOS As with Apple’s macOS, it’s still not clear what updates are coming to watchOS and tvOS.As CNET notes, Apple could begin offering a glucose monitor for the Apple Watch that would help diabetics monitor their blood sugar levels.CNBC reported in March that Apple CEO Tim Cook was seen walking around the company’s campus with a device connected to his watch that monitored his glucose. MacBook updates and a new iPad These rumors are a bit of a stretch, as Apple doesn’t usually announce much hardware at WWDC: But the mill keeps pointing to the potential for updated MacBooks and a new iPad debuting at the big show. According to Bloomberg, Apple will roll out three new MacBooks including a new version of the super-slim MacBook with a more powerful Intel processor, an upgraded MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with a new CPU. Read More Apple’s insanely thin and light MacBook is rumored to be getting an update at WWDC. It sounds like these MacBooks will only get improved internals, so don’t expect them to sport any new designs. The new iPad, meanwhile, is said to sport a 10.5-inch display and offer stylus support.9to5Mac says the iPad will manage to pack its large screen into a body that’s not much larger than the current 9.7-inch iPad. We’ll be on the ground in San Jose, California, and in our New York offices covering the day’s events as they happen. And don’t forget to follow all of the news as it happens via our live blog.

Video from Thursday night's game in Oakland shows Rihanna, a Cleveland Cavaliers fan, standing up to bow to star player Lebron James after a major play. A man wearing a Warriors shirt a few seats down is then seen in the background looking angry as he appears to motion towards the pop princess to take a seat.  That man was later identified as Apple Senior Vice President Eddy Cue, who is in charge of the company's Internet Software and Services division. That division includes the tech company's streaming service, Apple Music, which offers Rihanna's music. Scroll down for video  The man who allegedly yelled at Rihanna to sit down after she stood up to bow to Lebron James during last night's NBA Finals has been identified as an Apple senior vice president  A clip from the game shows Apple SVP Eddy Cue (right) appearing to motion to the pop princess to sit down  Cue runs a division that includes Apple Music, the company's streaming service which features music from Rihanna  Rihanna didn't appear to hear the Apple VP when she went back to talking with friends on the sidelines  In a tweet, Cue said that he had 'nothing but love for Rihanna' and wasn't talking to her in the clip  Rihanna fans were quick to express their outrage on Twitter, threatening to boycott Apple Music if Cue didn't apologize or if the company didn't fire him.  'I won't re-up my subscription until Rihanna gets a FULL & sincere apology from your sexist employee,' one fan wrote. Some of the Twitter users even claimed to hear Cue say 'Tell that b**** to sit down,' though DailyMail.com has not been able to confirm those reports.

Share this article Share 1.1k shares Cue responded to the criticisms with a tweet of his own, saying he has 'nothing but love for Rihanna' and wasn't talking to her in the first place.  'As usual I was excited about our lead and actually talking to Marissa, 8 seats to my right,' he said.  It's unclear who the Marissa that Cue mentioned is.  Cue has worked at Apple since 1989 and reports to CEO Tim Cook. According to his online bio, Cue was 'instrumental' in creating the iTunes and App stores.  Fans of Rihanna were quick to threaten a boycott of Apple Music if she didn't get a proper apology or if Cue wasn't fired The Cavs lost to the Warriors in a blow-out during Game 1, but Rihanna was nonetheless a proud cheerleader for her Cavs.  At one point, she was even heard yelling 'Briiiiiick!' as Kevin Durant tried to shoot a three-pointer.   As he passed her after successfully scoring the basket, Durant seemed to glare at the 29-year-old singer.  Lady in black: Rihanna cheered on the Cleveland Cavaliers and her favorite player LeBron James on Thursday during Game 1 of the NBA Finals in Oakland, California Cheering section: The singer and her personal assistant were rooting for the Cavaliers during the match Kevin Durant literally shot his shot for Rihanna pic.twitter.com/EX1PUaGXJM— justin lew block (@JBlock49) June 2, 2017 But Durant, 28, refused to be drawn on it after the game. He was asked during a post-game press conference with teammate Steph Curry if he stared the singer down on purpose. 'I don't even remember that,' Durant answered. The reporter then told Durant the exchange was blowing up on social media. 'Don't get in that trap,' Curry advised. Stare down: Golden State Warriors player Kevin Durant seemingly stared down Rihanna after drilling a three-point shot late in the game Not impressed: The singer looked on as Warriors star Durant ran past her courtside seat 'Yeah, I won't get into that. I'm cool. Have fun with that,' Durant said. Rihanna and her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales took their courtside seats with under three minutes left in the first quarter. The Diamonds singer arrived as the game was tied 24-24 after her favorite player LeBron James, 32, unleashed a furious dunk over Warriors player JaVale McGee.  ABC announcers were commenting on the dunk, but color commentator Jeff Van Gundy, 55, admitted he was distracted.  No memory: Durant insisted that he did not remember staring down Rihanna Super fan: Rihanna stood up and cheered for the Cavs while surround by fans of the home team Warriors Personal assistant: Rihanna's personal assistant Jennifer Rosales joined her for the game In the bag: The Stay singer peered into her purse during the game Easily distracted: The Diamonds singer arrived as the game was tied 24-24 and ABC commentator Jeff Van Gundy admitted his mind was away from the action 'I don't know about that but Rihanna just walked in front of me! Are you kidding me?!,' Jeff Van Gundy said. Fellow analyst Mark Jackson then told Van Gundy to keep his focus on the game. 'Come on, tell the truth, when she walked by she was stunning,' Van Gundy replied. The Bajan beauty wore an all-black ensemble that included a jacket with plunging neckline. She made her loyalty clear as she contrasted with most of the home team's fans who wore yellow T-shirts. Favorite player: James is shown bring the ball up the court while defended by Durant The Warriors cruised home to victory, beating the Cavs 113-91 but Rihanna remained steadfast in her support.  Durant finished with 38 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. Teammate Curry scored 28 points with six 3-pointers and 10 assists.  She was heckled by Warriors fans after the game while walking past the Cavaliers locker room. 'It doesn't matter, b****. The King is still the King,' she said.

Apple announced developers have earned over $70 billion since the App Store went live in 2008. Taking the tech giant's 70/30 revenue split into account, that means customers have spent over $100 billion in App Store purchases. Apple didn't stop with an earnings number boast as it also revealed App Store downloads grew by over 70% in the past 12 months, and active paid subscriptions are up 58% since the same time last year.

Yeah, they don't. They're fakes.  That's the word from one of the sources of the leaked photos, self-proclaimed gadgets leaker Benjamin Geskin. After originally posting the the pictures early Friday Eastern Time, Geskin, about an hour later, dubbed them "fake."  Chinese #iPhone8 "Clone". Not going to happen. Not real Apple design. This phone does not exist. Don't worry. https://t.co/COJtfdFUL8 — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) June 2, 2017 Instead, Geskin believes this is what Apple's upcoming "special" iPhone will look like. Note that unlike the one in the fake photos, this supposedly real design doesn't have Apple's Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone. Clone is wrong! This is how its going to look like. #iPhone8 pic.twitter.com/U7sY9hqm5S — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) June 2, 2017 There have been lots of rumors and supposed pictures circulating of the upcoming device, which will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. The fake photos Geskin posted — which were also shared by Spanish language tech site iPhoneros — were intriguing because they seemed to affirm some of the reports about the iPhone 8 while challenging others. iphone 8 leak iphonerosMore (Not the real iPhone 8.iPhoneros) Like the phone in the debunked photos, other supposed pictures of the upcoming device indicate it will have a vertically-oriented dual-lens camera. But most reports indicate the iPhone 8 will have thinner borders around its screen than the phone shown in the fake photos.  Geskin's debunking of one leak and affirmations of another, goes to show how leaks and rumors never truly reveal the final details of any product before its announced. Even if someone obtained a photo of an iPhone 8 from a verifiable Apple employee, it ought to be treated skeptically until Apple actually unveils the real thing.  Keep a handy grain of salt with you at all times, people, and be ready to throw it at rumors.   NOW WATCH: Here's everything Apple is rumored to be launching in 2017 More From Business Insider These secret codes let you access hidden iPhone features Apple is stepping up its war to steal Android customers Here's everything Apple is rumored to be launching in 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

The tech leader said he did all he could to try to stop Trump from making the move. “I know many of you share my disappointment with the White House’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement,” Cook wrote, according to Axios. “I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement. But it wasn’t enough.” (RELATED: Apple CEO Sends Consoling Letter To All Employees After Trump Win) The White House said that the Paris Agreement was poorly negotiated by the previous administration and that it will cost American jobs at the expense of negligible, if any, ecological benefit. Other advocates against the international accord told The Daily Caller News Foundation that there were many other disadvantages of the deal, including it undermining Trump’s deregulatory efforts. Cook, and several other tech executives like Tesla’s Elon Musk, disagree with Trump’s choice mainly for environmental reasons (rather than diplomatic ones), saying the accord is critical to help foster the creation of clean energy. “Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it,” Cook said in the email. “I want to reassure you that today’s developments will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment.” Follow Eric on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Opinion ProBeat: Google’s Chrome ad blocker initiative makes Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla look incompetent Emil Protalinski@EPro June 2, 2017 10:30 AM Google yesterday confirmed that Chrome is getting a built-in ad blocker that will block all the ads on a site (including Google’s own ads) if just one ad doesn’t meet certain standards. That’s right: Google, the company that makes the majority of its money from advertising, is building an ad blocker. This alone is crazy. Google already has the world’s most popular browser and it’s plowing ahead building arguably the only feature that would really differentiate other browsers. I find it astounding that none of the other major browser makers managed to beat Google to the punch. There is still time for Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla to act. Google’s solution isn’t coming to Chrome until “early 2018,” a timeframe that could easily slip. Delivering an ad blocker directly in Safari, Edge, or Firefox this year could help these browsers in their fight with Chrome. And yet, I don’t expect any of these companies to do anything but eventually follow in Google’s footsteps. Apple moves way too slowly with Safari updates. Some have even gone as far to call Safari the new IE. Still, Apple loves playing up the security and privacy features of its macOS and iOS devices, slamming Google at every opportunity. It makes plenty of sense for Safari to have some sort of built-in ad blocker that not only protects users but also hurts Google’s bottom line. I also don’t really expect Microsoft will do anything in time, despite the rumor of a native ad blocker in Edge back in March 2016. The company has certainly sped up its browser development compared to the IE days, but Edge is still only updated twice a year along with Windows 10. And the features in this year’s second release, the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, have already been announced. Firefox Tracking Protection That leaves Mozilla, the only company I can feasibly see not only getting something ready in time, but making sure it’s superior to what Chrome will have. Firefox could indeed steal Chrome’s thunder with a native ad blocker. Like Google, Mozilla updates its browser every six weeks or so. The firm also likes to regularly point out it develops the only independent browser — meaning it’s not tied to a tech company that has priorities which often don’t align with the web. Furthermore, Firefox has already offered a feature called Tracking Protection since November 2015. Just like how Chrome’s ad blocker won’t block all ads (if a site doesn’t have any low-quality ads, they all get shown), Firefox’s Tracking Protection also lets certain ads through. With Tracking Protection turned on, Firefox blocks website elements (ads, analytics trackers, and social share buttons) that could track you while you’re surfing the web, meaning it’s similar to add-ons like Ghostery and Privacy Badger. The problem is that Mozilla only offers Tracking Protection in Firefox’s Private Browsing mode (akin to Chrome’s Incognito or Edge’s InPrivate). If Mozilla really wanted to one-up Google, it would bring Tracking Protection to the forefront of Firefox. In fact, Mozilla ran an experiment that enabled Tracking Protection outside of Private Browsing mode. While the company identified websites that didn’t function properly with the feature on, and identified domains which have been incorrectly classified as trackers, it ended the experiment and didn’t pull the trigger on bringing it to Firefox users. “Making Tracking Protection available in Firefox outside of Private Browsing is certainly under consideration,” a Mozilla spokesperson told me a few months ago. “However, there are some websites which do not function properly when trackers are blocked.” In other words, Mozilla is being a coward. Its reluctance and inaction have given Google the perfect opening to let Chrome further pound Firefox into the ground. The feature wouldn’t even have to be enabled by default; Firefox could simply inform users about Tracking Protection and let them easily turn it on or off. The last step would be proper marketing: Firefox takes your privacy so seriously that it blocks ads and trackers more thoroughly than the ad blocker only coming to Chrome next year. Unless Apple, Microsoft, or Mozilla act quickly, you can bet Chrome’s stranglehold on the browser market will tighten. ProBeat is a column in which Emil rants about whatever crosses him that week.

Henderson/Getty Image Everyone had a lot of fun with Rihanna’s appearance at last night’s NBA Finals game. Her beloved LeBron lost, but her assistant heckled Kevin Durant; she also dabbed, and waved off some Warriors fan. However, it seemed like at least one person didn’t enjoy Rihanna at all: Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue, who was spotted allegedly yelling at Rihanna to sit down.

Oh cancelling my Apple Music subscription @cue – no one yells at Rihanna, especially not a grown white man telling her to "sit down" — Eileen Carey (@eileenmcarey) June 2, 2017 The tech world got involved immediately.

But for the people who make the apps, AR isn’t quite as simple, particularly when the apps they’re building involve 3D or “volumetric” objects — stuff you can walk around and interact with through the screen of the phone. Which is why Apple should start making that process a whole lot easier — especially if it is planning to release AR glasses in the future, ones that will need some sort of “killer app” or group of apps to justify their existence. Other companies, like Facebook, have now taken steps to let developers build AR experiences into their in-app cameras. You might not normally think of Facebook and Apple as direct competitors, but by doing this, Facebook has essentially set the stage for what is going to become an AR platform war on the phone. And Google already has its own AR platform, Tango. Amid the iOS, macOS, and potential Siri speaker reveals at WWDC next week, Apple needs to give due attention to AR. Augmented reality refers to any kind of computer-generated image that appears on top of a view of the real world. For the sake of this argument, however, let’s focus on smartphones. There are 2D AR apps: ones that do a pretty basic job of slapping a flat, non-dynamic digital image over the stuff you’re seeing through your camera lens. Developers say this is the easiest kind of AR mobile app to build. True 3D AR apps on mobile require sophisticated engineering right now Then there are 3D AR apps, which usually require more advanced software development and image processing. Think: Snapchat’s filters like the digital flower crown hovering over your head as you move around in real time, or the virtual furniture you can examine and walk around in home-renovation app Houzz. These may seem like lightweight (or lighthearted) applications, but Snapchat’s lenses require a serious amount of engineering, and the Houzz 3D AR feature took months to build. Another home-renovation platform that offers 3D imaging, Modsy, does most of its image processing after you’ve taken smartphone photos, which can take anywhere from five minutes to several hours. Afterward, it sends the rendered 3D images back to you. There’s another way to experience “true 3D” AR apps on a smartphone, and it’s a combo hardware-and-software solution. Google’s augmented reality computing platform, Tango, runs on smartphones that have a specific set of camera, infrared, and depth sensors. But right now there’s exactly one Tango phone model on the market. And some of the Tango apps are slow and low resolution. Since we’re not expecting any sort of hardware update to the iPhone lineup for the next four months at least — no new cameras or depth sensors that would enable 3D AR — that means any Apple advancements around AR in the near term will come from the software side. Some have speculated that Apple could announce “ARkit,” a kind of framework that would integrate parts of the existing camera with new software in a way that would allow developers to gather more information from the camera. Given that Apple chief executive Tim Cook has spoken so enthusiastically about AR in recent months, saying it’s a “big idea, like the smartphone,” this kind of framework makes a lot of sense. Currently, Apple doesn’t offer a specific API for virtual reality or augmented reality. There’s something called SceneKit, a kind of 3D-rendering engine for games, but no API for real-time object tracking. One developer, who spoke on background because of a pending AR app launch, told me that the one thing he has been hoping for is the ability to “hook into” the iPhone’s camera sensors and directly access the hardware in a way that developers currently can’t. Plus, if Apple really does plan to introduce AR glasses at some point in the future (something that has been rumored, but not confirmed), it will need a healthy ecosystem of app developers who know how to make or have already embraced augmented reality apps. Releasing a suite of developer tools for AR on the phone will presumably make it easier to move those apps over to future AR hardware products Apple could make. If Apple does eventually launch AR glasses, it’s going to need killer apps to prove that they’re useful, not awkward The last major pair of AR glasses to hit the market was the ill-fated Google Glass. Google Glass was awkward, made people uncomfortable in public, and even spawned the term “Glassholes.” But all of that may have been forgiven had the actual experience of having contextual information put right in front of your eyes been awesome. In other words: AR glasses are going to need apps so good and so useful that they justify whatever social awkwardness wearing a computer on your face creates. Will Apple be able to get major app developers to build AR apps for glasses, if and when it gets into glasses? Of course. But there’s also the very real possibility that the breakout app or surprise app for AR glasses would come from a less-established developer, one who wouldn’t have the resources to invest in true 3D AR if it’s as technically complicated as it is now. Apple has had a long-standing tradition of waiting to jump into a market because of the premise that it will do it — whatever it may be — better. But the company shouldn’t wait any longer to show the world that it’s serious about AR as a platform.

The images, which could be a prototype of Apple, were leaked by a source in China, the site said. iPhoneros said the source has previously sent over images that were proved accurate on multiple occasions, adding the individual has never sent them false information. The iPhone 8 is expected to  be unveiled in September, as usual, but may face release date delays due to the nature of these new designs.  Read: iPhone 8 Price, Rumors: Goldman Sachs Predicts New iPhone Will Cost $1K, Have 3D Sensing, No Home Button Meanwhile, leaker Benjamin Geskin also shared the images and said they were fake.   There have been previous rumors and leaked images that show a Touch ID on the back of the iPhone 8. Last week, images posted on Chinese social platform Weibo showed the button on the rear of the device, also underneath the Apple logo. A schematic of the iPhone 8 leaked in April by Sonny Dickson shows a circular hole underneath the Apple logo, which suggests the device could come with a Touch ID placement on the back of the device, like it’s placed on Samsung’s recently released Galaxy S8. Other reports claim the iPhone 8 will come with an edge-to-edge screen display with an embedded Touch ID on the front of the device. Apple was granted a patent for an edge-to-edge display and another patent for a Touch ID embedded in the display screen, it was discovered last month. Also in May, leaked images of alleged iPhone 8 molds suggested the device will not come with a Touch ID on the back. However, it seems like Apple is struggling with the feature. An analyst from Cowen and Co. previously said in April the embedded Touch ID was the feature Apple was having the most trouble. The analyst, Timothy Arcuri, gave three possible solutions Apple could take to address the problem: ditch the Touch ID and rely on face recognition technology, move the Touch ID to the back of the phone, or delay production of the iPhone 8 but still announce it this fall alongside the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. The leaked iPhone 8 images also show a vertically-aligned dual-camera system on the back of the phone, which has been previously rumored before. The new look would differ from the current horizontal placement on the iPhone 7 Plus. Read: Apple Making iPhone 8 Bigger Than iPhone 7? Dimensions Leaked In New Renders Apple’s 10th-anniversary phone, which could also be called the iPhone X, iPhone Pro or iPhone Edition, is also rumored to come with a 3D-sensing front camera and wireless charging. The phone is expected to feature an OLED display. Apple was said to have placed orders for OLED panels from Samsung for the iPhone 8.

Alongside a new version of iOS and other assorted goodies, the company is expected to wow attendees with the latest iteration of its desktop operating system, macOS 10.13. But what can we expect from the new software? We've run down the potential new features, as well as the release date and possible names. See related  iOS 11 release date, features and rumours WWDC 2017 dates, news and rumours: What to look out for at WWDC macOS Sierra UK release date, price, features: Night Shift mode returns with macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta 8 Features Rumours about what features Apple will include with the next version of macOS have been somewhat thin on the ground, but we can make some educated guesses as to what it's likely to feature. Following on from last year's conference, deeper integrations between the company's mobile and desktop operating systems are a fairly safe bet, helping the company to bolster its ecosystem and inject some more life into its services and subscriptions business. Another strong contender for inclusion in macOS 10.13 is the Apple File System (APFS). Introduced at WWDC 2016, the system is designed to improve space efficiency, encryption, and backups, and is optimised specifically for flash and SSD storage. The technology has been rolled out on iOS, but has yet to reach Apple's desktops, so it's a strong possibility that this could be the year it makes the jump. Design tweaks and changes are also a possibility, but given that macOS and iOS seem to be in sync from a design perspective, we're not anticipating any drastic visual changes. Name Ever since 2013, Apple has named its macOS releases after locations and landmarks in its home state of California. We've already had Sierra, El Capitan, Yosemite and Mavericks, but the next in the series is yet to be confirmed. Luckily, Apple has given us a couple of clues, in the form of a list of names that the company trademarked in 2014. Among the list are well-known Californian cities, animals, mountain ranges and deserts, including Ventura, Skyline, Pacific and Condor. Rumours are currently suggesting that the name of the next version macOS will start with an 'm', and that it won't be named after a mountain range or national park. With that in mind, our guess is that Apple is going to go with 'Mojave' - another entry in the list of trademarked names. Other options include Monterey, Mammoth and Miramar. Release date Apple's usual pattern is to unveil the next version of its desktop OS at its annual developer conference, and we're not expecting this to change for the latest release. macOS 10.13 will likely be shown off as part of the opening keynote on 5 June. Following the initial reveal, a developer preview will be made available shortly thereafter, with a public beta following a few months after that. The software won't hit general availability until this Autumn, however - most likely in September.

Here we round up all the latest news and rumours about watchOS 4, and break down its key features. Apple watchOS 4 At-a-glance Expected to feature at this year's WWDC in June Anticipated to be in beta for the next several months Likely to have fleshed out activity and health trackers and a host of new apps Jump to: Apple watchOS 4: release date and pricing Apple watchOS 4: features See related  iPhone 8 release date, features, and specs: Apple's legal feud is great for Intel, bad for the iPhone 8 WWDC 2017 dates, news and rumours: What to look out for at WWDC Apple watchOS 4: release date and pricing We will almost certainly see Apple's latest software iteration at this year's WWDC on 5 June. It's likely Apple will follow the same format as the launch of watchOS 3 last year, which saw the release of a beta test phase immediately following the presentation. The OS should be generally available to the public around September 2017.  As with other OS releases, watchOS 4 will be a free update to all users. Apple watchOS 4: features New apps The new OS generation should mean a richer set of supported apps, but there are a few in particular that users are craving for the Apple Watch. The Notes app, for example, would be a welcome addition, at least as a means to view existing lists, as it lends itself perfectly to a device that you carry with you at all times. Activity tracking Apple is likely to bring a swathe of new functionalities for fitness and activity tracking, including adding new sports such as skiing and snowboarding to the Activities app. Health will also be a priority; particularly following recent sightings of Tim Cook sporting a prototype Apple Watch with a blood sugar tracker, and similar reports suggesting the company was looking to sell a glucose sensor to help those with diabetes. Users will also be hoping for improvements to tracking statistics, making it easier to share a wider set of stats among friends and on social media. Some quality of life changes to fix buggy app syncing wouldn't go a miss either. Sleep tracking Native sleep tracking software has so far been missing on the Apple Watch range, despite its popularity among rival devices. Reports have claimed that Apple is working on its own sleep tracking software suite, which seems to be corroborated by its recent acquisition of sleep tracking firm Beddit in May. The main issues is that in order to track sleep the watch would need to have enough charge to last the night, which is normally when users plug it in to recharge. New watch faces and always-on displays The new software could bring some new, more elaborate watch faces, as well as the ability to set the watch face to always display the time. These have been highly requested features for a while, but limitations with battery life have likely meant these fancier functions have been pushed back. The new Apple Watch 3, likely to appear later this year, may be able to bring enough hardware improvements to afford an always-on display.

The singer’s fan base took to Twitter Friday to destroy Eddy Cue, the senior vice president of Internet Software and Services at Apple, after he reportedly told her to “sit down” at Game 1 of the NBA Finals in Oakland, California, on Thursday as the Golden Gate Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in a 113-91 victory. “@cue don't you ever fix your nonexistent lips to disrespect Rihanna ever again in your life,” netizen @clapbackanna wrote. @cue don't you ever fix your non existent lips to disrespect Rihanna ever again in your life. pic.twitter.com/jLCnYjXaMy — karlie jenner.

I want a public apology not just for Rihanna but for my children as well @cue,” the internet user said. Shara Tibken, a senior reporter for CNET and CBSI who covers Apple and Samsung, said Apple denied Cue told Rihanna to sit down. “.@Apple says @Cue was talking to someone he knew between him and @rihanna. He wasn't telling her to sit down,” she tweeted Friday. You're OVER. @cue pic.twitter.com/ptOaiyKIEt — Chantell (@ChantellHayden) June 2, 2017 The controversy around Cue broke out after Tibken identified “this man” as Cue to the internet. “LOL.

Even though her team lost, Rihanna still supported King James and Cavs after the game. When naysayers heckled her about James, she said, “It doesn't matter b----, the King was still the King.” Being told to “sit down” wasn’t the only time Rihanna was criticized. She was accused of putting on weight after blogger Chris “Spags” Spagnuolo wrote a Wednesday article for the website Barstool Sports titled, “Is Rihanna Going to Make Being Fat the Hot New Trend?” In the story, he talked about her “high key thickness.” Ok, @cue telling @rihanna to sit down after she bows to @KingJames is the best! pic.twitter.com/9JQz48kLSh — Konrad Siemek (@ksiemek) June 2, 2017 The story was deleted, with the website’s founder Dave Portnoy issuing a semi-apology. “We have an extremely minor controversy going on with this fat shaming blog that Spags wrote. Lots of feminists not happy about it,” he said. “I don’t think the blog was as bad as many are making it out to be, but I’ll tell you this. It wasn’t that funny either and I could have told you with absolute certainty that feminists would hate it and use it as an example of ‘there goes Barstool being Barstool again.’” Rihanna's navy of fans defended her after Apple executive Eddy Cue reportedly told her to "sit down" at Game 1 of the 2017 NBA Finals.

The images come from Chinese site iPhoneros and are the clearest look yet at a design that has seemingly been at least prototyped by Apple… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover One iPhone 8 aspect that continues to lack consensus is where Apple will place the Touch ID sensor. Some reports have claimed that Touch ID will be located beneath the iPhone 8’s display, while others have said it will be placed on the back due to manufacturing difficulties. Today’s images show the Touch ID sensor placed on the back of the device, directly below the Apple logo. The placement matches earlier leaked CAD drawings, showing the vertical camera design, camera flash placement, and more. Some have claimed in the past that such a design on the back could actually be for wireless charging connections, though these images seem to make it pretty clear that it is indeed for Touch ID. Building on the images shared by iPhoneros, Twitter leaker Benjamin Geskin has shared a separate image showing the front of the device, including a nearly bezel-less design. While some concepts and leaks have depicted the screen wrapping around the speaker and front camera, this leak shows there still being a small top bezel housing those cutouts. As for the legitimacy of these leaks, iPhoneros claims that the pictures come from a Chinese source that has provided correct images in the past and “never sent us false information.” Meanwhile, Geskin casts doubt as to the legitimacy of the leak. Either way, it seems likely that this is at least one design Apple has tested, though it’s unclear if it’s the design that will ship to the public later this fall. iPhone 8 leaks have been coming rapidly recently, with the main discrepancy between each one being the placement of Touch ID. In a poll we ran last month, readers were split between whether or not they would buy the iPhone 8 if it didn’t feature in-display Touch ID. 44% said they will buy the device either way, while 43% said they would wait for a later model.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | June 2, 2017 -- 16:00 GMT (09:00 PDT) | Topic: Apple (Image: CNET/CBS Interactive) All eyes will be on Apple as the week-long WWDC 2017 kicks off with the keynote speech. And while Apple fans will be salivating over iOS and macOS updates, along with whatever shiny new hardware is unveiled, it's Siri that will make or break the event. See also : Surface Pro (2017) vs. Surface Pro 4: Tech specs and key differences This year's WWDC will be an interesting time for Apple. For well over a decade the keynote has been a time when Apple could boast to the world -- and more importantly, other tech companies -- about how far ahead of the game it was, and how they had little hope of catching up. But this time is different. Apple is under pressure from multiple fronts. iPhone sales are teetering on the brink of a downturn, while iPad sales have crashed through the floor. And the company is lagging behind Microsoft when it comes to notebook innovation, trailing behind Amazon when it comes to getting hardware into the living room, and dawdling far behind Google and Facebook when it comes to AR and AI. iPhone 8: Everything we think we know SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 16 NEXT PREV No matter what sort of face Tim Cook and the gang put on when they're on-stage Monday, Apple is on the back foot, and it knows it. But there's one Apple product that could change all that -- Siri. It's easy to look at Apple and think of it as a hardware company. After all, when most people think "Apple," they think about the iPhone, Macs, iPads, and such. But the hardware is only part of the equation. In fact, building hardware isn't hard -- just look at how crowded the Android market is with devices ranging from treasures to total trash. Anyone with money can go to an ODM -- Original Design Manufacturer -- and get something drawn up and made. What really sets Apple hardware apart is the massive software ecosystem at the back end. Everything from iCloud to the App Store and the wider ecosystem, it's all about the software. And part of that software ecosystem is Siri. More apple iPhone 8 may not have the killer feature we've been hoping for Here's why you must back up your iPhone and iPad before upgrading to iOS 10.3 Apple to iPhone owners: We're working fast to block CIA's iOS hacks Is Apple's 'next big thing' the iPhone Pro? 10 things Steve Jobs would hate about Apple today Apple's been playing it slow and carefully with Siri. Apple acquired the technology back in April 2010 and baked it into iOS 5 in 2011, and since then the technology has spread across Apple's platforms to include macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. But with Amazon and Google carrying out a full-on assault on the living room with speakers and smart devices, it's time for Apple to push back. Because if it doesn't, these players will slowly start to chip away at and erode Apple's currently dominant ecosystem. After all, not only is someone who's purchased a smart device from Google or Amazon less likely to buy a similar Apple device, but they're also going to be looking at what else Google and Amazon have to offer, further weakening the ecosystem. Now some might say that Apple already owns the living room, kitchen, and bedroom, because it owns the smartphone, tablet, and smartwatch market, and people take these devices with them as they move about the house. But this is a weak argument. With the exception of Apple TV, Apple's hardware is aimed at a single user, and that makes it unsuited to home use. If your home automation setup is based around Apple, then you better make sure that everyone has iPhones and iPads, because it's not like you can pick up someone else's device to start controlling things. And this is where devices such as the Amazon Echo or Google Home really come into play. They're devices that are aimed at the family, not the individual, and that means they're far more convenient to use in a communal setting. I've noticed it myself. While I used to have to turn to my iPhone to control the lights or some other bit of IoT kit, it's far quicker and easier to bark a command at a nearby Echo or Dot than it is to whip out my iPhone and activate Siri. And remember to factor in how cheap Echo Dots are compared to Apple products. At $49 they're less than the price of two 2-meter Lightning cables from Apple. But Siri is the tool that will let Apple keep up with Google and Amazon, because it allows the company to create an interface-free device that people can interact with semi-naturally (I say semi-naturally because none of the voice assistants are currently up to the task of dealing with natural language, and some form of linguistic gymnastics are always required, despite what you might see in the on-stage demos). So, with all that said, here are my WWDC 2017 Siri-related predictions: A much-needed boost to Siri's AI (essentially new sets of questions and commands it can respond to) Siri will be able to recognize users based on their voice (this would be a killer feature for a communal device) A new Siri-powered device, likely a speaker, think Apple TV, but for music (given Apple's association with music, and the fact that it owns Beats) Text-based chatbot-style Siri (think along the lines of a smart search box) Make Siri able to work across devices (so, for example, Siri on the iPhone would be able to understand a command such as "open Numbers on my MacBook.")

This year the event runs from June 5-9 and is expected to serve as the launching point for major updates to iOS and macOS, as well as some new hardware. This will be the first time in roughly 15 years that Apple will not be hosting the event at the Moscone West Convention Center in San Francisco. Instead, the the event will take place at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. We'll be on the ground at the conference, so be sure to check back for our coverage beginning Monday morning. There's plenty to be excited about this year, so let's dive right in. A new iPad Pro Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz WWDC is typically centered around software like iOS and macOS, but this year we're expecting some hardware too. The extremely credible KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says there's a good chance Apple will announce a new iPad Pro at this year's conference. Advertisement The new iPad Pro is rumored to have a 10.5-inch screen that will fit comfortably between the existing 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models. It will also reportedly feature a new design with slimmer bezels. There's no indication of exactly how much the new device will cost-but there's a very good chance it will be priced similarly to existing models (starting at about $600). Siri speaker Image: Apple The new iPad Pro isn't the only piece of hardware expected to debut at the conference. Kuo also predicts that Apple is planning to launch a smart speaker to compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home. In a research note viewed by MacRumors , Kuo reportedly said there is "over [a] 50 percent chance" that Apple will announce its new smart home speaker and begin selling them later in the year. Kuo said the speaker will likely produce excellent sound quality and will positioned for a higher end market (i.e. it will be more expensive) than the Amazon Echo. Sponsored Adding to swirling rumors, the extremely credible Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman reported this week that Apple "started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker." Gurman reports that the speaker will differ from the Amazon Echo and Google home by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration into Apple products. The speaker will essentially serve as a hub to automate smart home devices through Apple's ( currently underdeveloped ) HomeKit platform. It will also help lock customers into Apple's walled garden as people begin to add more automation to their homes and subscribe to services like Apple Music. Gurman also reports that the speaker will have advanced acoustics that give it an edge over competing products like the Echo and Google Home and that Apple considered adding virtual surround sound technology similar to Sonos Trueplay. Advertisement It will also have comparable hardware to the Sonos Play:5 according to Kuo's research note, which says the speaker will have one subwoofer, seven tweeters, and computing power similar to the iPhone 6/6S. By comparison, as Mac Observer points out , the Echo only has one woofer and one tweeter. The Sonos Play:5 only has three woofers and three tweeters. In short, the soon-to-be-announced Siri speaker sounds much more powerful than Google Home or Amazon Echo. New MacBook and MacBook Pros Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz It looks all-but-certain that we'll be getting a new MacBook lineup at the conference. French website Consomac is reporting that it founds a Russian-language regulatory filing in the Eurasian Economic Commission database that points to at least five new models running macOS Sierra launching soon. Advertisement In addition to the filing, Bloomberg reports Apple will be releasing a new MacBook lineup to stave off competition from Microsoft's striking new Surface Laptop . The new MacBook Pro will get a bump to the latest seventh-generation Intel Core processors, giving it a significant hardware boost. One of the more remarkable rumors is that Apple could revive the 12-inch and 13-inch MacBook Airs by giving them a nice hardware bump, according to Bloomberg . Analysts aren't expecting any major design changes to either the MacBook or MacBook Pro, but say the new MacBook Air could have a new look. Advertisement John Gruber reported in April that Apple is working hard on a " completely rethought " Mac Pro with a modular design. The new design is supposed to accommodate high-end CPUs and GPUs and make it easier for people to update the computer with new components on a regular basis. The company is also working on pro displays to ship with the new desktops. Unfortunately, Gruber reports that the next-gen Mac Pros "will not ship this year" meaning they likely will not make an appearance at WWDC. A first look at iOS 11 Image: Gizmodo Don't get your hopes up for new iPhone models. They probably aren't coming until later this year. What you can expect at WWDC, though, is a big focus on Apple's new mobile operating system, iOS 11. We don't know much about the OS ahead of the show, but we're expecting a bunch of updates that focus on artificial intelligence. A sketchy rumor from Israeli publication the Verifier suggests that Siri will add contextual learning and better integration into Apple services like iMessage and iCloud. Advertisement Other updates to the operating system, according to 9to5Mac , could include features like group FaceTime, meaning that you'll be able to video conference multiple people from your phone. There's also a rumor that iMessage will add multi-person calls, making it easier to have up to five people join a single call. The most dramatic changes will be specifically tailored to the iPad. 9to5Mac reports that things like multi-user login to be added to the operating system while other blogs like MacRumors suggest Apple is working on expanded Apple Pencil support for the iPad Pro. Updates to macOS, WatchOS, and tvOS Last year, Apple decided to drop the "X" from its desktop operating system's name, instead calling it simply macOS. As part of the update, Apple started integrating even more iOS features into the desktop with things like Siri for Mac and Apple Pay for the web. Advertisement Advertisement This year, we're expecting to see the second iteration of macOS (10.13), but there aren't any hard details about what exactly. We should also see updates to other operating systems including WatchOS for the Apple Watch and tvOS for the Apple TV, according to the Telegraph . This essentially means that every operating system in the Apple ecosystem will receive a significant update, and that seems like a reasonable expectation considering the event is specifically tailored to get developers excited about building apps for Apple products. As always, we'll be covering the conference as news breaks, so be sure to check back here June 5-9 for more info about the latest updates, and we'll keep updating this story as more information becomes available.

The App Store, home to the most innovative apps in the world, has seen downloads grow over 70% in the past 12 months alone. From breakout hits like Pokémon GO and Super Mario Run to other standout launches such as CancerAid, SPACE by THIX, Zones for Training with Exercise Intensity, Vanido, Ace Tennis and Havenly, customers discover and experience new apps and games every day on the App Store. “People everywhere love apps and our customers are downloading them in record numbers,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “Seventy billion dollars earned by developers is simply mind-blowing. We are amazed at all of the great new apps our developers create and can’t wait to see them again next week at our Worldwide Developers Conference.” With the recently introduced iOS 10, app users are able to connect and collaborate in exciting new ways, such as on a fashion sketch with Prêt à Template. Since the release of iOS 10 last fall, iPhone and iPad users have also experienced new engaging and creative ways to connect, such as giving a friend a Starbucks gift card using Apple Pay, collaborating on a fashion design sketch using Prêt à Template or making someone smile with an endless assortment of stickers. The subscription business model is now available across every app category — Tastemade is a mobile-first cooking network that has its own app. With the subscription business model now available to developers across all 25 app categories, the App Store’s active paid subscriptions are up 58% year over year. Customers are enjoying subscriptions across a wide variety of services including longtime favorites such as Netflix and Hulu as well as newcomers like Tastemade, the modern, mobile-first cooking network, and photo editing apps like Over and Enlight. App Store developers from around the world create apps for customers in 155 countries that improve lives, rethink industries and shape culture. Gaming and Entertainment are top-grossing categories, and Lifestyle apps as well as Health and Fitness have experienced over 70% growth in the past year. The Photo and Video category is also among the fastest-growing at nearly 90% growth.

By 2009, 40 percent of the company’s 386,000 employees no longer needed to turn up to an office each day. Forward to 2017, and IBM is traveling back in time. Thousands of employees are being told they have to start working from set locations, or wave goodbye to their jobs. The irony is hard to ignore. Just this year, an IBM panel discussion mirrored the findings of a 2014 whitepaper from IBM’s own Smarter Workplace Institute: “The remote workers in this research were highly engaged, more likely to consider their workplaces as innovative, happier about their job prospects and less stressed than their more traditional, office-bound colleagues.” Other research agrees, showing remote workers to log more hours and do better work. Image Credit: Steven Zwerink via Flickr Some say that 19 consecutive quarters of falling sales have left IMB looking to trim the workforce without resorting to layoffs. Whatever the reason, in cases like these, the best talent will find other jobs — jobs that take employees’ work-life balance seriously. Just look at how a similar move by Yahoo  in 2013 ended with the company selling to Verizon for less than 5 percent of its peak price. Remote Work Is the Future According to recent findings by Gallup, 43 percent of the American workforce already spends some of its time working remotely. The report states, “Flexible scheduling and work-from-home opportunities play a major role in an employee’s decision to take or leave a job.” With that in mind, many of IMB’s employees are looking for other opportunities. And so are employees of other companies who are being forced fo endure outdated ways of working. Cubicles suck, after all. Thankfully, there’s a huge (and growing) number of respectable employers happy to take on remote workers Working Remotely Is The Future!

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Electrical fire leads to discovery of large indoor marijuana grow in Apple Valley Friday Jun 2, 2017 at 9:06 AM Jun 2, 2017 at 9:21 AM Staff Reports APPLE VALLEY — A small fire behind a residence believed to have been caused by a power line malfunctioning led authorities to uncover a large marijuana grow inside a home Thursday. San Bernardino County Sheriff's Apple Valley Station deputies responded to a home in the 11000 block of Saratoga Road at 9:20 a.m. to assist firefighters who had received reports of a fire at the residence, authorities said. The firefighters discovered the fire was likely caused by a main power line malfunctioning and melting, eventually falling into some shrubbery in the backyard and sparking a fire. Due to the circumstances, fire officials determined there was a significant concern that the remaining electrical lines inside the home may also fail and ignite a blaze in the home. According to authorities, upon entering the home to ensure no one was inside and that there was no damage to any property, the firefighters discovered an indoor marijuana grow with several hundred plants. Sheriff's Marijuana Enforcement Team personnel served a search warrant at the home and found a large-scale grow inside the house — with more than 750 plants in various growth stages — and the use of advanced lighting, fans, exhaust blowers and an air-filtering system to control both the climate and the odor, authorities said. Further investigation found the suspects responsible for the marijuana grow were stealing electricity to facilitate the operation by bypassing the electrical meter. Loss Prevention investigators with Southern California Edison responded to assist in the electrical theft investigation. The fire is believed to have been caused by the overload of electricity passing through the power lines, according to authorities. Investigators are in the process of identifying the suspects involved and once identified, the investigation will be completed and sent to the San Bernardino County District Attorney's Officer for a criminal complaint against them. Anyone with information regarding this investigation is urged to contact the Sheriff's Gangs/Narcotics Division at 909-387-8400.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The Tech World will be glued to Apple's WWDC Keynote looking for their Response to the Smart Home Speaker Device Craze | Main | AI-Industry Insiders: Apple's new Siri Device will take a Different Path to Market than Amazon's Alexa » June 02, 2017 In an Effort to hurt iPhone 8 Sales in Korea, Samsung Plans to Flood the Local market with Refurbished Note 7s   In February Patently Apple posted a report titled "Samsung Backtracks and is Reportedly Planning to Sell Refurbished Note 7 Smartphones in Q3." Samsung's President of Mobile Communications, D.J. Koh, announced during a special presentation surrounding the findings of the Note 7 fires by independent sources, that 4.7 million Note 7 smartphones were produced and that 96% of them had been returned to them. Samsung further noted that they would sell refurbished Note 7s at a later date.   At the time the rumors were that Samsung would use the refurbished Note 7's to excite sales in emerging markets with cheap Note 7s. But Samsung really had a much more detailed plan than that.   With the iPhone 8 capturing the imagination of global consumers as they delay the purchase of a smartphone this year until they see what innovation Apple could be bringing to market, Samsung has decided that they would sell the refurbished Note 7's just prior to the release of the iPhone 8 in order to hurt sales of the iPhone 8.   It's a strategy designed to say that the Korean market didn't think much of the iPhone 8. It's devious considering the volume of business Apple throws their way and are seeking to win Apple back for their processor business. But they can't help themselves. Their hatred for Apple runs so deep as Apple fans know. Samsung continues to this day to fight Apple's patent infringement victory going back to 2012.   Today a Korea Herald report confirms that "Samsung is gearing up for the upcoming launch of Apple's new iPhone, tentatively called iPhone 8, in September." Samsung will launch a refurbished version of the Note 7, dubbed Galaxy Note FE, or Fandom Edition, at about US$625.30 in South Korea. They already have 15,000 preorders for the devices.   The report further noted that Samsung would add color options of gold and rose for the Galaxy S8 line-up in August and believe that this move could also sway more consumers their way instead of the iPhone 8. This is kindergarten thinking that this would have any effect over the advanced iPhone 8. But their grasping at straws at this point.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Events WWDC 2017: Everything Apple is expected to announce on Monday Chris Mills @chrisfmills June 2nd, 2017 at 11:38 AM Share Tweet Andy Williams actually got it wrong. The most wonderful time of the year isn’t Christmas; it’s the two weeks around the end of May when Apple holds its annual developer conference. In one speech, we normally get a mix of new hardware and software updates, and Apple lays out the direction it’s going to take for the next 12 months. This year, we’re expecting a big one when WWDC 2017 starts on Monday at 1:00PM Eastern. In this post, we’ll roundup all of the most notable WWDC 2017 rumors so you know what to expect during Apple’s big WWDC keynote next week. Don't Miss: It’ll be a long time until the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot are priced this low again New MacBooks Right now, the safest best for new hardware at WWDC 2017 is an update to the MacBook lineup. It might be a little odd, considering Apple just launched an all-new MacBook Pro back in November, but all the leaks, rumors and retail supply chain leaks have pointed towards some kind of new model. That’s the good news. The bad news is that we’re probably not going to see a new MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro with a few more ports. Instead, the smart money is on the current MacBook range getting a spec bump on the inside, most likely with Intel’s new Kaby Lake processor. Improvements have also been made to the graphics cards for portable machines, so you could also expect the MacBook Pro to get a graphics bump. Siri Speaker We’re also expecting to see a new Siri-powered home speaker to pop up looking a lot like the Amazon Echo. Smart speakers have emerged as the obvious portal for controlling the smart home, so Apple can’t let Amazon and Google run away with the prize. It’s challenging to innovate on the concept of “kitchen speaker with an AI and a microphone built in,” so Apple has two options here: launch a keep-up-with-the-Joneses product that demonstrates its commitment to the product and lays the groundwork for something revolutionary to come; or try the classic Apple move, and make a much more expensive version to capture the high end of the market. It’s unclear what a “high-end” home speaker would look like, but a focus on audio quality using Beats branding isn’t out of the question. New iMacs Just like the new MacBooks, it’s possible that we’ll see a spec bump for the iMac. Intel’s new processors sure would look good inside, and it would lessen some of the cries we’ve been hearing that Apple doesn’t produce ‘“pro” computers any more. New iPads Finally, there’s rumors going around that we’ll see a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro at WWDC. It likely won’t be a “new” form-factor, as there’s already a 9.7-inch iPad Pro on the market (and it recently went on sale!) Instead, look for much thinner bezels enabling a bigger screen in the existing body. Software iOS 11 Apple uses WWDC to show off the newest version of iOS every year like clockwork, and there’s zero reason to imagine that this year will be different. Bloomberg rumors suggest that iOS 11 will see a design overhaul, not as severe as the iOS 7 update that scrapped skeuomorphic design, but still significant. One of the biggest new features could be the introduction of a “dark” mode across the entire OS, something that jailbreakers have been doing for years. It’s a quick and easy way to save a little battery life and appease some of the more hardcore fans. We’re also expecting updates to apps, including a possible peer-to-peer payment function in Apple Pay, and more videos in Apple Music to tie in with Apple’s first original series launching soon. One thing we haven’t heard much about are updates to Siri. Google’s recent developer conference focused heavily on the Google Assistant, and how it’s finding its way across the entire platform. If Apple is expecting the Siri Speaker to do anything well, Siri’s going to need some major updates, and fast. One of the big interface differences between the Assistant and Siri is the ability to have written conversations and type queries; it’s quite possible that Apple builds that functionality right into iOS 11. macOS Of course, we’re expecting to see a new version of macOS, but it’s unlikely to be anything big. We said above that Siri needs to be a focus of WWDC overall this year, so that’s one obvious thing for Apple to focus on for the Macs. Siri found its way to the desktop at WWDC last year, so some new features could be in order. “Hey Siri” functionality could be expanded, and third-party features don’t currently work for Siri on MacOS. What we won’t see Some bad news: we almost definitely won’t see a new iPhone. Although the iPhone SE is technically due an update, the timing would be terrible. Apple is expected to announce three new phones of some kind this fall; the last thing it needs is a new cheap iPhone undercutting the “super-cycle” of people upgrading to the iPhone 8. A new Mac Pro is also probably off the table. Although the timing for a preview announcement makes sense, Apple execs previously hinted that a new Mac Pro would come by the end of the year. That also gives Apple time to integrate Intel’s newly-announced Core i9 chips, which are an obvious thing for Apple to stick inside its premiere video-editing machine.

While both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have a history of revising their flagship smartphone series, that practice is likely directly connected to Apple’s mobile release schedule, with the Cupertino, California-based tech giant traditionally launching new iPhone models in September. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone and Apple is reportedly looking to go all out with its latest iOS flagship, which is what reportedly prompted both Samsung and LG to refresh their latest product lineups in an effort to not lose customers to the most profitable handset manufacturer on the planet. Samsung is said to be adding at least one new color variant of the Galaxy S8 that’s called Rose Gold, sources with knowledge of the matter said today. While the same model was already leaked yesterday, the latest report indicates that the Seoul-based consumer electronics manufacturer will be retailing Rose Gold variations of both the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus, with previous leaks hinting that only the latter will be available in a new color. Apart from a new variant of its latest flagship, Samsung may also try to slow down the sales of the iPhone 8 by releasing a refurbished version of the Galaxy Note 7 that will ship with a smaller, 3,200mAh battery and otherwise be identical to the discontinued flagship. While the Galaxy Note FE (Fandom Edition) — that’s expected to be marketed as the Galaxy Note 7R in China — will only be available in limited quantities in select Asian countries, Samsung may be hoping that the device will still be able to affect the sales of Apple’s upcoming handset. According to recent reports, LG is preparing to launch two new models of the G6 – the G6 Plus and G6 Pro. The former is expected to be a somewhat more premium variant of the original device while the later should be a slightly downgraded version, though both will primarily differ in terms of internal flash memory and wireless charging support, industry insiders previously said. Later this year, Samsung and LG are expected to take on Apple more directly by releasing the Galaxy Note 8 and LG V30, with both devices being predicted to hit the market around September.

The iOS 10.3.3 update is currently in beta and it looks like it will be another small release aimed at fixing bugs and improving security on the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. It should also bring some new wallpapers to the iPad. Apple hasn’t confirmed an iOS 10.3.3 release date but the company recently released a new beta update, a sign that it’s making progress behind the scenes. With the iOS 10.3.3 release date possibly on the way in June, we want to help make your transition from iOS 10.3.2 to iOS 10.3.3 as smooth as possible. When to Check for the iOS 10.3.3 Release The iOS 10.3.3 update is shaping up to be a small release with under-the-hood improvements and security patches. It’s not as exciting as iOS 10.3 but iOS 10.3.3 could be an important update for your device, particularly if you’re struggling with iOS 10 problems. While you might be tempted to check your phone every 15 minutes for the iOS 10.3.3 update, that’s not how Apple iOS releases work. It’s difficult to predict the exact iOS 10.3.3 release date (though we do expect it to arrive soon) but it’s very easy to predict the iOS 10.3.3 release time. Here are a few things to keep in mind as we close in on the iOS 10.3.3 release date. Apple never releases iOS updates on the weekend so there’s no need to check for iOS 10.3.3 on Saturday or Sunday. iOS updates almost always arrive between 9AM and 10AM Pacific. General rule of thumb is to check around 10AM Pacific. This release time applies to iOS 10.3.3 beta releases as well. Betas typically come every 1-2 weeks, usually on Monday. While some of you will want to download the iOS 10.3.3 update the second it arrives, many others will want to wait a few hours, a few days, or longer. Don’t Install the iOS 10.3.3 Beta Unless You Really Want To Given what’s on board (bugs and little else), you should only try the iOS 10.3.3 beta if you really want to help Apple squash problems, if you’re a developer, or if you really, really want to test the update’s performance on your device ahead of the official release. Furthermore, you can download the iOS 10.3.3 update’s iPad Pro wallpapers right now if you want. You don’t need to be on the beta to get access to them. Most of you should avoid the early version of iOS 10.3.3, especially if you’re having an outstanding experience on your version of iOS. Apple could add some more meat to the iOS 10.3.3 update in the future but that would be surprising. For more on the merits of the iOS 10.3.3 beta, take a look at our guide. Start Prepping Your iPhone, iPad or iPod Now It’s never too early to start preparing for an iOS update’s release. Here are a few pre-installation tips to keep in your back pocket as we approach the iOS 10.3.3 release date: Use this time to cleanup your device. Get rid of files (apps, music, etc), anything you no longer use. Cleaning up your device could improve your device’s performance. Start backing up your data. If you don’t know where to start, you’ll want to research iCloud backups, iTunes backups, and the differences between the two. If you want to download iOS 10.3.3 right when it comes out, make sure your device has at least a 50% charge (or you’re near a charger) around 10AM Pacific. Get your login information handy. Make sure you have the device’s passcode, Apple ID, and your important logins ready on release day. The update might log you out of various apps and services. Dig into feedback from iOS 10.3.3 beta testers. You might learn about a potential problem or benefit coming with your version of iOS 10.3.3. A little prep work will help you avoid major problems during the iOS 10.3.3 installation process. It’ll also help you avoid headaches once you get the new update on board your phone or tablet. Dig Into Older Updates If You Need To If you failed to download iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.3.1 and you plan to skip Apple’s iOS 10.3.2 update, make sure you know what you’re getting into before you download the iOS 10.3.3 update on your phone. If you skipped iOS 10.3/iOS 10.3.1 and don’t have plans to download iOS 10.3.2, you’ll get the changes from those updates baked into your iOS 10.3.3 update. (Note: You’ll also get the features and fixes from any other iOS updates you missed.) If you plan on downloading iOS 10.3.3, you’ll want to get familiar with their changes ahead of the update’s release. Prepare For & Report iOS 10.3.3 Problems If you choose to install iOS 10.3.3 on release day there’s a chance you’ll run into an issue during or after the installation process finishes up. Sometimes it can take a couple of days for an update to settle in. If you notice weird battery life on release day, give it a day or two to even out. If problems persist after two days with iOS 10.3.3, or if the issues are serious, you’ll want to take action. There are tons of resources out there but our list of fixes for common iOS 10 problems is a great place to start. If you don’t consider yourself an expert, you’ll want to bookmark those fixes so you’re ready to tackle problems as soon as they popup. If you can’t fix your problem and/or you want to help the community, you’ll want to report iOS 10.3.3 problems as you see them. There are a few places to do that. You can relay your problem to Apple Support on Twitter and/or get in contact with Apple Support via the company’s website. We also recommend reporting your problem on Apple’s Discussion forums to alert Apple and other users to your issue. You Can “Test” iOS 10.3.3 Remember, if you don’t want to deal with the iOS 10.3.3 beta, you can take the official version of iOS 10.3.3 for a test drive, provided you’re already on iOS 10.3.2 when it arrives. For a short time, Apple will allow you to downgrade from iOS 10.3.3 to iOS 10.3.2. Apple is no longer signing off on iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 so you won’t be able to drop back to either of those. Most of you will probably choose to remain on iOS 10.3.3 but others might benefit from dropping down to the older version of iOS 10. It could help improve your device’s performance in key areas like battery life, connectivity, and speed. If you aren’t familiar with the iOS downgrade process, now is the time to get familiar with it. How to Get Off iOS 10.3.3 Beta If you chose to try the iOS 10.3.3 beta and you don’t want to get thrown onto the next iOS 10 beta, you’ll want to unenroll from the iOS 10.3.3 beta once the final version is released. Here’s how you’ll do that: Go to Settings > General > Profiles and then tap the iOS Beta Software Profile that appears on your device. Enter your passcode, if there is on associated with the device, and tap Delete Profile. You will no longer receive beta software. Go into your Settings or iTunes and download iOS 10.3.3. If you’ve been running an iOS 10.3.3 beta and the new watchOS beta on your Apple Watch, you’ll need to take a few more steps before, on, or after the iOS 10.3.3 release date. Here’s how to get the watchOS beta off your device, Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone. Tap the My Watch tab. Go to General > Profiles. Tap the beta profile you want to remove. Enter a passcode if needed and then tap Delete Profile. If you want to use iOS beta software again you’ll need to install the correct beta profile. Avoid iOS 10.3.3 If You’re Jailbroken Do not, we repeat, do not upgrade to the iOS 10.3.3 update on release day if you’re jailbroken. Jailbreak developers have reportedly cracked the iOS 10.3.1 update. A proof of concept video has surfaced and we could see an iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak released to the public in the near future. Unfortunately, we haven’t seen a proof of concept for iOS 10.3.2 or iOS 10.3.3. Developers could certainly surprise us with an iOS 10.3.3 jailbreak release on release day but you’ll want to avoid iOS 10.3.3 when it arrives just to be safe. If you do happen to download iOS 10.3.3 on your device and developers do release a working iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak, you should be able to downgrade in order to take advantage of the tool. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.2 & 10 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.2 If You Want Better Security   1 / 14 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.2 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.2 brings (by our count) 23 security patches for a potential exploits. That's a ton for a small maintenance update and a great reason to install iOS 10.3.2 in the near future. Your iOS 10.3.2 update will bring even more security features if you failed to download previous versions of iOS. If you skipped iOS 10.3.1, your iOS 10.3.2 update will bring its security patch. If you skipped iOS 10.3, iOS 10.3.2 will also bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.2 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.2 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device.    1 / 14 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Linkedin More In Apple 7 Things to Know About the iPhone 5s iOS 10.3.2 Update We’ve been taking a close look at Apple’s iOS 10.3.2 update and today we want … 06/02/2017 6 min read 9 Things to Know About the iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.2 Update The iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.2 update is a small but important release for the former flagship. … 06/02/2017 6 min read 9 Things to Know About the iPad iOS 10.3.2 Update Its been a little over two weeks since the iOS 10.3.2 update release for the iPad, iPad Ai… 06/02/2017 6 min read Load More In Apple 2 Comments 2 Comments James Burton 03/25/2017 at 10:36 pm Hi I’m impressed with the amber alert system in the future is there going to be FBI warrants support Reply Chile 04/18/2017 at 9:51 am DellLundg Slovakien NicholRan SherrillH Elfenbenskusten CaroleSch JacquieDe Schweiz ValorieHi BonnyMgrx Osterrike WindyChid OrvalGoul Nederlanderna MarthaSpa GabrieleC Everton SKKRalfgc GlendaXvr Spanien DakotaCam BrainBole Rumanien GeorginaE NoellaEll Valencia EstelleNe TerranceR Wales StaceyThe Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Courtesy photo Brenda Tullis Special to Valley News Students and teachers gathered at a local church Sunday, May 7, at an event directed by students to recognize and show appreciation for local teachers and to gift a sole teacher from each Temecula high school a student-honored teacher’s award. English teacher Gayle Trout of Chaparral High School, math teacher Steve Maxey of Great Oak High School and biology teacher Toby Brannon of Temecula Valley High School were awarded the Crystal Apple in appreciation for their work and influence in their students’ lives. The 13th annual Crystal Apple Awards ceremony was led by students from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from Temecula Valley, Chaparral and Great Oak high schools and honored more than 130 exemplary teachers. Over 200 students individually nominated a teacher to receive a Crystal Apple award, and ultimately one teacher from each high school was awarded with the esteemed Crystal Apple. City and school officials attending included Temecula City Council member James Stewart, Temecula Valley Unified School District Superintendent Tim Ritter, TVUSD school board President Sandy Hinkson, school board member Julie Farnbach, Temecula Valley Educators Association President Jeff Kingsberg, CHS Principal Nicole Dayus, GOHS Principal Aimee Ricken and TVHS Principal Allen Williams. Explaining why the Crystal Apple nomination process of awarding recipients was important, Master of Ceremony and Public Affairs director for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Suzette Jacobsen quoted Carnegie Mellon University Professor Randy Pausch in her opening remarks. “Showing gratitude is one of the simplest yet most powerful things humans can do for each other,” she said. The other finalists for the Crystal Apple awards included CHS swim coach and history teacher Craig Winger and English teacher Barbara Mueller, GOHS economics teacher and football coach, Herschel Ramirez and Spanish teacher Crystal Parry as well as TVHS orchestra teacher Leanne Lugo and retiring ROTC leader, Lt. Col. Phil Byrd. Trout received her undergraduate at St. Cloud State University in St. Cloud, Minnesota, in 1991 and later graduated from University of California Riverside. She has taught school for 25 years. Trout is teaches English to seniors at Chaparral in the Chaparral Senior Expository Reading and Writing course and Mt. San Jacinto College dual enrollment English 101 and 103 courses. “Mrs. Trout is one of the most caring people I know,” CHS senior Lauren Paulson, who nominated Trout for the award, said. “She truly has a special gift in connecting with each of her students.” Trout estimates that she has taught approximately 4,000 students over the past 25 years. Mother of three children, she is married to Rancho Vista High School teacher Noel Trout. “This is the best and most meaningful award I have ever received because it is student driven,” she said. “The students are the ones with whom I interact every day, and to have them say to me, `Mrs. Trout, we recognize that you care about us and our education; you’re a good role model, and we appreciate you.’ That’s gold. They are affirming that I am the kind of teacher I set out to become.” Trout said that she was born to teach. “It’s my gift, talent and passion,” she said. “When I was in ninth grade, I had an English teacher who was not only a great teacher, but he was also someone who genuinely loved teenagers. He treated them with such dignity and respect, and I wanted to be that same kind of person and teacher.” She thanked the parents at the event for raising amazing children. “They do live true to your values,” she said. “They’re kind and generous; they’re respectful and responsible; they’re trustworthy.” Trout said that she thoroughly loved to stand and teach children, speaking wisdom into their lives every single school day. “I know that the LDS community sets a high standard for themselves and their children,” she said. “Being recognized as a person of integrity and good character by a community that upholds those same characteristics means a lot to me.” Junior Alexis Arnold introduced Great Oak math teacher Steve Maxey. “Mr. Maxey has been such a great influence on me and the people around me,” she said. “He always manages to have a positive attitude. His class is one of those classes that you’re actually not looking at the clock to see when it’s going to end.” Maxey graduated from Buena Vista University in Storm Lake, Iowa, in 1999, later receiving his master’s degree at California State University San Marcos in 2012. He has been teaching for 15 years. He is married to Kelly Maxey who teaches Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math courses at Vail Ranch Middle School. He said she has been teaching 25 years to his 15 years, but that he took off five great years to raise his three children, Jack, Claire and Pete, who are now 12 years, 12 years and 10 years old, respectively. Beginning his teaching career in 1999, Maxey is in his fifth-year teaching in the Temecula Valley school district, and he estimates that he’s taught approximately 2,500 children since becoming a teacher. “I teach because I love it,” he said. “Every day I get to teach the subject I love— to children who care.” Maxey admits that he was taken aback and humbled when he learned that he would be the recipient of the Crystal Apple award. “The thing that affected me the most was that my students felt that highly of me,” he said. “They’re phenomenal students.” Later he spoke to the students directly and said, “You have made this job great.” Maxey thanked the administration at Great Oak for hiring him. “It’s so nice to belong to a school where you know the administration believes in you,” he said. “There are so many fantastic teachers at my school, and I owe so much to all of them for giving me the guidance and support to be where I am today.” Student and nominator C. Robert Graff introduced biology teacher Toby Brannon from Temecula Valley High School. “This guy knows biology,” he said. “He’s a true stallion of biology. He can run on and on about biology and go so deep that my mind would just blow up.” Graff also said that Brannon’s class is a fun class. “He’s such a funny and awesome guy,” Graff said. “He connects with students either directly or indirectly. I feel he is one of the teachers on campus that I and others can go to for sound advice and counsel.” Graduating from University of California Irvine in 1995, Brannon began teaching in 1997 and has been teaching for 20 years now. He said he would not even venture to guess how many students he’s taught over the years. He finally decided upon a rounded-up number. “A lot,” he said. At the ceremony, he said that it was a tremendous honor to be there. “We [teachers] don’t get into this gig for public applause or pats on the back but this is nice,” he said. Speaking directly to the students in the back of the auditorium, he said, “When we get the envelopes with your comments, those are the things that sustain us. We need just a little bit of fuel to get through the next year and those little tiny comments make a huge difference.” Brannon encouraged the children at the event to pursue the things that they found interesting in life, to go for it. “When you get to a point that you have to figure out what to do with it, teaching’s not a bad gig. Consider it,” he said. “You get to teach the topic you truly love and you get to make a very real impact on your community.” Temecula Valley Principal Allen Williams summed up the general feeling of thankfulness from all the teachers and administrators in the room. “We recognize our teachers at Temecula Valley High School in different ways,” TVHS principal Allen Williams said. “But it’s really nice when an outside organization looks at our school and looks at our teachers across the district and says, ‘We value you. We affirm what you’re doing. We have confidence in you.’” Williams said that he wanted to thank The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for doing exactly that for teachers in the Temecula community. “Thank you,” he said. “It’s so appreciated. It makes us feel like champions.” Share this: Tweet More Share on Tumblr Print Email Related Crystal Apple awards, Gayle Trout, Steve Maxey, teachers, Toby Brannon Crystal Apple awards bestowed on three well-deserving teachers  added by Newsroom on June 2, 2017 View all posts by Newsroom → Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

In an internal memo obtained by Buzzfeed News, Cook told employees that he “spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement. But it wasn’t enough.” Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver.— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) June 2, 2017 Following the email sent out within Apple, Cook later also publicly tweeted on the matter, stating pointedly that he considers the decision “wrong for our planet” and reiterating Apple’s unwavering commitment to fighting climate change. In the internal e-mail, Cook reassured employees that President Trump’s decision will have “no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment,” emphasizing the company’s significant efforts in powering all of its operations with renewable energy, which as Cook says is not only good for the planet, but “makes good business sense as well.” Our mission has always been to leave the world better than we found it. We will never waver, because we know that future generations depend on us. Cook also promised to keep working toward the “ambitious goals of a closed-loop supply chain,” that were outlined in the company’s Environmental Responsibility Report released last month.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide What to Expect From Apple WWDC 2017: iOS, Siri Speaker, MacBooks, and More Michael NunezFriday 11:00am Filed to: Apple WWDC WWDC 2017 MacBook MacBook Air iOS 11 macOS Siri 32 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image: Apple On Monday, Apple’s annual developer conference, WWDC, kicks off, and that means we will soon learn more about the company’s newest and most exciting products. This year, the event runs from June 5-June 9 and is expected to serve as the launching point for major updates to iOS and macOS, as well as some new hardware. This will be the first time in roughly 15 years that Apple will not be hosting the event at the Moscone West Convention Center in San Francisco. Instead, the event will take place at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. We’ll be on the ground at the conference, so be sure to check back for our coverage beginning Monday morning. There’s plenty to be excited about this year, so let’s dive right in. A new iPad Pro Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz WWDC is typically centered around software like iOS and macOS, but this year we’re expecting some hardware too. The extremely credible KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says there’s a good chance Apple will announce a new iPad Pro at this year’s conference. Advertisement The new iPad Pro is rumored to have a 10.5-inch screen that will fit comfortably between the existing 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models. It will also reportedly feature a new design with slimmer bezels. There’s no indication of exactly how much the new device will cost—but there’s a very good chance it will be priced similarly to existing models (starting at about $600). Siri speaker Image: Apple The new iPad Pro isn’t the only piece of hardware expected to debut at the conference. Kuo also predicts that Apple is planning to launch a smart speaker to compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home. In a research note viewed by MacRumors, Kuo reportedly said there is “over [a] 50 percent chance” that Apple will announce its new smart home speaker and begin selling them later in the year. Kuo said the speaker will likely produce excellent sound quality and will positioned for a higher end market (i.e. it will be more expensive) than the Amazon Echo. Adding to swirling rumors, the extremely credible Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman reported this week that Apple “started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker.” Gurman reports that the speaker will differ from the Amazon Echo and Google home by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration into Apple products. The speaker will essentially serve as a hub to automate smart home devices through Apple’s (currently underdeveloped) HomeKit platform. It will also help lock customers into Apple’s walled garden as people begin to add more automation to their homes and subscribe to services like Apple Music. Gurman also reports that the speaker will have advanced acoustics that give it an edge over competing products like the Echo and Google Home and that Apple considered adding virtual surround sound technology similar to Sonos Trueplay. It will also have comparable hardware to the Sonos Play:5 according to Kuo’s research note, which says the speaker will have one subwoofer, seven tweeters, and computing power similar to the iPhone 6/6S. By comparison, as Mac Observer points out, the Echo only has one woofer and one tweeter. The Sonos Play:5 only has three woofers and three tweeters. In short, the soon-to-be-announced Siri speaker sounds much more powerful than Google Home or Amazon Echo. New MacBook and MacBook Pros Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz It looks all-but-certain that we’ll be getting a new MacBook lineup at the conference. French website Consomac is reporting that it found a Russian-language regulatory filing in the Eurasian Economic Commission database that points to at least five new models running macOS Sierra launching soon. Advertisement Sponsored In addition to the filing, Bloomberg reports Apple will be releasing a new MacBook lineup to stave off competition from Microsoft’s striking new Surface Laptop. The new MacBook Pro will get a bump to the latest seventh-generation Intel Core processors, giving it a significant hardware boost. One of the more remarkable rumors is that Apple could revive the 12-inch and 13-inch MacBook Airs by giving them a nice hardware bump, according to Bloomberg. Analysts aren’t expecting any major design changes to either the MacBook or MacBook Pro, but say the new MacBook Air could have a new look. Advertisement John Gruber reported in April that Apple is working hard on a “completely rethought” Mac Pro with a modular design. The new design is supposed to accommodate high-end CPUs and GPUs, and make it easier for people to update the computer with new components on a regular basis. The company is also working on pro displays to ship with the new desktops. Unfortunately, Gruber reports that the next-gen Mac Pros “will not ship this year,” meaning they likely will not make an appearance at WWDC. A first look at iOS 11 Image: Gizmodo Don’t get your hopes up for new iPhone models. They probably aren’t coming until later this year. What you can expect at WWDC, though, is a big focus on Apple’s new mobile operating system, iOS 11. We don’t know much about the OS ahead of the show, but we’re expecting a bunch of updates that focus on artificial intelligence. A sketchy rumor from Israeli publication the Verifier suggests that Siri will add contextual learning and better integration into Apple services like iMessage and iCloud. Advertisement Other updates to the operating system, according to 9to5Mac, could include features like group FaceTime, meaning that you’ll be able to video conference multiple people from your phone. There’s also a rumor that iMessage will add multi-person calls, making it easier to have up to five people join a single call. The most dramatic changes will be specifically tailored to the iPad. 9to5Mac reports that things like multi-user login to be added to the operating system while other blogs like MacRumors suggest Apple is working on expanded Apple Pencil support for the iPad Pro. Updates to macOS, WatchOS, and tvOS Last year, Apple decided to drop the “X” from its desktop operating system’s name, instead calling it simply macOS. As part of the update, Apple started integrating even more iOS features into the desktop with things like Siri for Mac and Apple Pay for the web. Advertisement Advertisement This year, we’re expecting to see the second iteration of macOS (10.13), but there aren’t any hard details about what exactly. We should also see updates to other operating systems including WatchOS for the Apple Watch and tvOS for the Apple TV, according to the Telegraph. This essentially means that every operating system in the Apple ecosystem will receive a significant update, and that seems like a reasonable expectation considering the event is specifically tailored to get developers excited about building apps for Apple products. As always, we’ll be covering the conference as news breaks, so be sure to check back here June 5-June 9 for more info about the latest updates, and we’ll keep updating this story as more information becomes available.

By Daniel Walker Published in Food & Drink June 2, 2017 10:00 am The doughnut game in Dallas is undeniably strong. When last we compiled our picks for best in town, there were only a few players really pushing the proverbial envelope. But today, there are a host of exciting vendors popping up in every corner of the city. Here are 15 of the best doughnuts from the most notable shops around town. Consider this your ultimate doughnut to-do list. Glazed Donut Works Saigon Cinnamon Sugar The brains behind the sweet creations at Deep Ellum’s beloved shop never cease churning out inventive new flavors. Seasonal offerings and holiday specials are the norm here, so you’ll want to keep an eye on their various social media platforms for updates. But one flavor that’s almost always on the menu board is their sumptuous Saigon Cinnamon Sugar. It may look a bit ho-hum at first glance, but don’t be fooled by its humble appearance. There’s a subtle spice intertwined with a crunchy sweetness from granulated sugar, all coating one of the finest brioche-style yeast raised donuts in town. Top Pot Doughnuts Salted Caramel Old Fashioned Blessed was the day when the celebrated Seattle-based Top Pot decided to open its very first location outside of Washington in our very own Big D. The fried-pastry-gods truly smiled down on us that day. Now with four locations across the city, it’s fairly easy to experience Top Pot’s “hand-forged” approach for yourself. Where they excel most is undoubtedly in “old fashioned” doughnuts, of which, you’re going to want to sample the salted caramel variety. These suckers have a slightly crunchier exterior, with a soft, cake-y middle. The sweet and salty combination from the salted caramel puts this particular doughnut over the top. In the best way imaginable. Momo’s Donuts Strawberries and Cream At this Sherman bakery, owner Mo Guerrero has established a loyal following of fried-dough fanatics that are, surprisingly, also big names in the bodybuilding and Crossfit community. The virtues of “donuts and deadlifts” are something Mo proudly embraces. “Our bodybuilding and Crossfit community loves us because carbs are not only great before leg day,” he says. “But we’re a treat that competitors look for after enduring strict diets in preparation for a bodybuilding show.” Momo’s popularity even landed them a spot on Cooking Channel’s Donut Showdown. And although they’re located in about an hour-and-a-half outside of Dallas, this popular donut spot will graciously deliver to Dallas every weekend for any who preorder (just message them on Facebook or Instagram @momosdonuts). Just be sure to order the Strawberries and Cream, stuffed full of plump, glazed strawberries and fresh cream.   Jerry’s Jerry’s Donuts Apple Fritter This humble Farmer’s Branch shop remains relatively unknown to most doughnut fans outside its immediate surroundings. It’s the epitome of old-school doughnut making: no outrageous toppings, no particularly fancy ingredients. Most of its employees have been hammering out the same recipes for more than 40 years—and they’ve darn near perfected their craft. The apple fritters are some their most elusive creations. It’s difficult to time exactly when they’ll be laying out a fresh tray…and when they do, they get snatched up quickly. Instead of the typical chopped, diced, and reformed dough bits that make up the apple fritter, Jerry’s serves one that’s more akin to a turnover, with the hot apple filling folded into the center of the dough, cooking in layers throughout the dough. It’s a bit unconventional, but it’s absolutely lovely to bite into. Jarams Donuts Cream Cheese & Berries For five-and-a-half years, Jarams has been supplying North Dallas sugar junkies with a very sound reason to roll out of bed on a weekend morning. They were among the first in the city to capitalize on the “Cronut” craze sweeping the nation at that time, and quickly built a reputation for serving donut varieties that couldn’t be found anywhere else in town. But one donut still shines above the rest, though it may not necessarily be the wackiest item they offer. This one comes topped with a smooth, not-too-sweet cream cheese frosting on a soft, yeast doughnut, and is finished with a crown of fresh assorted berries and a whiff of powdered sugar. It’s still deep-fried dough, but you can almost convince yourself you’re eating a fruit salad for breakfast. Almost. Okay, not really. Mojo Donuts Cookie Butter This small shop is conveniently located a mere stone’s throw from Love Field. So if you’re about to jump on a plane and are in need of a quick breakfast, look no further than Mojo. With a healthy assortment of doughnuts both traditional and elaborate, there’s plenty to keep any pastry fan coming back on a regular basis. Just be sure to snag one of their decadent cookie butter donuts when they’re on the shelf. This soft yeast-raised treat comes dipped in creamy cookie butter frosting, sprinkled with cookie crumbles, and finished with another thick gob of cookie butter in the center. It’s rich and a little messy, but it’s wonderful. FunkyTown Donuts Key Lime Pie Forget not Fort Worth when looking for exceptional doughnuts. FunkyTown has dominated this city’s scene since opening just over a year ago. Folks go nuts for their impressive array of doughnuts, so much so that they sell out nearly every day. The Key Lime Pie variety is a must. A yeast doughnut is topped with a citrusy lime glaze and stuffed with freshly-made whipped cream and graham cracker dust. It’s a Key Lime creation so good it will mentally transport you to an exotic white-sand Florida beach on a sunny afternoon. And once there, you won’t even mind that you’re destroying your beach body. Hypnotic Donuts The Peace’statio When founder, James St. Peter, established Hypnotic in 2010, there was no one else on the donut scene putting as much thought into doughnuts as him. Hypnotic built a dedicated underground following via Facebook and Twitter, selling donuts from the back of a Ford Expedition for months until demand reached a level that forced them to move into a permanent space. Today, Hypnotic’s place among Dallas’ fried-dough-royalty remains firmly intact. They’ve pioneered the “fancy” market with a collection of intriguing options, but one that remains at the top of the crop is the Peace’statio, a lovely cake variety topped with brown butter glaze and chopped pistachios. It’s the perfect way to wash down one of their sizable chicken biscuits. Earnest Donuts Blueberry Crumble This Lewisville shop is quietly putting out some of the greatest donuts in Dallas. If you’re looking for the finest “Cronut,” Earnest is your place. But the best reason to visit the shop is for their exceptional blueberry crumble cake doughnut. It’s packed with real blueberry, within a cake doughnut that’s not the slightest bit dry. They coat the whole thing with cake crumbles for a slightly crunchy textural element that really brings the whole thing home. Well played, Earnest. Dough Boy Donuts Cinnamon Roll At this Fort Worth food truck, things operate a bit differently than your standard doughnut shop. It’s just two guys in a tiny space, one taking orders and the other continuously throwing dough into hot oil. But because of their limited space, they’re churning out sweets practically to-order, ensuring that every doughnut served is fresh from the fryer—hot, soft, and golden brown. Go with the Cinnamon Roll variety. It’s less flashy than some of their other offerings—a simple sugar glazed with streaks of cinnamon-sugar drizzle—but it’s beautiful. Hurts Hurts Donut Strawberry Jelly How much does Frisco love this small Midwest doughnut chain’s first Texas location? Just take a peek at the lines. They frequently push out the door and around the building, with customers reporting waits of up to an hour during peak business. But they’re able to crank out quality donuts fairly quickly, and do a good job keeping their massive display cases filled. Generally, their yeast-raised donuts—which are larger and plumper than you’ll generally find at your average shop—outshine the cake variety. Most of their doughnuts are big, bold, and almost cartoonish, but you’ll find that the frosted jelly-filled one is everything you need it to be without all the excess. The Donut Kitchen Italian Wedding This McKinney staple sticks solely to cake donuts. But even if you generally prefer yeast-raised doughnuts, the cake variety served up here are not to be missed. They nail it on texture—never dry, light, and slightly crumbly. Truth be told, they’re probably the best cake doughnuts in town. Grab the Italian Wedding:  rolled in sugar and topped with a swirl of cream cheese icing and pecans. Donut Box Waffle Doughnut The food world has become obsessed with novelty mash-ups, but only a select few to hit the market survive and are actually worth tracking down. The doughnut-waffle was not dreamed up here at this small Little Elm shop, but they were the first to bring the concept to town. And luckily, they’re good. Darn good. It’s got all the right textural elements of a successful waffle—crunchy exterior and soft, chewy inside—but the thin layer of glaze takes it to a new level of decadence. You can get them coated in candy if you like, but it’s really not necessary to achieve peak enjoyment. Max’s Donut Shop Glazed Allen residents have long known that the finest glazed doughnuts in town were hiding in this tiny, no-frills shop. It’s a classic joint serving a simple menu of only a few standards: plain glazed, chocolate iced, apple fritters, and cinnamon rolls. But if you’re occasionally exhausted by all the glamorized, fancy doughnuts across town, and you’re most interested in a classic glazed ring of fried dough, the best is right here at Max’s. That’s right…the best plain glazed in town. And that’s a promise you can take to the bank. Rise Biscuits & Donuts Pineapple Basil with Pistachios Here’s another small donut franchise that’s already making waves within the northern suburbs. Although they are technically a chain, these are a far cry from the likes of sub-par, chain establishments. Rise simply makes a spectacular product. They do a dangerously good creme brûlée donut with a thick, crunchy shell of torched sugar, filled with a custard that sings of real vanilla. But their most interesting, and surprisingly successful variety, is the Pineapple Basil doughnut with pistachios. Holidays Most Popular The Legend of Chris Kyle By Michael J.

You could design a better phone than Samsung, Apple, Huawei, or Sir Jony Ive himself, but if not enough people hear about it, you don't stand a snowflake in Hell's chance. This, in Total Telecom's considered opinion, is the biggest single challenge facing Android co-creator Andy Rubin and his new company Essential, which, as well as having a new smartphone to show off this week, also has a professed aversion to logos – which doesn't help much when it comes to brand awareness. Essential does have a logo… You could design a better phone than Samsung, Apple, Huawei, or Sir Jony Ive himself, but if not enough people hear about it, you don't stand a snowflake in Hell's chance. This, in Total Telecom's considered opinion, is the biggest single challenge facing Android co-creator Andy Rubin and his new company Essential, which, as well as having a new smartphone to show off this week, also has a professed aversion to logos – which doesn't help much when it comes to brand awareness. Essential does have a logo, of course, but it's not happy about it. The press kit section of the Website informs the weary journalist that "we're not big on logos at Essential, but if you need one, please use the following…" Essential says it's not about logos, it's about phones, and to be fair, Essential's new phone is a good-looking piece of kit, with a sturdy titanium body encasing an edge-to-edge 4K screen. Inside is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor; 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage; a 13 megapixel rear camera and an 8 megapixel front-facing camera; and a fingerprint sensor. It runs Android. It also supports accessories, which attach via magnets and communicate wirelessly with the phone. The first accessory is a 360-degree camera, because framing a shot is hard, and people are nostalgic for those 90s skateboard videos filmed though a fisheye lens. Probably. Essential also unveiled its own take on Amazon Echo or Google Home. Called Home, it is designed to be less intrusive than its rivals, while offering similar functionality. However, while it does have a speaker, it is not designed to be used as a music player. Back to the phone, and the one thing it proudly lacks is a logo, because Essential says "your phone is your personal property. It's a public expression of who you are and what you stand for. Just because we played a part in making it, [it] doesn't mean you should be forced to advertise that fact to everyone in your life. Now you know why we don't have any logos on the phone." So, this is a phone designed very much for the people, and by 'people', I mean, 'rich people'. The phone comes unlocked and on its own costs $699 (€620). The camera accessory bumps up the price to $898; however, for a limited time, the phone and camera are available as a bundle for $749. Speaking at Recode's Code Conference, Rubin said the phone will begin shipping this month. The launch understandably generated a lot of excitement – Rubin co-created Android, after all; it's the phone equivalent of Steve Wozniak designing a new computer. Nonetheless, it is crucial that this be converted into sustained mindshare, if you'll forgive the gratuitous use of an advertising buzzword. Otherwise, average consumers – already bombarded by Samsung and Apple ads – will soon forget what they were so excited about. A highly unscientific and cursory glance at the online storefronts of major U.S., U.K., Japanese, and South Korean MNOs showed that Apple and Samsung hog the limelight, featuring on the front pages of the 14 operators surveyed 10 and 11 times respectively. LG ranked third with five appearances. Sony featured once. It may only be 14 of the world's operators, but together they have comfortably north of half a billion mobile subscribers. And, if the pattern observed on these 14 Websites is consistent with the industry at large, then there are a lot of eyeballs being nourished by delicious publicity shots of iPhones and Galaxy S8s. And these are just the operators' own online storefronts. There is also the money that the likes of Apple and Samsung pour into TV, print, and outdoor advertising, and sponsorship to consider too. The world is saturated with iPhone and Galaxy ads. With that in mind, Total Telecom contacted Essential to enquire about its advertising strategy; this story will be updated if and when it responds. The bottom line is Essential might not think a logo is essential, but getting word out to potential customers surely is.

WWDC Rumor Seems Totally Bogus Here's why Apple isn't likely to preview a new iPhone months ahead of its formal launch. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 2, 2017 at 10:15AM AppleInsider shared some speculation from a J.P. Morgan analyst that there was "some possibility" that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would show off the next-generation iPhone at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event next week. AppleInsider went on to note that the analyst thinks that the public will get such a preview due to "expected large form factor change as well as new 3D scanning features." Image source: Apple. AppleInsider's Mike Wuerthele pegged this as "highly unlikely" and I agree. Here's why. Needlessly hurting iPhone 7 series sales On Apple's most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said that the company believes that it is seeing a "pause in purchases on iPhone" due to what the executive described as "earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones." This isn't terribly surprising. Interest in future iPhone models is generally very high among investors, consumers, and the tech press, so speculation and leaks about future iPhone models is bound to circulate to a sizable portion of the smartphone/iPhone customer base. Furthermore, given that the extent of this year's changes should be quite significant (I'd argue that they're more substantial than even the ones that Apple brought to market with the iPhone 6 series devices), the information contained in these leaks sounds compelling enough that it'd be quite sensible for potential iPhone customers who are exposed to these reports would try to hold off for the new phone, if possible. So, if Apple's executive leadership team believes that leaks about future iPhone models in the tech press is depressing iPhone sales (and I would hazard that a substantial portion, if not the majority, of smartphone buyers don't closely follow the reports about future iPhone models), then surely the team would realize that publicly previewing an iPhone that won't be out for several more months at least would probably have an even bigger negative impact on current iPhone sales. That's just bad for business and, for stockholders, virtually no potential upside for Apple. But doesn't the analyst make a good point? The analyst's basis for this speculation seems to be that Apple might want to give application developers a heads-up about what's coming so that they can prepare their applications to take advantage of the new features available to them in the new iPhone. Although that's a reasonable point, it's also important to understand that the developers of the most common iOS apps (e.g., major game developers, social media, and so on) may get advance knowledge of these features (as well as software development tools to use them) in private under a non-disclosure agreement. If the major first- and third-party apps can take advantage of whatever new features Apple plans to bring to the new iPhone early on, then that should be more than enough to make said features into compelling selling points. Such "exclusivity" on the part of the larger app developers would give them a few months' advantage over the smaller app developers in implementing new features, but in the scheme of things, this is a reasonable trade-off for Apple to make to avoid further hurting its current iPhone sales.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts How to live stream WWDC 2017 on iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac, Windows, and Android Anthony Bouchard on June 2, 2017 10 Apple will be live-streaming its WWDC 2017 event, just as they have for the last several years, so the world can tune in and see what’s new in the world of iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and more. No matter what type of device you’re using the day of the event, you can live-stream the keynote. In this piece, we’ll go over all the methods on how for every operating system and platform. How to stream WWDC 2017 live The live stream is accessible on virtually any device, so long as you have the right software requirements to do so. One of the following setups is going to be required to watch the WWDC 2017 event live: Any iOS 7.0 or later iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad and viewed with the Safari web browser Any Mac running OS X 10.8.5 or later and viewed with the Safari 6.0.5 or later web browser Any PC running Windows 10 and viewed with the Microsoft Edge web browser Any Apple TV running software 6.2 or later, or the Apple TV 4 with any version of tvOS NOTE: Streaming for Android and older configurations of Windows require a special link that won’t be available until Monday, June 5th – the day of the keynote. All other streaming methods are straightforward and should work as described. We will update that post accordingly once that streaming link becomes available. How to watch WWDC 2017 on iPhone, iPad, or Mac If you’re using an Apple device to stream WWDC 2017, then you’re all set in terms of software, as long as everything is up to date. All you will have to do is visit the WWDC 2017 page at 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST) in Safari and wait for the event to begin. It should start playing as soon as Apple begins broadcasting; if it doesn’t just try refreshing the page and that should jump-start your viewing process. How to watch WWDC 2017 on an Apple TV If you’re fortunate enough to have an Apple TV and will be tuning in from the comfort of your own living room sofa, there’s a different process to stream WWDC 2017 on it depending on the type of Apple TV you have. On older Apple TVs (third-generation and earlier), an app icon is automatically added to the Home screen for tuning in to WWDC for your convenience. Fourth-generation Apple TV users will have to download the Apple Events app from the App Store to watch WWDC 2017 live. After the app is on your Apple TV Home screen, simply launch it before 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST) and the streaming will begin on your TV set automatically. How to watch WWDC 2017 on an Android device If you’re on the other side of town and are tuning in from an Android device, then you’ll be happy to know there’s a process available for you as well. Just follow these steps: 1) Download and launch the VLC app, then tap on the Menu button, then tap Stream. 2) After you’re asked for a streaming source, enter the following URL: Note: The link is not yet available, but we will update this post when it is. 3) Tap on the Play button after 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST) and the live stream will be playing from your Android device through VLC. How to watch WWDC 2017 on a Windows PC If you’re using a Windows PC, then the steps to live-stream the WWDC 2017 keynote vary depending on the version of Windows you’re running. Windows 10 users can visit the WWDC 2017 page in the Microsoft Edge web browser at 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST). Microsoft Edge supports HLS streaming, much like Safari does on your Mac or iOS device, which means you will get a seamless viewing experience. Windows 8.1 and earlier users can tune in by following these steps: 1) Download and open the VLC app, then go to Media > Open Network Stream from the top of the app’s interface. 2) When prompted to enter a source, enter the following URL: Note: The link is not yet available, but we will update this post when it is. 3) Click on the Play button after 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST) and the live stream will play from VLC Media Player. Tuning in from other parts of the world? If you’re not from the United States and you’re wondering when the WWDC 2017 keynote will begin for you, the following time zone conversions may be useful: Beijing, China: Tuesday 1:00 A.M. Berlin, Germany: Monday 7:00 P.M. Hong Kong, China: Tuesday 1:00 A.M. London, United Kingdom: Monday 6:00 P.M. Los Angeles, United States: Monday 10:00 A.M. Moscow, Russia: Monday 8:00 P.M.

Tokyo, Japan: Tuesday 2:00 A.M. Follow along with us If you’re as excited as we are to watch WWDC 2017 and see what Apple has in store, then be sure to stay tuned to iDB throughout and after the keynote for in-depth coverage of all the latest announcements and releases. We’re expecting to see previews of Apple’s next major firmware releases for Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Mac, as well as potential bumps to Mac hardware at the event. Some rumors have even suggested a new Siri Speaker may be on its way to compete with Amazon Echo and Google Now. As always, there will probably be surprises, as well as humorous blurbs.

Phil Randle Those times are wrong,the keynote is June 5th so that would be Tuesday June 6th, 3am in Sydney. Raphael Shakhabudinov Are you sure about keynote time and even dates in all these time zones? Say like, in WWDC app on my iPhone it says: “Monday, 20:00, Moscow local time”. Your article tells somewhat different. And the other places are also seem to be wrong. Agneev Yeah, they’re wrong! Anthony Bouchard Can you clarify what appears to be different? My sources indicate 20:00 24-hour time converts to “8:00 PM” 12-hour time. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b71a8e36cbdc9649fc1ffa119c5ad45be11586bdaea15860b79b9f33225d782a.png Raphael Shakhabudinov The timing is correct, it’s the date. My iPhone tells me that the event will take place on Monday, the 5th of June. Your article stated different date: “Wednesday”. Now it states correct dates, but the previous version stated dates all wrong. Raphael Shakhabudinov All the other places now looks to be right as well. Now you got it.

But this time in years past, Apple’s upcoming new iPhone design was basically a matter of record. While nothing is ever truly confirmed until Apple announces its new iPhones on stage in California, the rumor mill has always managed to produce a clear picture of what to expect. This year, however, the rumor mill is torn. Will the iPhone 8 feature an all-screen face with barely any bezels, or will there be a hideous notch cut out for the camera, speaker and sensors? Will Apple and its partners figure out how to get their embedded Touch ID sensor ready for mass production, or will Apple have to move the fingerprint scanner to the back? These questions and more have yet to be answered, and the fight took yet another turn on Friday morning. Don't Miss: It’ll be a long time until the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot are priced this low again Early on Friday morning, new photos were posted on Slashleaks that supposedly showed an iPhone 8 mockup. We covered them in an earlier post. The mockup shown in those pictures was essentially an iPhone 7 with a new dual-lens rear camera and a new Touch ID fingerprint scanner integrated into the aluminum back of the phone. It goes without saying that these new photos show an iPhone 8 design that flies in the face of everything we’ve heard so far. Apple’s new iPhone 8 is expected to feature wireless charging, which means the company can no longer use aluminum housings. Instead, Apple is expected to use Gorilla Glass on the front and back of the iPhone 8, with a stainless steel midframe that is rounded and polished around the edges. The steel edges should create a perfectly rounded design when lined up with the 2.5D glass on the front and back of the phone. In response to those photos, graphic designer turned gadget leaker @VenyaGeskin1 posted the following tweet: Clone is wrong! This is how its going to look like. #iPhone8 pic.twitter.com/U7sY9hqm5S — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) June 2, 2017 Now, Geskin has thrown a whole lot of spaghetti at the wall, so something will inevitably end up sticking. Citing unnamed sources who are believed for the most part to be random people in Chinese forums who claim to have an inside track at Foxconn, he has in the past made too many conflicting iPhone 8 claims to count. He’s said that the Touch ID sensor will be on the back. He’s said it will be on the front, embedded in the screen. He’s said that the dual-lens camera will be horizontal. He’s said it will be vertical. He’s said the flash will be beneath the two rear camera lenses. He’s said it will be between the two rear camera lenses. And so on. The iPhone 8 design Geskin seems to have landed on is the one pictured above. It’s a gorgeous design that is mostly in line with what we’ve heard from more reliable sources, though the notch cutout along the top of the display is absolutely hideous. It’s almost as bad as the one on Andy Rubin’s Essential phone. The only way I could see Apple actually using a design like this is if the company keeps the portions of the display panel on either side of the speaker and sensors dark, using them only to display things that currently appear in the iPhone’s status bar (carrier, signal strength, battery charge, Bluetooth status, location status, etc.). Of course, that wouldn’t work very well on an iPhone with a white face — perhaps Apple will only release the iPhone 8 in one color? We’re close enough to the iPhone 8’s launch that the design is almost certainly finalized by now. In fact, we recently shared exclusive photos of what is believed to be Apple’s final iPhone 8 design, though the mockup seen there doesn’t answer the display question. Someone with more solid sources will undoubted answer the iPhone 8 design questions that remain, but you can expect to see plenty of back and forth until then.

But Wharton operations, information and decisions practice professor David Robertson argues that this view is too narrow a definition of innovation, and one that is not useful to most companies. In his book, The Power of Little Ideas: A Low-Risk, High-Reward Approach to Innovation, Robertson talks about a more practical way companies can innovate: by focusing on complementary actions around a key product. He teaches innovation and product development at Wharton and is the host of Innovation Navigation, a Wharton Business Radio program. Robertson recently spoke to Knowledge@Wharton about his book. An edited transcript of the conversation follows. Knowledge@Wharton: The inspiration for this book actually came, in some ways, from a can of paint. Why don’t you tell us about that? David Robertson: My previous book was about Lego, and that was a story about a company that figured out that you didn’t want to innovate inside the box — that wasn’t going to get them anywhere — and you didn’t want to innovate outside the box because that almost put them out of business, but rather, around the box. Complementary innovations around a core product — the brick for Lego — was what really led them to their recent success. I got my house painted a couple of summers ago, and the contractor I hired put together a proposal. He helped me choose colors and helped me decide what kind of paint, what things needed painting the most, and how I’d manage on a limited budget. He put together a proposal, and he picked Sherwin Williams paint. I looked at my favorite consumer ratings magazine, and Sherwin-Williams paint is good, but it’s twice as expensive as another paint that’s equally good. So I talked to him, and I said, “Can’t we use this other paint?” And he said, “Well, yes, we could, but it’s going to raise your price.” I said, “I don’t understand, the other paint is half the price.” And he said, “Yeah, but paint is only about 15% of the total cost of your project. I have to think about all the supplies; I’ve got to line up the labor; there’s the overhead of running a company, etc..” He said, “What Sherwin-Williams does is help me though the entire process of working with you, from helping you choose your colors — there’s a Sherwin-Williams color consultant — to figuring out how much paint is needed for the primer, and for the paint itself, brushes, tarps, all the other supplies. Then, during the project, it is keeping me supplied — I can return extra primer if I don’t need it. If I run out of something, that Sherwin-Williams rep will be over at the site, delivering what I need. Then, at the end, he helps me put together that next proposal. Because there’s always a next proposal, as any homeowner knows. I looked, and it turns out within a five or 10-minute drive of my house, there are more Sherwin-Williams stores than there are Starbucks, and that’s because they realized who their customer is. It’s not me. I’m the end consumer, of course, and I’m the one that has Sherwin-Williams paint on the house. But it’s that small business, the painting contractor, [that they focus on]. Sherwin-Williams, like Lego, realized it’s not so much about the product — their product is a can of paint — it’s about their innovations around the product that make that product more valuable. I wanted to write a book for companies that wanted to try this approach to innovation. I don’t argue that there’s one best way to innovate, but it seems like it’s a tool that every innovation leader should have in their tool belt. Knowledge@Wharton: What isn’t being discussed when companies think about innovation, or how they should strategize toward an innovation? Robertson: I interview innovation thinkers, gurus, consultants, executives who have done interesting innovative things, and I continually see this binary view of innovation … — [develop] an incrementally better version of your current product here … or something revolutionary and disruptive, be it some kind of Blue Ocean Strategy thing (creating an uncontested market) or lean startup or disruptive technology, some kind of new and better version of your business. In other words, leaving the old behind and venturing out into new territories. “Sherwin-Williams … realized it’s not so much about the product — their product is a can of paint — it’s about their innovations around the product that make that product more valuable.” To see innovation in that binary way is dangerous. Most people in most companies doing most of the innovation are focused on that current product that needs to become more competitive. Maybe it’s competitively challenged; maybe it has become a commodity, whatever. What I liked about the approach of Lego and Sherwin-Williams was that it was focused on that type of innovation: How do we take our existing product and make it more compelling, make it more valuable for our customers? Knowledge@Wharton: Your book is not saying that in using this ‘third way’ of innovating, we have to throw out things. It’s more about finding the right toolkit to use for whatever your problem happens to be, or to solve your market issues. Are there ways, once you start using this third way, to keep your employees on track? Sponsored Content: Robertson: This book was a hard one to write, because the stuff in the middle is really review. It’s the material at the beginning and the end that’s different. What I lay out in the book is a four-step process. And the first step — what you are asking about — is really the step of answering, “Who are we as a company? What are our crown jewels? What are those things that we did yesterday that we’re going to do today and that we are going to do tomorrow? The things that made our company great, that our customers still depend on us for? What’s our [Lego] brick?” Some companies have many different bricks. Lego was easy. Sherwin-Williams was easy. But there are other companies where it’s more difficult [to find the key product]. But starting small, choosing something important, and then trying to understand what customers are getting from the product is the first step. That is a different step. It’s almost where you’re not going to innovate. What’s going to stay the same? I think that’s a much more stable base to build innovation efforts from. Then, once you’ve done that, it’s understanding what the value is to the customer, what I call “the promise,” that’s the second step. Then you come to the third step, which is the creative idea generation, and there’s lots of different ways to do it. Then, going into some of the prototyping and experimentation to understand whether you have the right ideas, that’s all pretty well-trod territory. I put in some things that are unique to this approach to innovation in the book. But then, it’s the fourth step, and you have to read all the way to Chapter 7. If you’re a company that’s good at product development, developing a better version of your product or service, then you have probably set up roles and responsibilities, and structured processes, metrics, reward systems, that make you very good at that. But that actually prevents this approach to innovation. You have to change some of that, otherwise, you are setting your team up for failure. That last part, about how you change your organization to give your team the chance to be successful, that’s what makes this so hard. “Get a team organized around some product, and give them the freedom to really think more broadly than just about the product or service.” Knowledge@Wharton: You also have to organize your company that way, because if it’s organized toward disruption, you can’t do this. Robertson: That’s right, and it’s why I suggest starting small. Get a team organized around some product, and give them the freedom to really think more broadly than just about the product or service. Rather, give the team the mandate to start thinking about other services, partners, channels to market, whatever, that will really help your customers get more value from the product. That’s something that can be really difficult to overcome in a company. But if you start small, you can show that it’s valuable, and then build up from there. Knowledge@Wharton: Now you also point out — using Kodak as an example — that this is not the answer for every company, for every problem. For example, Kodak probably couldn’t have used the third way to survive the advent of digital photography. Robertson: That’s right. I think of it as another tool in the tool belt that I don’t see people talking about. Knowledge@Wharton: One of the things you talk about in the book is that Lego — back when their fortunes had declined, and they were looking for a way back to growth — first turned to incremental innovation. Then they turned to disruption, and then they turned to this [third way of innovating around the box]. Robertson: I saw that pattern being repeated again and again. I saw it with Apple; I saw it with Gatorade. One of the first things that companies tend to do is … maybe they’ve grown because they came out with a great product. So they do more of that product, and they expand it to new geographies, and the company grows and everything’s wonderful. Then, all of a sudden, that’s not enough. That avenue for growth hits its inevitable end. Then what often happens — what happened at Lego, Apple, Gatorade, etc. — is they keep putting out more versions of the product. Every new variant that they spin off makes less money, but has just as much cost. So profits go down, sales don’t go up, and the whole thing — if you keep doing it — will result in a problem. What happened at Lego — as also happened at Apple, and that happened at other companies — is that they begin to ask this: How can we reinvent the future? How can we reinvent the future of play for Lego or computing for Apple or whatever? And they come out with all kinds of revolutionary disruptive products. And that’s really dangerous. It’s expensive, it’s difficult, it fails a lot. It doesn’t mean you don’t want to try. You absolutely want to try. You have to have somebody looking out there to see what’s happening with technologies, and with competitors, and new low-end, high-tech solutions that could disrupt you if you’re not really paying attention to it. You’ve got to be focused on that. “Steve Jobs was not a disruptor. He was disruptive, but not a disruptor. That may sound like academic nitpicking, but I think it’s really important.” But it’s tough to bet the company on it. It was only when those companies went back to the core product and started innovating around it that they began to have the success that they had. Knowledge@Wharton: A lot of times, when people talk about innovation at Apple, what they talk about is disruption. You argue that it’s the third way that actually came first. Robertson: Yes, and I get a lot of heat for that second chapter about Apple, because I’m arguing that [its late cofounder and visionary CEO] Steve Jobs was not a disruptor. He was disruptive, but not a disruptor. That may sound like academic nitpicking, but I think it’s really important, because it says something about where innovation leaders should look for ideas. Let me go into that in a little bit of depth. Apple, when it came out with the iPod and iTunes in 2001, made major changes in the music industry. Of course, in 2003, when they opened up the iTunes Store, that was a big change. And it opened up the first major digital market. If you’re a music company or if you’re a company making MP3 players, that feels like a disruption. But the point that I try to make in the chapter is that Steve Jobs was not looking to disrupt. You’ve got to go back to 2001 to see that Apple was a company that had focused on the PC market, and had steadily been losing share. I think they had a peak of about 15% in the mid-1990s … and hit a low of 4% market share. Things were really bad at Apple in 2001. Of course, it was the tech crash, so there was less demand, but things were not going well. What Steve Jobs was doing with the iPod and iTunes was he came out — and I urge anybody to go back and listen to his Macworld presentation from 2001, where he shows a picture of a Mac in the middle, and he shows around it a VCR and a digital camera and a CD player and a Palm Pilot — and he said, “Your life is becoming digital. Your pictures are digital, your movies are digital, both the ones you watch and the ones you take. And your music is digital. And in no place is this experience worse than with music. So, we’re going to help you manage your digital life.” And then, he introduces the iPod and iTunes. And iTunes, actually, was a product called SoundJam that he’d acquired the year before and improved slightly, but it was introduced as iTunes. And of course, the iPod was, at that time, an MP3 player. And Steve Jobs, if you go back and read Walter Isaacson’s biography, fought like crazy resisting taking iTunes to the IBM platform, which of course, was necessary. I mean, the customers just demanded it, so he had to. But the purpose of the iPod and iTunes was not to disrupt the music industry, it was to complement the Mac. It was to sell more Macs and to make the Mac more valuable. It was to make it the hub of your digital life. Again, if you’re in the music industry, those feel very disruptive. But Steve Jobs was not looking to disrupt. He was saying, “What is our brick? What’s that center of who we are? It’s the Mac. How can we sell more Macs? Well, by making it more valuable. Well, what do people want? They want to manage their digital life.” And in 2001, that was becoming a real thing. Let’s do that for one area — music — and let’s see whether that can’t sell some more Macs. It really was, I think, a misunderstood case. That is not a case of disruption, not from the standpoint of what was going through Steve Jobs’ mind in 2001. Knowledge@Wharton: What do you think is Apple’s brick today? Would it be the Mac or the iPhone? Robertson: They followed where their customers led them. That iPod, of course, became the iPod Touch, and then it became the iPhone in 2007. Then the App Store opens up in 2008, and there’s this whole system of complementary innovations around the iPhone. Now, of course, they make a lot more money from the small screen than from the big screen. The iPhone has become its own center of a system of complementary innovations. One of those, of course, is the Watch. We will see whether the Apple Watch becomes a third center. It doesn’t look like it is. It looks like Apple is not quite able to execute. One of the things that Steve Jobs was able to do, he had that force of personality that demanded everybody in the company work together to make an insanely great customer experience. “The purpose of the iPod and iTunes was not to disrupt the music industry, it was to complement the Mac.” Well, as the company has grown, and as Steve Jobs is gone, it may be getting harder within Apple to bring together all the different parts of the company to really make that seamless experience. To make it not around one center, but around two or even three, if you count the Watch. I end the book with a story of Disney. Disney is both a great example because they were the first to do this — back in 1937, they were doing this with the first animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. They also had records, so you could sing along. They had bath salts, so you could smell like Snow White. They had events at the movie theater. The Mickey Mouse Club, at its peak, was bigger than the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts combined. All those things made the movie more valuable and the whole experience better. But as Disney grew, and — especially during the [CEO Michael] Eisner years, this has been well documented — all those different things became their own business units. So there was the theme park business unit, the movie business unit, the stores business unit, and the TV shows. All those things kind of went in their own direction. And the one that was let go, that lost some of its luster, was movies and telling stories. A lot of the characters in the stories were the things that drew people to Disney World, and to the merchandise in the stores and so forth. And Bob Iger, when he took over for Eisner, realized that. He said, “I had this eye-opening trip in Tokyo, where I looked around, and all the characters that kids were really excited by or interested in were either very old Disney characters, like Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck and Goofy, or the new ones from Pixar.” All the other movies that they had been making — The Princess and the Frog, Bolt — were just a lot of very ho-hum movies that Disney put out. They’d lost that art. So Iger purchased Pixar, and used the management of Pixar to help revive the fortunes of the Disney innovation. Of course, that led to Frozen and some of the other great Disney animated features that we’ve seen, and a revival of the whole system of innovations around it. Knowledge@Wharton: How do you find those ah-ha moments, like when Gatorade realized that athletes were its core audience? Robertson: It starts with that question, ‘What are our crown jewels?’ Lego asked the question, ‘What would the world miss if we were gone?’ And what they found was that people would miss the brick, the plastic brick. … The toys that didn’t have bricks in them were the toys that failed. People felt that if there was no brick, they had no reason to do business with Lego. They’d rather go to Fisher-Price or Mattel or Hasbro. Just asking that question, ‘What are our crown jewels?’ And then, for each of them, what would the world miss if it was gone? Then, going out and talking to those customers and watching them use the product. Watching kids play, or watching a contractor paint a house: That’s what you have to do to understand where other innovations might make that crown jewel more valuable to a customer.

INNOVATION FUND & INNOVATION CENTRES IN ENGINEERING COLLEGES IN INDIA In a broader sense, innovation is important to the advancement of society around the world. New and innovative products can increase the standard of living and provide people with opportunities to improve their lives. Breakthroughs in medicine and technology have significantly improved living standards around the world. Innovation has also lead to significant improvements in the way businesses operate and has closed the gaps between different markets. Innovation in engineering: Innovation in engineering is much more than research and development. It encompasses an end-to-end process, such that it extracts value through implementation. Innovation involves: • creating or generating new activities, products, processes and services • seeing things from a different perspective • moving outside the existing paradigms • improving existing processes and functions • disseminating new activities or ideas • adopting things that have been successfully tried elsewhere Innovation covers the area from minor quality improvements to ‘cutting edge’ products and services. “If we can’t find ways to inspire a generation of engineers with varied skills, this is going to be a principle obstacle for growth in our slowly recovering global economy” said Lidia Brito, Director of the Division of Science Policy and Capacity Building at UNESCO. “A recent UNESCO Engineering Report shows a marked shortage of engineers in many countries. Although the general number of engineering students is increasing worldwide, the proportion who enroll in engineering, as compared to other disciplines, is concernedly dropping. We need hands-on challenges like Fly Your Ideas to motivate young innovators about the potential of engineering in helping to find practical solutions to issues the world may face in the near future.” Such innovation may be under threat from a skills gap that could be hitting the economy hard. It will see high tech companies face a shortfall of 40 million of the skilled workers needed by 2020 and beyond, with aerospace likely to suffer, along with motor and the medical equipment sectors. Charles Champion, Executive Vice President Engineering at Airbus and Fly Your Ideas Patron, says: “These future-focused and disruptive concepts prove that engineering isn’t just about technical skills – it’s about having an innovative mindset and a creative approach. But for our industry to succeed in making aviation carbon neutral by 2020, we need a constant source of fresh and inventive ideas from the innovators of today and those of tomorrow. Our future solutions are here right now – and through projects like ‘Fly Your Ideas’, we are helping them to become a reality for the future.” Innovation is extremely important to a country like India as it is closely related to productivity. Although there are a number of avenues to increased productivity, innovation is the most significant factor. Creativity is seeing what everyone sees and thinking what no one else has thought before,Invention is transforming those new thoughts into tangible ideas Innovation goes even further, involving preparedness to mix with the commercial world to turn novel ideas into products . The expertise of the engineering profession is vital to convert innovative ideas into reality for common use. Many of the comforts humankind enjoys today have been the result of innovative engineers. Examples include electrical appliances, transportation, buildings, telecommunications and urban infrastructure. Innovation and technology have become two inseparable words in the annals of human history. Engineers drive technology and are therefore at the forefront of innovation. In India there were efforts to harness the talent and innovative spirit among people by organisations like National Innovation Foundation(NIF),National Research Development Corporation(NRDC),TePP etc. besides some private initiatives(Spark the Rise) etc. In a vast country like ours these are piecemeal. “The real innovation has to come from the bottom of the pyramid,” he added.” The amount spent for innovation should help to shape the beneficiaries as entrepreneurs. I have a project: Innovation Centres in Engineering Colleges:in India: Engineers are best suited to innovate. Unfortunately most of the Engineering Colleges like Infrastructure facilities(like Good Workshop, Electronics Lab etc). A Project,” INNOVATION CENTRES) in Engineering Colleges can be started under Innovation Fund. Selected Colleges can be provided to start a good workshop and Electronics Lab. This way the Students can undertake innovative projects and come out with good gadgets. Later they can patent them and go for commercialization. This is the best way to spend Innovation Fund so that there will be productivity and promotion of Entrepreneurship. We often talk of Appropriate Technology(AT): it should be: A T ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGY AFFORDABLE TECHNOLOGY ADAPTABLE TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTABLE TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBLE TECHNOLOGY I have a novel scheme to SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PEOPLE: Human Resources – Traditional Knowledge and Methods – Great Assets to Developing Countries Ideas float around in bewildering numbers, and scores of designs, ranging from windmills to the spinning wheel, are available ; papers are circulated stating the wonders of intermediate (not innovative) technology what could be done, why it should be done, what must be done, and how the rural countryside can be changed if intermediate technology is implemented. Experts are called from abroad to tell people this. In all this talk, there seems to be no place for the ideas generated by farmers, rural artisans. A stand seems to have been taken that this transfer of technology for the socio-economic regeneration of the rural areas is a novelty for country-folk. But rural communities have survived for generations without any help in ideas and materials from outside. They have developed a low-cost technology of their own, suited to their own particular areas. It would be foolish to overlook and take for granted methods used by farmers and artisans. When a ploughshare develops trouble on the field, when a bullock cart breaks down on the road to market, when a house collapses in a storm, the villager uses materials available in the immediate vicinity to solve his problem. It is the scientist who must see these problems as challenges that must be met if there is to be development in rural areas. It is clear that the villagers and scientists will see the problems of the villages quite differently, and it will not always be true that the projects proposed by the scientists will be meaningful to the villages. If projects are imposed on the villagers, they are likely to be skeptical and may well resist rather than co-operate with the programme. Rural Development Schemes, in the broadest sense, requires first a good sociological approach, and as much psychology as scientific knowledge. After all ‘country means people and not soil’. Problems – People – Solutions Research, Development and Demonstration projects in developing countries have generated a variety of devices and systems for exploitation – for example, solar cookers, wind battery charges etc. In Innovation theory, this is a classic case of technology push, that is, technical solutions looking for a social application. Technology push innovations might of course be adopted if they happen to satisfy a real demand, or are heavily promoted. Success is much more likely, however if the needs, priorities and demands are studied before attempting to introduce a new technology or system. This is the demand pull approach to innovation. Often identifying the right problem is difficult rather than finding a possible solution. People are better judges to identify the problems and since they benefit most by the solutions, they can contribute for finding the best solutions. A novel and innovative scheme is suggested to achieve the above goal. In developing countries the Government can advertise in the media seeking problems from the people in different disciplines like education, health, energy, industry etc. The problems received can be screened, studied and short-listed by a committee comprising government officials, experts, representatives from N.G.O’s etc. The short-listed problems can be re-advertised seeking solutions from people. The solutions received can be studied in detail and the best solutions given awards. To catch a fish the bait should be attractive enough. As such there should be sizeable incentive so that people can devote their talent and energies for finding solutions. As the saying goes ‘Anything can be done for a Dollar’. In this way the creative potential of the people can be tapped to the full and a thought process will be set in motion in the country. In India a general knowledge programme conducted by a Super Star on TV is a roaring success and children, youth and old-all alike have become addicted to get equipped with general knowledge so that they can try their luck for winning fabulous cash prizes.
