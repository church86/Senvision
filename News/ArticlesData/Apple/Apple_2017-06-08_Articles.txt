That is the buzzword nowadays in the Silicon Valley. On June 5 at WWDC 2017 when Apple showed the new cool photography tricks that the iPhone will do with the iOS 11, it became clear why the computational photography is the next big thing as far as smartphones and cameras are concerned. It changes the game completely and in the last two odd years we have seen how it is making the phones like the iPhone 7 Plus and the Google Pixel the kind of shooters that can hold their own against proper cameras. But before we talk about the computational photography, let's talk about that magic trick that Apple showed on June 5. While demoing the new photo app in the iOS 11, Apple spokespersons talked about the time lapse feature. This is the kind of the feature that lets photographer clicks that light trail and silky white and extremely smooth running water with motion effect. It requires fiddling with aperture and shutter speed in cameras. It also requires a decent enough camera for the best results, with DSLR cameras often preferred. But Apple showed it can do the same photography with an iPhone, without fiddling with any knobs and dials. On the stage we saw that the time lapse feature was turned on the iPhone and it clicked a photo of waterfall that showed the water motion with silk smooth white stream. Just like that. Pure magic. Not for the first time The interesting bit is that this is not the first time Apple is doing something like this, creating an effect that would otherwise require expensive camera and lenses, with an iPhone. In fact, Apple is not even the only phone company doing it. Google too is big on the computational photography. We first saw the best example of it when Apple came out with the portrait mode in the iPhone 7 Plus. This mode allows a user to click portrait photos that have this creamy blurred background. and it works beautifully. In a proper DSLR camera the effect of blurred background is achieved using physics and light. It requires a lens with very wide aperture - F1.8 is better, F1.4 is fantastic - and with a combination of distance between the sensor and lens. Also the elements used inside the lens and the sensor size have an effect on this mode. Finally, there is the focal length. The higher the focal length, the better will be the blurred background aka bokeh. This is the reason why pro photographers use something like 105mm or 135mm lens with aperture of F2.8 or less to shoot portrait photos. There is lot of science involved here, lot of technology, and lot of skills. The iPhone 7 Plus does it all with just a toggle. Put the camera app in the portrait mode and shoot. And results are spectacular. so how does Apple manage something that requires a bulky camera with a small iPhone that has a tiny lens and tiny image sensor. Apple uses computational data. Apple doesn't rely on the physics of light to create the blurred background. It uses the data that camera sees, and computes a scene that would otherwise require expensive lens and a big bulky camera. It's not perfect all the time. It is definitely not as fine and natural looking as what a full-frame DSLR can manage. But the difference is minute. It is more than good enough for most consumers. Now the company is doing the same with the time lapse feature. it again is using the data collected by the tiny lens and making all those calculations using the powerful A10 processor to create a scene that is otherwise can only be clicked by a proper camera. Nowadays, everyone clicks photos with their phones. In fact, phones like the Google Pixel are even better than most entry-level cameras. In good light, these phones even match better cameras And Apple is hardly the only company doing it. Samsung is working on computational photography to make its cameras click better photos. Inside Google, which makes Pixel phones, there is this whole team that works on computational photography. It is this team that is behind the fantastic HDR mode in Pixel phones. Pixel phones have a small sensor compared to what you will inside a DSLR camera and yet it captures brilliant HDR. the sunset and sunrise photos clicked with the Pixel phones have amazingly clean shadows and brilliant colours. it's not because of the lens of the pixel or its image sensor - although that plays a role too - it is because Google's camera app issuing all those cool algorithms to compute a scene. It is probably filling in the data that is missing by recognising the patterns in the scene. It is using machine learning to probably make billions of calculations and figuring out the scene to recreate it digitally even if its lens can't capture all those brilliant rays of light the way a DSLR camera can do. Nikon and Canon should worry The interesting bit about the computational photography is that this is just beginning. In the last one year we have seen portrait mode and HDR getting better in the phones with the use of algorithms. Now Apple is adding another cool effect using it. Next you will see, phone companies will be figuring out the focus-related issues by using computation and not the light physics the way Canon or Nikon do. Then low light photography. Next the effects like starbursts. Who knows in future the computational photography may even figure out the problem of zoom and shutter speed. It is the digital world after all. This should make Canon and Nikon sit and take notice. Unfortunately, for now they remain oblivious to the risk, even though the entry-level camera market is almost gone. Nowadays, everyone clicks photos with their phones. In fact, phones like the Google Pixel are even better than most entry-level cameras. In good light, these phones even match better cameras. Yet, canon and Nikon continue to rely on their mastery of light, sensors and lights. But that won't be enough. they also need to start thinking about putting powerful computers inside their cameras, the way Apple and Google do in their phones. The Nikon and Canon cameras need to go beyond the Expeed and Digic. They need Snapdragons, Exynos and processor like the Apple A10 in their DSLR cameras. And they need to use these processors to make the cameras better, fill in the gaps, solve the problems that physics and light can't. Or else, in another five years DSLR cameras will look as irrelevant  as the compact cameras do right now. Also Read: iPhone 7 Plus camera can surpass a DSLR camera.

We compare the iPad Pro to the (mid-2017) MacBook Air and decide for ourselves. Read next: Best iPad buying guide 2017 | Best Mac buying guide | Best cheap iPad deals UK iPad Pro vs MacBook Air: Hardware For arguments sake, lets compare the 13in MacBook Air to the iPad Pro, as it has a similarly sized 12.9in screen and thus, should have similar dimensions. Dimensions Even though its called the MacBook ‘Air’ it seems to be the bulkier of the two, though not by much – the iPad Pro measures in at 305.7 x 220.6mm and is only 6.9mm at its thickest point, while the MacBook Air measures in at 325 x 227mm and is 17mm at its thickest point. Although with this being said, the iPad Pro is clearly the lighter option of the two, weighing in at a lightweight 677g compared to the bulkier 1342g MacBook Air. However, dimensions aren’t everything; for an iPad Pro to replace a MacBook Air, it needs to be able to do everything a MacBook Air can, and more. While in terms of processing power, the iPad Pro is an interesting specimen (we’ll come to this in more detail below), it falls flat on its face in one important area; ports. Though the MacBook Air has fewer ports than others in the Mac range (due to its slim form factor) it still boasts more connectivity than the iPad Pro, offering a headphone port, Thunderbolt 2 port, two USB 3.0 ports, an SDXC card slot and of course, the hugely popular (but soon to be discontinued) MagSafe 2 power port. The iPad Pro on the other hand? It features a ‘smart’ connector used for connecting keyboard covers, along with the single Lightning port and headphone port available on the device. The lightning port can be used to import photos and videos from an SD card when used with a Camera connector (sold separately) and mirror the iPad Pro display to the TV using a Lightning Digital AV Adapter (also sold separately), but those looking to pop a memory stick in and browse their files will be disappointed. It’s the one area we feel the iPad Pro is lacking, especially for those looking to use the iPad Pro on business trips – even its main competitor, the Surface Pro 4, has a number of ports including a full size USB 3.0 port, a Mini DisplayPort and a micro SDXC card slot. Media consumption So the iPad Pro might not be the best option for business men and women, but what about for those looking for a media consumption device? This is an area where the iPad Pro excels thanks to a number of factors, but mainly thanks to its’ display and audio. The iPad Pro has a 12.9in LED touchscreen with a resolution of 2732x2048, giving it a pixel density of 264ppi, while the MacBook Air boasts a 13.3in glossy LED display with a native resolution of 1440x900, almost half of the iPad Pro offering – and the difference is noticeable. This makes gaming, catching up on the latest TV and even browsing the web on an iPad Pro a much crisper, vivid experience. Although media consumption doesn’t just rely on video – as any decent video editor will tell you, audio has a just as important – if not more important – role to play. Think of it like this; if you’ve got a native 4K video but low quality, highly compressed audio, you won’t enjoy the experience the same as with crisp, high quality audio. The MacBook Air features stereo speakers that aren’t exactly ground breaking; while it’s satisfactory for catch-up TV, it’s isn’t something you’d constantly be playing music though (we always opt to use a Bluetooth speaker rather than the built-in MacBook Air speakers). The iPad Pro on the other hand has not two, but four speakers that help to produce a “stereo soundstage” as described by Apple. The speaker housings have been machined directly into the body of the iPad Pro, producing a wider frequency range, improved volume and audio that seems to be coming directly from the center of the display, opposed to from behind or the sides, as is the case with other iPads. It really provides a more immersive experience when gaming or watching movies, and although it still isn’t as bass-y as we’d like, it’s a huge improvement over the MacBook Air and previous iPad models.   Specs It’s time to move onto the most important part of the comparison (for some at least) – processing power. The 13.3in MacBook Air boasts a 1.8GHz dual-core intel core i5 processor, Turbo Boosted up to 2.9GHz with 8GB of RAM and Intel HD Graphics 6000, which when coupled with a SSD provides a solid performer with enough power to complete every day tasks, as well as use processor-hungry software like Photoshop and iMovie. The iPad Pro features Apple’s latest (and greatest) SoC, the 64-bit A10X Fusion, which is a different beast altogether – and when coupled with an M10 motion co-processor (and a yet unannounced amount of RAM), you’ve got a machine that should handle anything you can throw at it. While a MacBook Air may struggle with the likes of high-resolution video editing, the iPad Pro is capable of editing three streams of native 4K video at once with no sign of slowing down, giving you some idea of its capabilities. Read next: Is it possible to get a free iPad? The truth about free iPad scams Software The iPad Pro comes running iOS 10, Apple’s latest mobile operating system whereas the MacBook Air features macOS Sierra, a fully-featured desktop OS. iOS 10’s key iPad-focused features like split-screen browsing in Safari work really well on the iPad Pro. You no longer need to scroll down to continue reading an email because (in general) the 12.9in screen will be able to display the email in full, even when sharing the screen with another app in split-screen mode. This in turn makes you more productive, as you’re able to operate two apps independently at the same time and get more information at a glance.  However, with a MacBook Air running macOS Sierra, you can have a number of apps open at the same time, with the ability to switch between active windows only a click of the trackpad away. Some people may think using a trackpad is faster and more efficient than using a touchscreen, but we think this is more down to personal preference than anything else. One area where the iPad Pro may not be able to compete with its macOS counterpart is, ironically, pro apps. For a long time, developers have complained that Apple’s App Store policies act as a barrier for those that want to create iOS versions of Mac apps. Professional apps can cost hundreds of pounds – Digital design app Sketch 3 costs £79.99 when purchased for Mac, which is a lot of money to hand over without using the app first. Of course, Mac users are treated to a free trial before parting with their cash, but the same can’t be said for the iOS App Store, where free trials aren’t available. Consumers have to take the leap of faith, purchase the app and hope its what they need – something that wouldn’t happen with pro apps that’d likely have a similar price tag to their Mac counterparts. The other option is to lower the price and hope it encourages more sales, but with professional apps that cater to rather small, niche markets, it’s not a viable option. Even if consumers did pay full price for a pro iPad app, paid-upgrades (something that’s fairly standard with Mac apps) aren’t available with the iOS App Store, meaning developers that put resources and time into app redesigns can’t reap the benefits of extra income. However, with that being said, the iPad Pro wins in terms of app discovery and availability. Though there is a multitude of apps available for Mac, the Mac App Store isn’t over-populated to say the least. Compare this to the iOS App Store which has over 1,500,000 apps and its clear to see that in terms of app discovery, the iPad Pro offers the better platform. It’s ideal for casual gamers, too – where on a Mac you’d pay £10-40 for a decent game, iOS games are generally much cheaper, with the average game costing between £0.99 and £4.99. When it comes to downloading files from the internet, the MacBook Air is the clear winner. iOS users can download and open files, but it can’t be any old file – it has to be a photo, video or a supported file type that can be opened by an installed iOS app. Even then, downloads can be slow and depending on the overall size of the download, you could run into errors – as we often have – whereas downloads on a MacBook Air are handed with ease, no matter whether its large or small. You also have complete freedom with file formats too, as you can download any file type to your MacBook Air. Read next: MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro comparison review Accessories Let’s move onto accessories, an area particularly important for graphic designers and artists alike that use digital platforms to create their artwork. Of course, the MacBook Air isn’t touchscreen-enabled, so using any kind of stylus is out of the question – and trying to draw on a MacBook display would be pretty awkward (with its current design, anyway). Creatives using a MacBook Air for work would have to fork out for a graphics tablet to produce similar results to what is possible on the iPad Pro with the Pencil – except a decent graphics tablet, like the Wacom Intuos Pro, costs £299.99. Not ideal when you’ve just paid £850-1000 for the laptop. As mentioned, the Apple Pencil is the flagship accessory for the iPad Pro, and was announced alongside the device itself in September 2015. The Pencil was designed specifically for use with the iPad Pro, and boasts a number of impressive features, including virtually no lag when drawing. This is possible because the iPad Pro can sense the difference between Pencil input and finger input, scanning its signal 240 times per second when the Pencil is detected, giving the iPad Pro twice the amount of data it would normally collect. That’s not all though, as the Pencil can also detect varying levels of pressure, which allow for better shading, and should help to produce more life-like images than before. There are also two tilt-sensors built into the tip of the Pencil that calculate the orientation of your hand, meaning you can tilt the Apple Pencil and shade like you would when using a real pencil and achieve the desired effect. Even with regards to its design, it’s a winner – our sister site Digital Arts let artist and illustrator Pete Fowler use the iPad Pro & Pencil, and he remarked that "In your hand, it just feels fantastic” and that “there's a really nice weight to it". It’s a fascinating accessory, even for those without an artistic bone in their body (like us) and at £99, it’s a lot cheaper than buying a graphics tablet. Read next: Apple Pencil review Pricing and availability Last, but by no means least, we come to pricing. The iPad Pro starts at £769 if you want the variant with 64GB of storage, jumping up to £859 for 256GB of storage, and a whopping £1,039 for 512GB of storage. If you're looking for an iPad Pro with cellular connectivity, prices jump up to £899, £989 and £1,169 respectively. Though that may seem like a lot of money to fork out for an iPad, especially considering the standard 9.7in iPad starts at £339, its processing power and hardware puts it in the same category as the MacBook Air. The 13.3in MacBook Air starts at £949 and comes with 128GB of PCIe-based flash storage, jumping up to 256GB for those wanting to part with £1,099 of their hard-earned cash. Comparing 256GB Wi-Fi models (there is no cellular MacBook Air and no 128GB iPad Pro), the iPad Pro is a whopping £240 cheaper than the MacBook Air, but that’s not including accessories. For the iPad Pro to replace your Mac, you’ll probably have to fork out for a keyboard cover – the official Apple iPad Pro keyboard cover will set you back £169. And if you’re a creative, the Pencil costs an additional £99, although buying both accessories are a cheaper option than opting for the £299 Wacom Intuos Pro, as mentioned earlier. OUR VERDICT Reverting back to the original question of whether an iPad Pro could truly replace your Mac – it’s a hard question to answer, and we think it depends on a number of factors, from what you’d use the iPad Pro for, to your requirements for work. Are you a creative? Do you edit videos or photos on the fly? Or do you just want a bigger iPad for TV and gaming? Then you could probably ditch your MacBook and buy yourself an iPad Pro. However, if you rely on USB-powered accessories for every day life (like memory sticks), rely on software that isn’t available on an iPad or just need a “do it all” system, the MacBook Air seems to be the better option.

Both are slim, capable machines but with enough differences to make it a tough decision. At WWDC in June 2017, Apple updated the specs of both laptops. The new MacBook has Intel's 7th-gen Kaby Lake processors, but the MacBook Air still runs the Broadwell generation. The 12in MacBook is both smaller and lighter than the once “light as air” MacBook Air, which begs the question: which is the best lightweight laptop from Apple? In this article we will weigh up the pros and cons for both models, and look at the best upgrade options, and some alternatives that might suit your needs better. Read on for more detailed comparisons of Apple's newest lightweight laptops, specs, design and more. Read: New Retina MacBook release date, specs & UK pricing Also: Apple MacBook Air (mid 2017) review MacBook Air vs MacBook: Design, Dimensions and weight The MacBook comes in Silver, Gold, Rose Gold and Space Grey, just like the iPhone. Judging by the popularity of the Rose Gold iPhone, for some the fact that the MacBook is now in that hue will be reason enough to buy it. However, if you’d prefer a more muted colour the silver or grey options may appeal. Alternatively, the MacBook Air comes in just the traditional aluminium.  While the MacBook might sound like it should be bigger, with its 12in display, lengthwise it is smaller by almost 2cm. You may notice that the width of the 11in Air is slightly less, but it’s only 45mm different, less than half a cm, and unlikely to make a big difference to how easily you can fit the Mac laptop in your bag. The 12in MacBook measures 28.05cm by 19.65cm, and is 0.35-1.31cm thick. The 13in MacBook Air measures 32.5m by 22.7cm and is 0.3-1.7cm thick. The MacBook is lighter than the 13in MacBook Air, which weighs 1.35kg. The 12in MacBook is undoubtedly the most portable and lightweight MacBook ever made at 920g. Read: MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro review: 13in Mac laptop battle | 13 ways to use Force Touch on the new MacBook BUYING ADVICE: Design, Dimensions and weight If it’s the lightest and smallest Mac you are looking for, then get the MacBook. Just remember that the MacBook Air still gives you a bigger screen. When it comes to design, only the MacBook offers you a selection of colour choices and that may be a big part of the buying decision for some. If you aren’t keen on Rose Gold or Gold then there is the choice of Space Grey or Silver – but if it’s Silver you are going for, perhaps the Air will fulfil your needs. It may seem an obvious choice at this point, but there are a number of other factors involved in the decision, including the specs of the machine, the ports and other features on offer, read on to find out more. There is also the significant difference in price, with the MacBook Air starting at £949 and the MacBook starting at £1,249. That’s £300 more, so the MacBook justify its higher price? Read on. MacBook Air vs MacBook: Specs comparison  The MacBook Air offers a 1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor (capable of Turbo Boost to 3.2GHz) and comes with 8GB RAM and an integrated Intel HD Graphics 6000 graphics card. You'll have to pay £100 extra for 256GB compared to 128GB though. You can opt to upgrade at point of purchase to an i7 processor and up to 512GB SSD. That option costs £1,384. The 12in MacBook ships in two configurations. One features a 1.2GHz dual-core Intel Core m3 processor, which can Turbo Boost up to 3.2GHz. The other costs £300 more and offers a 1.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, which can Turbo Boost up to 3.2GHz. Both MacBooks offer 8GB RAM and Intel HD Graphics 615. If you want all the bells and whistles of an i7 processor, 512GB SSD and 16GB RAM it;ll cost you a whopping £1,864. The MacBook Air (above) is bigger and heavier than the MacBook, but only very slightly BUYING ADVICE: Specs comparison On the face of it the MacBook Air offers the best specs, with a faster processor, not just clock speed, but a Core i5 as opposed to a Core M at the base model level. Both offer 8GB RAM as standard. The main big difference is the fact that the MacBook ships with a 256GB flash drive, while the entry-level MacBook Air offers only 128GB. If it's specs you want for your money, then the MacBook Air is still better value. You'll get an i5 processor and 8GB RAM for £300 less than an m3 MacBook. If you only want 128GB storage, you can add an i7 processor for £135 and still spend nearly £200 less than the base MacBook. Wondering which Mac to buy? Read our best Mac buying guide MacBook Air vs MacBook: Processor comparison  Regarding that processor difference. How does the Core M stand up to the Core i5? The Core M is Intel’s newer generation of processors that run so cool that they can be fanless. Being fanless means that the computer in which they feature can be thinner and smaller than ever. That M in Core M stands for mobile, though, and these are processors destined for tablets and hybrid laptops, so don’t expect anything like the power of the Core i5. We'll have to wait till we get our hands on the machines for full benchmarks, but it's still safe to stay the MacBook Air is the better performer. That's not to say the 12in MacBook is a complete slouch; we have the 2016 version and rarely experience lag in everyday tasks, and the new 2017 model will be even quicker with the new Kaby Lake processor. However the full i5 processor rather than a mobile version in the MacBook Air is still more capable but hasn't benefitted from a Kaby Lake update - it's still on Broadwell. BUYING ADVICE: Processor comparison While the MacBook Air processor is faster than the MacBook in terms of clock speed there is some question of how big a difference that will make in real world testing. You don't want to edit video on the Core m3 MacBook, for example. If it’s a powerful laptop you are looking for you probably need to consider something other than the MacBook Air or MacBook. The MacBook Pro, which comes in 13in or 15in versions, offers a faster processor and when you consider the 13in models, there isn’t a big leap in price from the MacBook Air to the MacBook Pro. Read: MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro review: 13in Mac laptop battle. MacBook Air vs MacBook: Battery life   Apple went out of its way to fill every empty space in the MacBook with battery. The company describes how it used “every millimetre of space inside the slim MacBook enclosure.” Apple explains on its website how: “Traditional rectangular batteries leave unused space when placed in a curved enclosure, so we created a new type of battery technology that allowed for an innovative terraced battery cell, custom shaped to fit the specific contours of the enclosure.” As a result Apple has eked out 35 per cent more battery cell capacity than would have been possible without the innovation. Batteries actually sit on top of each other, as you can see in the below illustration. Apple claims the MacBook will offer a battery life of up to 10 hours. The 13in MacBook Air has more space in the chassis for battery - enough for 12 hours of battery life, it claims. The Air is certainly capable of even more than that from our experience, and is one of the industry leaders. Apple's MacBook batteries are layered in every available space BUYING ADVICE: Battery life  If you want to buy either of these computers and battery life is important to you, you will get more juice out of the MacBook Air. It's the kind of machine you can leave the house with without the charger. Confidence in the MacBook is slightly lower, though the latest generation will give more battery than previously. 10 hours is still impressive, but the results are less consistent.  MacBook Air vs MacBook: Screen & resolution    The biggest difference is the fact that the MacBook offers a Retina display. That display is LED-backlit display with IPS technology, and offers a 2304x1440 resolution at 226 pixels per inch, as well as support for millions of colours, and a 16:10 aspect ratio. The MacBook Air, on the other hand, offers 1440x900 resolution at 16:9 aspect ratio. The MacBook Air has attracted criticism for the quality of its screen, and the fact that the 16:9 aspect ratio means that the screen depth is much shallower – this matters to you if you want to see the maximum number of lines of a document on your laptop screen. Although it may suit those who watch widescreen movies as the 16:9 aspect ratio is suited to that kind of use.    The bezel around the edge is smaller on the 12in MacBook so you get more screen without having a bigger laptop.  BUYING ADVICE: Screen & resolution  The MacBook offers the superior display, both in terms of screen size and resolution. If it’s a good quality screen you need then the MacBook Air probably won’t cut the mustard. If you like to watch films on your laptop you may be thinking that the MacBook Air would be better with its 16:9 aspect ratio – but the quality of the display is poor in comparison so you probably wouldn’t benefit all that much. There are a couple of options if you are concerned about screen quality. Either plug your MacBook Air into an external screen when you are sat at your desk, or opt for the MacBook Pro with Retina display – at £999 the 13in entry-level model is still cheaper than the MacBook. It's not that the MacBook Air has a bad screen - but the MacBook's is better, if smaller. MacBook Air vs MacBook: Graphics     The MacBook sports the Intel HD Graphics 615 and supports dual display and video mirroring. It can support up to 3840x2160 pixels at 30Hz on an external display. The MacBook Air offers superior graphics: the Intel HD Graphics 6000 and supports dual display and video mirroring. It can support up to 2560x1600 pixels on an external display, less than the MacBook. The MacBook Air does offer Thunderbolt digital video output however. We've yet to test the latest MacBook Air, but we have tested previous generations extensively. When we ran the Batman: Arkham City benchmark test, the 2014 and 2015 MacBook Air models both averaged 29 frames per second in medium detail; and 24 fps in High detail. We haven't yet tested the latest MacBook's graphics, so we can’t comment on how good they are. However, like the Air, it seems unlikely that the graphics in the MacBook would be suitable for game play. BUYING ADVICE: Graphics    Both of these Macs have inferior graphics cards compared to the MacBook Pro, so if good graphics capabilities are necessary for you, you should consider opting for the MacBook Pro instead. However, of the two, the MacBook Air is still superior.  MacBook Air vs MacBook: Capacity      This is one area where the entry level MacBook Air lets itself down in comparison to the MacBook. The £949 MacBook Air ships with 128GB storage, while the entry level MacBook ships with twice the storage, 256GB, although it costs £1,249. £300 is a lot. For a better comparison, the £1,099 MacBook Air ships with 256GB, but that's still £150 less than the MacBook with the same storage. If you are looking for the most storage possible, the cheapest you can get a 512GB MacBook for is £1,549. To get that much storage in your MacBook Air you need to turn to the build to order options. To upgrade the base 128GB MacBook Air to a 512GB drive costs an extra £300, bringing the price to £1,249. That’s £300 less than the 512GB MacBook. BUYING ADVICE: Capacity    It's good that the base MacBook comes with 256GB where the MacBook Air only has 128GB, but the difference of £300 is a lot to justify if you're concerned about storage. Instead, you could opt for the base MacBook Air specced up to 256GB for £1,099.  In terms of storage, the MacBook Air represents better value. MacBook Air vs MacBook: Ports and input The most obvious difference between the MacBook and MacBook Air is the lack of ports on the former. The MacBook (in)famously features only a USB-C port and a headphone port. There isn’t even a Magsafe port for charging as charging is done through the USB-C which also supports USB 3.1 Gen 1 (up to 5 Gbps), Native DisplayPort 1.2 video output, VGA output using USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter (sold separately) and HDMI video output using USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter (sold separately). The USB-C port may support a lot of peripherals, with the necessary adaptor, but there is still only the one USB-C port available and for many that will not be enough. As for the MacBook Air, the 13in model features two USB 3 ports (5Gbps), one Thunderbolt 2 port (up to 20 Gbps), and a MagSafe 2 power port. You also get a SDXD card slot for transferring the photos taken on your camera. The MacBook Air has Bluetooth 4,0 whereas the MacBook has version 4.2. One thing that the MacBook features that the MacBook Air doesn’t is the Force Touch trackpad. This trackpad (which also features on the MacBook Pro) is sensitive to varying degrees of touch pressure: you can set it to respond to harder/deeper presses to activate different features. It also provides what is known as haptic feedback, a tangible, tactile response that in theory allows you to 'feel' what you are interacting with, which means that you feel like you are pressing the trackpad in when actually the pad isn’t moving at all. Read: The new MacBook doesn't deserve the criticism it's getting Also: Best USB Type-C accessories for the Retina MacBook The USB-C port on the MacBook can be used for charging or data transfer BUYING ADVICE: Ports and input If you have a laptop right now and you use all the ports all the time then you may not be able to cope with only one port on the MacBook. However, if your concern is that you won’t be able to use your external mouse or plug in a hard drive while charging your Mac you may be worrying unnecessarily. Adapters are available that will extend the port so that you can plug in more than one thing at a time. The question is whether the tradeoff in ports is enough to justify the smaller, thinner design of the MacBook. And whether you really like the Force Touch trackpad; try one in store.  MacBook Air vs MacBook: Price  This the big difference between the MacBook Air and the MacBook. The entry level MacBook price starts at £1,249 while the entry level MacBook Air is £300 cheaper at £749. The difference in price might be acceptable if the MacBook was more powerful, but you are not paying that extra £300 for a more powerful machine. What you get for the £300 is a better display and a smaller and lighter laptop. While we think the display on the MacBook Air would benefit from improvement, we think £300 is a high price to pay for what is essentially a better screen.  And at the end of the day you could just plug your MacBook Air into an external display which would likely cost you less than £300 (and you’d have the necessary port to do so). That said, the money for the MacBook gets you a better looking, lighter piece of tech. BUYING ADVICE: Price If you are looking for a cheap Mac option then the MacBook is simply not for you right now. It is one of the most expensive Mac laptops as well as being the least powerful. This is a laptop for those who are looking for a status symbol to write their emails and presentations on. If money is no object and you have a penchant for gold then by all means buy a MacBook, but if you just want the cheapest Mac laptop the MacBook Air is a better deal.   MacBook Air vs MacBook: Build to order options    You can get the MacBook with either 256GB or 512GB with build to order specs - a more power i5 or i7 processor and/or up to 16GB RAM.  There are build to order options on the MacBook Air, which gives you a lot more flexibility to design the Mac that best suits your needs. Moving to a Core i7 from i5 will cost you £135. You can also upgrade to 256GB for £150 or 512GB for £300 (that's steep).  BUYING ADVICE: Build to order options For now we’d recommend that if it’s a light laptop you are after you stick with the MacBook Air, upgrading it at point of sale to include the extra RAM and if you can afford it, the faster processor. Read: 8 laptops that rival Apple's new MacBook OUR VERDICT For now it’s clear that the MacBook Air offers the better deal in terms of specs, presuming that you are looking for a light laptop – if weight isn’t an issue then there are even better options in the MacBook Pro range. The MacBook is, for now at least, priced higher than many would think a lower specced machine should be. But the price does not reflect the specs of the MacBook, the price reflects the new technologies that have gone into the first generation of this newly resurrected Mac. Like the MacBook Air, which when it launched cost a lot more than the other Mac laptops, but eventually came down in price to be the entry-level Mac it is today, the MacBook price will come down over time. Eventually it may even replace the MacBook Air. There will, no doubt, be some people who can’t wait to own the MacBook, just as there were some who rushed out to buy that first generation MacBook Air. If you are one of them then we are sure you will enjoy the new machine. But if you’d prefer to wait for the next generation nobody will blame you.

We've got the beta up and running — here are the best goodies heading your way that Apple didn't mention. Apps are now label free in the dock. (Image: Gizmodo) Built-in screen recording Image: Screenshot Screen recording is useful for everything from sneakily capturing your friends' Snapchats to uploading tutorials to YouTube, and while it hasn't been too difficult to do on iOS in the past, with iOS 11 it's built right in — you no longer need a spare Mac with QuickTime. The new tool, called Screen Recorder, appears if you customise the shortcuts in the revamped Control Center via Settings. Tap the red button to start recording, and the title bar to stop recording, and then the video is saved to your camera roll as normal. Instant Wi-Fi sharing Just about everyone loves Wi-Fi, and iOS 11 is going to make it easier for you to share your wireless connectivity with friends and family, with no need to spell out passwords. However, you all need to be using iOS 11 devices for the trick to work, as 9to5Mac has found. The process needs to be initiated by someone turning up with an iOS 11 device that's not connected to the Wi-Fi — if that person tries to connect, then other iOS 11 devices already hooked up and close by get a prompt to share access (basically the Wi-Fi password). A one-handed keyboard Image: Screenshot iOS has now joined Android in offering a built-in one-handed mode for the default keyboard: It means if you've only got one hand free to tap out a message, then the keys become a bit easier to hit, especially if you're using one of the larger iPhones models. To find the option, press and hold on the globe or emoji icon to the left of the space bar, then choose the left or the right configuration. The arrow that appears in the blank space lets you return to the normal keyboard mode when you're back to two-handed operation. QR code scanning A bunch of early iOS 11 testers have noticed that the updated Camera app is going to come with the ability to read QR codes, just in case you come across any on your travels. The QR code reader in iOS 11 knows when it’s a WiFi network and offers to join. pic.twitter.com/pCHwGi1abF — Dayton Lowell (@daytonlowell) June 5, 2017 If you've never actually seen a QR code in the wild they're actually pretty useful. They can do stuff like give you access to Wi-Fi networks, share your contact details with someone else, send you to a particular website, or prove your ticket is valid for whatever gig you've shown up to. FLAC media playback One thing that has made the super music obsessive wary of iOS is the lack of FLAC support. FLAC, or Free Lossless Audio Codec, is an audio format that has zero compression. According to music lovers, compression can lead to loss of quality in music playback. You might miss the squeak of a finger across a guitar string or the lower registers of a bass drum. While Apple has maintained it's own lossless audio format, Apple Audio Lossless Codec, since 2004, the big majority of lossless music available is FLAC based. According to a savvy redditor iOS 11 now supports FLAC playback. It's still not available in iTunes or the music player specifically, but if you have any FLAC files hanging out on your iCloud drive you can simply tap to play them. App offloading Image: Screenshot Deleting apps that are gathering dust is useful for reclaiming storage space and generally keeping your iPhone or iPad running smoothly, but before iOS 11 appeared, deleting apps also meant erasing the settings and other related data for an app. Not so any more. If you go to iPhone Storage from the General menu in Settings, you can tap on an app then use a new feature called Offload App — this seems to delete everything but some key settings. Apple has also included an option to "offload" rarely used apps automatically. Extra app access to NFC As Engadget spotted, with iOS 11 Apple is opening up access to the NFC chip inside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, along with (presumably) future iPhones — for users that should mean more of their iOS apps able to tap into the wonders of Near Field Communication. Think mobile payments, but also hotel room access, or instant one-tap access to a Wi-Fi network (Android users have been playing around with NFC tags for years of course). In some cities you can even use NFC devices to pay your subway fare. It's difficult to say exactly how this new functionality will play out, but with Apple now embracing NFC it's definitely one to keep an eye on. Typed Siri queries Image: Screenshot A bunch of Siri upgrades are to be expected whenever a new iOS rolls around, but hidden away in the Accessibility menu under General in Settings for iOS 11 is a new Type to Siri option: When Siri is launched, you can type out your question rather than speaking. Obviously this is aimed at those who can't speak out commands normally, but it's handy for anyone who's in a quiet (or loud) space. By the way, you can already type commands into Siri in iOS 10, but you need to tap on a previous (spoken) query and then edit it. Restricting app location tracking Keeping tabs on your location is one of the most invasive permissions an app can ask for, even though a lot of them need it to function properly, and at the moment it's only possible to turn location tracking on or off for a particular app (or off altogether on iOS). In iOS 11 there's a new option which allows location tracking, but only while the app is being used, which means more privacy and more battery life for users. To take advantage of it, open the iOS Settings, select the app you want to deal with, then pick Location. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on June 9, 2017 01:23 PM Apple has once again unleashed a whole new collection of products during the opening ceremony of the WWDC 2017 event. Among the products released is the new iMac 2017 that now features the latest Kaby Lake processor from Intel. While these have been notoriously lacking in some aspects, Apple assured its consumer base that the new iMac 2017 has been improved from the ground up. New Intel processor Of course, an upgrade will not be complete without the proper processor from Intel. The previous iteration of the iMac used the Skylake processors. Now, iMac 2017s are equipped with the seventh generation Intel processor based on the Kaby Lake architecture. These new processors boasts a15-percent performance boost across the board. Furthermore, the new chip has native support for 4K video processing. Faster storage As with every iteration of iMacs, Apple tries to make the best of it in terms of storage. Although the basic model still features the spinning platter storage, users can still take advantage of faster solid state drive. This time around, Apple speed up the SSD technology by 50 percent and increased maximum storage size of 3TB. New iMac 2017 (via apple.com) Better and more powerful display For photographers and content creators, the iMac 2017’s new display is a welcomed treat. The new 4K and 5K displays are now 43 percent brighter than the previous model. And with Apple including 10-bit dithering into the mix, be ready to glimpse 1 billion colors from the impressive display. For media creators, such as 3D graphics, the new Radeon Pro 500 graphics cards will surely whet one’s appetite. The new on-board graphics is capable of handling just about anything that is thrown at it including five streams of 4K video on Final Cur Pro X. Virtual reality, finally The new iMac 2017 will be the first iMac to ever support virtual reality or VR. This is quite a good news especially for people who consume VR contents on a regular basis. As VR is getting more and more popular these days, it is just right that Apple includes this feature on the new iMac. In addition to a huge number of possible contents, the iMac 2017, along with Final Cut Pro X, will enable users to create 360-degree videos and cutting-edge VR contents easily. VR support on the new iMac (via apple.com) Upgradability For enthusiasts and people who want to save a few bucks, the iMac 2017, especially the 21.5-inch model, is once again upgradable. According to a recent teardown from iFixit, the small iMac 2017 sports a modular CPU and slots for SODIMM memory modules. Unfortunately, unlike the 27-inch model, upgrading the 21.5-inch version is not for the faint-hearted. Upgrading anything on the smaller iMac will still need a good amount of disassembly. Furthermore, doing it yourself will effectively void the device’s warranty. Nevertheless, for experienced iMac enthusiasts, this is surely a great news. As for the maximum size of memory, Apple still limits the RAM size for the 27-inch model to 32GB. However, as confirmed by OWC, the bigger iMac is indeed capable of supporting a maximum of 64GB of RAM. Thunderbolt 3.0 Thunderbolt 3.0 is finally supported on the iMac 2017. The good news is, Apple kept with the tradition of putting two high-speed ports on the new iMac. Consumers can connect as many as two 4K external display to both Thunderbolt 3.0 ports or one 5K display. In addition to external 4K and 5K display, Apple is also allowing users to attach third-party eGPU hardware to the iMac. Now that it features a faster Thunderbolt port, using an eGPU on a Mac is more exciting than ever. Gone are the days of bottle-necking and inefficient eGPU support for the iMac. Price Finally, there is the question of the price. For anyone using the older 21.5-inch 4K iMac, upgrading to the new version is a bit less painful on your pockets. Apple has given the said iMac a $200 price cut. Now, the smaller iMac 2017 is priced at only $1,299. Furthermore, its bigger brother can now be fetched for only $1,499. Data ports on the new iMac (via apple.com) Final verdict There are a lot of things to consider when it comes to upgrading to a new iMac. For one, the 2015 models are already Retina-ready and used quite impressive hardware inside. However, for those who want to experience VR on the iMac would need to upgrade to the new system. In addition to this, enthusiasts who like using eGPUs to improve their graphics handling performance will surely benefit from the iMac 2017’s Thunderbolt 3.0 ports. For those who feel that the AMD Radeon Pro 500 GPUs are still lacking, sticking in another GPU is as easy as inserting a cable to a port. A fast storage, especially for video editors, is very important. Upgrading to the new iMac will surely shorten your wait time when it comes to transferring videos for editing on your Mac. Again, for professional photographers, the new display will help make sure your images are true to their colors. The display’s increased brightness and wider colour gamut will ensure quality images every single time. As Apple has introduced some nice price reductions to both the 21.5-inch and 27-inch iMac 2017s, getting one is a bit less painful on your wallets. Selling your older unit and then toping it up for the new one is much easier than it will ever be. As an end note, if you are looking for an absolute beast of a machine, perhaps waiting until December for the iMac Pro is worth considering. For consumers who are price insensitive and is looking for the best iMac experience, the iMac Pro is the machine you are looking for.

From the company’s Twitter page, OnePlus posted a product launch announcement showing what its next flagship killer would look like. And from the looks of it, it does share some similarities with a more commonly known smartphone in the market. A closer inspection of the image that OnePlus posted on Twitter, it seems like the OnePlus 5 will resemble an iPhone 7 Plus in looks. The overall shape of the phone is quite similar to the said iPhone model down to the antenna traces at the top and bottom of the back case. In retrospect, is also shares the same looks as the OPPO R11 smartphone that was launched in China earlier this week. Even the two cameras share an astounding similarity to the iPhone 7 Plus. This is quite a bold move for OnePlus. This is mainly because Apple does not take kindly to anyone who copies its designs. Last year, Apple and Samsung were battling it out as the former accused the latter of copying patented designs. At the end of it, Samsung was ordered to pay more than half a million dollars as some sort of royalty. A continuous hard edge, refined over 3 years. https://t.co/KVXBWmhBt8 pic.twitter.com/KBNppQ0R0U — OnePlus (@oneplus) June 8, 2017 It will be quite interesting as to how Apple will react with the OnePlus 5. Although, this will not be the first time that an Apple product is copied by Chinese companies. Xiaomi has been at the forefront of copying Apple designs for several years in a row. Its own line of ultra-light laptops are modelled as close as possible to Apple MacBook line. Furthermore, Xiaomi has also released smartphones in China that share the same design features as previous iPhone models. The OnePlus 5 will be officially launch on June 20. At the moment, experts believe that the new flagship killer will be priced around $450 or more. The good news is, it is only a matter of days before OnePlus finally reveals just how much the OnePlus 5 will be. For more updates on the OnePlus 5, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

"The department of electronics and information technology (DeitY) is looking at this. They want alignment of duty structures on the mobile components which it proposes to make here. In the current PMP, Apple's plan is not fitting," PTI quoted an official. The report said that DeitY is discussing the matter component-wise with the Apple. To recall Apple had also asked for tax concessions, including lower import and manufacturing duties, and certain policy exemptions from the Government for setting up a manufacturing unit here in the country. The company also wants duty exemptions on the products to be bought from special economic zones (SEZs). Apple had informed the government this year in January that it is ready with a blueprint to begin manufacturing iPhones in India but wants fiscal concessions. However, Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has earlier said no in a reply to a question in Rajya Sabha on whether the government has accepted most of the demands of the iPhone manufacturer. According to IDC, Apple's move to start manufacturing in India comes at a time when its sales in China, the company's second-biggest market, are slowing. Meanwhile, India's smartphone market is rapidly expanding and is likely to overtake the US to become the second-largest in the world. Currently, most of Apple's products are assembled in China, primarily by Foxconn Technology Group. The company is also planning to set up 100 small stores under the franchise mode in the pilot phase.

The OnePlus family is about to get a plus-1. The Chinese phonemaker has announced that it will launch its newest phone, the OnePlus 5, on Tuesday, June 20. And yes, we're skipping right over the OnePlus 4 -- it's an unlucky number in China -- and going straight to 5.  The company has made a name for itself by making high-quality phones with the latest hardware, for much less money than the likes of Samsung and Apple typically charge. CNET called the OnePlus 3 "the best budget Android phone you can buy."  OnePlus habitually leaks its own news, and this time is no different. Since CEO Pete Lau posted a teaser picture on Weibo to announce that a new phone was in the works, the company has been dribbling out hints of what's to come. Taking a page from Apple's playbook -- and doing the exact opposite -- OnePlus seems to be both reveling in the speculation around the 5 and fueling it, tweeting out clues on an almost daily basis.  As to be expected, the internet has complemented all of that official and semiofficial content with a steady supply of unofficial leaks and renders. We're collecting the most promising and interesting below.  Specs rumored for the OnePlus 5: 5.5-inch display with 2,560x1,440-pixel QHD resolution Dual rear cameras (confirmed) 8-megapixel front camera Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor (confirmed) 6GB or 8GB of RAM 4G LTE multimode modem 3,600mAh battery Fingerprint scanner OxygenOS based on Android Starting at $449 (roughly £350 or AU$600) Launching June 20, 2017 OnePlus will unveil the new phone at a live online launch at 12 p.m. ET on Tuesday, June 20, to be followed by a series of "pop-up events" hosted in retail locations in the US and Europe. Early reports by the Verge and CNET that the phone would debut this summer were followed by speculation on phone nerd sites, which included purported event posters, that the reveal would come on June 15.  Will the real OnePlus 5 please stand up? More images show up every day. Are they real? Are they fake? We don't know -- OnePlus has declined to comment on their authenticity.  In May, Android Authority posted a photo of phone that looked awfully similar to the OnePlus 3T -- but with a vertical dual camera array -- that the site claimed was a OnePlus 5 protoype. More recently, Android Police published a different design with two rear cameras, that looks similar -- though not exactly the same -- to an image subsequently released by OnePlus.  Going full unicorn OnePlus has invited its 1 million Twitter followers to pick the color of the OnePlus 5. In a May tweet, the company offered up options such as black, red, gold and a green/blue/purple gradient that the company later referred to as "unicorn."   Serious hardware  We know for sure that the OnePlus 5 will have a Snapdragon 835 processor, because Qualcomm said so, and so did OnePlus CEO Pete Lau. It's Qualcomm's fastest chipset, which also powers the Samsung Galaxy S8. That means that the OnePlus 5 could be thinner than its current flagship phone, the 3T -- which kicked serious butt in our benchmark tests -- and deliver longer battery life and faster speeds when you navigate around and edit photos and video.  Ecommerce site Oppomart, which has a mixed track record of predicting specs, lists a handful of other possible components including 6GB of RAM, 64GB or 128GB of storage capacity, a fingerprint scanner and OnePlus's Android variant, OxygenOS.   Stepping up to dual lens OnePlus announced in a June 5 tweet that the 5 will come equipped with two rear cameras, confirming one of the more compelling rumors. A number of alleged pics posted online (Weibo, Slashleaks, Twitter) in recent weeks appeared to have a dual-lens array, and the specs posted to Oppomart included two 12-megapixel Sony camera sensors. The OnePlus 3T, for all of its considerable virtues, delivered photos and video that were just OK. The move to a dual-lens array gives OnePlus an opportunity to leapfrog competitors like Samsung, whose Galaxy S8 has just one rear camera.  In May, OnePlus announced a partnership with DxO, a photography software and accessories shop. The nature of the partnership remains unclear beyond a promise to "enhance your photography experience."   Price tag and release date Oppomart lists the price as $449 (approximately £350 or AU$600) and gives an estimated ship date of early June -- so take it all with a plus-sized grain of salt. But the OnePlus 3 and 3T combined premium design, features and performance with an accessible price tag, and we expect a similar deal from the OnePlus 5.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

The Financial Express FE Online SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Sex, lies & 3 Bengaluru murders everyone thought were suicides UK polls end in hung parliament Flipkart has come up with a Father's Day special sale and it is offering the Apple iPhone 6 (16GB model) with a massive 40 percent off on the e-commerce website. Apple iPhone 6 can now be purchased at a price of Rs 21,999 on the portal. This discount is really big if we consider the original price tag of Rs 36,990. Also, buyers can get another Rs 15,000 off if you buy the smartphone under the exchange offer. This offer is valid from June 8 to June 10. But is the Apple iPhone 6 deal worth it, in spite of the drop in price? Notably, the Apple iPhone 6 was being sold at Rs 24,990 for quite a while on Flipkart, so actually, the discount is not as dramatic as it appears to be. That being said, one should remember that it would be a fair deal to get a 4.7-inch iPhone for just a little more than Rs 20,000. This offer may not be available on any other phone for a while. So, if you are still confused about whether you should buy this iPhone as a gift for your father, there are few things you should know. Best deals on smartphones and other gadgets When it comes to performance and features, the Apple iPhone 6 has no major issues. The phone has Apple's A8 chip with the M8 Motion co-processor, 8-megapixel rear camera and a 1.2-megapixel selfie shooter and a 4.7-inch LCD IPS Retina Display. The total memory storage available on this phone is 16GB, which is not enough on an iPhone. But when it comes to software, Apple has said that the iPhone 6 will get support for iOS 11, which is the new OS that will launch in 2017, so that is one really good news. ALSO ON MSN: Nokia 6, Nokia 5, and Nokia 3: Here’s a look at the new phones Nokia 6, Nokia 5, and Nokia 3: Here’s a look at the new phones However, before you decide to hit buy, you should know that an Apple iPhone 6 with 32GB storage space available at Rs 25,999 on Flipkart, which is just Rs 4000 more than the 16GB version. This version of the phone also comes with Flipkart Assured next to it, which means the quality check has been done by the company. Once again this phone comes with up to Rs 15,000 off on Exchange, so you can get some more off on the price, depending on the kind of phone you are trading in. © image If you are bent on getting an iPhone for Rs 21,999, the iPhone SE is also retailing at Rs 21,999 on the website. This one comes with a smaller 4-inch display and might appeal to those who do not prefer big displays. Also, the iPhone SE comes with the new A9 processor and a higher 12MP camera. More importantly, there is 32GB onboard storage. Apple iPhone SE still comes with a 1.2MP front camera.

The 25 Best Time Travel Movies For the First Time, Apple Is Putting its iPhone Repair Boxes in Stores Like Best Buy A cultural shift for a company that's always valued secrecy. Most Popular Getty By David Grossman Jun 8, 2017 Reversing decades of policy, Apple has announced that it will place proprietary screen repair machines in hundreds of third-party locations by the end of 2017. Reuters reports that 400 authorized third-party repair centers in 25 countries will get the devices, internally known known as "Horizon Machines." The move comes as several states nationwide have pushed towards "right to repair" legislation, which promote the idea of greater access to third-party repairs for a number of machines, ranging from iPhones to John Deere tractors. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The California phone and computer powerhouse denies any influence from right to repair, although it has led lobbying efforts in several states attempting to halt such laws. Apple instead says the decision to expand Horizon Machine access is because of long lines at Apple stores, which previously have had exclusive access to the machines. Before this announcement, Apple has declined to acknowledge the existence of Horizon Machines. Most Popular "We've been on a quest to expand our reach," senior director of service operations Brian Naumann told Reuters. While iPhone repair kiosks appear in malls across America, serious damage, such as the fingerprint sensor breaking, can only be fixed through Horizon Machines. The company began developing repair strategies for the phone shortly after it was released in 2007 and analysts estimate the company makes upward of $2 billion on repairs for all devices. Apple allowed Reuters a look at the machines, which the news service describes as "gray metal boxes the size of a microwave with a swing-out windowed door, vary slightly in shape depending on the model of iPhone they repair." The news service goes to say that In a smaller training room, a technician laid out the tools Apple uses to fix iPhone screens: special screwdrivers for the iPhone's five- and three-lobed screws, a custom suction-cup for loosening the screen without tearing the delicate ribbon cables behind it, and a press to squeeze iPhone 7s to ensure waterproofing. Once the new screen is mounted, the iPhone goes into the Horizon Machine, which allows Apple's software to communicate with the fresh hardware. Over the course of 10 to 12 minutes, the machine talks to the phone's operating system to pair the fingerprint sensor to the phone's brain. While that unfolds, a mechanical finger jabs the screen in multiple places to test the touch-sensitive surface. The machine also fine tunes the display and software to match the precise colors and calibration of the original. "We design for a customer experience that exceeds anything our competitors try to do," says Naumann, Apple's service chief. "We endeavor to make it right at the same standard as when the customer bought the product." The company plans to roll out the machines to Best Buys, starting with one in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Soon, one will be coming to a Best Buy near the company's northern California home in Sunnyvale, California Source: Reuters via The Verge More from Popular Mechanics: More From Best New Gadgets GIF Best New Gadgets Share MIT's Robot Furniture Can Rearrange Apartments With a Simple Command Best New Gadgets Share IBM's Fingernail-Sized Semiconductors Pack in 30 Billion Switches Best New Gadgets Share Things Come Apart: Air Conditioner Best New Gadgets Share HomePod, iOS 11, High Sierra, and More: All the Key Announcements From Apple's Big Event GIF Best New Gadgets Share Take a Quick, Blinding Tour of a $25 Million Broadcast Truck Best New Gadgets Share Keep an Eye on Your Stuff With This Panoramic Wi-Fi Security Camera GIF Best New Gadgets Share ReMarkable Hands-On: This E Ink Tablet Gives Paper a Run for Its Money Best New Gadgets Share An Anti-AI Wearable for Our Cyberpunk Future Best New Gadgets Share Why Won't Anyone Fix What Is Actually Wrong With Phones?

The iPhone 8 this fall will almost certainly be the first device to ship with iOS 11, and now a new set of renders imagine the upcoming flagship device running Apple’s latest operating system. Furthermore, the report adds a few additional detail about the iPhone 8… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover Today’s report out of iDropNews claims that the upcoming iPhone 8 will feature a nearly bezel-less front design with a cutout at the top for the ear speaker and front-facing camera. This is contrary to some reports that had claimed the front-facing camera would be behind the display. Furthermore, the report claims the front of the device will feature a “laser and infrared sensor” in conjunction with the front-facing “3D dual-camera lens system” to add support for facial and iris recognition.  The biggest question about the iPhone 8 continues to be the location of Touch ID. Some reports and renders have imagined the device with rear Touch ID, while others have claimed the technology will be implemented directly beneath the OLED display. Today’s report suggests the following, claiming that the iPhone 8 model Apple has chosen to move forward with “will feature Touch ID technology built into the front-facing glass. Today’s report also adds that the iPhone 8 will have a “large pad on the inside” to enable wireless charging, something that will be possible thanks to its all glass design. As many other sources have claimed, the report says the iPhone 8 will feature a vertical dual-camera setup for augmented reality capabilities, which has further been corroborated with Apple’s ARKit. As with almost any iPhone 8 report, today’s piece should be taken with a grain of salt. While some things seem nearly all-but-confimred at this point, we still hear conflicting reports on a regular basis, especially for factors such as the location of Touch ID. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see iOS 11 running on what could be the iPhone 8 design. Much of iOS 11 feels optimized for OLED and a bezel-less design, so check out the renders below for an idea of what that could look like. Let us know what you think of this design paired with iOS 11 in the comments. Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Tom Krisher. Updated June 7, 2017 9:33AM SHARE ALSO SEE Automotive Uber Waymo Travis Kalanick Social Media Twitter Sexual Harassment Uber, the world's leading ride-hailing company, has taken two big steps toward repairing its corporate image: It fired 20 employees for a host of harassment problems and hired an Apple marketing executive to rescue its tainted brand. Those fired for sexual harassment as well as bullying, discrimination and other behavior that violated company policies included both managers and lower-level workers. Some had retaliated against other employees after they complained about bad conduct, said Bobbie Wilson, a partner at the Perkins Coie law firm, which did the investigation. Separately, Uber announced Tuesday that it had hired Apple marketing executive Bozoma Saint John, who will be Uber's chief brand officer. She ran global consumer marketing of Apple Music and iTunes. Her task at Uber will be to improve its brand image so people like it as well as they like the company's ride services, an Uber spokeswoman said. "Boz has a long track record of successfully creating emotional connections between people and the products they love," Uber CEO Travis Kalanick [pictured here] said in a statement. More action could come next week when a report on Uber's culture by former Attorney General Eric Holder is likely to be made public. He is supposed to make broader recommendations on how to change Uber's culture. During Uber's ascent to becoming the world's most valuable startup, the San Francisco-based company took Silicon Valley's penchant for sexism, for cutthroat, unapologetic competition and distaste for government regulation and kicked it up several notches. For a while, this worked well, pushing Uber's valuation to nearly $70 billion. But this year, Uber's aggressive corporate culture and 40-year-old Kalanick's self-admitted need to "fundamentally change and grow up" has caught up with it. In addition to the sexual harassment allegations, Uber is the target of lawsuits, boycott threats and a federal investigation into claims that it has used a fake version of its app to thwart authorities. It's also been accused of corporate espionage by Waymo, formerly Google's autonomous vehicle arm. Uber's former chief autonomous car researcher took confidential documents from Waymo before his startup firm was purchased by Uber, according to a Waymo lawsuit. Uber also is searching for a chief operating officer and chief financial officer as it prepares for a possible public stock offering. Uber Technologies Inc. retained Perkins Coie after former engineer Susan Fowler posted a blog in February about sex harassment at the company. Fowler wrote that on her first day at work her boss propositioned her in a series of messages and superiors ignored her complaints. After the posting, Uber set up a 24-hour hotline to take complaints from employees, and hired Perkins Coie to investigate them. The firm checked into 215 complaints, and 57 remain under investigation. The hotline will remain in operation. The probe into Fowler's complaints is still underway, and Wilson wouldn't say if any of those fired, or 31 other employees placed in counseling, were involved in that. Wilson said Uber gave her law firm "unfettered access" to people and documents that were needed for the Fowler investigation. Problems at Uber are not unusual in the technology industry, given the company's size of more than 14,000 employees, said Wilson, whose firm has done similar work for the biggest tech companies in the nation. © 2017 Associated Press syndicated under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Chinese officials have now arrested 22 Apple distributors after discovering that they were selling off sensitive user data they found on a secure Apple database. The crooks apparently collected over $7.3 million (over 50 million yuan) from selling the information before being caught.  Don't Miss: New leak claims to reveal final iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s Plus designs The thieves reportedly accessed the internal Apple database and collected user information that included Apple IDs, names, and phone numbers of users. They then sold that information to obviously sketchy buyers for as little as $1.50, or as much as $26. As the sales piled up, the distributors made millions upon millions, and it remains unclear exactly how much user data has fallen into the wrong hands. The distributors — who were apparently third party sellers, but still had access to at least some level of Apple’s internal server hierarchy — were busted after a months-long investigation by Chinese officials, which is still ongoing. Apple has had a rather rocky relationship with China as a whole. The company finally truly broke into the Chinese market in 2014 when China Mobile finally got on board with Apple and offered the iPhone 5s and 5c. In the months that followed, Chinese government officials repeatedly accused Apple of “spying” on Chinese customers, and the company has gotten plenty of pushback at various levels of the government there. Still, the iPhone remains a hugely popular device in the country.

Among them: the HomePod smart speaker (see "Apple Is Countering Amazon and Google with a Siri-Enabled Speaker") and new ways developers can build artificial intelligence into apps. By Thursday morning, the Apple CEO was on the other coast, sitting on a gray couch next to a yellow emoji pillow (a happy face) at the MIT Media Lab’s Affective Computing Group listening to Rosalind Picard talk about depression. Cook, who will give this year’s MIT commencement address, is spending the day before learning more about research on campus, much of it involving sensors and AI. Picard, an expert in using wearable devices and phone data to measure human emotions, is researching how data pulled from cell phones might help identify and perhaps even predict depression, a problem expected to be the second leading cause of disability in the world by 2020.    A graduate student in the Laboratory for Social Machines at the MIT Media Lab explains his research to Apple CEO Tim Cook. In time, Picard hopes to be able to predict when a person will become vulnerable to depression even before they get there. “We want to not just recognize, but try to forecast it,” she tells Cook. As our phones become smarter about our behavior, they could play an important role in helping us track and understand ourselves, and our future behavior.   One way can be by leveraging artificial intelligence, and though Apple is often termed a laggard on AI when compared to companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, Cook argues that machine learning is already well integrated into iPhones. Related Story What If Apple Is Wrong? Phones that lock away everything they hold could inhibit law enforcement more than we really want. In an interview with MIT Technology Review conducted a few hours after the meeting with Picard, Cook ticks off a list: image recognition in our photos, for example, or the way Apple Music learns from what we have been listening to and adjusts its recommendations accordingly. Even the iPhone battery lasts longer now because the phone’s power management system uses machine learning to study our usage and adjust accordingly, he says. Cook says the fact that the press doesn’t always give Apple credit for its AI may be due to the fact that Apple only likes to talk about the features of products it is ready to ship, while many others “sell futures.” Says Cook: “We are not going to go through things we’re going to do in 2019, '20, '21. It’s not because we don’t know that. It’s because we don’t want to talk about that.” While he calls AI “profound” and increasingly capable of doing unbelievable things, on matters that require judgment he’s not comfortable with automating the human entirely out of the equation. “When technological advancement can go up so exponentially I do think there’s a risk of losing sight of the fact that tech should serve humanity, not the other way around.”  Part of that perspective, for Cook, continues to be keeping an eye on what iPhone data Apple should be able to access, and what is too personal, something that became an issue in its high profile refusal last year to unlock iPhones at the behest of law enforcement (see "What If Apple is Wrong?"). Related Story Apple Is Countering Amazon and Google with a Siri-Enabled Speaker Oddly, though, Apple is emphasizing HomePod’s musical skills rather than all-around smarts. Picard’s lab doesn’t use Apple phones for its research today, though she tells Cook she would like to. For their current study of student emotional health, her team can’t get certain data from an iPhone that they need. For instance, who the user is calling and texting, something the researchers use (with study participants' permission) to build an understanding of the students' social activities. Apple does have a platform for mobile health research and development called HealthKit, but even exploring that, they haven’t been able to make it work, Picard says. Before the discussion is done, Cook has taken his red chrome iPhone from his pocket to make a note to himself to inquire about that internally.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Benjamin Geskin A new iPhone 8 case leak shows us a very different design Chris Smith @chris_writes June 8th, 2017 at 10:04 PM Share Tweet No smartphone gets as much attention as the iPhone, and the iPhone 8 buzz seems to be at even higher levels than you’d expect. That’s because Apple will introduce a brand new iPhone design this year, after sticking with the same tried and tested iPhone design for three iPhone generations. A new iPhone 8 render tells us what the iPhone 8 might look like, according to a case maker. Don't Miss: New leak claims to reveal final iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s Plus designs It’s pretty common to see accessory makers leak design renders featuring their upcoming creations. But we have no way of knowing whether they have real evidence to back up their designs, or if they’re just using the leaked sketches and available rumors to come up with iPhone 8 cases. Image Source: SlashLeaks The same goes for the clear case in these images. Posted on SlashLeaks, the renders show an iPhone 8 design that we expect from Apple. The screen is likely wrong considering that Apple isn’t expected to stretch the display over the edges like Samsung does. Moreover, the top and bottom bezels are bigger than expected, at least considering the many alleged sketches we’ve seen so far. Image Source: SlashLeaks But what really matters here is the actual design of the case. The protective design features an opening that would fit a vertical dual lens camera on the back, and all the expected physical buttons that you’d expect on an iPhone, including a mute switch, two volume rockers, and a standby button. The latter is slightly taller than previous power button designs, which also fits with earlier rumors. What’s also worth noticing is the absence of an opening on the back of the case that would fit a rear-facing Touch ID sensor. If this case maker has accurate information, then it means the iPhone 8 won’t have a fingerprint sensor on the back. Image Source: SlashLeaks Finally, there’s also one puzzling element in all this. The SIM tray opening seems to be missing. The future is certainly bright, but we’re far from seeing Apple launch an iPhone that will work with eSIMs instead of physical ones.

Nick Whighamnews.com.au@NWWHIGHAM news.com.au June 9, 201712:18pm Apple's limited edition sneakers are going to auction. HOW much would you pay to dress like Steve Jobs? You just need a black turtleneck, jeans and to tie it all together a pair of limited edition Apple sneakers. Fortunately if you’ve got some spare cash the latter just happens to be going to auction with the bidding starting at $19,900 ($US15,000). But you’ve got to have deep pockets because the rare shoes are expected to potentially fetch as much as $48,000. The prototype sneakers were made in early 1990s, a few years after Apple brought out its first colour desktop computer. The all white sneakers made by apparel brand Adidas feature the tech company’s iconic rainbow logo. In the late 1980s and early 1990s Apple sought to cash in on the cult like devotion of its customers and produced a slew of groovy garments oozing with the requisite 80s-style kitsch of the time. But the Apple sneakers are particularly rare because they never left the prototype stage and were reportedly only made available to employees. The pair going up for auction has a mysterious history but are said to have turned up at a garage sale in San Francisco. A pair of the sneakers had previously sold on eBay for $105 in 2007. Apple's limited edition sneakers are going to auction.Source:Supplied They were reportedly found by a friend of Leon Benrimon, the director of Texas-based auction house Heritage Auctions which is putting the shoes up for sale. “These sneakers are truly unique and have rarely been seen or photographed,” he told Business Insider. “It’s a true collectable for the tech community.” He expects they will go for at least $39,0000 ($US30,000) but thinks they could fetch much more. And judging by past auctions of rare Apple items, he’s probably right. Last year, a private vendor sold a leather jack worn by Steve Jobs for a cool US$22,400. While in 2015 a private high school in the US sold three business cards belonging to Steve Jobs — from his times at Apple, Next and Pixar — for more than $US10,000 after 47 bids. Heritage Auctions will be selling the rare Apple collectable sneakers alongside other vintage shoes, skateboards and surfboards in an auction dubbed “The Future is Now” on June 11. These rare Apple shoes are expected to fetch a pretty penny.Source:imgur Share on Facebook Tweet this story Send in email Jump back to top trending in technology 1310 Foxtel Now: Why I am cancelling Netflix 616 Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne forecast: Rain ‘increasing in in... 295 Arachnophobia: How to kill spider phobia in just five minute... 193 Uber boss’ weird sex rules for staff 183 Finkel report: Coal-fired power in Australia will decline e... 121 Westpac email scam 2017: Don’t fall for it 101 Apple employee sneakers from 1990s to sell at auction 46 Uber: NFL player Shareece Wright takes 858km ride to make tr... 58 Apple staff in China busted selling off private customer dat... 43 Einstein’s general theory of relativity: ‘Gravitational lens...

Ella CeronJun 8, 2017 10:24PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestGary Miller In the past, if you wanted to listen to a Taylor Swift song, you had a few very limited options: Open up an Apple Music account, as that was the only streaming service to feature Taylor's complete discography for two years. Own physical copies of Taylor's albums, or pay for digital copies in full. Watch Taylor's music videos in a different tab on your internet browser while going on with your day. Listen to songs that Taylor was featured on, like Zayn's "I Don't Wanna Live Forever" on repeat. But if you wanted to listen to a song like "Red" or "22" on another streaming platform, you were out of luck. She'd pulled her songs from platforms like Spotify after writing an open letter to Apple Music about its policy for paying artists fairly. "These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child," she wrote when it was reported that Apple Music wouldn't pay artists for streams accrued during a user's three-month free trial. "These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer, and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much. We simply do not respect this particular call." (Apple quickly changed their policy, making way for commercials like Taylor's impression of Drake while at the gym, and Drake's returning of the favor.) Fast forward to two years later, and Taylor's entire discography is officially back. Her official fan account tweeted the announcement, noting that it was in honor of 1989 selling over 10 million albums, and Taylor's songs hitting the 100 million songs mark from the RIAA. So the next time you need to scream-yell "We are never, ever, ever getting back together" or "Welcome to New York!" you can do so, regardless of your preferred streaming platform. The Tay is yours once more. https://twitter.com/taylornation13/status/872958066119016448 Related: Fans Think Taylor Swift Is About to Be a Bridesmaid in the ULTIMATE Wedding follow us Facebook Twitter Pinterest Recommended for You Follow:FacebookTwitterInstagramPinterestWe Heart ItTumblrYouTubeGoogle Plustoggle social menu Condé Nast Condé Nast Websites Allure Ars Technica Backchannel Bon Appétit Brides Condé Nast Traveler Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ GQ Style Pitchfork Self Style Teen Vogue The New Yorker The Scene Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Site MapContact usNewsletter SignupSubscriptionsIn this issue CareersCondé Nast StoreReprints/PermissionsParsons x TeenVogue Accessibility Help Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy (Revised 1/2/2014).  Teen Vogue may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.  Your California Privacy Rights.

This meant that users would be able to buy RAM upgrades at cheaper price points than what Apple was offering. That changed with the newer iMacs, but it seems that Apple could have a change of heart. At WWDC 2017, Apple unveiled upgraded 21.5-inch 4K iMac models, which on the surface wasn’t too exciting. However thanks to the folks at iFixit, they have discovered in their teardown of the computer that this particular iMac is the most upgradeable iMac in recent times. According to iFixit, they note that while accessing the innards of the computer isn’t particularly easy, but not impossible. “Again, this isn’t the most accessible thing in the world—it’s flipped onto the backside of the logic board, trapped behind a lot of other components, and buried under a glued-down pane of glass—but for the first time in years it’s possible to replace or upgrade the CPU without a reflow station, and that’s a big win.” It still isn’t quite the same as older iMacs where upgrading the RAM was pretty much a plug-and-play situation, but it should make it easier for repair stores, so if you wanted an iMac that could be upgraded, perhaps the 2017 21.5-inch 4K iMac could be for you.

The presentation detailed what users can pretty much expect in the next software update, and at first glance, the features are looking to be incredible. Let’s take a look at some of the best not-so-major features announced. Wi-Fi Sharing Ever forgot your home’s Wi-Fi password? You’re not alone. It’s a problem when you have a new device or you have guests over that want to connect to your network. This situation is apparently so widespread that Apple decided to make a fix. Per CNET, the company’s solution is simple: you can approve any smartphone or laptop via your iOS device. You will receive a notification whenever someone is trying to join your home network, and you have the option to send the device the password. The Volume Box Until the latest iOS version, we’ve had to suffer from the volume box that’s too in-your-face when summoned. Adjusting the volume or turning the ringer on/off makes the box appear that is large enough to block a huge chunk of the screen. This can be annoying, but thankfully, Apple has redesigned it. Instead of a square box appearing in the middle of your screen, the volume HUD is now much smaller and tucked in the corner. The now more inconspicuous volume HUD is both more aesthetically pleasing and more logical; why Apple just now realized it is a mystery. The biggest change in iOS 11. That nobody has mentioned. The volume indicator no longer obstructs the center of the screen obnoxiously. pic.twitter.com/tE3F4qvkVT — Devon T. (@Turqmelon) June 6, 2017 Screen Recording Apple finally decides to have a built-in screen recorder in iOS, which eliminates the need to pay for a third-party app or make the effort to use QuickTime on a Mac. You can set up a shortcut for the feature on the Control Center so you can simply swipe up and tap the button to start recording, according to 9to5 Mac. This allows the users to record tutorials, bugs, or content that they want to share with family members, friends, or even their followers. However, it doesn’t record the sound from apps. It does record from the microphone by doing an extra step so there will still be some sound but not as clear. Do Not Disturb While Driving [Image by Apple] The increase in car accidents is party attributed to the increase of humans who can’t look away at their phones for one second. It’s even harder to ignore your device when it is buzzing with notifications from your group chat, calls from your wife, and emails from your boss. Now you can focus on the road with iOS 11’s new feature. Aptly called “Do Not Disturb While Driving,” the feature takes over the phone when it is connected to the car via Bluetooth or cable and when it detects you’re in a moving car. You will not receive alerts or notifications during, and your iOS 11 device can even reply to your messages with an automated response. The phone’s functions will also be limited if the feature is active. Most apps will be unusable, though Apple Maps can still be accessed. One-Handed Keyboard Phones are getting larger and typing with one hand is becoming harder. If you don’t have the iPhone SE, chances are you can’t easily type on your iPhone with one hand. With iOS 11, you can now have the whole keyboard move closer to your thumb by pressing and holding the emoji icon. Just discovered this keyboard settings on iOS 11. Perfect if you normally write with one hand. ???? pic.twitter.com/h2s5qn04cx — Enric Enrich @ WWDC (@enricenrich) June 8, 2017 These are only some of the new features that iOS 11 will introduce come fall. The software update will also be introducing bigger features such as a revamped Control Center, a new interface for the iPad, AR experiences, and more. As of the moment, developers can download iOS 11 into their devices. A beta will come to the public next month.

This is its second version under the new nomenclature, macOS. Last year, Apple made the switch from OS X to macOS, much to our surprise (not really). Why High Sierra? High Sierra is technically a minor update to macOS Sierra, though the new features are pretty amazing. So the idea is that Apple went higher with its already great Sierra operating system. When can I get my hands on it? macOS 10.13 High Sierra is available for developers right now. The public beta will be available in late June as Apple ramps up for its traditional fall events, which usually mark the official launch of software. If you're not a developer, and don't want to risk testing the public beta, you'll be able to download it for free this fall. If you plan on downloading the developer or public beta, be smart about it: If you only have a single Mac, make sure you create a partition to run beta software, or install on a secondary Mac you don't rely on for everyday use. How do I upgrade to macOS 10.13 High Sierra? Apple makes it really easy to upgrade to new versions of its operating system across all devices. If you're unsure how to get the latest software upgrade, we have you covered with a comprehensive guide. How to upgrade your Mac software My Mac is old, can I upgrade to macOS High Sierra? The latest Mac operating system will run on the following devices: iMac (Late 2009 & later) MacBook Air (2010 or newer) MacBook (Late 2009 or newer) Mac mini (2010 or newer) MacBook Pro (2010 or newer) Mac Pro (2010 or newer) Will there be any features that won't work on my older Mac that is listed as compatible with macOS High Sierra? Similar to El Capitan and Sierra, if your Mac was built prior to 2012, you won't be able to take advantage of the Metal Graphics framework and many of the Continuity features, but the rest of macOS High Sierra should be just fine. How much is this new software going to cost me? Nothing! Apple stopped charging for software upgrades quite a few years back. macOS High Sierra is a free update for all iMac, Mac mini, and Mac laptop computers that are compatible. OK, so what are the new features coming to macOS High Sierra? The short answer is HEVC support, APFS support, better graphics, VR support, and some fantastic app improvements. The long answer is below. Read on for details. What the heck is HEVC? HEVC stands for High Efficiency Video Coding. It's also known as H.265. It's a new standard for video compression that is about 40% better than the current H.264 standard. It compresses 4K video much faster and more efficiently and improves video bit-stream. It also uses less bandwidth so you can stream higher quality video in places where your internet speeds are lower. Video file sizes are much smaller, and so take up less storage space on your Mac. Basically, HEVC is way better than H.264 for video compression and you're going to love how fast you can stream 4K movies without any lag. Why is Apple File System such a big deal? Every computer uses some form of file system. Imagine your Mac has a filing cabinet that a little guy goes to every time you open a file or search for something. Let's call him "Apple." Apple's current file system, Hierarchical File System Plus (HFS+), works great, but he came up with his organization system more than 30 years ago. Even though he updated it about 20 years ago, he didn't actually clear everything out and start fresh. He just made some changes so he could file stuff faster and find stuff easier. Fast-forward to today, where Apple has designed a new way to organize and keep track of everything in your Mac. He got a new filing cabinet, better locks, and even added filing cabinets for your iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. He also got those file folders that can be adjusted wider so he can fit more files in each one, and changed the paper weight of current files so they are thinner and more of them can fit into a folder. What this means for you is that you'll be able to access and load your files much faster, encryption will be much stronger, duplicating files will happen in a blink of an eye (even large video files), and you'll have protection from crashes thanks to metadata copying. Basically, it's going to make your Mac feel brand new again, and if your Mac already is brand new, it's going to make it feel like you just installed a turbo engine. So, better graphics? That's correct. Apple has suped up the Metal graphics processor by adding machine learning, external GPU support, and virtual reality. Metal 2 focuses on GPU support over CPU, so things will load and process faster — up to 10 times faster, according to Apple. This is great news for game developers and might (hope, hope) open the door for more PC games to make their way to Mac in the future. macOS High Sierra will support external GPUs, too. So even your baseline MacBook will be able to support heavy graphics programs in the future. Wait ... Did you say VR support? Oh, yeah. The Metal 2 framework will make it possible for developers to create virtual reality games and macOS High Sierra will make playing virtual reality games on Mac a reality. The iMac with 5K Retina display and the iMac Pro will natively support VR. Plus, thanks to macOS High Sierra, you'll be able to add an external GPU seamlessly and play VR games. Valve has even decided to add SteamVR to the Mac. What about the apps? Did Apple update any apps? It sure did. Apple added some nice improvements to Photos, Safari, and Mail. There are also some pretty sweet additions to Notes, FaceTime, Siri, and iCloud. Read on to find out more. Photos Photos has a few redesign features, a couple of great new filters, some cool editing tools, and looping Live Photos. Expanded sidebar - The sidebar is now always on to make searching for your photos a lot easier. The photo Import view shows all of your past imports in chronological order, similar to your standard Photos collection. Better organization - You can filter photos by different criteria. There is a selection counter that will let you drag and drop multiple images into an album or import them to your desktop. Better editing tools - You'll be able to adjust the contrast and color options for your photos just a little bit better with Curves for fine-tuning and Selective Color for saturation. Oh, and there are more photo filters now. More Memories categories- You'll get more automatically generated Memories based on different criteria. For example, you'll get beautiful slideshows from your first anniversary, or scroll through pics of your pets. Live Photos Extreme - Live Photos have been super charged with editable Loops, Bounce, Long Exposure (my favorite), trim, and mute. You can even select a key photo for each Live Photo, which will be the single non-moving image people will see before they touch the photo to watch it move. Better third-party app support- Third-party apps are better integrated with Photos in macOS High Sierra. You can select a photo, open it in a third-party app, and make your edits. Those changes will automatically be saved in Photos. You won't have to re-save new edits. App extension support has also gotten bigger with more apps. Bigger faces - The People album has larger thumbnail images for faces and group pictures better. If you're signed into iCloud Photo Library, your People changes will update across all of your connected devices. Safari Safari's biggest update is with Intelligent Tracking Prevention. It uses machine learning to find cookie trackers and stop them from following you from one website to another. So, you won't be as likely to see an add on one website for a product you just looked at on another website. Safari in macOS High Sierra also implements an autoplay auto-block tool. Basically, if you visit a website that has an add or video that is set up to automatically blast you with noise, it won't play automatically on Safari. Blocked! Speaking of blocked, Safari in macOS High Sierra lets you personalize what your browsing experience looks like with each website you visit. You can enable Reader View, content blockers, page zoom, and auto-play blocking. It's in the same section that used to house Reader View. Oh, and Safari is even faster than ever before. Zoom, zoom! Mail When you search in Mail in macOS High Sierra, the most relevant results will appear as "Top Hits" so you can find what you're looking for faster. You can also use split-view when composing mail. Productivity increased! Siri improvements Apple gave Siri a boost in macOS High Sierra with a more expressive voice. It has better tone and talks more realistic. Personally, I like it when Siri tells a joke in a super robotic voice. I think it's funnier. Siri is also able to learn about your music interests by connecting to Apple Music. You can ask to "play something to help me relax" or "make me a party playlist" and it will play songs based on your previous Apple Music activity. In macOS High Sierra, Siri also knows a lot more about the music you're listening to. Sharing in iCloud When you save a file in iCloud Drive, you can share it with others, just like you do in the Notes app. Using the Share tool, you can send people an invitation to edit and everyone that's using the supported app can collaborate in real time. Apple has also added iCloud Family Sharing, which means you can invite family members to share your iCloud storage instead of everyone having their own account. iCloud Family storage plans include 200GB or 2TB of storage, so you can load up all of your photos, videos, and more. Search for flight info with Spotlight When you enter your flight number into Spotlight, it will search your system for all the information you need to get there on time, including arrival and departure times, terminals, gates, delays, and airport maps. In macOS High Sierra, Spotlight also supports constellation information, celebrity facts, and lots of Wikipedia results for those really elusive bits of knowledge. Notes If you use a particular not a lot, you'll be able to pin it to the top of your list so it doesn't get lost in the mix every time you update another note. Keep it at the top and it'll stay there, right were you left it. Notes also gets tables in macOS High Sierra. It's sort of like a mini spreadsheet for keeping track of things like expenses, party invitees, and wedding plans. FaceTime Live Photos Have you every had a moment when you're FaceTiming with your family when someone does something so cute or so funny that you wish you could have captured it? Well, now you can. In macOS High Sierra, you'll be able to take Live Photos of the FaceTime window, and this is on the Mac, which will automatically save to the Photos app. And, before you think about taking a Live Photo without your dad knowing, you'll both get a notification when one is taken. Messages in iCloud That's right. Your chats, those ones you don't want to delete because they hold a special place in your heart, will no longer disappear if you download a fresh copy of an operating system. All of your Messages will be stored (encrypted on both ends) in iCloud. So, when you start using a new device, your chats with mom from a year ago will still be there. The bottom line Though macOS High Sierra doesn't seem like much on the surface, the under-the-hood improvements are huge. With advanced file systems, better graphics and video compression, and support for VR, your Mac is really finding its stride. If you have any questions or comments, please put them in the comments and we'll try to answer them as best we can, as we learn more about macOS High Sierra.

As Craig noted during the interview with Gruber last night, that team is very proud and highly motivated to produce a superior product. These two changes -- and the speed improvements -- should provide strong motivation for Mac users to stay with or switch back to Safari: "And so we thought we'd bring some knowledge! And it's all true, man. I mean, that team is unbelievably obsessive about performance. They're absolutely the best in the industry. The Safari team rules, the WebKit team, the combination of them, they build the fastest browser on the planet, and honestly, I'm getting sick of people not giving them their due!" Better performance, better privacy, better silence, and punching a well-deserved hole in Google's revenue model. Who could ask for more?

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues macOS High Sierra: Features, release info, system requirements and more Macworld Australia Staff 9 June, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News The next version of Apple’s operating system for the Mac is called macOS High Sierra. While the OS is mostly about software refinements, it also lays the foundation for future innovations in the worlds of VR (virtual reality) and AR (augmented reality). You can learn more by taking a look at our favourite High Sierra features listed below. That’s followed by an FAQ, where you can get details on High Sierra’s release date, system requirements, installation instructions and more. A new file system Ever since System 8, the Mac has used the HFS+ file system to keep our documents and directories running smoothly, but at last year’s WWDC, a new Apple File System (APFS) was announced. It made it into iOS with the iOS 10.3 update, and with High Sierra it’s also coming to the Mac. But where the changes to iOS are largely behind the scenes, you’ll really get it see it in action in the new macOS. One of the main tenets of High Sierra, APFS will be new the new default file system, bringing an advanced 64-bit architecture and a responsive design to cut down on the time it takes to do common tasks. Apple VP Craig Federighi quickly demoed how fast files are copied, and it should save quite a bit of time, even on older Macs. APFS also brings some heavy-duty security, including built‑in encryption, crash‑safe protections and simplified data backup on the go. Better Photos Photos is rapidly becoming one of the most used apps on our Macs and in High Sierra it looks we’ll be spending even more time with it. A slew of new features await us in the new OS, including better organisation, looped Live Photos and new Memories categories. It’ll also be easier to identify who’s in your photos with more accurate People identification and cross-device syncing for albums. But the coolest feature may be a set of new built-in editing tools. Photos already lets us make some awesome adjustments to our snapshots, but High Sierra seriously ups the game with powerful pro-level tools – like a curves palette for fine-tuning colour and contrast, a selective colour dropper to home in a specific hue and new filters that will make your photos fit for an art gallery. And for all your gallery- and album-worthy photos, Apple has now partnered with third-party apps to give you more publishing and printing options. Speedier, smarter Safari Apple’s browser always gets a tune-up whenever a new version of macOS comes out, but this time around Federighi says the improvements coming in High Sierra actually make it the world’s fastest desktop browser. It features 80 percent faster JavaScript performance when compared to Chrome, which should help us surf a lot quicker. But we’re more interested in two new features that address what it’s like to use the internet in 2017. The first will eliminate one of the more annoying features of the modern web: autoplay videos. Where Safari in Sierra tells you which tab is playing audio, in High Sierra, it will shut the video down before it can start. Autoplay blocking will detect which sites are delivering unwanted videos, and then press the pause button for you. Along with our ears, the new Safari will also protect our privacy. A new system of intelligent tracking will use machine learning to identify prying advertising trackers that track your online behaviour and remove the cross-site tracking data they leave behind. That means you won’t get hit up with three dozen vacuum ads the next time you buy one on Amazon. Smoother video We watch a lot of video on our Macs and High Sierra is making the experience even better. In addition to supporting 4K where available, it’s also upgrading to the new industry standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (or H.265 for short). The new system compresses video up to 40 percent more the H.264, the current video standard. Under the new codec, videos will stream smoother and take up less space, both of which will make the experience much more pleasant. And if you’re a video creator, the new standard will also be built into Pro Tools so your projects will be able to take full advantage of it right from the start. Next-level Metal When Metal was introduced in El Capitan, it brought a slew of under-the-hood changes to make games and graphics sing, and now it’s ready to deliver the next generation, appropriately called Metal 2. The new technology will open up games to a whole new world of power, with a new API and powerful tools for developers. Metal 2 will bring 10 times the draw call throughput that Metal delivered, enabling graphics that are far more robust while adding external GPU support for hard-core gamers. But Metal 2 also brings support for something sorely missing from today’s Macs: virtual reality. High Sierra lets developers create interactive and immersive virtual reality experiences on the Mac for the very first time that will work with the HTC Vive and Unreal Engine for VR. And to show how serious it is about VR, Apple is even offering developers an external graphics dev kit to get started, featuring a Thunderbolt 3 enclosure with an AMD Radeon RX 580 GPU. You know, until the iMac Pro arrives in December. Other features Since High Sierra is a maintenance release, there will be lots of little improvements all over your desktop that you might not even notice at first. In Mail, Search will now use Spotlight to quickly identify top hits, and you’ll be able to split your inbox and your compose window when in full-screen view. You can add properly formatted tables to Notes and pin your most important ones. Siri has a more natural voice that sounds more like a person rather than a machine. And when you’re in a FaceTime call, you’ll be able to easily turn a special moment into a Live Photo so you can remember it forever. macOS High Sierra FAQ What is the name and version number of the new macOS? Apple names its macOS versions after California locations. This time, it named the new version High Sierra. The name follows Apple’s pattern of slightly changing the name of the previous version of the OS if the upgrade isn’t considered a big one. (For example, Leopard and then Snow Leopard, Lion and then Mountain Lion.) Apple senior VP Craig Federighi joked during the WWDC keynote that the name could be “misconstrued,” but Federigi was reassured that the name High Sierra was “fully baked”. If you’re into version numbers, then you’ll be happy to know that this one is version 10.13. When will macOS High Sierra be released? Apple, as usual, said macOS High Sierra will be released this Fall. “Fall” has typically meant the end of October for macOS releases, so if you’re making plans, that’s the area of your calendar to target. How much with macOS High Sierra cost? Apple makes its operating systems free, so macOS High Sierra is a free upgrade for users who have macOS Sierra installed. From what operating systems can I upgrade to macOS High Sierra? If you have macOS Sierra (the current macOS version), you can upgrade straight to High Sierra without doing any other software installations. If you are running Lion (version 10.7.5), Mountain Lion, Mavericks, Yosemite or El Capitan, you can upgrade directly from one of those versions to Sierra. Chances are this will still be the case with High Sierra. If you are running Leopard, you need to upgrade to Snow Leopard first and then upgrade to El Capitan, before you can upgrade to High Sierra. If you want to upgrade from Snow Leopard, you need to upgrade to El Capitan and then you can upgrade to High Sierra. How do I get macOS High Sierra? Apple will make the High Sierra upgrade available in the Mac App Store. Can I try macOS High Sierra before it is released? If you are a developer, you can get a beta of macOS Sierra through the Apple Developer Program. The developer beta is available now. Apple will make a beta available to the general public in late June. Apple releases public betas on a regular cycle and the betas are free, but come with the caveat that the software isn’t as stable as it would be at release – meaning it could cause problems on your Mac. However, if you do decide to try the beta, you can provide Apple with valuable feedback. Sign up for the public beta program online here. What Macs are compatible with macOS High Sierra? MacBook Pro (2010 and later) MacBook (late 2009 and later) MacBook Air (2010 and later) Mac Pro (2010 and later) iMac (Late 2009 and later) Mac mini (2010 and later) Should I upgrade to macOS Sierra? Whether you upgrade to High Sierra or not is up to you. First, you need to check to see if your Mac is compatible. Then, you also need to make sure the software you use most often will work. As High Sierra’s ship date approaches, developers may release updates to ensure compatibility. Check the Mac App Store on a regular basis to install updates on apps you have bought there. (To do this in the Mac App Store app, click on the Updates tab. This will check the store for any updates.) If you have software you didn’t get in the Mac App Store, launch the app and look in the preferences or other menus for an option to check for updates. You can also look on the developer’s website. Make a backup of your Mac before you install High Sierra. You might even save your important documents separately from your primary backup, just in case. If you install High Sierra and encounter problems, you can revert back using the backup. How do I install macOS High Sierra? After you download High Sierra from the App Store, there are several ways to run the installation. Go to the High Sierra product page in the Mac App Store. The Download button will be replaced by an Open button. Click on it to start the installation. In the Mac App Store app, click on the Purchased tab. You should see the macOS High Sierra installer in the list of purchased apps. Click on the Install button. Go to your Applications folder and look for a app called ‘Install macOS High Sierra’ and double-click on it.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues iOS 11 FAQ: Everything we know about new Siri, Messages, Photos and Apple Pay Oscar Raymundo 9 June, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Siri in iOS 11 has learned to sound like an actual human – and that’s just the beginning when it comes to the new mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads. Apple CEO Tim Cook and friends gave us a full overview of iOS 11 during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on Monday. New features include sweeping new upgrades to Siri, a redesigned Control Centre and App Store, and a brand-new Apple Pay feature that lets you send or receive money to your contacts via iMessage. In addition, developers can now create apps that tap into your iOS device’s potential to create augmented reality experiences via the new ARKit. Plus, there are new productivity features for the iPad, including drag-and-drop capability and a new Mac-style Dock. Here’s everything we know so far about iOS 11, plus a few of the new features that we can’t wait to try. What iOS devices will it run on? The following iPhones: iPhone 7/Plus iPhone 6s/Plus iPhone 6/Plus iPhone SE iPhone 5s The following iPads: iPad Pro (12.9-inch, 10.5-inch and 9.7-inch) iPad Air iPad Air 2 iPad (5th generation) iPad mini 2/3/4 Plus, the iPod Touch (6th generation) When will it be available? Following a series of developer and public betas this summer, Apple will make iOS 11 available to everyone as a free upgrade later this fall – likely around the same time as the launch of the next iPhone, typically in early or mid-September. Can I test the iOS 11 public beta? Yes, Apple will probably start rolling out the first public beta in June and anyone can give it a whirl (at their own risk). First, log in to the Beta Software Program page using your Apple ID and click on the link to enrol your iOS device. In order to download and install a configuration profile, you’ll be instructed to go to beta.apple.com/profile on the iOS device that you want to put the beta on – that will make the beta available as an over-the-air software update in the Settings app. Just remember that this is a beta version of the new software, so make sure you backup your iOS device before venturing into this unknown territory. Better yet, we recommend installing the public beta profile on a secondary iOS device (if you have one) so that you can test it without fear that it will screw something up. What’s new with Siri? The first new thing you’ll notice about Siri in iOS 11 is her more-natural sounding voice. However, she also looks a little different: Apple has given its voice assistant a new visual interface that surfaces multiple results for your requests, as well as followup questions. In addition, Siri can now translate phrases for you, from English to Chinese, French, German, Italian and Spanish. This feature is in beta, and Apple will add more languages in the months to come. Siri has also become more predictive across different iOS apps. For example, if you search for ‘Iceland’ in Safari, Siri will surface Iceland-related articles in the News app and bring up QuickType suggestions in Icelandic. Or, if you get a text message asking for money, Siri will suggest iMessage’s Apple Pay integration with the exact amount that’s been requested. Apple has also expanded SiriKit support to include more robust integrations with third-party services. You can now use Siri to add to your Evernote or pull up a QR code in WeChat, among other things. How is Apple Pay more like Venmo? You can use Apple Pay at certain brick-and-mortar stores (Apple says 50 percent of US retailers will support Apple Pay by the end of the year), online web stores via Safari and in certain iPhone apps. With iOS 11, you’ll be able to use Apple Pay to send or receive money from your contacts via Messages, thanks to a new iMessage app which essentially turns Apple Pay into your new Venmo or Square Cash alternative. All the money that you receive will be collected in your Wallet app in the form of a Cash card. You can use these funds to complete other Apple Pay transactions or you can transfer that cash over to your bank account. Apple Pay’s peer-to-peer transactions will be available in iOS 11 and watchOS 4. Can I do more with Live Photos? Yes! Apple has given us more editing tools for Live Photos, those moving images that you can take using an iPhone 6s and later. You can turn your Live Photos into video loops that replay over… and over… and over. The Photos app will even suggest Live Photos that would make for great loops. You can also add a ‘Bounce’ effect so that the Live Photo plays and then rewinds, kind of like Instagram Boomerangs. There’s also a new Long Exposure effect which makes the iPhone even more like a DSLR. But don’t Live Photos take up a lot of space? That’s true, but thankfully Apple has addressed this issue by switching to a more space efficient encoding system. For videos, iOS 11 uses HEVC (aka H.265), which is twice as efficient as the previous H.264 format. For still photos, iOS 11 uses HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) which Apple claims will take up only half the space. Where will I be able to use Maps indoors? Apple continues to improve the native Maps app in iOS 11. For the first time, you’ll be able to use Maps to navigate your way around indoor spaces. Maps in iOS 11 introduces indoor mapping so you can get detailed floor plans of certain malls and major airports, down to individual vendors on each floor. To start off, Maps will have indoor support for malls in Boston, Chicago, Hong Kong, London, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, San Jose, Tokyo and Washington D.C. Maps will also be able to show you around inside 30 major airports including JFK and London Heathrow. How does ‘Do Not Disturb While Driving’ work? Another feature introduced at WWDC is iOS 11’s ‘Do Not Disturb While Driving’ mode. Your iPhone will use Bluetooth (if connected to CarPlay or any other in-vehicle Bluetooth system) or motion sensors to figure out if you’re driving, and will automatically prevent all notifications from surfacing and causing a distraction. You can override this mode, however, or setup an automatic response to let people who text you know you’re on the road and that you’ll get back to them as soon as you arrive at your destination. What about augmented reality? Tim Cook has spent all year talking about how excited he is for augmented reality, so it’s no surprise that Apple used this year’s WWDC keynote to show off what it’s been working on in this emerging area. Alongside iOS 11, Apple unveiled ARKit, a new developer platform for creating iOS apps that tap into augmented reality. Apps built with ARKit will be able to use computer vision to identify surfaces and add 3D objects. These objects create dynamic shadows that are rendered in real-time. Did the iPad get more macOS-type features? You bet! There’s a new app Dock that looks a lot like the one in macOS, making it a lot easier to switch between apps. You can also press on any of these apps and drag them over to the right side of the screen to open them as a Slide Over. As always, you can lock Slide Over into Split View to use both apps simultaneously. The Dock can be accessed from any screen and you can customise it with your favourite apps. Also, it has a dynamic section on the right side that changes to suggest recently-used apps across your Apple devices. What about drag-and-drop? Yes! Apple finally answered our prayers. With iOS 11, you can drag-and-drop between the two apps in Split View, which makes it easier to transfer files, images, text and URLs. You can drag-attach images from the Photos to Mail, or drag-copy-and-paste directions from Safari into Maps. And how does the new Files app work? Apple also launched Files, a new iOS app intended to make the iPad experience more like a traditional Mac. Pretty self-explanatory, Files displays your documents stored in iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive and other file-storage apps. Are there new ways to use Apple Pencil? Yes, Apple has expanded Apple Pencil support for iPad Pro in iOS 11. Tap a PDF or screenshot with the tip of the Pencil and you’ll be able to scribble on it instantly thanks to a new feature called Instant Markup. Similarly, you can Pencil tap on the Lock screen to start writing. All your handwritten creations will be automatically saved to your Notes app, and these handwritten notes are searchable, too. Notes also has a new built-in Document Scanner, allowing you to scan a document, sign it or mark on it with Apple Pencil, then save or share – all with just your iPad Pro. In addition, Notes and Mail now support Inline Drawing so you can add some colour to your emails and notes. The text will automatically move out of the way when you start drawing, so that everything remains legible. A few more things… Control Centre has been redesigned so that it’s only one panel. You can customise it with your go-to’s like Low-Power Mode and use 3D Touch to adjust more-specific controls. App Store now mirrors the look-and-feel of Apple Music, with a new Today tab for featured games and apps. Messages App Drawer makes it easier to access your favourite iMessage apps by swiping across the bottom of the screen, instead of having to tap back to the drawer every time you want to switch apps. Apple Music gets more social: New profile photos indicate when one of your friends has listened to a certain albums or playlist. QuickType Keyboard is now easier to use one-handed. Simply long-press on the emoji key to bring the keys closer to your thumb. For iPad users, you can now flick down on a specific key to type a number or punctuation mark, instead of having to switch to the symbols keyboard.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues How to restart your Mac remotely Glenn Fleishman 9 June, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments Help Reader G. Murray needs to restart his Mac at times when it’s not within arm’s reach – or even with walking legs’ reach. He’s wondering what options are available with modern Macs. His Mac is located on a network created by a Time Machine, so it has a privately assigned IP address using NAT (Network Address Translation). Two kinds of situations may occur here: when the Mac is still ticking away but isn’t doing what you want and you wish to restart it remotely; or when the Mac is unreachable and has ostensibly crashed or is experiencing other problems and you want to power cycle it. Remotely connect to a working Mac Screen sharing and remote terminal access can let you control a Mac remotely, but reaching that Mac over the Internet is often the fly in the ointment. While macOS includes Back to My Mac, which pairs with iCloud to allow remote access to a Mac via the Screen Sharing app, it only works in its regular configuration from another Mac signed into the same iCloud account. Apple offers no guest access from other Macs – though you could set up an account on another Mac temporarily – nor does it have an iOS app. Instead of Back to My Mac and the Screen Sharing app, you can use the generic screen-sharing protocol VNC. (Just to be more confusing, Apple’s Screen Sharing app is based on VNC, but is not identical.) VNC can work over Back to My Mac but it doesn’t always, as it’s not a supported feature. Third-party macOS and iOS apps let you access any VNC-capable system. Enable screen sharing in the Sharing system preference pane, and click the Computer Settings buttons to turn on VNC. Warning! Always set a strong password for VNC, as it’s easy for attackers to scan for VNC and find yours if it’s reachable from the internet. Back to My Mac fails with ‘double NAT’ situations, which I unfortunately have and which aren’t entirely rare. A double NAT happens typically when an ISP provides a modem that also acts as a router, and which has features you can’t replicate or turn off. If you connect, say, an AirPort Extreme with DHCP and NAT enabled to a LAN port on the ISP’s modem, you’re creating a NAT inside a NAT. All outbound connections work fine, but inbound ones can be a mess. (In my case, the provided modem has some obscure networking features used by CenturyLink’s fibre-optic network.) Instead of relying on macOS, you can turn to third-party remote access software, although my favourites have faded away and left active development, while ones that used to have free or affordable flavours have gone commercial and expensive. TeamViewer remains the exception, being still continuously developed and free for personal, non-commercial use. It can punch through a double NAT, and it’s my preferred tool as if works on practically every platform, including macOS and iOS. The company charges a pretty hefty rate if you’re using it for business purposes, starting at $850 for a perpetual licence for remotely accessing up to three devices. For business users without big budgets, I recommend LogMeIn, which is $250 a year for two devices. Chris Breen’s 2012 directions on using SSH to reboot or shutdown a Mac via a Terminal session remain accurate, so I refer you there. But creating a remote Terminal session via SSH, a secure protocol that’s trustworthy over the internet, requires setting up port mapping on a router or Wi-Fi base station using DHCP reservation (so your Mac has the same private IP address all the time) and NAT port forwarding (so an internet-reachable network cubbyhole maps to the Mac you want it to). Unfortunately, Apple no longer offers a detailed guide to AirPort configuration as it did years ago. I’m reluctant to toot my own horn, but if you really need to set up this kind of remote access for SSH or other services, you’ll find complete instructions on this topic in my book, Take Control of Your Apple Wi-Fi Network. Remotely powercycle your Mac Now long ago, my friends, I owned a surge protector powerstrip from Sophisticated Circuits (the PowerKey line) that had a dial-up modem built in. You could call into a phone line and it would let you use a touch-tone phone to control powercycling individual outlets, among other features. In the days of running Mac and other servers that needed ‘remote hands’, the several PowerKey models I owned saved a lot of late-night car trips to offices. But we have the internet now, and you can purchase the same kind of item that works over IP instead of a voice line. Unfortunately, these devices tend to cost a lot, but they’re designed to be robust and connect via ethernet to increase reliability. The $76 ezOutlet single-outlet remote power switch has generally positive reviews, and can be controlled via an iOS or Android app. Another option would be to set up HomeKit with remote access, and use a HomeKit-compatible smart outlet. You can find a number of such items, including the roughly $40 iHome SmartPlug, reviewed at TechHive. But remote access requires either a 3rd or 4th generation Apple TV. If you don’t own an Apple TV, that bumps up the total cost quite a bit.

Chance Miller - Jun. 8th 2017 6:04 pm PT @ChanceHMiller Feature iPad View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit At WWDC earlier this week, Apple overhauled its iPad lineup with two new iPad Pro models: an all-new 10.5-inch model and a refreshed 12.9-inch model. Gone is the 9.7-inch iPad Pro that was introduced just over a year ago.With the two new models, here’s how the iPad lineup stacks up today: 9.7-inch iPad 10.5-inch iPad Pro 12.9-inch iPad Pro How do these models compare? Read on to find out… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover Display In terms of displays, both iPad Pro models are identical in every way, except of course for size. Both models feature Apple’s True Tone display technology, as well as its ProMotion technology and reflective coating. For those unfamiliar, Apple’s True Tone screen technology which automatically adjusts color temperature based on the room environment, was first introduced with the 9.7-inch iPad Pro last year. The ProMotion technology, on the other hand, brings refresh rates of up to 120hz. The refresh rate adjusts dynamically, which means the screen moves from 24hz to 48hz to 120hz depending on your use patterns. This, according to Apple, will maximize battery life and performance. In terms of resolution, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro features a 2224 x 1668 resolution, while the 12.9-inch model comes in with 2732 x 2048. Nevertheless, both work out to be the same 264 pixels-per-inch. Other display features found on the iPad Pro include: Wide color display (P3) Fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating Fully laminated display Antireflective coating Moving onto the $329 budget iPad, however, you can see where Apple cut some corners to keep the price down. The iPad lacks True Tone display technology, as well as the antireflective display coating. You also don’t get the ProMotion refresh rate technology. The $329 iPad does, however, offer the same 264 pixels-per-inch display with a resolution of 2048 x 1536. Specs In terms of power, you’ll again find discrepancies between the iPad Pro models and the standard iPad. Both iPad Pro models are powered by the same hexa-core A10X Fusion processor with 64-bit architecture and the embedded M10 coprocessor and a twelve-core GPU. Meanwhile, the 9.7-inch iPad features Apple’s A9 chip with the M9 running at dual-core speeds of 1.85GHz. All in all, the iPad Pro models carry the ‘Pro’ name for a reason. Expect them to offer a considerably higher amount of power and capabilities than the $329 iPad, but that’s not saying the more affordable model is a slouch in any way, shape, or form. The fact of the matter is that Apple is excellent at optimizing software for all types of hardware, so expect smooth performance from all three iPads. Battery One interesting tidbit regarding Apple’s iPad lineup relates to battery. All three models quote the same estimated battery life of 10 hours (with the exception of the cellular iPad Pros, which quote 9 hours). However, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro features a 30.4-watt-hour battery and the 12.9-inch features a 41-watt-hour battery. The 9.7-inch iPad packs a 32.4-watt-hour battery, meaning it’s slightly larger than the 10.5-inch iPad Pro’s battery. While this doesn’t necessarily mean anything in terms of real-world usage, it’s an interesting factoid nonetheless. Another thing worth noting is that the iPad Pro ships with fast charging support thanks to USB 3 and USB-C charging adapters. This means the devices will take considerably less time to charge than previous models. Design One thing many were quick to point out when the $329 iPad was released earlier this year was its backwards step in terms of design. The device is thicker and heavier than the iPad Air 2 it replaced, which featured a slim 6.1mm and .96 pound design, while the new iPad comes in at 7.5mm and 1.03 pounds. This means the new iPad is more than 20 percent thicker than the iPad Air 2. Compared to the iPad Pro models, however, the 9.7-inch iPad isn’t any heavier. The 10.5-inch iPad pro comes in at 1.03 pounds, while the 12.9-inch is 1.49 pounds. In terms of dimensions, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro is 250mm tall and 174.1 mm wide, where as the 12.9-inch is 305.7mm tall and 220.6mm wide. Then there’s the 9.7-inch iPad at 240mm tall and 169.5mm wide. One other tidbit worth noting is that both iPad Pro models feature a four speaker design, whereas the 9.7-inch model features a standard dual speaker system. This means you get a much more powerful sound from the iPad Pros than the budget model. This means that you get nearly an inch more screen real estate with the iPad Pro, yet you gain just 10mm in height and 5mm in width compared to the 9.7-inch model. Cameras In terms of camera technology, the iPad Pros carry the clear lead here. Both models feature a 12MP rear camera with a host of features: ƒ/1.8 aperture Digital zoom up to 5x Optical image stabilization Six‑element lens Quad-LED True Tone flash Panorama (up to 63 megapixels) Sapphire crystal lens cover Backside illumination sensor Hybrid IR filter Autofocus with Focus Pixels Tap to focus with Focus Pixels Live Photos with stabilization Wide color capture for photos and Live Photos Improved local tone mapping Body and face detection Exposure control Noise reduction Auto HDR for photos Auto image stabilization Burst mode Timer mode Photo geotagging You also get 4K video recording, slow-mo support, time-lapse capabilities, and more: 4K video recording at 30 fps 1080p HD video recording at 30 fps or 60 fps 720p HD video recording at 30 fps Optical image stabilization for video Optical zoom at 2x Quad-LED True Tone flash Slo‑mo video support for 1080p at 120 fps and 720p at 240 fps Time‑lapse video with stabilization Cinematic video stabilization (1080p and 720p) Continuous autofocus video Body and face detection Noise reduction Take 8-megapixel still photos while recording 4K video Playback zoom Video geotagging In terms of front camera tech, you get a FaceTime HD camera with 7MP photos, Live Photos, and more: 7-megapixel photos 1080p HD video recording Retina Flash ƒ/2.2 aperture Wide color capture for photos and Live Photos Auto HDR Backside illumination sensor Body and face detection Auto image stabilization Burst mode Exposure control Timer mode Meanwhile, the $329 iPad features an 8MP rear camera and 1.2MP front facing shooter. The budget device also misses out on some of the more advanced features. Camera 8-megapixel camera Live Photos Autofocus Panorama (up to 43 megapixels) HDR for photos Exposure control Burst mode Tap to focus Timer mode ƒ/2.4 aperture Five-element lens Hybrid IR ﬁlter Backside illumination Auto image stabilization Face detection Photo geotagging Video Recording 1080p HD video recording (30 fps) Slo‑mo (120 fps) Time-lapse video with stabilization Video image stabilization Face detection 3x video zoom Video geotagging FaceTime HD Camera 1.2-megapixel photos Live Photos ƒ/2.2 aperture Retina Flash 720p HD video recording Backside illumination HDR for photos and videos Face detection Burst mode Exposure control Timer mode Storage + Color The 9.7-inch iPad is available in just two tiers: 32GB and 128GB. Meanwhile, the iPad Pro models are available in 64GB, 256GB, and for the first time ever, 512GB. For color, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro is available in silver, gold, space gray, and rose gold. The 12.9-inch model is available in silver, gold, and space gray. The 9.7-inch iPad is available in the same silver, gold, and space gray. The moral of the story here is that if you want rose gold, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro is your only option. Price Where the 9.7-inch iPad shines, however, is its price. The device starts at just $329 for the 32GB model and increases to $429 for 128GB of space. For cellular connectivity, you’re looking at $459 for the 32GB model and $559 for the 128GB model. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro starts at $649 for 64GB of storage and increases to $749 and $949 for 256GB and 512GB, respectively. For cellular connectivity it’s priced at $779 for 64GB, $879 for 256GB, and $1,079 for 512GB. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro starts at $799 for 32GB, $899 for 256GB, and $1099 for 512GB. For cellular connectivity, you’re looking at $929, $1,029, or $1,229. Wrap up As I have tried to make as clear as possible, the iPad Pro and iPad are targeted at two very different markets. The iPad Pro is meant for professionals and who will benefit from accessories such as the Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil. You also pay a considerable premium for faster performance, more advanced screen technology, and more storage. Additionally, for the first time, both iPad Pro variants are equal in nearly every aspect. It really comes down to the screen size you think you’ll need and the cash you’re willing to drop. Meanwhile, there’s the $329 iPad which is plain and ordinary, but it comes in at a great price point for an average user. It doesn’t have the latest and greatest processor and screen, but it will certainly get the job done. What are your thoughts on Apple’s current iPad lineup? Which model strikes your interest?

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI AI Weekly: Apple and Google are making smartphones smarter Blaise Zerega@BeeZee June 8, 2017 6:12 PM It’s happening again. Smartphones are getting smarter. At WWDC this week Apple announced Core ML, a programming framework for app developers seeking to run machine learning models on iPhones and other devices. Think of this as AI on your iPhone, which means your favorite apps may soon intuitively know what you want to do with them. Meanwhile, Google made a similar announcement a few weeks ago at its I/O developer conference. The company’s new TensorFlow Lite programming framework will make it possible to run machine learning models on Android devices. And these announcements are in addition to Google Assistant now being available for the iPhone. (It’s already become my most used app.) So what does this mean? These moves suggest yet a third front for more artificial intelligence battles by the tech giants. First, intelligent assistants: Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. Second, smart speakers: Amazon Echo, Google Home, and the new Apple HomePod. And third: smartphones and their apps. Of course, Microsoft, Samsung, and others may stir things up further.

That's especially true in the battle over the smart home, where Alexa has become a powerful assistant thanks to Amazon opening up Alexa as a platform back in 2015; Alexa now knows over 13,000 third-party Skills. Meanwhile, Apple and Amazon have had numerous standoffs across different competitive areas. One of these just ended, with Apple finally announcing earlier this month that Amazon Prime Video would be coming to Apple TV. Given the tensions, it would seem unlikely that Alexa and Siri will ever get along and work together, but it appears that at least Amazon is open to the idea. Siri powers the new HomePod. Image source: Apple. Apple probably should, but won't At the Wired Business Conference yesterday, Amazon hardware chief David Limp said that Alexa and Siri should be able to cooperate, according to USA Today. Limp said, "You should be able to tell 'Alexa, ask Siri X.'" The executive said he'd be open to Apple or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google exploring a potential partnership, although Limp acknowledged the unlikelihood of that happening. There's little doubt that consumers would prefer the various virtual assistants in their lives being able to communicate with each other, which is what should matter most. But rivals are probably more interested in using virtual assistants as potentially differentiating factors. For example, Google is betting that Google Home can answer a much broader set of questions, tapping into the search engine's "featured snippets" and relaying those through Google Home. While the implementation of that has approach been heavily criticized, if Google can improve the execution, that could be a compelling advantage for Google Home over Echo, and a feature that Google would rightly be averse to sharing. Apple's HomePod was just announced and won't be available until December. The Mac maker is positioning its smart speaker at the premium end of the spectrum, hoping that high-fidelity audio will win over consumers -- its second attempt in as many years. However, Apple has been working on its smart home platform for years (HomeKit was released in 2014), which Siri on HomePod will be able to tap into, but Apple has very little to show for it thus far. The company only opened up Siri to third-party developers last year. With that backdrop, if Apple were to theoretically partner with Amazon so that Alexa and Siri could interface with each other, it would probably benefit Apple more than Amazon, since Siri could ask Alexa to perform smart home tasks, and Alexa is capable of a whole lot more of those. Still, it probably won't happen. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Twenty two people have been arrested out of which twenty worked for Apple or companies Apple outsources to. The employees illegally used Apple's internal system to acquire the Apple ID, name, phone number, and other data of customers. The information was then sold for between 10 yuan ($1.46) and 180 yuan ($26.27) each. The total money involved has initially been estimated at over 50 million yuan ($7.3 million). A new Chinese law that took effect June 1st makes acquisition, sale, or provision of 50 or more pieces of information pertaining to personal whereabouts, communication content, credit and property a crime. For those who work in financial, telecommunications and medical care sectors, 25 pieces of information leaked is considered a crime if leaked for personal benefit. Notably, under the new law, Apple could face investigation and possibly fines if their systems have inadequate protections against a leak.

Apple Sure Has Some Weird New Hobbies Alex Cranz Jun 9, 2017, 10:30am ⋅ Filed to:  apple imac pro ipad pro macbook pro video feature wwdc wwdc 2017 Share Forget the HomePod or the latest version of iOS. The big news out of WWDC was related to something that Apple, and most consumers, don't really care about: Virtual Reality. In between Kaby Lake refreshes and Siri voice demos, Tim Cook announced a wide range of software and hardware changes that will finally bring VR to macOS, and that's pretty damn surprising because Tim Cook himself is on record as giving exactly zero damns about VR. That gorgeous new iMac Pro. (All images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo) "VR, I think, has some interesting applications, but I don't think it's a broad-based technology," Tim Cook told reporters during an Apple earnings call last October. At the time Cook was talking up AR, a technology that Apple embraced Tuesday with the announcement of the ARKit. So what's prompted Tim and company's sudden change of heart? Because VR was smeared all over the Tuesday keynote, mentioned not just in the announcements of SteamVR compatibility in macOS (this means the HTC Vive will work on a Mac) or a "External Graphics Developer Kit" (a new box made by Sonnet that uses Thunderbolt 3 to boost a computer graphics capabilities), but also in the announcements of updated iMacs and the new iMac Pro. A lot of it might be about wooing back the creative professionals Apple has ignored in favour of iPhone users. Apple first acknowledged that its relationship with that community was a problem back in March when it held a carefully cultivated press event just so it could promise a new MacPro was coming... eventually. But Apple's competitors aren't going to wait for whatever hyper-engineered desktop the Cupertino-based company has cooking. Last year, Microsoft swooped in with the launch of the Surface Studio. The big, gorgeous workstation was so impressive, the even allegiant Apple fans were interested. It wasn't particularly powerful, but it was flexible, able to be used in a variety of positions, and the Dial — a small peripheral that could be used onscreen or off to quickly adjust app settings — gave pros a whole new way of interacting with the programs they lived in. Microsoft's Beautiful Surface Studio Is Coming To Kill The Desktop PC As We Know It Desktop computers have come in two flavours for the last few years. boxes you plug into your monitor or TV, and all-in-one devices like Apple's popular iMac series. Microsoft's newly announced Surface Studio is the latter kind of desktop, but with a giant touchscreen and pen input too. It's also the first desktop computer Microsoft has ever made. Read more All of Apple's new products feel like a way to curb Microsoft's inroads. Where Microsoft focused on design with the Surface Studio, Apple's leaning on power with the iMac Pro, packing an up to 18-core Xeon processor and next-generation AMD Vega GPU into a desktop as thin as a stack of pancakes. People love that HomePod. And, as noted before, the company is also leaning on VR, and all the powerful machines that can tackle it. That was very apparent after the keynote, when press were ushered into a dark room full of demos. While many clamoured for a glance at a non-functioning HomePod, the majority of the demo room was given over to the cooler tech Apple announced. "This is for professionals," an Apple rep told me, just before he slipped an HTC Vive headset over my eyes and put me face-to-face with all 2m of Darth Vader. It was nearly identical to the Vader demo we all saw on stage during the keynote. The purpose, according to the rep, was to show off how smoothly VR could work on macOS High Sierra and with current Apple hardware, like the 5K iMac. "They can develop on an iMac," he said, referring the class of developers who need a machine that can crunch the big numbers that come with 3D rendering such as that found in the Star Wars demo. A WWDC attendee checks out 360 video on the Vive. Besides the long row of current generation iMacs ready to show off VR demos, there was another long table of MacBook Pros lashed to external GPU boxes. The boxes were there to show off the new "external graphics" dev kit Apple announced during the keynote, but according to Apple reps, any external GPU that connects via Thunderbolt 3 should, theoretically, work in Apple's macOS ecosystem. The Sonnet box, packed with a video card an AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB video card. External GPUs aren't new. Both Alienware and Razer have been pushing their boxes (the Graphics Amplifier and Core respectively) on gamers. For those companies the external GPU is a great compromise. You can have a super light laptop with great battery life when you're on the move, and a computer as powerful as a desktop when you get home. Perfect not just for the VR fans and gamers Apple nodded at, but for creative professionals who need the extra GPU oomph for 3D renders. Perhaps Apple's sudden interest in VR has nothing to do with courting professionals. Maybe it really is about the masochist gamers who want to game on a platform rarely supported by video game developers. But, at least from what we've seen so far, that doesn't seem to be the case. Instead, it seems that Apple's focusing on VR because it is well aware of the fact that it can't keep ignoring the pro users that helped bolster Apple's cachet as a cool company in the first place.

It's almost as if Apple is working behind the scenes to try and make this fringe technology insanely digestible to the masses, but yeah... what a "weird" hobby.... Reply 0 Huh Guest Jun 9, 2017, 11:42am I don't get all the hype about VR. Maybe I'm an old fart and don't really see the point in it. I guess Apple is just jumping on the on-trend train Reply 0 soldant @soldant Jun 9, 2017, 12:20pm Like most newer technologies, nobody's quite sure what to do with it yet. In the immediate term, augmented reality (AR) is probably more useful to end consumers. The potential to create an entirely artificial environment and then have people interact with it naturally (well, as naturally as possible with a screen stuck to your face and controllers in hand) is pretty big though. Just for a start you could create high fidelity training environments for all sorts of different professions. Reply 0 symo @symo Jun 9, 2017, 12:53pm I think what people are trying to do is invent a dumb reason that they think Apple have come up with as to why they are developing anything at all and then proceed to hand shit on said dumb reason. In other words, haters gonna hate. Reply 0 ross_co @ross_co Jun 9, 2017, 2:32pm Immersion. I've been using VR for 8 months and immersion is the point, it's another way of consuming media, whether that be games or video. I've had some fantastic experiences in VR and I'm excited to see how far it will go. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Augmented reality (AR) is a huge part of the company’s vision of the future for the iPhone and iPad (and beyond), and we’re going to see the first results of Apple’s AR implementation later this year when iOS 11 is released and developers launch their AR creations for the iPhone and iPad. However, as exciting as native AR support might sound for the iPhone, you should know that you might have to upgrade your gear to take advantage of it. Don't Miss: With WWDC 2017 and iOS 11, Apple has shown us the end of the iPhone Apple said on stage at WWDC that ARKit will bring AR to millions of iPhones and iPads. That’s all great news, but not all iPhones and iPads are created equal. What Apple did not say on stage but jotted it down in its ARKit documentation online, is that ARKit will only work with Apple A9 and Apple A10 processors. That means AR apps will be compatible with iPhones and iPads released in 2015 or later — think iPhone 6s or iPad Pro. “ARKit runs on the Apple A9 and A10 processors,” Apple explains. “These processors deliver breakthrough performance that enables fast scene understanding and lets you build detailed and compelling virtual content on top of real-world scenes.” So if you happen to have an iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, iPad Air or even the latest iPod touch, you won’t be able to get any AR love once you upgrade them to iOS 11 this fall. Apple doesn’t list the incoming A11 processor on its ARKit page as that would obviously confirm its existence. But the processor that will power this year’s iPhone will also support AR. In fact, it’ll probably be the best mobile chip in town for that.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Legal Image Source: QQ Officials arrest Apple distributors who sold private data Mike Wehner @MikeWehner June 8th, 2017 at 8:00 PM Share Tweet Smartphone users — which, at this point, is pretty much everyone — already have enough to worry about when it comes to hackers, malicious apps, and malware invading their phones, but in China, some iPhone users found out their worst enemy was actually the folks selling them their devices in the first place. Chinese officials have now arrested 22 Apple distributors after discovering that they were selling off sensitive user data they found on a secure Apple database. The crooks apparently collected over $7.3 million (over 50 million yuan) from selling the information before being caught.  Don't Miss: New leak claims to reveal final iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s Plus designs The thieves reportedly accessed the internal Apple database and collected user information that included Apple IDs, names, and phone numbers of users. They then sold that information to obviously sketchy buyers for as little as $1.50, or as much as $26. As the sales piled up, the distributors made millions upon millions, and it remains unclear exactly how much user data has fallen into the wrong hands. The distributors — who were apparently third party sellers, but still had access to at least some level of Apple’s internal server hierarchy — were busted after a months-long investigation by Chinese officials, which is still ongoing. Apple has had a rather rocky relationship with China as a whole. The company finally truly broke into the Chinese market in 2014 when China Mobile finally got on board with Apple and offered the iPhone 5s and 5c. In the months that followed, Chinese government officials repeatedly accused Apple of “spying” on Chinese customers, and the company has gotten plenty of pushback at various levels of the government there. Still, the iPhone remains a hugely popular device in the country.

"Lately, I've gotten so sick of hearing about how FANG's finished, crushed, over, roadkill, all that other stuff ... that I decided to dust off the CANDIES in order to show how things really work with growth stocks. And you know what? I was pleasantly surprised to see that, seven years later, the CANDIES are still crushing it," Cramer said. In fact, Cramer found that the CANDIES stocks — Chipotle, Apple, Netflix, Deckers, Intuitive Surgical, Express Scripts, and Salesforce.com — are up 281 percent on average since he formed the acronym in 2010, versus 121 percent for the S&P 500 index. The "Mad Money" host picked these particular names because they were some of the best growth stocks of the time, and oddly, they remain some of the strongest performers today. Watch the full segment here: show chapters Cramer revisits a pre-FANG acronym to see if those stocks kept growing    14 Hours Ago | 07:02 Chipotle shares have run up 209 percent since CANDIES' creation and is up nearly 22 percent for the year, a testament to the stock's strength despite its 2015 E.coli incidents. Cramer chose the fast-casual chain because it was the most highly valued restaurant chain at the time, delivering the best same-store sales numbers of anyone in its class. "There were never enough Chipotle's, and its highest quality problem? The lines were too long," he said. "It's been 15 months since the last outbreak and the stock's been doing, well, what we said it would be doing: rallying as people forget the past. But it's been a tough slog." Apple's stock is up 312 percent since CANDIES formed, with a 34 percent rise in 2017 alone. And while some analysts knock the consumer tech giant's lack of innovation, Cramer is not so convinced. "I am tired of reading about Apple's lack of innovation since Steve Jobs died. Jobs lived a little more than a year after the CANDIES were launched and the stock did go from $35 to $55 during that period, but that's a far cry from its total 312 percent gain, most accruing under the Tim Cook era," the "Mad Money" host said. "I think Apple's innovated well beyond what anyone else has done in the consumer space and the quality has only improved with each iteration [and] each product." Netflix, the biggest winner and the only CANDIES stock that made it to FANG, ran up 938 percent since the first acronym's inception and has rallied 34 percent this year. "I picked it seven years ago because my kids were cord-cutters from way back. They turned me on to the platform [as] something we could do together," Cramer said. "I wish I could say there was more thought was behind it, but there wasn't, just like with Apple." Deckers was one of the more disappointing stocks, up only 35 percent since CANDIES' creation, though it has climbed 25 percent for 2017. Cramer said Uggs brand parent has fallen out of relevance, even with Oprah Winfrey's endorsement, and that the stock is only up now on takeover rumors. Intuitive Surgical has run 176 percent since CANDIES formed with a 47 percent run this year, and Cramer was surprised the stock did not run more given the strength of the business. "Intuitive Surgical has parlayed its Da Vinci surgical machine into multiple markets and is beloved by hospitals as a selling point for patients who can choose where they want to go," he said. Express Scripts, the most unfortunate of the bunch, is only up 17 percent since 2010 and is down 12 percent for the year. The pharmacy benefits manager, which Cramer called a "widely reviled" middleman, recently lost its biggest client, Anthem, and shares have since been weak. Finally, there is Cramer-fave Salesforce, which has run 283 percent since 2010 and 33 percent for 2017. The "Mad Money" host said Salesforce has consistently delivered under CEO Marc Benioff as the company seized on its pioneer cloud business and branched out to serve various sectors. "Conclusions? First, this market, like all markets, has a fascination with growth, especially in the era of stifled economic activity. It never mattered how expensive that growth was — these were all super expensive — as long as the company in question didn't stop growing, as Deckers and Express Scripts did. Second, listen to your kids, but you've still got to do your homework," Cramer said. Cramer said he got plenty of these ideas from his kids, from Chipotle to Apple to Netflix to Domino's, and that it is worth paying attention to the names that are staring you in the face. "With the exception of Express Scripts, the CANDIES were all right in front of you, available to everyone," he said. "A buy and homework rap would've made you a killing. The moral? The CANDIES say don't be scared to buy the growth stocks you believe in, as long as you've got the temperament to stick with them long term." Questions for Cramer?

By Cyrus Lee | June 8, 2017 -- 23:43 GMT (16:43 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Huawei will become the number one PC maker globally in three to five years, leapfrogging brands such as Lenovo, HP, and Apple, Wan Biao, COO of Huawei's consumer business group, told CNBC on Wednesday. Huawei's "unswerving input in R&D" and "innovation capabilities" will enable it to become a top PC vendor globally, which the company has already proven with its smartphone products, Wan was quoted as saying. "In the laptop space some technologies are the same with smartphones. In the meantime, with the development of AI, AR, and VR technologies, the chance to succeed will only grow bigger for a strong innovative company," he told CNBC. Wan also told Chinese media on Wednesday that Huawei has made huge investments into its first MateBook product and market responses have already reached expectations. He added that Huawei will adopt a similar strategy from its smartphone segment to its PC lines by concentrating on the high-end markets. The company last month announced three new MateBooks, the X, D, and E, starting from 1,399 euro, 999 euro and 799 euro, respectively. The new releases come one year after the company released the first generation of the Huawei MateBook. Taiwan media suggested that shipments of the first-generation MateBook only reached 700,000 units, a far cry from Huawei's target of 2 million units. Global PC shipments totaled 60.3 million units in the first quarter of 2017, up 0.6 percent from the same period a year earlier, an IDC report revealed in April. It was also the first PC shipment inflation on an annualized basis since the first quarter of 2012.

Roston - Jun 8, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple has pushed out an update for GarageBand that adds, among other things, support for the Touch Bar found on the new line of MacBooks. It’s easy to see how the Touch Bar could come in handy during editing, particularly for quickly navigating through a project. That’s not the only change coming to the software, though — it has also received a new design that Apple calls ‘modern.’ GarageBand, of course, is Apple’s low-barrier software for creating music, podcasts and more. The software was recently made free for all Apple users, even those clinging to their dated machined, and it can be downloaded from the Mac App Store. Users have been requesting the addition of Touch Bar support for a while, and now it has arrived. The new support comes in GarageBand version 10.2, which also has a new ‘modern design’ that is said to offer better ease of use. Version 10.2 also brings three new drummers that, says Apple’s software changelog, play Pop, Songwriter and Latin percussion. There’s also a new drummer loop that can be used in audio projects; it is customizable via the performance controls. Finally, the new update also allows users to add new tracks to their projects from the iOS version of the software on iPad and iPhone. You must be using Mac OS X 10.11 or later in order to run the newest version of GarageBand.

During the two-hour presentation at the mostly-annual developers conference, CEO Tim Cook and other Apple executives barely unveiled the new operating system for iPhone and iPad. Sure, we learned about phone-to-phone payments in iMessage, new augmented reality efforts, etc, which you can read all about from here, but the software is actually loaded with tonnes more tricks. We know this because the company released a beta version of iOS 11 and developers are already testing it and discovering unannounced features. The company also quietly showed a slide (above) during the keynote that listed dozens of additions in iOS 11. Here are the best ones we've found or learned about so far. Keep checking back, too, as we'll update this piece with more over time. Do these leaked iPhone 8 drawings reveal the phone's final design? Apple made a pair of sneakers once and now you can buy them MacOS High Sierra: What's in the new software for your Mac? Best iOS 11 features Apple didn't announce Custom Control Center control center is like THIS ISNT EVEN MY FINAL FORM pic.twitter.com/MlWqf0YIxv — George Kedenburg III (@GK3) June 6, 2017 Apple mentioned the Control Center has been redesigned, but did you know it'll also customisable? Although the layout can't be changed, you can select what's displayed via Settings. There are a tonne of new options including Low Power Mode, Notes, Text Size, Wallet, Screen Recording, and more. There's even a new option to add Apple TV Remote controls to Control Center. Type to Siri type to siri in action pic.twitter.com/7mzZNYkzMA — Mike Beasley (@MikeBeas) June 6, 2017 In the Accessibility menu under General in Settings, there is a new Type to Siri option. With this option, you can type out your question rather than say it aloud to Siri. You could technically type commands into Siri with iOS 10, but you had to tap on a spoken query and then edit it. Markup screenshots The screenshot editor is a nice addition to iOS 11 pic.twitter.com/kCqMOVmtFE — Chad Whitaker (@chadwhitaker) June 6, 2017 When you take a screenshot, you'l be able to go full screen and have access to new tools for cropping and annotation. So, you can markup your screenshots with iOS 11 - no third-party app required. Screen recording Seems like there are a lot of options for additional control centre toggles (including screen recording) #iOS11 pic.twitter.com/kiBE0H217F — Michael (@Malvix_) June 6, 2017 You will be able to record your screen with a simple tool in the iPhone's redesigned Control Center. The new tool, called Screen Recorder, will be available if you customise your Control Center shortcuts via Settings. Then, just tap the red button to start recording. You can tap the title bar to stop recording, too, and the video will be saved to your camera roll like normal. Dark mode screen recording and dark mode... ios 11 is lit pic.twitter.com/UNKqbzIn3F — ???? (@_itsjourdann) June 6, 2017 Apple offers a darker display mode, where it inverts colours, but that's always negatively affected photos and other things you see on the screen. Now, a Smart Invert setting (Settings > General > Accessibility > Display Accommodations > Invert Colors) will turn light backgrounds dark, but it won't do anything to images and icons. It's basically an unofficial dark mode. One-handed keyboard This new keyboard feature for better one-handed typing is so useful for me, since I am always doing 2 things at once. Loving iOS 11 @Apple! pic.twitter.com/yJoBo4X7rO — Crouton (@Cr3wBoss) June 8, 2017 There is a new one-handed typing keyboard in iOS 11, but it can only be found by holding down on the emoji key and selecting it from the menu. Keep in mind Microsoft introduced its own one-handed keyboard for iOS last year. While Microsoft's keyboard was a half circle, Apple's crowds the keys to the left or right, with the idea of making it easier to type with one hand. Built-in QR code scanner The QR code reader in iOS 11 knows when it’s a WiFi network and offers to join. pic.twitter.com/pCHwGi1abF — Dayton Lowell (@daytonlowell) June 5, 2017 The Camera app has been updated with the ability to read QR codes. You can therefore scan the code with your camera to quickly open websites, access Wi-Fi networks, share your contact details, prove your ticket is valid, or whatever else the QR code is enabled to do. Wi-Fi sharing En iOS 11 ya no habra mas "Me pasas la password de tu Wi-Fi??" .. Ahora existe Shared my Wi-Fi password…!!! pic.twitter.com/XoO6Cq3ZI4 — Adrian Leal (@adrianlealmtz) June 7, 2017 Ever go to a friend's house and see them spend 30 minutes trying to remember their Wi-Fi password? With iOS 11, that is no more. A new Wi-Fi sharing feature will notify you when a visitor wants to join your Wi-Fi network and it will automatically share your Wi-Fi password with them, too, as long as you approve their password request. Automatic setup Automatic Setup in iOS 11 … nice pic.twitter.com/X0UJHFMrYM — Röstbrotkammer (@toastroom) June 5, 2017 One of the most annoying aspects about getting a new iPhone has been resolved, thank to Automatic Setup. By simply holding a new iPhone or iPad near an iOS device or Mac you own, you can transfer over all your preferences, settings, and even iCloud Keychain passwords. Is that it? There's also that slide Apple quietly showed at WWDC 2017. While it's loaded with many new iOS 11 features, there are a few worth pointing out: for one, Apple is opening up the NFC chip previously reserved for Apple Pay. It also revealed iCloud family storage plans are coming. Lastly, Apple will begin auto-filling passwords for apps, not just websites in Safari.  When can you get iOS 11? Developers can get their hands on iOS 11 now, while a public beta version will be made available in late June. The final version is still months away from release. Expect it to launch this autumn, and like all other software updates from Apple, it will be free to download and use. Want to know more? Check out Pocket-lint's iOS 11 guide.

We’re slowly getting an idea of what to expect. 9to5Mac reports that AirPods will automatically pair with a user’s Apple TV. Previously, the earbuds only automatically paired with iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches that were associated with the same iCloud account. So maybe with tvOS 11 you’ll be able to watch TV without needing a whole speaker setup or even dealing with manually pairing. How many people want to watch TV with their AirPods? I’m not sure, but Roku did add a headphone jack to its remote.

That's why companies like Apple and Google have developed their own respective "languages" for enabling these devices to stay in sync. But some argue that this interconnectivity hasn't completely solved the smart home's biggest issues. In order to get those benefits, consumers must choose one specific platform, like Apple's HomeKit or Google's Works With Nest, which could limit the choices they have when shopping for smart home products. Get the latest deals, reviews and recommendations from the editors of TIME: sign up for The Goods newsletter here Andy Rubin, the creator of Android and CEO of newly launched tech company Essential, is trying to change that. One of his company's first products is a voice-enabled smart home assistant called, appropriately enough, Home. He hopes to make the gadget compatible with any smart home device, regardless of whether it runs on an Apple, Google, or Samsung-operated platform. The trick, says Rubin, is to use application programming interfaces, or APIs, to create a sort of emulator that allow his product to support gadgets on different platforms. An API is a set of protocols that makes it possible for apps and services to integrate with one another. They make it possible to use your Facebook credentials to sign up for a new website, for instance. Read more: The 25 Best Apps of the Year So Far Speaking on stage at the Wired Business Conference on June 7, Rubin compared the various smart home platforms to individual islands, saying his product would provide a bridge between them. "If I can emulate [these islands], I can turn it on and control 100,000 devices," Rubin told reporters. Following Rubin's May announcement of Essential, observers have questioned whether it will be possible to create a device that can offer cross functionality between competing platforms. Such doubts Apple doubly so to Apple, which is known for keeping its software and hardware ecosystems closed. The iPhone maker only allowed third-party developers to integrate their apps with Siri and iMessage last year, long after rivals like Amazon and Facebook made similar moves. But alongside the rise of smart home technology, tech giants have shown an increasing willingness to allow their devices and software to play nice with others. Google recently debuted its Google Assistant on the iPhone, while Microsoft's Cortana has been on iPhone and Android since 2015. Amazon in particular says it's willing to embrace even deeper collaboration, saying it's open to the idea of making Alexa compatible with Siri. "You should be able to tell Alexa, 'Ask Siri X,'" David Limp, Amazon's senior vice president of devices, told reporters at the conference. "If Apple or Google want to call, my number is out there." Read more: Here's What Amazon Thinks About Apple's New Echo Rival Even if Rubin's gadget succeeds at building those aforementioned bridges, there are plenty of other ways smart home tech could stand to improve. Rubin says he's already thinking about how the installation and setup process can become more accessible to those who aren't tech-savvy. Companies like Control4 offer remote device installation and management services, but Rubin feels customers should be able to handle their gear on their own. "That's an outdated approach," said Rubin. "The [people] that are doing the user interface are the same ones drilling holes in your wall . . . So I need to change who the installer is, and I think we've developed enough technology to make it very easy."

Seeding developer-only betas of watchOS 4, tvOS 11 and macOS 10.13 at the beginning of the week, the company announced a number of features that would be landing on Apple Watch, Apple TV and Mac – come this fall. tvOS Like Amazon Prime Video, for example, which officially got the green light at this year’s WWDC and will see its launch on Apple’s streaming box – later this year. The arrival of the retailer’s popular video-on-demand service will follow months of toing and fro’ing between the Californian tech giant and Amazon over the rights to stream the service’s content to Apple TV users, and will come just a few weeks after a separate report (via MacRumors) pegged the video option as landing on the box – this Summer. More info iPhone + iPad Amazon Prime Video FREE watchOS Meanwhile, with watchOS 4, Apple says that its personal, fitness-driven wearable is more dialled in to you than ever before … “A smarter coach and workout partner, better in tune with your taste in music, and an even more proactive all-day assistant” make for a more intuitive, intelligent watchOS experience. Activity Starting with Activity, you’ll now receive personal progress updates from the moment you put Apple Watch on – meaning you can learn more about the achievements you’re about to close in on, or simply get encouragement to keep your current streak going … And in the evening, receive a boost at the end of the day as Apple Watch offers specific suggestions on how you can reach your goals. Monthly challenges will also help to keep you motivated – with Apple Watch now able to set personalised challenges based on what you accomplished last month. “Track your process anytime in the Activity app on iPhone,” Apple says… as it notes you can also enjoy new full-screen effects that get better and more intense the more you achieve. Workouts Set to make starting a workout as easy as just one tap, with its new custom heart-rate and motion monitoring Apple notes that watchOS 4 can now accurately track your calorie burn during your most toughest of cardio workouts. While the software’s updated ‘Pool Swim’ workout will automatically track sets and rests, as well as pace and for each set and distance for each stroke. Plus, it’s now even possible to switch the type of workout you’re doing (perfect for those multi-activity events) … and the upgrade will also see ‘Do Not Disturb’ automatically activated when you’re working out, so you can keep going without interruption. Perhaps the most major change in Workouts, though, is the coming support for something called Gym Sync. Set to take full advantage of Apple Watch’s hidden NFC sensor, you’ll soon be able to sync your Apple Watch with the physical equipment you most use at your local gym – and that means your most important metrics like heart rate, speed and calories, will be completely in sync. Music watchOS 4 is set to know a lot more of what you love, and hold more of it – Apple says. That is largely down to automatic sync now being included for both of Apple Music’s weekly curated playlists: My Favourite Mix and New Music Mix. All-Day Assistant Designed to elevate the current moment – while anticipating the next, Apple’s new Siri watch face to debut in watchOS 4 will proactively display the information you need, right when you need it. There’s also a new Siri complication. Of course, Apple’s enhancements don’t stop there. The new ‘Kaleidoscope’ face turns static images into “mesmerising, intertwining patterns,” says the company, as it notes that users can also control these effects through the Digital Crown … … and Disney Pixar fans will be excited to learn that they’ll soon see animated versions of Toy Story’s Woody, Buzz Lightyear and Jessie – right on their wrist. As part of its expansion of its ever-more-proactive assistant, Siri, watchOS 4 will in addition include support for sending payments person-to-person through Apple Pay … (More on that over here). While Apple News stories are gaining summary support. macOS A revision aimed at polishing the best parts of macOS Sierra, Apple describes macOS High Sierra (10.13) as containing new technologies, which -at their heart- will make your Mac more reliable, capable, and responsive …whilst also laying the foundation for future innovations. A new file system It starts with Apple File System. An advanced upgrade to the company’s desktop file system -originally introduced in iOS 10- APFS features 64‑bit architecture that is designed for today’s flash technology and ready for tomorrow’s new storage capabilities. Responsive to make common tasks like duplicating a file and finding the size of a folder’s contents happen instantly, the system is also safe and secure – allowing you to “enjoy even more peace of mind with built‑in encryption, crash‑safe protections, and simplified data backup on the go,” Apple says. Video HEVC is the new standard for video in High Sierra. Citing that the format can compress video up to 40 percent more than H.264, HEVC takes up less space on your Mac, while preserving the same visual quality – Apple notes. Graphics Next is Metal 2. Today’s Mac experience relies more than ever on the graphics processor (GPU) in your computer. And GPUs are becoming more and more powerful. Metal is a technology built into macOS that allows apps to unleash the full power of the GPU. Metal 2 is described as not only taking the visual experience to the next level, but also adding capabilities like machine learning, virtual reality, and external GPU support for entertainment and professional creative apps. “Whether you play games, create content, or develop software, Metal 2 provides the power to bring your imagination to life,” Apple explains. Photos There’s a lot to love in Photos, too: An expanded sidebar. At the center of everything. Quickly find what you’re looking for with the always‑on sidebar. An expanded Import view shows all of your past imports in chronological order, so you can go right to last month’s vacation photos. And the albums you make are always where you can see them. Now you can organize your photos in a flash. Instantly filter photo collections by your favorite criteria. A new selection counter keeps track of what you’ve selected, and lets you drag and drop collected images into an album or export them to the desktop. You can also rotate and favorite batches of images right from the toolbar. Perfect your best shots with advanced editing tools. Easily make sophisticated contrast and color adjustments to your photos with powerful tools like Curves for fine‑tuning and Selective Color to make any color more saturated. And new, professionally inspired filters let you quickly give your pictures a distinctive look. Bring even more life to your Live Photos. When editing a Live Photo, try the new Loop effect to turn it into a looping video that you can experience again and again. Try Bounce to play the action forward and backward. Or choose Long Exposure for a beautiful DSLR‑like effect to blur water or extend light trails. You can also trim, mute, and select a key photo for each Live Photo. Relive your favorite moments with new Memories. macOS High Sierra introduces more than a dozen new Memories categories — including pets, babies, outdoor activities, performances, weddings, birthdays, and sporting events — for even more personal and meaningful moments. The People album gets even better with faces. Easily find your favorite subjects in the People album with larger image thumbnails and more accurate groupings. And when you use iCloud Photo Library, your album stays up to date on all your devices. You can find out more about what’s new in macOS High Sierra – at Apple.com.

From minor (processor upgrades to the current line of MacBooks) to major (Apple's very own smart speaker). While professional creatives lusted after the new, powerful iMacs, for everyone else there was a more interesting proposition: the iPad Pro, with a new size, more storage and the promise of more power. 10.5-inches the better choice? What differentiates the second generation of iPad Pros from last year's pioneering batch is that the smaller size now has a 10.5-inch display, a modest but important bump from 9.7-inches. Why does the size matter? The previous 9.7-inches was called far too small a space to do proper work. Watch a video, maybe. Play with apps, of course. But the bigger 12.9-inch option was only appealing to those who were already used to working with larger tablets for creative work. Anyone not a designer or photographer, graphic artist or illustrator, would not be so keen on such a big device. The 10.5-inch display of the newer, smaller iPad Pro is not just wider but the bezel is thinner. Just wide enough to grip but offering so much more glass to look at. Enough to view a document comfortably and with the new Apple wireless keyboard, an alternative to Apple's Microsoft Surface devices. Why an iPad? What the Microsoft Surface offers is a tablet with power as well as portable, usable keyboard with support for an active digitiser pen. The iPad Pro also has its own Pencil, one that you wish would come with the iPhone. An iPhone with a Pencil would likely steal thunder from Samsung's Galaxy Note series. One can dream, no? The iPad Pro offers one benefit over the Surface: It's light. Just about 469 grammes for the lightest model, which still manages to store 64GB of storage. While it doesn't come with its own keyboard cover, there are plenty of third-party options as well as Apple's own Bluetooth keyboard. You could say it offers more flexibility that way. Not being able to install PC programs is not as much a hindrance as before. Microsoft now makes native versions of its Office suite for the iPad, and the new paradigm where documents are stored in the cloud has become a necessity as well as a norm. Why settle for a purely cloud-based device such as a Chromebook PC which only really works with the cloud? The iPad works well offline and on, though you will need to learn a new workflow and get used to the iOS' quirks. Finally, multitasking What really makes the iPad different this time around is iOS 11. The latest update to Apple's operating system has finally added a proper dock as well as the ability to run more than one app at a time, side by side, on the same screen. No more having to flip through various windows — you can now get the apps you use most all along the bottom of the screen and with the increased space, you can see and access the apps in a simple flip. What is most attractive is the drag and drop feature — I found it easy to swipe one picture from a webpage into an email or from an email to my notes. Then I could create various little spaces, each with their own app combos and switch easily from one to another. However, the software was buggy in the beginning; it was easier to drag single objects such as pictures or links, as compared to selecting text from passages. As iOS 11 will only be launched properly in the Fall, the bugs should have been ironed out by then. It is possible to try out iOS earlier, by downloading the developer's beta but for most people it would be better to wait for the final release in Fall. The most powerful iPad yet Apple fitted its new A10x processor into the iPad — a processor that offers power to rival midrange desktops. As slight overkill, the iPad even has the same camera as found on the iPhone 7. With all its potential, for most people, the iPad Pro does offer a compelling alternative to the usual ultrabook or midrange notebook. Yet for people who rely on specific Windows apps, specialised ones with no native version for the iOS, the iPad Pro might not prove a real laptop replacement... yet. What is certain is that with the new software, hardware and design upgrade, the iPad Pro is a compelling alternative to the Microsoft Surface while still proving to be better than any Android tablet in the market. The iPad Pro's pricing starts at RM2,999 for the 10.5-inch model and RM3,499 for the 12.9-inch model. Availability has yet to be confirmed in Malaysia, but if you can't wait then head on over to neighbouring Singapore's Apple Store where the iPad Pro will be available in the coming weeks.                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week An iPad that properly challenges the Microsoft Surface AI gets so-so grade in Chinese university entrance exam Facebook launches disaster maps to help aid workers save lives Cracked screen woes?

 Apple is threatening Facebook's best hopes for monetizing messenger Evan Niu, The Motley Fool Jun. 8, 2017, 7:30 PM 2,626 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook AP Apple didn't talk about it at all during its WWDC 2017 opening keynote, but Facebook better be paying attention. The Mac maker has added a new section to its developer site that details a feature called Business Chat that will make its way into iMessage. It's pretty much exactly what it sounds like: Apple hopes to connect businesses to customers directly within the core Messages app. Here's Apple's description: "Business Chat is a powerful new way for your customers to get answers to their questions, learn about and purchase your products, and engage with your existing support channels. Integrated into Messages and discoverable through Maps, Siri, Search, as well as your own app and website, Business Chat helps you build persistent, long-lasting relationships with your customers." This precisely targets Facebook's best hopes for monetizing its growing Messenger platform, which now boasts over 1.2 billion monthly active users (MAUs). The social age of customer service Modern mobile consumers have increasingly turned to social media channels to interact with businesses or ask for free chicken nuggets, a trend that largely started on Twitter. Apple officially launched its own Twitter support account, @AppleSupport, early last year, but many businesses had already hopped on the bandwagon. Firing off a few tweets when you're seeking support is a whole lot easier than calling in and navigating an annoying phone tree. Facebook is a uniquely ideal platform for these types of interactions, in part because of its real-name policy that makes it easier for a business to know who it is interacting with. Anonymous Twitter trolls aren't worth paying attention to (in more ways than one). Facilitating customer support is also a key reason why Facebook is pushing so hard with Messenger chatbots, since automation will be utterly critical to scaling. Conceptually, sending messages to businesses on a unified platform has a lot of appeal, far more than the outdated model of seeing pop-up chat prompts when you visit a company's website, or being directed to a bloated support forum to dig up answers on your own. At what cost? Apple will detail its Business Chat plans further later this week when it streams a WWDC live session on June 9, but it remains to be seen if the company will outline the economics. Will Apple attempt to charge businesses for implementing Business Chat? Or will it offer Business Chat as a free developer tool that any company can use to integrate directly into iMessage with no fee? If Apple chooses the latter, since it has no need to monetize such an offering, we could be talking about really disrupting Facebook's burgeoning efforts to offer the exact same thing for a price.

Print Story X Print Story Business June 8, 2017 Share Advertisement Apple makes iPhone screen fixes easier as states mull repair laws SAN FRANCISCO: Hey Siri, where can I get my cracked iPhone screen fixed?Apple Inc customers will soon have more choices as the company looks to reduce long wait times for iPhone repairs at its retail stores. By the end of 2017, Apple will to put its proprietary machines for mending cracked iPhone glass in about 400 authorized third-party repair centers in 25 countries, company executives told Reuters. Among the first recipients is Minneapolis-based Best Buy, which has long sold and serviced Apple products. The electronics retailer already has one of the screen-repair machines at a Miami-area store and one coming soon to an outlet in Sunnyvale, California. Fixing cracked screens may seem like small potatoes, but it´s a multi-billion-dollar global business. The move is also a major shift for Apple. The company had previously restricted use of its so-called Horizon Machine to its nearly 500 retail stores and mail-in repair centers; and it has guarded its design closely. The change also comes as eight U.S. states have launched "right to repair" bills aimed at prying open the tightly controlled repair networks of Apple and other high-tech manufacturers. Apple said legislative pressure was not a factor in its decision to share its technology. It allowed Reuters to view and photograph the machines in action at a lab near its Cupertino, California headquarters. Until now, Apple had never formally acknowledged the Horizon Machine´s existence. The initial rollout aims to put machines in 200, or about 4 percent, of Apple´s 4,800 authorized service providers worldwide over the next few months. The company plans to double that figure by the end of the year. "We´ve been on a quest to expand our reach," said Brian Naumann, senior director of service operations at Apple. He said repair wait times have grown at some of the company´s busiest retail stores. Pilot testing started a year ago. In addition to Miami, a few machines already are operating at third-party repair centers in the Bay Area, London, Shanghai and Singapore.   Advertisement Comments Comment Advertisement Topstory Qatar crisis: Pakistan ready for mediation Interior, defence secretaries will go to jail: IHC PPP to stand by institutions if PML-N confronts them Xi, Putin fail to arrange Nawaz-Modi meeting Attackers of Haideri killed in Mastung operation: ISPR View more... see all opinions Opinion Aijaz Zaka Syed Human shields and sacred cow Hussain H Zaidi The anatomy of trade deficits Kamila Hyat Finding the right friends Shahzad Chaudhry More vision wasted Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani A matter of responsibility David W Pear Never surrender see all opinions Newspost Cost of fasting Out of power Plastic bags Loadshedding Combating terrorism View more... see all opinions Editorial Terror comes to Tehran In touch with nature View more... see all opinions National Book building for PSX’s public offering extended for another day Punjab PA continues discussion on budget Govt to move for appointing SBP governor after budget approval Gas utilities seek Rs93-Rs114 per mmbtu tariff rise LHCBA again demands PM’s resignation View more... see all opinions World Nepal bans Polish climber over illegal Everest traverse Bahrain says it too will jail Qatar sympathisers Yangon censors bars Rakhine documentary Blast hits US embassy in Kiev China to bar foreign climbers from Everest’s Tibet side View more... see all opinions Sports Pakistan hope to do even better after stunning mighty SA Sri Lanka Lions stun India at Oval Lehmann wants ODIs to be more ‘liberal’ during rain delays Smith heaps praise on ‘clever’ Pakistan Sarfraz hails fan factor View more... see all opinions Business FPCCI warns anti-government action if demands not accepted US jobless claims drop; labour market slack shrinking IT ministry seeks cabinet’s approval to roll out 5G UAE re-imposes port ban on Qatari-linked oil tankers SECP notifies draft rules View more... see all opinions Karachi Cosmopolitan Karachi’s development warrants Rs30 billion: MQM-P Govt told to comment on plea against military court verdict Robbers injure another man for resistance Corps commander urges coordination to rehabilitate errant youths PS-114 by-poll candidates to be finalised by June 17 View more... see all opinions Lahore Over 1.1m rotten eggs seized, destroyed ‘Cut prices instead of Ramazan bazaars subsidy’ Gas supply disconnection ordered Youth killed in roof collapse Scattered rain predicted View more... see all opinions Islamabad Intriguing bias in implementation of Interior Ministry directions Temperatures in southern parts to be slightly above normal Saira shares her ministry’s four-year achievements FDE forms online complaint cell Pakistan ranking improves by four points in WEF View more... see all opinions Peshawar see all opinions Advertisement PRIVACY POLICY | CONTACT US | BACK ISSUES © 2017 THE NEWS INTERNATIONAL Back To Top

In the '50s, however, you couldn't just render your idea and post it on a website. You needed to make your pitch artwork by hand. Which is exactly what Walt Disney and artist Herb Ryman did, inking a piece of vellum with a vision of what would become The Happiest Place On Earth. Vellum doesn't travel well, however, so they transferred and then hand-colored the drawing onto the piece you see here. This 1953 Disneyland Presentation Map was carried by Roy Disney to New York and used in his pitch that secured the funding for the park. It's visible in the background of several photographs of Walt from that era and was eventually given to his friend Grenade Curran, who kept it out of public view for the last sixty years.

While George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is an undisputed literary classic, and also served as the basis for the greatest television ad of all-time, its themes of public manipulation and government surveillance seem especially poignant in recent days. Despite being first released in 1949, it's currently the best-selling book on Amazon, and its publisher just ordered another 75,000 copies. These first-editions are likely to become even more collectible as the years go on, but if they're a little more than you typically spend on dead trees, we'd recommend the recent Penguin Modern Classics edition, with a cover design from David Pearson that's among the best we've ever seen.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple At WWDC 2017, Apple proved it hasn’t forgotten about its pro users Yoni Heisler BGR News June 7, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share One of the more interesting narratives to surround Apple in recent years holds that the company has either forgotten or simply doesn’t care about pro users anymore. This narrative can arguably be traced back to the company’s 2013 Mac Pro design and only picked up steam following the release of Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar. As a quick refresher, Apple’s flagship MacBook Pro was derided for being overpriced and under-powered, with many users lamenting the fact that Apple’s pro-oriented machine could only support 16GB of RAM. In fact, the backlash against Apple was so strong that Tim Cook and other executives were forced to confront the criticism head on, with Cook stating the following during a company shareholder meeting earlier this year: “You will see us do more in the pro area. The pro area is very important to us. The creative area is very important to us in particular.” Don't Miss: New leak claims to reveal final iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s Plus designs Just two months later, Apple executives held a special meeting with select tech outlets where they assured developers and creative professionals that new and advanced pro-oriented hardware was in the product pipeline. Not only did Apple relay that a completely redesigned Mac Pro was on the way, but Phil Schiller made a point of noting that the company was working on iMac configurations developed “specifically with the pro customer in mind.” True to form, Apple at WWDC 2017 demonstrated that its pro users have a lot to look forward to. Aside from supercharging its iPad lineup, Apple updated the entirety of its MacBook line with speedier Kaby Lake processors and faster SSDs. Further, some of Apple’s notebooks will now feature more powerful graphics. Apple on Monday also took some time to refresh its iMac lineup, gracing its iconic all-in-one machine with more memory and faster processors. Of course, the star of show — at least as it pertains to the Mac — was Apple’s iMac Pro. Priced at $4,999 with an option to max the machine out with 18 core Xeon processors, Apple’s brand new iMac is a clear indication that Apple has decidedly not forgotten about its pro user base. In a nutshell, Apple’s upcoming iMac Pro is an absolute monster of a machine. And though the iMac Pro won’t ship until December, the fact that Apple announced it so far in advance was a subtle nod to users who have grown impatient with slower product upgrades over the years. In other words, the current MacBook and iMac upgrades and the forthcoming iMac Pro update sends a clear message that Apple not only has exciting new hardware today, but even more exciting and powerful hardware coming down the pipeline. And that’s not even to speak of a revamped Mac Pro which, if we’re lucky, will be unveiled sometime next year. WWDC 2017 may not have been the most exciting keynote we’ve ever seen, but for any consumers who has been patiently waiting for a solid improvement to the Mac, Monday’s keynote was nothing short of encouraging.

Apple's Upgrades To Location And Photo Privacy Features Are Pretty Great Kate Conger Jun 9, 2017, 9:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple privacy video feature wwdc wwdc 17 Share Apple is making changes to the way apps get information about users' location and photos, giving users more control over what data they share and when they share it. Photo: Getty These are the changes that are coming in iOS 11: All apps that use location data will be required to offer an "only when using" option, instead of just "always" and "never". (Uber was criticised last year for removing the "only when using" option.) Apps will be able to access single photos from a user's library, rather than their entire photo history, and will be given write-only privileges so that users can save images from an app without granting it complete Camera Roll access. "Users appreciate being able to navigate the world and find interesting places through their iOS device. At the same time, we want users to always be in control of their privacy," Apple privacy engineer Georgios Kontaxis said at the company's WWDC conference earlier this week. Users are already celebrating Apple's decision to force apps to offer an "only when using" option for location data. Kontaxis' announcement was met with applause, and developers who have installed the iOS 11 beta are praising the change on Twitter. 🚨 iOS 11 *FORCES* option for GPS access “Only While Using the App” even when apps don’t offer it! Suck it Uber. pic.twitter.com/op1siQ8rZz — Ryan Jones (@rjonesy) June 6, 2017 The changes to photo access haven't been as widely celebrated, but they're pretty exciting as well. With today's operating system, you have to grant an app access to your entire photo library just to put a single filter on a dumb selfie. But once iOS 11 is widely available, you can filter to your heart's content without worrying if whatever app you're using has the security capability to protect your nudes. "Users will be able to open a photo in your app without the need for you to prompt for access to their entire photos library. This will make them more comfortable using your app because they will have better control over their data," Kontaxis explained. Apps will also be given the option to request write-only privileges to a user's photo library, Kontaxis said. Users could take advantage of this option in scenarios where they want to save images from a service, without uploading or sharing any images of their own.

Those stocks — Chipotle, Apple, Netflix, Deckers, Intuitive Surgical, Express Scripts, and Salesforce.com — are up 281 percent on average since he formed the acronym in 2010, versus 121 percent for the S&P 500 index. And while Deckers and Express Scripts turned out to be disappointing, Cramer said that Apple, which has run 312 percent since CANDIES formed, with a 34 percent rise in 2017 alone, gets too much heat from analysts for its alleged lack of innovation. "I think Apple's innovated well beyond what anyone else has done in the consumer space and the quality has only improved with each new iteration [and] each new product," Cramer said. "Apple may not be the greatest tech company ever, but it's clearly the best consumer products manufacturer in history, by a long shot. What's wrong with that?" Jacob Kepler | Bloomberg | Getty Images Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive officer and co-founder of Nvidia, speaks at an International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Then, on a day where the major averages inched up, seemingly unphased by the congressional hearing of former FBI Director James Comey, Cramer found a different story worth noting. "I think the story is much less about Director Comey versus President [Donald] Trump than it is about two stocks: Nvidia versus Nordstrom," the "Mad Money" host said. "I know, I know. Only I could really boil down a constitutional crisis into two stocks, but that's alright. They're jumping. I can do it because as riveting as the Comey testimony was, to me it means only one thing: forget about Washington ... if you're looking for anything good." While the hearing is bad for Trump's pro-business economic agenda, Wall Street was focused on these two other stories, which Cramer said represent the conflict of growth versus value. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Cramer also went off the tape and sat down with David Yeom, the co-founder and CEO of online bargain retailer Hollar, to see how the privately held dollar store is faring in the internet realm. "We have been just pounding the pavement, working with amazing suppliers and sourcing just unbelievable products," Yeom told Cramer on Thursday, highlighting the company's ability to offer products like the fidget spinner at competitively low prices. And as the company rides what Yeom called a "macro trend" of bargain buying in the otherwise bleak world of retail, the CEO said that Hollar is perfectly positioned to benefit from two of the struggling industry's most popular segments. "There's really two things working in retail right now, and that's online and off-price, and we're doing both. And we're chasing after a consumer group, really Middle America millennials, that's really been under-served for a long time," Yeom said. Misha Friedman | Bloomberg | Getty Images Joey Levin, chief executive officer of IAC/InterActiveCorp, left, speaks as Barry Diller, chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp, listens during a conference in New York on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016. Although its stock has doubled over the past year and rallied over 64 percent in 2017, InterActive Corporation does not get enough love from the market, Jim Cramer says. "It's because IAC is a confusing conglomerate of online businesses that people simply don't understand. They don't know how IAC is structured, and more importantly, they can't keep track of what IAC even owns," the "Mad Money" host said. So Cramer broke down the business to find the key to its soaring stock and how IAC has kept creating value over the years under the leadership of Chairman and Senior Executive Barry Diller. Inovio Pharmaceuticals: Confidence in DNA Finally, Cramer sat down with Joseph Kim, the president and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals, to hear more about the rise of the speculative biotechnology play that focuses on DNA-based therapies for cancer and other infectious diseases. Kim told Cramer on Thursday that despite the company's relatively small market capitalization, it has managed to stay efficient in developing and testing their cutting-edge treatments. "We're very focused and we're very good at what we do, but also, it's our technology platform," the CEO said. "It's a very innovative way of jump-charging a patient's own immune system, and we can do this very rapidly and effectively." And although the company is small, it has partnered with pharmaceutical giants like AstraZeneca's Medimmune, Regeneron and Roche's Genentech to continue developing its medicines, Kim said, adding that his confidence about Inovio's future is not unfounded. "The confidence isn't out of ignorance, it's really based on our data. We have about 1,000 patients' worth of strong and potent immune responses already recorded across our early trials," he told Cramer. "While we're still growing, this is a wonderful platform that's been validated with a lot of these data." Lightning Round: I See your Anheuser-Busch, and I Raise You... In Cramer's lightning round, he flew through his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: Anheuser-Busch InBev NV: "I like it, but I have to tell you, I'll see your Anheuser Busch InBev and I'll raise you a Constellation Brands. By the way, I didn't that Molson Coors report yesterday at all." BlackBerry: "No, it's already moved so much. Intellectual property can only get you so far. We missed that one. Let's find the next."

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: A Market Foolery Picnic With Soda, Beer, and (Silicon) Chips The guys are checking in with the latest on Coke, Pepsi, Ambarella, and more. Chris Hill (TMFWizard) Jun 8, 2017 at 6:45PM On this episode of Market Foolery, Chris Hill is joined by Motley Fool analyst Jason Moser as they discuss the reasons why video chip specialist Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) took a hit post-earnings; why an analyst downgrade of both Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) came with two very different messages; and what the outlook is for craft beer leader Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM). And for something fun, the pair also talk about the all-time highs being set by Dave & Buster's (NASDAQ:PLAY) and its long-term prospects. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on June 7, 2017. Chris Hill: It's Wednesday, June 7th. Welcome to Market Foolery. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me in studio today, from Million Dollar Portfolio, Jason Moser. How are you? Jason Moser: I'm doing great. How about you? Hill: I'm good. I was saying just before we started, we're having a very social video kind of week here on Market Foolery. Yesterday we did a Facebook Live. Moser: It's a social world. Hill: It is. And today, this is being video streamed on the Twitter via Periscope. Moser: Why not? We have people who follow us on Twitter. Hill: We do. We love the listeners, we love all of our listeners. A question we get from time to time is, do you do much editing on the podcast? How long does it take? And generally, we like to think of these as one-take productions. We want to make this as easy for our producer, Dan Boyd, as possible, so we try to make sure there's no editing involved. But the way to see for yourself whether or not there's any editing involved is you can come by Fool HQ, as anyone is welcome to do, to catch a taping. Or you can be on Twitter while we're doing this. Moser: And we get that question a lot. I think that's the good part about having worked together for so long. You kind of get into a groove and know how to respond to each other's questions and answers and jokes and whatnot, and you can make these things happen without having to do too much cutting up. Hill: Exactly. So, we're going to go heavy on beverages today. We're going to talk about the beer industry, we're going to talk about the soda industry. We have to start with Ambarella, which is one of the biggest losers on the NASDAQ today. This is the chip maker, key supplier to GoPro. Ambarella's first quarter results looked OK, but their guidance for the current quarter is what sent Wall Street headed for the exits. Moser: Yeah, I think you pretty much said it in a nutshell there, key supplier to GoPro. So that should probably have you running in the other direction on its own. Hill: Not key supplier to Apple. Moser: [laughs] And I think what we saw it with a company like InvenSense is that if you are a supplier to Apple, that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be all sunshine and lollipops, either. But with Ambarella, we talk a lot about trying to learn from mistakes, learn from businesses past and see why history might not repeat itself. It certainly rhymes in some cases. I think we may be seeing that same sort of thing playing out here with Ambarella as we saw with InvenSense. We owned Ambarella for a time in Million Dollar Portfolio. it was an interesting company. We thought there was a lot of potential there because of this move toward video, because of the fact that they were such a key supplier to GoPro. And that story quickly changed once we saw GoPro falling off the cliff. Ambarella, really sort of the one-two punch there. Not only are they getting hit on that supply side as a provider of chips to GoPro, but the problem with this technology, they have these systems on a chip hardware that they're selling, they're constantly having to figure out ways to innovate and get better. There's always someone out there in this space that comes up with some sort of new technology that's a little bit better, a little bit faster, it produces a better picture, whatever it may be. So we sold in MDP, because we saw this picture where sales growth was starting to slow down. And typically, with a company like this, when sales growth starts to slow down, they're going to have to start conceding a little bit on pricing in order to get that product out there. And when you're conceding on your pricing in any capacity, and the company that you're supplying a lot of your product to is really seeing a major slowdown as well, those margins start getting squeezed pretty hard, too. And that's what has the market really down today on the stock. I think the biggest problem is the forward-looking picture. While the quarter itself wasn't all that bad -- I think they actually beat expectations on both fronts -- it's the picture going forward, and the market is starting to look at this and say, woah, maybe this is something where the path to success isn't quite as clear or as bright as perhaps we once thought? I really can't help but think this is going to be another InvenSense story. I don't know that it's a stock that I'd put up there as one I'd want to buy, because it's such a tough space. Scale is really the biggest advantage in this business. Ambarella, InvenSense, those are not companies that have that scale when you compare them to companies like Intel or Qualcomm. Hill: So we get this question a lot, about entry point, what you're going to pay for a stock. And a lot of times, the question comes in the form of, I really like company X, the stock keeps going up, should I buy now or wait for a pullback so I can get a better entry point? You don't look at Ambarella falling 10% today and say ... unless it's just a really small -- Moser: I think, if you want to look at it from that perspective, you need to be able to identify the catalyst that's going to take this thing in the other direction. The problem is, that's not so easy to recognize, especially when it comes to technology like this, because it's really difficult to see what new technology is coming down the pike. That's not really what we specialize in, and not a lot of people are so capable to see around the corner. So I tend to look at something like this and think, it's not even like it's that cheap of a stock still, when you look at the fact that sales are slowing down and margins are being squeezed a little bit. This is one of those where you think, maybe there's a value trap here where, yeah, it's nice to buy on dips, but make sure that when you buy on that dip that there's a catalyst that gets this thing going back in the other direction. I just don't know that we can identify the catalyst with Ambarella today. Hill: Dave & Buster's is hitting a new high after first quarter profits came in higher than expected. Their same-store sales were a little over 2%. That was lower than analysts were looking for. I get that, but I look at this environment, I look at the restaurant space, and I think the stronger headline is, Dave & Buster's had positive comps. Moser: Yes. You can't argue with that. It was 2.2% comps in the face of a restaurant industry right now that is having a difficult time figuring out what direction it needs to head. Again, we go back to what we were talking about with InvenSense and Ambarella, I think that on the surface, Dave and Buster's had a nice quarter here. Most of that growth on the top line came from opening new stores, though, even though they had positive comps. Really, most of that growth came from new stores. When we look at Dave and Buster's today, they have about 100 stores, and they see their opportunity in North America, the U.S. and Canada, as about 200 stores. So, they're basically halfway there. We're watching something play out here already with Buffalo Wild Wings. Sally Smith leaving notwithstanding, before that news came out, we knew that Buffalo Wild Wings was starting to hit a little bit of a ceiling there as far as growth goes. So, identifying what is it that's separated Buffalo Wild Wings for so long? And it wasn't the food, it was the experience. It was the fact that you could go into one of those restaurants and there were going to be 60 TVs and they were showing you virtually any game you wanted to see. I would make the argument, and I've never been to Dave & Buster's, but I don't think what separates them is the food. I think it's pretty replicable. What separates them is the experience. That's why we see 55% or so of their revenue coming from the Amusements side of that business. So it's an experience-based story. And I think what you have to look at here is, based on the market opportunity, how many stores they had to open, it's maybe 100 more. Perhaps that's a little bit of an overestimation, too. I think a lot of times these companies overestimate the actual market opportunity. They're going to open probably 10 stores a year, so it's going to take them 8 to 10 years to get there, if that prediction is actually correct. Again, when you look at what separates them, just being the experience, and given all of the dollars that are out there competing for our attention today in the entertainment space, I don't know that I look at Dave & Buster's as necessarily the most attractive opportunity to go for. I appreciate that they've done well to this point. But again, with investing, we're looking forward. And you have to be thinking five years down the line, what does this company look like? Five years down the line, they probably have 150 stores, maybe a little bit less or a little bit more. But I don't know necessarily that at that point in time the market is going to be looking at this and saying, yeah, this is just a revolutionary company that is changing the face -- I mean, restaurants are a very difficult business, especially to really gain a tremendously loyal following. So need experience, I think they're doing a lot of good things to get the business where it is today. I look at what they're doing right now with repurchasing shares, and I have to push back on them a little. I hate to see a company this young in its public life buying back as much stock as they're buying back. Hill: I was surprised by that, too. And it's not like they're buying a ton of stock, but just the fact that they're buying any, and as you said, as young a company as it is, I saw that in the release and I was like, wait, why are they spending $1 repurchasing stock? Moser: I don't know. I think sometimes these young management teams think that it creates a shareholder-friendly headline. People generally look at that and their first take is like, "Oh, they're buying back shares, it must be a compelling value. Shareholder friendly management team there." We've seen, there's all sorts of proof out there that, for the most part, management teams tend to get share buybacks wrong. And it's very clear, these guys are buying back shares of the stock at an all-time high, they have net debt on the balance sheet, and they still have a lot of growth that they need to fund. I just don't think it's a good decision. I don't like seeing it. So for me, that's almost the nail in the coffin. I feel like, if I'm going to invest in a restaurant, this isn't going to be the first one I touch. Hill: And as we often say, if you're buying back stock, sometimes that's an indication that you don't have a better idea of what to do with that money. And when you look at the debt and the opportunity in terms of opening stores -- and I'm not even suggesting that Dave & Buster's should be looking to ramp up in a significant way the speed with which they are opening new locations. But just sock that away. Even if you just put it toward paying off a little bit of that debt. Now, on the flip side, give them credit for their margins, because they grew their margins. And yeah, 55% is coming from the Amusements side. They also sell alcohol. And that's always high margin. Moser: Yeah, I think you're right there.  Hill: Unless you're doing it wrong. If you're selling alcohol and you're not doing it in a high margin way, you're doing it wrong. Moser: They are doing a lot of things right. And they do have a good loyalty program that I think brings back customers. Again, though, it's a business that requires a lot of capital, because they have to stock those restaurants with all sorts of games and entertainment devices and whatnot. So they're not cheap to open. And like you said, I think at this point in the game, there's got to be something more you can do with that money than just buying back stock at all-time highs. And then you look at the balance sheet and you actually look at the share count outstanding, it's going up, not down. So all things considered, if we look at comparable there with Chipotle, when we're talking about buying back shares, we put Chipotle through the wringer here over the last 18 months, and they deserved it. They screwed up big time. And it took them a little while to actually come to grips with it and communicate it well. But all throughout that, they did a really good job of buying back that stock at seriously depressed levels. So in hindsight, when we look at what Chipotle did in buying back a lot of their shares, assuming this recovery continues and there are no more health scares, that would be considered a very shrewd use of capital. Also, when you consider, they have a stacked-with-cash balance sheet with no real debt to speak of. So those are the two ends of the spectrum there. Chipotle is certainly a much more mature company, whereas Dave & Buster's is not. Yeah, like you said, I think there's probably a better use for that capital. Hill: BMO Capital put out a note this morning downgrading both Pepsi and Coca-Cola, and I wanted to get your thoughts on this, because what struck me was how very clear the analysts at BMO Capital were about differentiating between the two businesses, even though both were downgraded slightly. They went out of their way to say, essentially, "We think Pepsi can grow earnings, and we don't think Coca-Cola can. We look at Coca-Cola as essentially a safety stock. It's a stock where you can park your money and you're going to do better than bonds, and you might get a little appreciation, but mainly you're going to get a dividend. But we don't view it the same as Pepsi." And on the one hand, I agree with that. And somehow, I'm still a little surprised at that, only because for so long, we have looked at these two businesses together in tandem. That at various points in their history, one has outperformed the other. But this is the first time I can think of where there's this real divergence and the stock appreciation run is over for Coca-Cola. Moser: There's an argument to be made there.  Hill: They're making it. Moser: I tend to agree with that. For a long time, perhaps it was my Georgia roots had me favoring Coca-Cola, just because for so long it's been such a no-brainer and such a big winner. But to your point there, I do think that Coca-Cola has become sort of like the IBM type stock where anybody can go buy it. You're not going to sit there and thumb your nose at it. You're going to be like, "Oh, you bought Coca-Cola. It's a great American brand, tremendous distribution, global presence, you'll probably do just fine." It's not going to be some terribly appreciative stock, but it's going to be one where you get a dividend. I think that Pepsi, on the other hand, certainly has more opportunity, particularly when considering the diversity of the business on the food side, the salty snacks, and I think Quaker is a part of it, is that right? Hill: Yeah. Part of Frito-Lay. Moser: Yeah. I think the Frito-Lay side of the business really offers them a lot of additional incremental revenue opportunity that maybe Coca-Cola doesn't see today. I will say, the one catalyst that could be there for Coca-Cola down the line is this Honest Tea brand they own. And Honest Tea just started out as just tea. They are building that business out. It's becoming a more and more important driver of the business as time goes on. They are going to be rolling out more and more in the way of food. That could certainly be a nice little catalyst. Now, Coca-Cola is a very big business, and it's not going to be something that impacts the bottom line overnight. But I think if you gave me the choice between these two stocks today, I would go with Pepsi, because I do think there's a bit more upside opportunity in the stock, while still reeling in a nice dividend. And, hey, I love the salty snacks, Chris. I'm just a salty snacks kind of guy. Hill: And they didn't go out of their way to say this, but part of my takeaway from reading through this was, maybe Coca-Cola no longer has a place in your stock portfolio, but you can make a pretty good case that it can replace your bonds. That if you have any sort of bonds that you're holding on to, Coca-Cola isn't going away, and it's going to be safe, and you are going to get that dividend and you're going to get a better return than with a 10-year Treasury. Moser: Yeah. And I don't want listeners or viewers to hear us talking about this and think, "Now I have to sell my Coca-Cola or my Pepsi." These were downgrades from one firm from market-outperform to market-perform. These were essentially valuation-based downgrades. So let's remember that, let's keep it all in perspective. I think they're based more on the shorter-term price targets as opposed to the longer-term fundamentals of the business. These are still very good businesses with tremendous brands, tremendous distribution networks, and by far and away, tremendous global footprint on both sides. They're good holdings. But yeah, they're not going to be the same type of growth story that perhaps they were a decade ago. But they can still be very good bedrock holdings if you have them. Hill: Our email address is marketfoolery@fool.com. From Sal Miragliotta in the 908 -- I think that's Jersey. "The last two years have not been kind to Boston Beer shareholders as we have seen the stock drop below $150 a share. I've been waiting/hoping for a big move out of Boston Beer, and I've seen nothing. They've sat on the sidelines as big brewers gobble up small craft brewers. Their strategy of 'wait until the small guys die' won't pan out if there's a chance those guys are sent life preservers with motors so they can expand and distribute through the big guys. The successful ones are being purchased for amazing sums of money. What are your thoughts? I used to trust Management's direction, but I am becoming increasingly concerned for a company with virtually no debt. I would love to see them invest in small craft brewers, whether through buying out or ownership stakes." That's a great question, particularly in the wake of what we were talking about with, how do companies use money? Because we love to look at businesses, but as we say all the time, people are running these businesses, and one of the decisions these people make running the businesses is, how do they allocate capital? And in the case of Boston Beer, we've talked about this before, some have gone out and said, "Hey, Ballast Point, we'll spend a billion dollars on that." So, you can applaud Boston Beer for not taking out a huge checkbook and doing that. But to Sal's point, they have the money. Moser: They do. Hill: So I guess my first question is, he's starting to waver on management. Where are you on Boston Beer's management right now, in terms of what you've seen over the last couple of years? Moser: Sal, as a shareholder of Boston Beer myself, I feel your pain. I would say to you -- this has been a very frustrating investment from the perspective of, it's becoming more and more apparent that founder Jim Koch is more inclined to just batten down the hatches and ride this storm out, versus trying to get it there and actively do something to make something happen. I think we've been hit with this tremendous craft beer revolution, so to speak. And what it's done is taken craft beer to the local level, which has been great if you're a beer fan, because there's all sorts of local flavors out there, and people really enjoy being able to support their own local breweries. And I think there's a future where Boston Beer exists. But it's hard for me to see the case for buying shares today, because I think it's going to take a while for anything to happen. Jim Koch's thrown some clues out there, at least, that he's going to wait this thing out. He talked about an example with Corona at a point in time where over the past eight years, Corona's depletions had been down, and they only got back to their 2006 to 2007 levels recently. So they more or less just kept on investing in the brand and waiting it out, and volumes came back eventually. But that took a lot of time. And obviously, Corona is not just one brand, it's part of Constellation, which owns a lot of brands including Ballast Point. Let's be clear, buying Ballast Point for $1 billion was absolutely unreasonable. Now, if you are a Ballast Point owner, you have to take that deal. You just have to take that deal. Craft roots be damned, that's $1 billion, you can't turn that down.  So from Koch's perspective, he is very much a craft beer guy. I don't think he wants to become part of something bigger. And there's been a lot of good literature out there recently about craft beer, and how the big brewers, their strategy at this point -- we're talking about Anheuser-Busch InBev and Miller, companies like that -- their strategy is basically to marginalize the craft beer market. Buy these little craft beer labels, take them to market, cut the prices, and more or less just whittle down that perception between your Budweisers and your craft beers of the world. So, I think that has really put Boston Beer in a tough spot. And I don't know that there's an easy solution. What I would love to see them do is invest in some new craft brands, and become what I liken to the Buffett of craft beer. I think there's an interesting opportunity for Koch to do that. But by the same token, he's not going to do that in the face of these really robust valuations today. And they've said as much on the call. So they're not going to go out there and make acquisitions just for acquisitions' sake. He says between the two choices here, of making acquisitions of high-priced companies or just buying back their own stock at depressed levels, they're going to buy back their own stock. I admire that. At least they're doing the right thing in saying, "We feel like our stock represents a compelling value, we're going to buy more of that stock back, try to return more value to shareholders that way, and play the waiting game." As a shareholder, I'm going to keep my shares because I don't need to sell them, and I think there's value there in the brand and the distribution, the facilities that they have. But I think it's going to be a much longer story to play out than perhaps we anticipated even two or three years ago. Hill: Sal mentioned the price of Boston Beer's stock, just to put it in percentage terms, over the last two years, the S&P 500 up about 16%. During that same time period, Boston Beer shares down 45%. So, 60% trailing the market there. Moser: Yeah. And they're looking for a new CEO, too. Martin Roper is getting ready to step down. They brought in a new chief marketing officer and they're trying to do some rebranding. I think, if you've noticed, there's new labeling on the bottles. I think they're pursuing some more different types of flavors. They really dropped the ball this spring with their new seasonal offering, so hopefully we'll see a little bit of a better performance this summer with their summer ale, because that's always, traditionally, a strong performer. But there's a lot of challenges out there for these guys right now. It's not going to be an easy solution. But I think in order for them to grow in a meaningful way, they're going to have to add new craft brands to that portfolio at some point or another. It's just anyone's guess as to when that is. But I think we're going to really have to wait to see some of these valuations come back to earth.  Hill: Jason Moser, thanks for being here! Moser: Thank you!

Then you need these sneakers, which the company made exclusively for its staff. Jana Kasperkevic Forget the new iMac. The must-have Apple item this week is a pair of vintage Apple sneakers. The pair of sneakers is being auctioned by Heritage Auctions, with the live bidding scheduled to start at noon Eastern Daylight Time on Sunday. According to the auction house, the vintage pair of sneakers is valued at $30,000 or higher. The opening bid is $15,000. “We have no way of telling how high they will go,” Elon Werner, director of communications at Heritage Auctions, told Marketplace. “The Apple sneakers are the perfect collectible item for 2017, given that it’s the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. The juxtaposition of these sneakers and Apple’s branding and technology really makes these the holy grail for both sneaker and tech enthusiasts.” According to the description on the website, the white sneakers emblazoned with the rainbow-colored Apple logo were made by the company exclusively for its employees in the early 1990s. Also on the auction block is a pair of the self-lacing 2016 Nike Mag sneakers based on the shoes worn by Marty McFly in “Back to the Future Part II.” In addition to live floor bidding, the auction house will accept bids via phone, mail, fax, internet and Heritage Live, its online bidding platform. “Online bidding began at the end of May,” Werner explained. “Online bids are coming in now, primarily through ha.com as well as some third-party partners, like LiveAuctioneers, Invaluable, and eBay.” Related How Apple's technology affects the smartphone repair business Will the iPhone (RED) boost Apple's sales? The sneakers are not the only piece of clothing produced by Apple. In fact, back in 1986, Apple rolled out its own clothing and accessories line, partnering with other companies, like North Face and Patagonia. Fans who got their hands on The Apple Collection catalog would have come across some of the following items: Apple polo shirt: $32 Yup, a polo shirt with an Apple logo instead of the tiny man on the horse. “These heavyweight 100 percent brushed cotton polo shirts are perfect for the courts or the club.” Apple sailboard: $1,100 “This 11’10” board is best for sailors over 145 pounds. Included are two polyester-reinforced ripstop Mylar sails - a 6-square-meter powerhead and a 5-square-meter sail with gigantic Apple logo.” Apple sweatshirt: $15 “After a rough day windsurfing, the Apple sweatshirt is just the thing. And a perfect companion to our sweatpants.” Apple running shorts: $21 “For people who run, or just want to look like they do, our rugged lined short are absolutely perfect.” Apple sun visor: $7.50 “Tennis anyone? The Apple sun visor is made of cotton twill, with adjustable band, terry lining, and embroidered logo.” Apple umbrella: $28 “‘It never rains in California.’ Baloney. It rains everywhere. When it does, have our sturdy cotton poplin umbrella at the ready. There’s even room under it for a friend.” Apple chair: $39 “The Apple director’s chair with natural wood frame and Apple design will complement any decor.” How did this not catch on?

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Chinese authorities say they have uncovered a massive underground operation run by Apple employees selling computer and phone users' personal data. Twenty-two people have been detained on suspicion of infringing individuals' privacy and illegally obtaining their digital personal information, according to a statement Wednesday from local police in southern Zhejiang province. Of the 22 suspects, 20 were Apple employees who allegedly used the company's internal computer system to gather users' names, phone numbers, Apple IDs, and other data, which they sold as part of a scam worth more than 50 million yuan ($7.36 million). Following months of investigation, the statement said, police across more than four provinces, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian, apprehended the suspects over the weekend, seizing their "criminal tools" and dismantling their online network. The suspects, who worked in direct marketing and outsourcing for Apple in China, allegedly charged between 10 yuan ($1.50) and 180 yuan ($26.50) for pieces of the illegally extracted data.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple’s ambitious iPhone 8 design could already be causing problems Chris Mills BGR News June 8, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share From everything we’ve heard so far, the iPhone 8 that Apple plans to debut later this year will be a departure from the status quo. Rumored new features include an OLED panel, edge-to-edge display, under-screen fingerprint sensor, and possibly even wireless charging. Any one of those would be a big undertaking for a phone company. Trying to do all four at once is just asking for problems, and according to new supply-chain rumors, problems are exactly what Apple is getting. Don't Miss: Let’s talk about the iPhone 8, which might make one of the worst design compromises we’ve ever seen Investment bank RBC has told MarketsInsider that a number of key iPhone 8 suppliers are having problems with the specifications and volume of parts needed for the iPhone 8, which could push production back by months. Samsung, the lead OLED panel provider, is reportedly struggling with integrating the fingerprint sensor under the screen. It’s “presented challenges,” according to RBC, which on its own could delay the phone’s launch by months. Broadcom, which manufactures some of the wireless components, and Analog Devices Incorporated, a sensor supplier, have also reportedly seen “slow growth in their supply chains this quarter,” which is a fancy way of saying that there’s production issues. Going from prototype to full-scale manufacturing is always an issue, and the specs and volume of components that Apple is demanding seems to be causing problems across the board. It’s unclear exactly what these delays mean in terms of the launch date for the iPhone 8. Traditionally, Apple has announced its new iPhone every year in September, and had it on shelves two weeks later. This year, it’s already expected that Apple will miss that launch date, although some kind of reveal of the device in September (with a launch a couple months later) is still possible. The big question now is whether Apple gets the phone out in time for holiday sales. Sure, the iPhone 8 is expected to drive a “super-cycle” of upgrades regardless, but a bump in sales from Christmas madness would go some way to justifying the insane expectations on iPhone 8 sales. RBC, for its part, doesn’t see the delay as a problem, saying “We think a shift in OLED production by 1-2 months doesn’t change the demand dynamics for iPhones (fairly captive demand) or undermines the positive iPhone upgrade cycle narrative.” That’s a fancy-ass analyst way of saying that iPhone owners are dumbly loyal and will basically buy whatever Apple makes.

That might be the case, especially in 2018 when Apple is rumored to adopt micro-LED display technology for its wearable devices, which at the moment is pretty much only the Apple Watch in Apple’s product lineup. This is based on a report from Nikkei whose sources have suggested that Apple’s adoption of the technology could be as soon as 2018. This has led to speculation as to whether or not Apple could be cutting ties with Samsung for OLED display production for the Apple Watch, although MacRumors does point to a rumor that Samsung is looking into micro-LED production with a possible acquisition of a micro-LED manufacturer. According to an anonymous executive with close knowledge of display technology, “Apple is working very hard to foster the micro-LED technology … the company could push the use of new display tech as early as next year. At this point, Apple is the only company who is able to roll out micro-LED, a technology that is still at an early stage of development, and cover the high costs incurred by the low yield rate.” As for micro-LEDs finding their way into smartphones, it seems that it might be too early for that due to the larger displays required, and that it will be 2020 at the earliest that we could see smartphones adopt the technology.

The fee is standard among similar P2P services, and necessary to cover credit card transaction costs, but it’s worth pointing out to potential users. If you don’t want to incur the 3% fee, simply use your debit card to fund the Apple Pay P2P payment, as this method is completely free. Apple announced the new iMessage-based service during its WWDC keynote earlier this week. With it, you’ll be able to use any card stored in Apple Pay to send money to other users. Once sent, the money loads onto a prepaid Apple Pay Cash card, where it can be spent or withdrawn. Apple Pay Cash will go live after Apple publicly launches iOS 11 this fall.

Macs & Mac OS X | 06 Jun 2017 | Print  | Comment (15) Apple Beefs Up iMac and MacBook Lines, Teases the iMac Pro by Adam C. Engst At WWDC 2017 today, Apple devoted a non-trivial segment of the keynote to new Mac hardware, showing off improved iMacs and performance-enhanced MacBook Pros and mentioning a speed bump to the MacBook Air in passing. After running through all the changes to today’s models, Apple gave a sneak preview of the iMac Pro, a workstation-class version of the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display that’s scheduled to ship at the end of the year. No mention was made of the Mac mini or Mac Pro, though Apple has already said that the Mac Pro is in the middle of a major redesign that won’t be done until 2018 at the earliest (see “Maca Culpa: Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency,” 4 April 2017). iMac -- The workhorse of Apple’s desktop line has long been the iMac, which Apple continues to offer in three basic models: a 21.5-inch non-Retina version, a 21.5-inch iMac with 4K Retina display, and the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display. On the CPU front, each model receives a speed bump thanks to Apple using Intel’s 7th generation “Kaby Lake” processors and increasing clock speeds. You can see the specifics on Apple’s Tech Specs page, but the summary is that Apple is focusing more effort on the 21.5 Retina iMac, offering just a single configuration of the non-Retina model. Benchmarks will show how much faster the combination of new CPUs and higher clock speeds will be, but I suspect purchases will mostly be based on price. Although the iMac Retina displays are already gorgeous, Apple claims to have improved them even more in both the 21.5-inch and 27-inch sizes, increasing brightness 43 percent to 500 nits and supporting display of up to 1 billion colors. The non-Retina iMac model drives its screen with the integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, but all the Retina models now take advantage of Radeon Pro GPUs, the 555 and 560 for the 21.5-inch models and the 570, 575, and 580 models for the 27-inch models. The notable win here is for the 21.5-inch Retina models, which were previously limited to integrated Intel Iris Pro Graphics 6200. Apple has made the Fusion Drive standard in more configurations, and the company claims that the SSDs available in 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB capacities are up to 50 percent faster. You can also configure the top-of-the-line 27-inch iMac with a 2 TB SSD for a whopping $1400. When it comes to RAM, all base models still ship with 8 GB. The non-Retina iMac and low-end 21.5 Retina model remain limited to 16 GB, but the high-end 21.5-inch Retina model can now take 16 GB or 32 GB, a welcome improvement. Similarly, the low-end 27-inch model still maxes out at 32 GB, but the two higher-end models can take 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB. RAM in the 21.5-inch iMac models cannot be upgraded by the user, but you can install memory in the 27-inch model yourself. Unsurprisingly, Apple replaced the previous models’ Thunderbolt 2 ports with a pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports that support DisplayPort for external screens, Thunderbolt at up to 40 Gbps, USB 3.1 Gen 2 at up to 10 Gbps, and various other protocols via adapters (see “Explaining Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, and Everything In Between,” 3 November 2016). All these changes are welcome for anyone in the market for a new iMac. I doubt they’re significant enough to warrant trading in an existing Retina iMac, unless Thunderbolt 3 is a necessity. The most interesting changes are actually in the 21.5-inch models, which move past the RAM and graphics limitations of the previous configuration while introducing a cheaper config. The 21.5-inch non-Retina iMac remains priced at $1099, with the two Retina configurations starting at $1299 and $1499. The 27-inch model comes in three configurations: $1799, $1999, and $2299. They’re all available now. Perhaps I’m just boggled by the number of changes Apple announced in the WWDC keynote, but I couldn’t see how to give more context for the changes in relation to previous configurations because the matrix of what models get which build-to-order options was just too complicated. If you want to price out different possibilities, I recommend opening several browser windows so you can compare the configurations side by side. MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air -- As with the iMac, Apple updated the processors in the MacBook and MacBook Pro with new Kaby Lake processors running at higher clock speeds. That should improve performance, although likely not by that much. The MacBook Pro models also get improved graphics processing, with the 13-inch MacBook Pro models using Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 and 650, and the 15-inch models switching to Radeon Pro 555 and 560 discrete GPUs on top of Intel HD Graphics 630 and 640. You can now buy a MacBook with 16 GB of RAM, up from the previous limit of 8 GB, and Apple claims that the MacBook’s onboard SSD is up to 50 percent faster. That might make the MacBook a more attractive option, given that lackluster performance was one of its main disadvantages. Despite rumors to the contrary, the MacBook Air lives, but it sees the least change, replacing its stock 1.6 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with a 1.8 GHz model. It remains upgradeable to an Intel Core i7 running at 2.2 GHz. Although these changes are all positive, they do nothing to simplify the difficulty of choosing between the three models. Each falls into the three-dimensional graph of price, performance, and size in a different spot. You’ll have to decide what’s most important to you — cost, speed, or portability — and figure out which of Apple’s notebooks best fits your needs. As with the new iMac models, these updated notebooks are all available now. iMac Pro -- During the private media meeting in which Apple executives confessed to the company’s sins with regard to the Mac Pro, mention was made of pro-related announcements about the iMac coming this year. Apple has now revealed more of what that means, pulling back the curtains on the iMac Pro. Due in December 2017, the iMac Pro retains the same form factor of the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display, but swaps the brushed aluminum look for a space gray finish that extends to the Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, Magic Mouse 2, and an optional Magic Trackpad 2. The goal of the iMac Pro is to provide workstation-class performance within the iMac design. The hardest part of that is dealing with heat, because the iMac Pro will feature Intel Xeon processors in 8-core, 10-core, or 18-core configurations. Also playing into the necessary thermal architecture redesign is Apple’s use of a new Radeon Pro Vega GPU, which reportedly features a next-generation compute core and up to 16 GB of on-package high-bandwidth memory (HBM2). Apple says that the iMac Pro with Vega GPU delivers up to 11 teraflops of single-precision compute power for real-time 3D rendering and high frame rate VR. For half-precision computation that’s reportedly ideal for machine learning, the iMac Pro can deliver up to 22 teraflops of performance. (No, we don’t really have a sense of what that means, either, but Apple PR did a good job of making it sound impressive.) The iMac Pro will come with 32 GB of RAM by default, but for a machine in this class, the fact that it’s configurable to 64 GB or 128 GB is more important. A 1 TB SSD is also standard, with 2 TB and 4 TB SSDs as options. Unsurprisingly, the iMac Pro sports four Thunderbolt 3 ports, which enables it to drive up to two 5K displays and two high-performance RAID arrays at the same time. Other connectivity options mimic what’s on the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display now, with the exception of Ethernet. Instead of gigabit Ethernet, the iMac Pro will include 10 Gb Ethernet, which could be a big deal when transferring huge amounts of data between machines. How much will all this cost? A lot, with the base iMac Pro configuration starting at $4999. Apple claimed that a comparable workstation would cost about $7000, without a 5K display. Even still, given the high price of large SSDs and RAM, we anticipate that a loaded iMac Pro will easily meet or exceed that $7000 mark. But that won’t stop the audience for the iMac Pro. If you need the maximum performance from a Mac, the iMac Pro will provide it. At least until a new Mac Pro makes its debut, and many of those who live and die by the teraflop won’t want to wait.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

The most unexpected news, however, was the announcement of the iMac Pro, due in December 2017. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Michael E. Cohen   2017-06-06 10:48 And if anyone out there thinks the iMac Pro means that a Mac Pro ISN'T also coming, Apple's press release on the iMac Pro puts that misconception to rest: "In addition to the new iMac Pro, Apple is working on a completely redesigned, next-generation Mac Pro architected for pro customers who need the highest-end, high-throughput system in a modular design, as well as a new high-end pro display." Reply Mackay Bell  2017-06-07 20:38 It seems that part of the reason they revealed that they were working on an expandable Mac Pro (and apologizing for the trash can version) is they wanted people to get excited about the iMac Pro, and not suck up all the air complaining about the lack of an expandable system. By getting that story out before the release, they could get a little more excitement going for the coming of the iMac Pro. Reply Alan Forkosh   2017-06-06 11:09 It's noteworthy that Apple didn't mention anything about the Touch Bar. As it stands now, Touch Bar is an orphan, present on only on the MacBook Pro line. It strikes me as something that can't really be considered a standard until there is a desktop version of it also--either a new keyboard or a standalone item to be paired with a keyboard. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 12:00 In fact, it turns out that Apple did release a new wireless Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad. But not with a Touch Bar. Boo! http://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-has-a-new-wireless-magic-keyboard-with-a-full-numeric-keypad/amp/ Reply Paul Ellis  2017-06-06 13:53 The Touch Bar is a gimmick. It breaks all the rules of ergonomics and focus. It might possibly make some sense when positioned close the the screen, and therefore point of focus, on a laptop, but makes little sense for a desktop. If I were a developer, which thankfully I'm not, I wouldn't be wasting any time developing for it, and certainly not if I'd previously been stung by OpenDoc, QuickTime VR, etc. etc. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:57 I like what Apple is doing with the iMac and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assuming they'll make things right with the new Mac Pro once it finally arrives. The MBP seems fine. I still don't see what TouchBar is supposed to accomplish - I also think it's mainly a gimmick with poor ergonomics. Apple didn't spend any time on it at this WWDC. Does anybody think it might disappear during the next overhaul? I don't really get why Apple is keeping the MBA around instead of just trying to make an inexpensive entry-level MB instead. Since there is no inexpensive entry-level MB, I assume that means the MB is targeting the middle/high-end of the compact/light market. So with that in mind, why in the world did they not replace that USB-C with TB3? If this were a budget Mac at $999 targeted at schools and students, fine. But since this is a midrange Mac we're talking about, why leave it stuck with USB-C? Nothing TB3 offers can't be done with USB-C, but TB3 is just more versatile and it is no doubt the new standard across Macs - well almost, sigh. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:59 (cont.) My only real gripe on the Mac side is the Mac mini. How can Apple just let it sit there to die? Either kill it off already (so people know they'll have to go Hackintosh) or update it. But just leaving it sit there without a clear plan makes we wonder what message Apple is trying to send. It reminds me of the Mac Pro situation before pressure from pros and tech journalists forced Apple to take a stand. I see a lot of potential for the Mac mini, from cheap servers to simple office computers, offering a low-price entry point to the Mac universe, schools, home media servers, etc. I'm afraid all of that is "too techy" and not sexy enough for the new Apple. I really hope I'm wrong. I'm holding onto my trusty Core i5 Mac mini, but with its 4 GB of RAM (could be upgraded) and 500 GB HDD (could also be upgraded, but is that worth it?) its days are numbered even as my home media server. Reply Bertrand Morin  2017-06-06 19:27 Is the memory (RAM) upgradable in the iMac 27in. by the user, as it wad older iMac… Reply James  2017-06-08 07:58 Did you read the product page for the 27" iMac? If not, go back and read it again. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-07 01:08 Is there any indication yet if the new iMac models (both 21.5" and 27") have user upgradable RAM? There is some wording on the Apple page that you can upgrade the 21.5" RAM after purchase through Apple or an authorized dealer, but it not 100% clear. And the page for the 27" is completely silent. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-07 09:59 The 21.5-inch models are NOT user-upgradeable, but the 27-inch model is. See http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201191 Reply Bob  2017-06-08 18:02 Scott, MacRumors reports "iFixit has published a teardown of the new 4K 21.5-inch iMac, which reveals that – surprisingly – Apple's smallest all-in-one desktop machine has both removable RAM and a Kaby Lake processor that's not soldered onto the logic board." Note though, updating is an involved process. Certainly not user-replaceable by the average owner. But at least users aren't irrevocably locked in to what they originally purchased. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:28 I guess that I should have been a little more accurate with my question. I was more trying to determine if the RAM in both the 21.5" and 27" is upgradable, whether user upgradable as officially supported by Apple or even just upgradable but only officially by Apple or an Apple ASP (which means a user can do it if they are afraid to open up their Mac and maybe end up having Apple not provide support under the warranty if there is a problem). Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:32 Good to know. I am not afraid to open up a Mac even for supposedly no user upgradable items at least officially in Apple's eyes. On my original 2006 MBP, I replaced a fan that was squealing due to the bearings and also upgrade the WiFi card, neither of which was consider user upgradable by Apple (certainly not the fan at least...not sure about the WiFi card). It likely would not matter as if I were in the market for an iMac (I am currently not), I would be going for a 27" model anyway. I am kind of used to the 27" Thunderbolt display that I have, so going back to what would seem like a freakishly small (to me) 21.5" screen would not really be an option. Reply Simon  2017-06-08 18:20 I wonder if the non-retina 21.5" iMac will have the same SO-DIMM slots? I guess the replaceable CPU is a given because apparently Intel does not offer desktop Kaby Lake with BGA (i.e. soldered).

As part of the announcement-heavy WWDC keynote, Apple has revved the iMac line with Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs, higher performance graphics, brighter screens, and faster SSDs. The MacBook and MacBook Pro also get new CPUs, the MacBook becomes more expandable, and the MacBook Air receives a small speed bump.

The wireless headphones currently sync with other paired Apple devices, including the iPad, Apple Watch and Macs through iCloud. Apple TV had been excluded from the iCloud syncing setup. Read: Siri vs. Alexa vs. Google Assistant: Apple Struggling With Privacy Concerns On the tvOS 11 beta, AirPods automatically show up as a speaker option on Apple TVs with iCloud accounts linked to iPhones that are paired with the wireless headphones. The setup is automatic, which means you don’t have to pair the earphones manually to Apple TV. The feature will allow users to play audio or listen to content from the Apple TV through AirPods without using the TV speakers. The tvOS 11 beta is still limited to one iCloud account. However, a report in April said Apple would integrate a multiuser support feature for the Apple TV. The feature would allow users to create their own profiles based on what their preferences are, similar to Netflix. Users would be able to link the Apple ID to a device to create a profile and listen to the account's Apple Music content, view iCloud photos and videos, and use apps. The feature is reportedly in the advanced stages and could come after the first tvOS 11 update. Read: iOS 11 Beta: 5 Features We're Excited To Use On The New iPhone More Apple Speaker WWDC News iOS 11 Speaker Features Apart from the Apple TV’s AirPod speaker option, Apple also revealed this week at its Worldwide Developers Conference new speaker features for its iOS 11 update. The update for iPads and iPhones will add speakers to HomeKit, which controls smart home accessories. Apple introduced AirPlay 2, which will allow HomeKit to control speakers throughout a user’s home. AirPlay 2 also will work with Apple’s new HomePod speaker. The AirPlay 2 feature allows for multiroom audio through iOS. You’ll be able to play music on select speakers inside your house through the Music app. With iOS 11, people visiting your house will be able to add songs in the Up Next section of the app without interrupting sound from speakers. Multiple speaker makers, including Bose, Beats and Marantz have partnered with Apple for Airplay 2. Speakers from Apple TV  also will be linked to AirPlay 2, which means you can control the audio playing throughout the house when turning on the TV. HomePod Apple’s HomePod will work as a high-end speaker and home assistant. The cylindrical, 7-inch gadget is powered by an Apple A8 chip, which was previously used in the iPhone 6 series and the latest Apple TV. The speaker will feature Siri, competing with other speakers on the market, including Amazon Echo and Google Home devices. The HomePod will also work with Apple Music and HomeKit, which will allow users to control smart home devices. The HomePod, which will be available in white or Space Gray, is set to launch in December and will cost $349.

In using the new camera formats, Apple estimates users will be able to save up to 50% on storage needs, without any loss in image quality. This becomes the perfect solution for users on lower capacity devices, that still want to take advantage of the iPhone’s great camera. Let’s dive in and see what other advantages these formats will bring. Why is Apple switching to HEVC and HEIF? For the past few years, camera videos on iOS have been using h.264 video compression and camera photos have been regulated to JPG. As the camera improves every year, and storage capacity needs increase,  and Apple pushed towards a solution with compression and quality in mind. It should be noted that neither of these new camera formats were originally built by Apple. HEIF is a relatively new system with technical specifications having been finalized in 2015, and HEVC being around for about as long. Apple is adopting HEVC and HEIF to tap into their strengths on their own systems. By bringing in these new camera formats, Apple can continue to improve photo and video quality, while needing nearly half of the storage. That means savings not only in photos and videos taken in the camera app, but bandwidth from live streaming services too. By making the move to High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF), Apple is getting ready for the future of media consumption and creation. What does that mean for me? Basically, you’ll save 50% on storage when taking photos and videos using the iOS 11 camera app. If you’re currently running iOS 11 beta 1, you can verify this by switching between the High Efficiency and Most Compatible formats under iOS Settings → Camera → Formats. Under the High Efficiency format, images will be saved as HEIC and movies as an HEVC .mov file. Under Most Compatible, images will be saved as JPGs and movies as an h.264 .mov file. In testing I went out at night and took a photo and video of the New York City skyline. The outputted JPG image weighed in at 2 MB, while the HEIC image came in at 1.2 MB. Similarly, the h.264 encoded video was 61.2 MB, while the h.265 (HEVC) video was 33 MB. JPG vs HEIC FIle Sizes Full resolution images are available here. Outside of the camera, Apple has already begun encoding videos as HEVC in another iOS app: FaceTime. Starting back with the iPhone 6, HEVC was the format of choice in iOS video calls. By applying HEVC to the video conversations, Apple saved on bandwidth and data. This meant clearer and cleaner videos even when suffering from poor internet connectivity. In Apple’s WWDC 2017 High Efficiency Image File Format session, they showed just how HEVC’s deblocking filter can improve an image’s appearance. HEVC Deblocking Image Filter This is only the beginning for the new formats. In the WWDC sessions this year, Apple explained that developers should begin building in HEIF and HEVC support in their applications today. Of course, the question of compatibility arises. Not all services, apps, and hardware support the new formats, so Apple shares some ideas on accounting for that. Apple explains that to use these new camera formats, iOS devices will need to have at least an A9 chip. On stage this year Apple made it clear it’s going all in on HEVC and paving the way for HDR. To support HDR10, a device would need to play content from an HEVC video and have support for 10-bit graphics. It just so happens that Apple announced that the new iPad Pro supports HDR video and that the new iMac will support 10-bit graphics. Dan Rayburn of Streaming Media, predicts that Apple might even “re-encode their entire library including SD and HD videos,” which would result in smaller files when streaming or downloading to your Apple TV or iOS device. iOS 11 is currently in developer beta, with a public preview expected for later this month. You can watch the full developer talk Introducing HEIF and HEVC at WWDC 2017 below: Update 06/08/2017 3:03 PM PT: Clarified that HEVC was already being used on FaceTime, beginning with the iPhone 6.

The report notes that Tim Cook himself will attend the first meeting of the council, which is said to occur on June 19th. Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover While this isn’t the first we’ve heard about Apple’s role in the council, this is the first time it has been said that Cook himself will be involved, as opposed to another executive or representative. Tim Cook will join representatives from 11 other companies, including Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Eric Schmidt of Google, and Satya Nadella of Microsoft. Of note, Facebook has been invited to the summit but has yet to reply to the invitation. The list of planned attendees include Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos, Oracle Co-CEO Safra Catz and International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty, the people said. Alphabet Inc. plans to send Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt. The American Technology Council was formed on May 1st by a Trump executive order with the goal of forming a group to “transform and modernize” government information technology and digital services. The council is led by Trump advisor Jared Kushner, while former Microsoft and General Motors CFO Chris Liddell is the director. This group is largely the continuation of a meeting Trump held at Trump Tower in December, which consisted of Cook and many of the same executives. Topics at that meeting ranged from immigration to jobs to diversity. Cook will attend the inaugural American Technology Council meeting despite is well-known opposition to much of Trump’s agenda. The Apple CEO just last week slammed Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate pact and has also been critical of Trump’s immigration efforts. This won’t be the first time Cook has met with Kushner, as he attended dinner with Ivanka Trump and Kushner earlier this year. Cook believes that it’s better to be in the game than on the sidelines, thus his reasoning for attending these meetings. This is something he explained in an open-letter to Apple employees.

According to the South China Morning Post, police in four provinces have cuffed 22 people in total who are believed to be behind a fraud ring that made roughly $7.36m in profits from selling the personal information of Apple customers. Of those 22 people, 20 were believed to be Apple employees who had access to customer databases. The police say those 20 went into customer records to lift information including names, phone numbers, and Apple IDs. They then sold off the stolen information to fraudsters at prices ranging from $1.50 to $27 per record. The report did not say just how many people's information was accessed, or whether the victims are international or only based in China, but the $7.36m haul would indicate that the number of accounts exposed easily reaches into the hundreds of thousands. According to the report, police have been investigating the group for months and now believe they have dismantled the entire operation. Apple did not respond to a request for comment on the matter. This would not be the first time a massive customer record theft was found to be an inside job. Security researchers say a market for leaked internal records from employees is thriving on the dark web, as scammers are soliciting workers to turn over files in exchange for cash. Earlier this year, three workers at a Cardiff car rental shop were charged with selling off customer contact details to scammers for use in extortion schemes. A survey conducted in 2015 found that a third of workers would be willing to sell off sensitive information if given the offer. ® Tips and corrections 2 Comments MORE Apple China Data Breach Legal Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Another IoT botnet has been found feasting on vulnerable IP cameras Children, please welcome Persirai to the class 19 Comments Microsoft emits code for DIY Linux IoT hubs.

Apple Pay is an incredibly useful payment service from Apple that wins across all payment services thanks to encrypted transactions. That means, everything you buy at any supported retailer doesn't get tracked by credit card companies and doesn't get sold to interested data tracking companies. It's almost as private as paying with cash. In iOS 11, Apple Pay is going to be extended to more than just retailers and restaurants. You'll be able to pay your buddy back for covering the cab ride, or tell your sister she still owes you for the cost of the shared hotel you fronted. It's called person to person payment and its available in Messages on iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch running iOS 11. So how does it work? It's kinda magical. All you have to do is send a chat in the Messages app to someone with a dollar amount in it. When you tap the dollar amount, a tool will pop up allowing you to either request or pay the amount. Tap Pay if you want to send someone money, or Request if you want someone to pay you money. If you're requesting money, a link to make the payment via Apple Pay will show up in the Messages chat window. If you're paying someone, when you hit the Send button, you'll be prompted to use Touch ID to complete the transaction. That's it! Payment sent. Payment received. But where does that money I've received go? You're not a giant retail store or a credit card company. You're just one person. So, how do you get your money from Apple Pay after your friend sends it to you? Initially, the cash will store up in your Apple Pay account, sort of like a virtual debit card, that you can use to buy stuff with anywhere it's supported, including retail stores. If, however, you find yourself wishing you had that dough in your bank account, it's no problem. You can transfer it directly without having to pay a service fee (though you will probably have to wait two days for the transfer to complete). But my iPhone doesn't have Touch ID, how do I use Apple Pay in Messages? You don't. Not only is Apple Pay on the iPhone only available with Touch ID supported devices, it's also only available on iOS 11, which means older iOS devices won't be able to take advantage of the peer-to-peer payment service. It is also only going to be available in the U.S. to start. Apple Pay in Messages is supported in the following devices running iOS 11 or higher: iPhone SE iPhone 6 and later iPad Pro iPad 5th Generation iPad Air 2 iPad mini 3 and later Apple Watch When can I start using it? You and your peeps will have to be running iOS 11 on supported devices, so you won't be able to split the dinner bill with your friends using Apple Pay until later this fall unless you're all running a beta version that it works in.

Here are the best you can buy so far!. Updated June, 2017: Added some new product information Apple just updated its entire line of MacBook and MacBook Pro computers with the Kaby Lake chipset, 50% faster speeds on SSD, and faster graphics on the 15-inch MacBook Pro. With all this under-the-hood ramping up, why not get a nice big screen to go with it? USB-C is the future. Transfer rates are lightning quick, it's easy to plug in, it can replace just about any cable under the Sun — what more could you need? The new MacBook Pro only has USB-C ports (Thunderbolt 3), so it's an awesome time to check out compatible monitors, since there are those that can power your MacBook Pro and even act as USB hubs, all through a single connection! Here are the best USB-C monitors you can buy right now: LG 27UD88 This 4K monitor is hands-down the best USB-C monitor you can buy to complement your Mac experience. Via one cable, USB-C, you can power your MacBook, transfer video, and use the monitor as a USB hub, with the ability to interface with any peripheral you plug into the UD88's two USB 3.0 ports. You can calibrate the colors with your MacBook so that you glance back and forth between each screen and have it be seamless and pleasing to the eye. You also have 14 options for layout, so you can view multiple windows simultaneously — run your Apple TV via HDMI while using your MacBook! As mentioned, the best part of this monitor is its ability to power your MacBook while acting as a display, so that you're not limited by your battery. See at Amazon ASUS MB169C+ ASUS' MB169C+ is just plain cool. It's a portable monitor that connects to your MacBook via USB-C, though it is powered by that same connection, so you will be limited by your MacBook's battery. This monitor offers a 1080p resolution, which is a far cry from a Retina display, but it gets the job done. At 1.76 pounds, the MB169C+ is incredibly light and easy to carry around. It's just as easy on the eyes, thanks to its blue light filter, which helps diminish eyestrain, especially during prolonged use. You can't run multiple devices on this monitor at once (USB only), but if you need it as a second or alternate display for your MacBook, it'll work perfectly. See at Amazon Acer H277HU kmipuz Acer's slim-bezeled H277HU has a great display that looks as good as its hardware. The golden chin bezel and collar-shaped stand are gorgeous and eye-catching, though not distracting, since the bezel around the rest of the screen is minimal. Like the ASUS monitor above, the USB-C port on this monitor won't power your MacBook, though it won't suck power from it either, since the H277HU has its own power cable. This monitor isn't for folks with a wonky setup who need to swivel it around to portrait mode or anything like that, since it can only tilt backward 15 degree and forward 5. Other than that, it's a great companion to your MacBook, adding a 1440x2560 display, and HDMI port, and a DisplayPort (though you cannot interface with peripherals via your MacBook and the USB-C input). See at Amazon LG Ultrafine 5K I mean, say no more! The LG Ultrafine 5K was developed with Apple, specifically for the 2016 MacBook Pro. This 27-inch IPS panel has a 5120x2880 resolution and pairs perfectly with the new MacBook Pro (at least, the upper-model 13-inch and 15-inch models), offering an 85W charging port and three 5 Gbps USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports. You can orient this monitor in just about any configuration you like, or mount it on a VESA arm using the included VESA cover. This monitor even comes with a Thunderbolt 3 cable! For more information, check out Rene's review. HP Envy 4K This 27-inch 4K monitor is gorgeous and relatively inexpensive in this realm, at around $625. The Envy has an IPS panel and features an "ultra-wide" viewing angle, at 178 degrees. This monitor has one USB-C port, which can charge your MacBook Pro with up to 60W of power, and it also sports two HDMI ports, as well as a DisplayPort. The best part? All of the necessary cables are included! MacRumors includes this one in its buyers guide for the new MacBook Pro, making it a great choice if you've recently upgraded. See at Amazon Levono ThinkVision X1 Both Monitor Nerds and MacRumors recommend the ThinkVision X1 from Lenovo, since it's an exceptional 4K monitor with a minimalist and very classy design. The ThinkVision X1 comes with a full HD camera, stereo speakers, and a microphone, and it has HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB 3.0 ports (which can act as a hub), as well as a fully functional USB-C port.

Despite the fact that the internal graphics chip is spec'ed to drive 4K monitors at 60 hz. There has been much speculation that Apple purposely crippled the MB 12" so as not to cannibalize sales of the MacBook Pro line. I'm still very dissapointed that the tech specs and the actual performance of the my 2015 MB 12" don't match. And I'm still hoping there is a workaround or a native USB-C monitor that my MB can drive at full rez, full frame rate. 0 7 months ago Reply MG537 This is the description from Apple's own website. Dual display and video mirroring: simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 3840 by 2160 pixels at 30Hz on an external display, both at millions of colours.

I just bought the 2016 MacBook Pro, and am REALLY struggling with the type of monitor to get....it seems they made this harder than it had to be. The whole Thunderbolt 3/USB-C and what works with what and what's backwards compatible is pretty dang confusing. I would love to have a monitor like the LG above - single cable solution. But my options are pretty limited for now.... 0 7 months ago Reply anovelli I'm curious if there is a dongle to allow connection to a 2-yr old 27" Apple LED Display?

Do I lose anything by doing that? I know that it probably won't power the 15" Macbook Pro, but I'll give up a port to do that while using another port to plug into a hub of some kind. That will leave me two ports free. And I'll probably spend less and get the ports I need (ethernet being one of them), for when I'm using this as a desktop. 0 7 months ago Reply appletim Mike, how did you calibrate the LG 27UD88 to get this monitor to match your MacBook pro? Was there a magic combination you found in terms of resolution and calibration settings? I just recently purchased this display, and it's absolutely killing my eyes in terms of strain. I have this connected to a brand new 15" Touch Bar MacBook pro, have tried the LG calibration app, calibration via macOS, and also making tons of adjustments via the display itself, and I just can't get it right. My old Apple Thunderbolt display seems MUCH easier on the eyes in comparison. 0 5 months ago Reply slumpbuster I bought this same monitor a couple weeks ago for my 13" MBP w/Touch Bar. It appears to be calibrated fairly well...I've just got my Display Preferences set as "Default for display" and haven't had to change any settings for the most part in the LG Screen Control software either. What sort of resolution/calibration issues are you having? 0 5 months ago Reply appletim The "default for display" settings via macOS put the resolution at 1920x1080. (the lowest setting, given that it's capable of 3840x2160) So I put it on the next scaled resolution up (2560x1440), and the text seems washed out compared to the display on my Mac.....as if the gamma settings are off or something. Most of my work is in email, Safari, and Pages, so I'm doing a lot of average text type of work (very little video or photo), and it just doesn't seem as smooth as on my MacBook Pro's retina display, or what it was on my old thunderbolt display. Do you ever notice that smaller text looks this way? 0 5 months ago Reply slumpbuster Weird....mine is set to the resolution of the LG 4K monitor....not the 1920x1080 you mention. Everything looks wonderful so far on mine. 0 5 months ago Reply appletim Interesting. Perhaps I have a bad unit?

I understand the iPad lacks a USB-C port for a direct MacBook to iPad Pro connection but there does exist a cable with USB-C and Lightning connectors on opposite ends. I suspect you understand that the iPad Pro is a far, far better option than the ASUS MB169C+.

For a limited time, developers may also be able to get a promotional code for $100 towards an HTC Vive virtual reality headset. Apple made a fairly substantial VR push for macOS during its WWDC 2017 keynote, announcing support for VR on the Mac coming from Epic's Unreal game engine and SteamVR, among others. If you're a registered Apple developer, you can order a kit directly from Apple from its developer website for $599.

Click. Boom. Photos and Camera in iOS 11 FAQ: Everything you need to know! By Susie Ochs Thursday, Jun 8, 2017 at 10:26 am EDT 4 Comments Susie is a tech-obsessed writer and mom, and former Executive Editor of Macworld and Mac|Life. Follow her on Twitter @sfsooz. The Photos and Camera apps in iOS 11 will be able to do more than ever, while using less of your precious storage space. Camera and Photos: Not a day goes by when you don't use them. And no matter how often Apple iterates them, there's always a little more that can be done. In iOS 11, plenty of changes are coming. You'll have more control over Live Photos, see better low-light results, and play around with new filters—all while using less disk space thanks to a new compression format. What's this about a new file format? High Efficiency Image Format, or HEIF, is a standard created by the MPEG group as basically a still-image container format that uses the High Efficiency Video Codec (HEVC, or H.265), which Apple is also adopting in iOS 11. The main benefit of HEIF and HEVC is compression. Apple says the standard can nearly double the amount of compression that's possible while maintaining the same image quality as JPEG. That means smaller file sizes, so you can store more images, share more images, and ultimately shoot more images. HEIF also allows groups of images to be stored in one file—think bursts, or images that were captured simultaneously with different exposures or focal points. Sounds like stuff Apple is interested in, doesn't it? Just so we don't have another GIF problem...how do you pronounce HEIF? Heef. But either a hard or soft H is acceptable. So the devices store images in HEIF format. But I can still send JPEGs, right? Yes. As soon as you share an image from iOS, it arrives as a JPEG, whether you're sending it by iMessage, email, putting it in a cloud drive, or sharing it to social media. So you shouldn't have to worry about compatibility when you're sharing images and videos from the Photos app. Developers get a choice. They can choose to always transcode exported images from HEIF to JPEG, and videos from HEVC to H.264, or they can keep the native formats, or decide based on what device will receive the file. So videos I shoot are captured with HEVC? Yes, iOS 11 will use the HEVC codec to compress your video, but they'll still be MOV and MPEG-4 files when you export them. Again, this means your videos will take up less space than they would in H.264 while keeping the same What's new for developers? Developers also get a new Depth Map API, so they can do more with the data captured by the iPhone 7 Plus's two-camera setup. Other new camera-related APIs include AVCapturePhotoOutput, which lets apps capture Live Photos and wide gamut color, and output RAW-format DNG files and HEVC-format HEIF files aside from JPEGs. What about the Photos app, any new tricks for Live Photos? iOS 11 lets you edit your Live Photos, which means you can choose which still should be shown, instead of the one that's picked by the app. To get started, you'd just find a Live Photo (remember, they have their own smart album), then tap the edit button. The Live Photo gets splayed out frame by frame on a timeline, and then you can drag the ends to trim it, and drag the white box along the timeline to highlight the frame you want to use as the still photo. Do Live Photos still look the same when you play them back? Not necessarily—iOS 11 gives you three new effects to add to your Live Photos: Loops, Bounce, and Long Exposure. Think of Loops like a GIF, just a continuous loop that repeats forever. Except, unlike with Vine, you don't have to plan ahead and agonize over getting the loop point just right—iOS finds it for you, and you can't adjust it even if you want. Bounce is similar in that it goes forever, but instead of looping, the action proceeds forwards and then goes back—it's iOS's version of Boomerang. Again, iOS creates the effect automatically and you can't adjust it, but it's so much more convenient than Boomerang, because it works on any Live Photo already in your library. Long Exposure mimics the effect of, well, taking a very long exposure. Think of those nighttime photos of highways, where the buildings and road are in focus, but the cars are blurred into streams of white and red light. Objects that stay still will stay in focus, but anything that's moving in your Live Photo will be smoothed out. The effect is a still photo with parts of it moving. Think a shot of the waves at sunset, or a waterfall in a forest, or cars on a road. Trying it with portraits of people or animals results in a blurry mess (which can be fun too, if that's what you're after). But the best part of all these effects? You don't have to plan ahead. To try one out, just find a Live Photo in the Photos app, and swipe down. You'll see more info about it (where it was taken, which people are in it), as well as controls to slap on a filter or try one of these effects. You can try them all out one by one, pick which you like best, share it, and then change your mind later and pick a new effect. Do the Loop and Bounce Live Photos share as GIFs? It appears they are sent as MOV files. You mentioned filters—are there new filters? The set of filters in iOS 11's Photos app are different, and aimed more closely at changing the look of your photo without messing up the skin tones, if possible. In iOS 10, for example, the color filters are Fade, Chrome, Process, Transfer, and Instant. In iOS 11, you get three variations on two filters, for six color filters total: Vivid, Vivid Warm, Vivid Cool, Dramatic, Dramatic Warm, and Dramatic Cool. iOS 10 and iOS 11 both have three black-and-white filters, including Mono and Noir, but Tonal in iOS 10 is now Silvertone in iOS 11, and looks pretty different. What about the iOS 11 changes on the iPad? When you think about it, some of the iPad-only features in iOS 11 could be great for photographers who aren't heavy users of Apple's own Photos app and iCloud Photo Library. For example, if you keep your images backed up to Google Photos, you could drag and drop photos from that app onto the Pixelmator icon you keep in iOS 11's Dock. Or you could link your Dropbox account to the new Files app, use multi-touch to select multiple photos, and drag them into an app running on the other side of the screen. Since the Files app supports multiple cloud services, you'll be able to use the images you have stashed in each of them as easily as if they were on your local Camera Roll.

Their latest teardown focuses on the 2017 21.5 inch 4K iMac. The teardown gives us a nice look inside the iMac, including some interesting changes that Apple has made to its RAM installations on the smaller all-in-one. Where previous versions of the 21.5-inch iMac saw the RAM soldered to the logic board, this new model features (technically) removable RAM modules. From iFixit: And with a bit more elbow grease, we shimmy the logic board out of its slot to reveal ... removable RAM? We can hardly believe our eyes. Yep, those are SO-DIMMs. Two of them. It should be noted that we shouldn't call this memory "user-replaceable". In order to get to the RAM slots, you need to remove, among other things, the iMac's display, power supply, hard drive, and fan. Given that the iMac wasn't exactly made to come apart, we recommend just selecting more RAM up front if you can when you purchase your 4K iMac. If you're looking at a 27-inch 5K iMac, however, you're still in luck: that model comes with an easy-to-use door on the back that allows you to swap out Apple's included RAM for your own compatible memory modules.

While the bulk of the the changes seem to revolve around rewording existing guidelines, there are a handful of notable changes developers will want to be made aware of ahead of their next app submission. Some of those changes deal with the recently added ability for developers to respond directly to user reviews, such as guidelines that state developers should keep comments respectful and avoid putting personal information and marketing spiels in their responses. But on the more technical side of its review changes, the guidelines now note that developers should use the Apple-provided API to prompt in-app user reviews, as it is now disallowing custom review prompts in App Store apps. Apple has been in the process of clearing unsupported and outdated apps from the App Store for some time now, and that process is now represented its submission guideline changes. Going forward, developers will only be able to submit apps that run on the current version of a given platform’s OS. It also warns developers that apps need to be kept up to date with each OS update and that depreciated features, frameworks, and technology must be phased out in said updates to avoid letting apps slip into the up-for-removal, unsupported app territory. The updated App Store Review Guidelines are already live on Apple’s developer portal, while a comprehensive look at the changes, including section-by-section breakdowns of the new and old guidelines, can be found over on iClarified.  Related Jobs Pixelberry Studios — MOUNTAIN VIEW, California, United States [06.08.17] Junior Game Writer Square Enix Co., Ltd. — Tokyo, Japan [06.07.17] Experienced Game Developer Visual Concepts — Novato, California, United States [06.06.17] ESPORTS PRODUCER - NBA 2K ESPORTS LEAGUE Gameloft — Barcelona, Spain [06.05.17] Senior Producer [View All Jobs] Top Stories StarCraft Remastered dev analyzes the enduring appeal of StarCraft What makes a great sim game?

This is the first time a Singapore-based developer has won the award from the iPhone maker. It is also a first win for South-east Asia. Clean Shaven Apps was one of the 10 winners at this year's awards at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in San Jose. The results were announced on Wednesday. Apple did not disclose how many entries were in the running. The Straits Times understands that Elk's thoughtful design and efficient experience on the Apple Watch were key factors in the win. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up Since their inception in 1997, the Apple Design Awards have recognised the best and most innovative Macintosh and iOS software and hardware created by independent developers. Past winners include the popular productivity app Evernote in 2013 and the game Monument Valley in 2014. Clean Shaven Apps was founded by Malaysia-born permanent resident Muh Hon Cheng, 36, and Singaporean Lin Junjie, 31, in 2015. Mr Lin is known for the Due reminder app, while Mr Muh is behind the SG NextBus transit app. The duo first met during a developer seminar. They became good friends and decided to team up to form Clean Shaven Apps. Mr Muh, who collected the award at WWDC, was surprised but delighted with the win. "Every time I go to (the awards), I hope they would call my name," said Mr Muh, who has attended the annual WWDC since 2010. Mr Lin, who could not attend the event, said via e-mail: "It is surreal that a modest team of two, working out of a study room in a Housing Board flat, can be recognised at the highest level alongside top developers and designers from the United States and Europe." Launched in April, the Elk - Travel Currency Converter, as it is called in the Apple App Store, shows the conversions for the user's home currency and a currency of interest. The conversions can be compared side by side across 10 values for each currency on the iPhone version of the app. Users can just swipe on the app to quickly change the currency values. "We wanted to reduce input via keyboard," said Mr Muh. Elk also uses a mobile device's current time zone to infer the currency that a person might be using, so he need not manually select specific currencies to convert. For the Apple Watch version of the app, users can tap, swipe and rotate the smart watch's digital crown to convert currencies. It took about 31/2 months to develop the app. The idea for Elk originated from Mr Lin's habit of creating a lock screen wallpaper on his phone with a list of 10 values each for two currencies whenever he travels. Elk can be downloaded for a 14-day free trial from the App Store, after which it costs $5.98 to unlock all currencies. It can still be used for free after the trial period, but users will have access to only six popular currencies such as the US dollar, euro and Japanese yen. Financially, Elk is not doing so well. One in 100 users has paid for the app so far. "In the 54 days since Elk was available on the App Store, we have about 73,000 downloads but less than $3,000 in profit," said Mr Lin. While Clean Shaven Apps is not sure if the award would help make Elk more popular, the developer hopes Apple will feature the app prominently in the weeks and months to come. "We hope it will be a long-term feature that will benefit us," said Mr Muh.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Pixel XL vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus News VSby Mitja Rutnik9 hours ago 13 429 10 While the Google Pixel XL and Apple iPhone 7 Plus are far from new devices, they are both important flagships for their respective companies. For iOS fans, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus represent the very best of what Apple has to offer. For Google, the Pixel and Pixel XL showcase what a premium, stock Android phone is truly capable of. Of course we are talking about Apples to Oranges Androids here. While the iPhone 7 Plus and Pixel XL share some similarities, they are quite different from one another in a lot of ways. While we might be late to the game, with the summer slow taking hold, we thought it would be a perfect time to revisit some of the major flagships currently on the market. In this post, we’ll compare the two smartphones in terms of specs, design, software, price, and more. We’ll take a closer look at what exactly sets them apart, so you’ll have a better idea of which device might be better for you. See also: Problems with the Google Pixel and Pixel XL and how to fix them May 8, 2017 Design Although the Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus look quite a bit different from one another (especially the back), they both have a very minimalistic and simple design. Google’s smartphone has a metal body with the addition of a small glass window on the back, which gives it a little bit more character. Despite this, Google has played it safe when it comes to design, as the Pixel XL doesn’t really stand out from the crowd. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as design is very subjective, but it’s still something that’s worth pointing out. Apple’s flagship also has a metal body and looks more or less the same as the previous two iPhone generations, with some minor differences here and there. It’s not the most compact device you can get, as in addition to its 5.5-inch screen it also has quite large bezels on the top and at the bottom, which might make the device a bit difficult to hold and use if you have smaller hands. The bezels on the Pixel XL aren’t small either, and they definitely can’t compare to those of the Samsung Galaxy S8, for example. However, they are a little bit smaller than those of the iPhone. A big difference between the two smartphones is the position of the fingerprint scanner. The Pixel XL has it on the back, while the iPhone has it on the front, below the screen. It’s impossible to say what is better in this case, as we all have a different opinion on this topic. Personally, I prefer a front-mounted fingerprint scanner just because it’s easier to unlock the device while it’s on a table. That way, I don’t have to pick it up every time I want to quickly check something. But hey, that’s just me. Moving on to the color options, the iPhone 7 is available in a total of six different colors. You can get the device in Jet Black, Black, Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold. There’s also a special edition of the smartphone available that comes in red. The Pixel XL, on the other hand, can be yours in three color options. These include Very Silver and Quite Black as well as the limited edition Really Blue, which currently isn’t available on Google’s online store. There’s no real winner when it comes to design. As already mentioned, this topic is subjective, so you’ll have to decide for yourself which one looks better. You can check out more images of both devices in the gallery below. Camera The camera is one of the main selling points of the Pixel XL. The device features a 12.3 MP sensor with an f/2.0 aperture, 1.55µm pixel size, electronic image stabilization, and dual-LED flash. When Google took the wraps off the Pixel XL, it actually said that it features the best camera you can get on a smartphone. These claims were later also confirmed by DxO, which gave the camera the highest DxOMark rating at the time with a score of 89. However, it‘s worth pointing out that Google has since dropped down to second place, as DxO gave a higher score (90) to the HTC U11 a few weeks ago. Pixel XL camera samples Just like the Pixel XL, the iPhone 7 Plus also has a great camera. Unlike its rival, it features a dual-camera setup on the back. The smartphone is equipped with a 12 MP main camera with an f/1.8 aperture, 1.22μm pixel size, phase detection auto-focus, optical image stabilization, and quad-LED dual-tone flash. It also sports a secondary 12 MP 56mm telephoto lens that offers 2x optical zoom without reducing quality. Unfortunately, DxO hasn’t reviewed the iPhone 7 Plus, so we don’t have a DxOMark to share with you at this point. Apple iPhone 7 Plus  camera samples On paper, it’s hard to decide which device is the winner in the photography department. In good lighting conditions, both smartphones can produce great looking images. However, the Pixel XL does perform better in low-light conditions, where the difference between the two is quite obvious. To see for yourself, check out the sample images taken with the Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus above. Specs Being a flagship, the Pixel XL features high-end specs. It has a 5.5-inch AMOLED screen with QHD resolution (2560 x 1440 pixels) that’s protected against scratches by Gorilla Glass 4. The smartphone is powered by the Snapdragon 821 chipset and has 4 GB of RAM. It offers either 32 or 128 GB of storage that, unfortunately, can’t be expanded, as you won’t find a microSD slot on the Pixel XL. The Pixel XL also sports a 3,400 mAh battery, a USB Type-C port, and an 8 MP front-facing selfie snapper. To learn more about the device’s primary camera, check out the Camera section above. The smartphone is also splash and dust resistant thanks to the IP53 rating. To be more specific, the rating means that the Pixel XL isn’t completely dust-tight but should work fine unless it’s exposed to massive amounts of it. When it comes to water, it can only handle being sprayed here and there. The iPhone 7 Plus has the same screen size as its rival at 5.5-inches but offers a lower resolution — Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels). It’s powered by the A10 Fusion chipset and has 3 GB of RAM, 1 GB less than the Pixel XL. There are three storage variants available to choose from: 32, 128, and 256 GB. You’ll have to choose wisely, as the device doesn’t support expandable storage. Although they are roughly the same size, the iPhone 7 Plus sports a smaller battery than the Pixel XL. It is non-removable and has a capacity of 2,900 mAh. However, the iPhone’s screen does have a lower resolution at Full HD, which doesn’t consume as much power as the QHD panel found on its rival. Apple’s flagship is dust and water resistant, as it’s IP67 certified. What this means is that it’s completely dust-tight and can be submerged in up to 1 meter of water for a period of 30 minutes. A big difference between the iPhone 7 Plus and its rival is the headphone jack. The Pixel XL does have it, while you won’t find it on the iPhone. To use your pair of headphones with the device, you’ll have to plug them in with the help of an adapter, which comes included in the box. Or you could just opt for wireless Bluetooth headphones instead. On paper, the Pixel XL beats the iPhone 7 Plus when it comes to specs. However, there’s more to this story, since Apple controls both the software and hardware experience and doesn’t have to make its software work with tons of phone models — unlike Android. That means that Apple’s phone can perform just as well – or arguably better, depending on who you ask – despite having worse specs on paper. Ultimately, both are high-end devices and should handle just about anything you throw at them. The iPhone offers more protection based on its IP67 rating but doesn’t have the headphone jack, which might be a deal breaker for some.   Pixel XL Apple iPhone 7 Plus Display 5.5-inch AMOLED display Quad HD resolution, 534 ppi 5.5-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD display Full HD resolution, 401 ppi Processor 2.15 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor Adreno 530 GPU 2.34 GHz Apple A10 Fusion processor PowerVR Series7XT Plus RAM 4 GB 3 GB Storage 32/128 GB not expandable 32/128/256 GB not expandable Camera 12.3 MP rear camera, f/2.0 aperture, EIS, dual LED flash 8 MP front-facing camera Dual 12 MP rear camera, f/1.8 aperture, OIS, quad-LED flash 7 MP front-facing camera Battery 3,450 mAh 2,900 mAh Software Android 7.1 Nougat iOS 10 Dimensions 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5 mm 168 grams 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm 188 grams Software Software is definitely the biggest difference between the two devices. The Pixel XL ships with Android 7.1 Nougat on board, while the iPhone 7 Plus runs iOS 10. Google’s smartphone offers a stock Android experience a lot of users love. It’s easy to use and also has a ton of customization features. If you love playing around with different settings and options then Android is definitely the way to go. Apple’s operating system is quite different. The company’s plan has always been to make it as simple as possible to use and it has done a good job in this regard. However, by not having an app drawer, like the one you’ll find on most Android devices, things can get a bit disorganized, as all the apps are placed on the home screen. You do have the option of placing apps in folders (just like on Android), which is something that’s probably a must if you have a lot of them installed on your device. Until recently, a big difference between Android and iOS was that the former features Google’s Assistant, while the latter has Siri on board. Both digital assistants offer quite a few similar functionalities and they allow you to interact with your device using your voice. However, during Google I/O last month, the online search giant launched Assistant for iPhones. What this means is that you now have the option of using either Google’s digital assistant or Siri (or both) on Apple’s smartphones. The battle between which is better, Android or iOS, has been a hot topic for a while now. They are different in a lot of ways, so it’s almost impossible to say which one comes out on top. That’s a decision you’ll have to make on your own. But the fact remains that Android does offer more options and features for you to play around with, which is something a lot of users do appreciate. iOS, on the other hand, is all about simplicity. Final thoughts Both the Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus are, without a doubt, great smartphones. The Pixel XL offers a bit more in terms of specs, has a headphone jack, and a better camera, at least when it comes to low-light performance. The iPhone, on the other hand, offers more protection thanks to the IP67 rating and comes equipped with a dual-camera setup with 2x optical zoom. So, which device should you get? Well, that’s a question you’ll have to answer for yourself. We personally prefer the Pixel XL, as it offers more bang for the buck and obviously runs Android, which just brings more to the table when compared to iOS.

The community had a palpable sense of ennui. They’d lost that lovin’ feeling. Then WWDC 2017, and now I’m hungry for all the new hardware. Tim Cook launches WWDC 2017 in the keynote address. Something has lit a fire under Apple. It was probably Tim Cook. Throughout early 2017, the tone of the influencers had gone sour. And while Tim Cook kept pointing to increases in revenue from services and iPhone, we all knew that there was a problem. I’m sure Tim felt the uneasiness. One of the punctuations of the serious concern was Bryan Chaffin’s accounting in late 2016 of Apple’s new products. “This List Proves Apple (Still) Hasn’t Accomplished Much in 2016.” After the disappointing October, 2016 Mac event and the Microsoft Surface Studio surprise, we drifted into 2017 with only the lonely, revamped iPad to point to. It seemed Apple was perpetually doing less and less with more and more. Little Did We Know There must have been some serious brush fires going on inside Apple for the last 8 months. Then, on June 5, it all came bursting forth. In an event not particularly known for a multitude of hardware announcements, Apple gave us a boatload of new hardware. Not only did we get Kaby Lake MacBook Pros and iMacs, shipping immediately, but we got new iPads with the long-awaited A10X SoC—shipping next week. There were a myriad of other minor announcements: updates to the MacBook and MacBook Air, a new wireless keyboard, a Pencil case. It just kept coming and coming like a freight train. We counted at least 18 new products, including major software items. And then. OMG. We were blessed with a look at the iMac Pro and the HomePod. It’s almost as if Apple were making statement. “So there. See? We work hard. It just takes time to develop great stuff. Patience all you Jedi. And now, we’re going to overwhelm you with all this new hardware.” It worked. A New Conversation All of a sudden, the conversation has changed about Apple. All of a sudden, those of us who had been muddling along, I’ll surmise, with Apple hardware that was good enough are reconsidering. And diagnosing our bank account balances for the rest of the year. I expect that every time I go into my local Apple Store, I’ll look at the 2013 Mac Pro on display with new eyes and fatasize about what comes next. Will my next Mac be its successor? Or an iMac Pro? Or just a great 27-inch, 5K iMac? Or a Kaby Lake MacBook Pro with Touch Bar? What about my aging iPad Air? It has to be updated now after almost four years. The HomePod looks terrific and is well priced. An awesome Christmas present to be sure. If I read all this right, Apple is going to see a serious uptick in Mac and iPad sales. Especially the iPad. The combination of new iPad hardware capabilities powered by iOS 11 is something I’ve yearned for and creates a combo that looks to be stellar. That really ought to reverse the decline in iPad sales. Most importantly, Apple is constructing a better foundation to build on. The (re)commitment to the professional users, to the Mac users, to the pro iPad users (Files!), and its entry into the smart speaker market should ignite interest that will fuel yet more aggressive and powerful designs as Apple focuses on AR, VR, and AI in the coming years. The mothership is fully awake. If only I could afford one of every new hardware product Apple announced at WWDC. And I think I’m not the only one who is now in full drool-mode.

While those with smaller iCloud Storage capacities were unaffected, Apple eliminated its 1TB option and cut the price of the 2TB option in half, from $20 per month to $10. Now, just two days later, one of Apple’s competitors in online storage has responded, but not in the way consumers were hoping for. Amazon, which launched its Amazon Drive service in early 2015, announced today that it is killing its “unlimited” storage plan and replacing it with a new 1TB tier at the same $60 per year price, starting June 8th. Those who need less storage will have the option of a new 100GB tier for $11.99 per year, while those who need more can request up to 30TB for an additional $60 per terabyte per year. Users currently subscribed to the unlimited Amazon Drive plan will continue to have access until the end of their current subscription period, at which point they’ll be automatically enrolled in the 1TB plan unless auto-renew is turned off on the account. Those who have more than 1TB stored online when their unlimited account expires will have 180 days to either remove the excess data or sign up for the additional per-terabyte plan. After that 180-day grace period, Amazon will delete any data, “starting with the most recent uploads first,” above the allotted limit. Amazon’s change of heart on unlimited data closely mirrors that of Microsoft, which also ditched unlimited storage for OneDrive just one year after initially offering it as a perk for Office 365 subscribers. In Microsoft’s case, it cited both customer abuse (some customers allegedly uploaded dozens of terabytes of pirated content) and the fact that the vast majority of its users had well below 1TB stored with the service as justification for the switch. Amazon, meanwhile, has yet to offer an official explanation, remarking only that it wants to offer customers storage plans that are “right for them.” Those currently subscribed to Amazon Drive will want to check their Manage Storage page to verify their current expiration date and auto-renew settings, view their current storage amount, and make any changes regarding the new plans and pricing tiers. Of note, today’s changes only affect the primary Amazon Drive storage platform which, like Dropbox or Google Drive, allowed users to store any type of file online. Amazon’s existing offer of “unlimited” photo storage for Prime members remains unchanged, at least for now.

It could also shake up the used iPhones industry. The feature is called DeviceCheck, and it will let developers to connect a user to a particular iPhone, even after you delete the app or wipe your phone. Remember when Apple CEO Tim Cook spanked Uber CEO Travis Kalanick for “fingerprinting” users? It’s kind of the same thing, but DeviceCheck does it with privacy in mind. DeviceCheck Device tracking is not the same thing as location tracking. Apps need to ask your permission to know your location, and you can change your mind at any time. This won’t be changing in iOS 11 (and isn’t likely to change ever). The issue surrounding DeviceCheck has to do with fingerprinting your iPhone. Fingerprinting is when a developer of iOS and tvOS associates your device with you, the user. DeviceCheck will do this by allowing developers to tag a device with two bits and a timestamps. That tag persists even if a user deletes the app in question, but it’s being stored by Apple, not the developer. Furthermore, the tag is limited to four types of binary bits (it happens to be 00, 01, 10, and 11, but that’s only a technical detail. The important news for everyone else is that Apple set up DeviceCheck to allow developers to assign whatever meaning they want to these bits. What This Means In one example reported by Gizmodo, a developer could offer a seven-day trial for their app, before a user has to subscribe or delete the app. When starting a trial, developers could assign the iPhone the bits 00, for instance, to indicate the trial has started. A timestamp could be added to note the start date. When the trial is over, a different set of bits—maybe 01—could be sent to Apple’s servers to indicate you’ve used the trial. A timestamp could be added again to note the end date. Katie Skinner, a privacy engineer for Apple, gave a talk to developers and provided more details: There are many developers who are currently using a variety of techniques to try and identify devices. Now, they may be trying to identify and answer questions like: Has this device received a free trial? Has this device participated in fraudulent activity? This means [the bits] will be stored by Apple through deletion of your app, reinstallation of your app, through erase all contents and settings, as well a transfer of that device between users. Used iPhones DeviceCheck could create problems for people that buy and sell used iPhones. Since it works persistently even after wiping your iPhone—or assigning it with a new Apple ID—the person buying your iPhone may be blocked from starting the free trial. Developers were warned they would need to find a way to handle cases like that. That may include providing a way for users to contact them if the iPhone’s fingerprint needs to be reset. The move by Apple is seen as a way to balance fraudulent behavior and user privacy. There’s a compelling case for developers to prevent fraud, but hopefully it doesn’t make buying used iPhones more difficult.

There are also some steps you need to take after you’ve successfully downloaded the iOS 11 beta. There are plenty of reasons to install the iOS 11 update on your device right now. Apple’s loaded iOS 11 beta up with new features including Siri translation, screen recording, and a mind-boggling number of small enhancements and tweaks. If you decide to install the iOS 11 beta on your device, make sure you prepare. The pre-release software is plagued with bugs and performance problems. It’s also important to stay vigilant after you install iOS 11 beta on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Problems could emerge out of the blue so you’ll want to keep a close eye on your data, your device’s performance, and so much more. Here’s our post-iOS 11 installation checklist. Test Your Connectivity One of the first things you’ll want to do is check your connectivity. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, and cellular data issues are extremely common and they are plaguing a number of iOS 11 beta testers. Furthermore, some features, like Siri translation, require a connection to work. In the aftermath of your iOS 11 beta installation, test your Wi-Fi connectivity. That might involve connecting to several different routers. Test out your various Bluetooth devices. That includes any speakers, headphones, or Bluetooth-enabled vehicles you own and depend on. If you rely on GPS for your commute, make sure your maps are spitting out the proper data. Apple’s made some changes to Apple Maps so if you use the app, you’ll want to dig in. If you use your iPhone or iPad to control appliances in your house (lights, heat, front door, garage, etc), make sure everything is good to go. The initial check should only take you a few minutes but you’ll want to be on your toes during your time on iOS 11 beta. Again, problems with your connections could strike at any moment. Test Your Apps & Services If you’re running the iOS 11 beta on a device you rely on for work, school, or just daily life, you’ll want to dig into your most important apps and services immediately. If this is your first time trying a beta, here’s the deal. This is pre-release Apple software and pre-release Apple software is notorious for conflicting with apps and services. Apps can and probably will crash. Some features probably won’t function normally. It’s the nature of the beast. If you plan to stay on iOS 11 beta for the long haul you need to test all of the software you use on a daily basis. Your browser, your favorite music app, the email service you use at work, the list goes on. If an important app doesn’t run well with iOS 11 beta on board, you probably want to drop down to iOS 10. Check for App Updates There’s no guarantee the developers of your favorite apps will update the software with support for iOS 11. Many won’t. Some developers might add support for iOS 11 and bug fixes for beta problems without explicitly saying so in an update’s change log. Bug fixes could help stabilize apps that are giving you trouble on iOS 11 beta and that’s why you need to keep an eye on the App Store during your stay on Apple’s beta software. Be on the lookout for compatibility updates and bug fixes but make sure you read reviews before you dive in with the latest software. Make Sure Your Data is Backed Up Properly If you store irreplaceable photos, video or other files on your device, make sure all of those files are present after you install the iOS 11 beta. Most of your data should transfer properly. That said, we’ve heard some horror stories in the past, mainly from people who failed to backup their device prior to installing beta software. If you backed up before you installed iOS 11 beta you should be good to go but it’s still important to comb through your files to make sure. The job doesn’t stop there though. We highly recommend making regular backups of your device during your time on beta software, just to be safe. Once a day if you’re extremely paranoid, once a week if you aren’t. Have Fixes for iOS 11 Beta Problems Handy The iOS 11 beta isn’t perfect. Far from it. Early adopters are running into a variety of issues including severe battery drain, lag, random reboots, sound problems, and Apple Music problems, 3D Touch issues, and App Store problems. The list is already huge and it will grow when Apple releases the public iOS 11 beta. Even if you take perfect care of your phone or tablet, you’re bound to run into an iOS 11 beta problem. Each beta will have its own collection of issues so you need to be prepared. It’s important to have a list of bug fixes stored in your head or on your computer. Our list of fixes for the most common iOS 11 beta problems is a great resource to bookmark. Don’t rely on Apple support to help you solve your problem(s). Keep Your Battery Charged & Bring Extra Juice Severe battery drain could strike your device at any moment. If you’re near a computer and a charger it won’t matter. But what if you aren’t? Keep your battery charged close to 100% before leaving the house. And if you’re going on a lengthy journey in the car, plane, or train, we recommend using a battery case (if you have one) or bringing a battery bank (again, if you own one). If you don’t already own a case, take a look at our guide to the best iPhone cases. Report Bugs to Apple Don’t forget this is a beta and Apple needs your help. Remember to send in bug reports to Apple so that its engineers can improve the final version of iOS 11 for everyone. Sending feedback about the iOS 11 beta is extremely easy. The beta comes with a Feedback Assistant app that lets you send in feedback on-the-go. It’s located on the second page of your home screen. It’s also available via the help menu of any app. Simply choose ‘Send Feedback’. If your Feedback Assistant app is busted, you can send your iOS 11 beta feedback directly to Apple using the online Feedback Assistant. Don’t be shy about reporting bugs. Your feedback could prevent a nasty surprise from appearing in the final version of iOS 11. Keep an Eye on the Downgrade If you want to get off iOS 11 you can but your options are extremely limited. As of right now, you can downgrade to two official versions of iOS, iOS 10.3.1 or iOS 10.3.2. You can also hop to the iOS 10.3.3 beta but we don’t recommend that. You can’t downgrade to anything older than iOS 10.3.1. Apple can and will close up downgrade loopholes. Once it stops signing on iOS 10.3.1 and iOS 10.3.2, you will no longer be able to downgrade back to them. The company typically closes up downgrades one to two weeks after it releases a new update so we expect the iOS 10.3.1 and iOS 10.3.2 downgrades to close up soon after it releases iOS 10.3.3. Monitor iOS 11 Jailbreak News Jailbreak developers have had their hands full with iOS 10 so don’t expect an imminent jailbreak for iOS 11 beta. That said, if you’re looking to jailbreak Apple’s new operating system, you’ll want to keep an ear to the ground. Dig Into iOS 11 Features And finally, once you’re on iOS 11 beta, make sure you have some fun. What’s new in iOS 11 and how it compares to iOS 10. iOS 11 is loaded up with new features. Some are obvious, others are extremely difficult to find so be sure to do some exploring. If you’d rather have someone lay out all of the features for you, take a look at our iOS 11 vs. iOS 10 walkthrough. It will take you step-by-step through the biggest, and smallest, changes in the iOS 11 beta. 5 Reasons Not to Install iOS 11 Beta & 7 Reasons You Should Install iOS 11 Beta If You Want to Improve the Final Version   1 / 12 Have you ever installed a new iOS update only to discover problems on board your device? If you've experienced frustrating iOS problems, you might want to give the iOS 11 beta a shot.  The iOS 11 beta lets you try out new features but it also helps Apple improve the software ahead of the release in the fall.  Your beta testing could prevent a major problem or a minor bug from appearing in the final iOS 11 release for your device.   If you're sick and tired of running into problems with iOS updates, do something about it. Download the iOS 11 beta and hunt for bugs.  If you find something, make sure you report it to Apple.    1 / 12 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Linkedin More In Apple iPhone 6s iOS 11 Beta: First Impressions & Performance We’ve been using the iPhone 6s iOS 11 beta for a few days now and we still believe m… 06/08/2017 13 min read 12.9-Inch iPad Pro vs 2017 Surface Pro: Which to Buy?

There's also a cheaper 13-inch MacBook Pro with function keys starting at $1,299 with 128GB storage, compared to $1,499 for the previous base model. Beyond that, the 2017 MacBook Pro is nearly identical to the 2016 MacBook Pro in both design and other tech specs. The update arrives just eight months after Apple redesigned the MacBook Pro with features such as the Touch Bar, Touch ID, Thunderbolt 3 ports, and a shallower keyboard with a second-generation butterfly mechanism. Prior to then, the MacBook Pro had gone over 500 days without an update. For prospective buyers of the 2017 MacBook Pro, here's how the new models stack up against the 2016 MacBook Pro. Mobile users: tap this link to view the full-size image Geekbench results suggest the 2017 MacBook Pro is up to 20 percent faster than the 2016 MacBook Pro in CPU performance, but the difference is likely lower in real-world usage and given the apparent optimizations that Apple has made to last year's MacBook Pro between its launch and now. Apple began accepting online orders for the new MacBook Pro on Monday, and delivery estimates currently range between June 12 and June 22 in the United States. The notebooks are also available today at most Apple Stores, and customers have the option to reserve a model for in-store pickup on Apple's website.

Rating: 15 Votes jjjoseph 10 hours ago at 01:52 pm I just don't get it. Why is 128GB so bad? I think people are commenting on the fact that your internal storage is non-upgradable and you will have 128GB as your storage size for as long as you own this computer. When you are buying hardware of this price you would hope to use it for a while. 128GB is not that much storage, and if you do anything with HD or 4K Video your space will be gone before you know it. Also the OS and Programs get larger and larger every year. Next year 128gb will feel totally small as you try to install more applications and use them properly. IMHO 128GB is a joke and shouldn't be even a baseline option for a "high end" laptop. 256GB should be the Minimum.

AirPods currently pair automatically with iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches thanks to iCloud support and an Apple-designed W1 chip, but that automatic pairing doesn't extend to the Apple TV. That's set to change in tvOS 11. In the first tvOS 11 beta, as 9to5Mac points out, AirPods appear as a new speaker option on the Apple TV when a user with AirPods is signed into their Apple ID on the Apple TV. As with any iOS devices or Mac, when connected to an Apple TV, sound will play through the AirPods. Prior to tvOS 11, AirPods worked with the Apple TV, but had to be paired manually, a process that's not as seamless or as quick as the automatic switching baked into Apple's wireless earbuds. According to Apple's release notes for the first tvOS 11 beta, other features new to the operating system include automatic switching between light and dark mode based on local time, Home screen syncing between multiple Apple TVs, new background modes and notification support, and a few other under-the-hood changes. In a few months, tvOS 11 and the fourth-generation Apple TV will be gaining a much-desired Amazon Prime Video app for the first time, which was announced on stage at the Worldwide Developers Conference. tvOS 11 is only available for registered developers at the current point in time, but Apple plans to make a version available for public beta testers in the future.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Computers Whoa: Apple made a computer you can actually upgrade Chris Smith @chris_writes June 8th, 2017 at 3:49 PM Share Tweet Apple unveiled new iMacs and MacBooks during its annual WWDC keynote, which are faster than ever. If you’re looking for a new macOS machine, now’s the time to buy one — even the dying MacBook Air got a boost. But, it turns out, Apple did not share all the details about its machines during the keynote, leaving a major surprise out of it announcements. The 21.5-inch iMac (Retina 4K 2017) can be upgraded. Not only can you bump up memory yourself, but you can also replace the CPU. Don't Miss: New leak claims to reveal final iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s Plus designs The discovery was made by the teardown experts at iFixit who dismantled the machine as soon as they received it. iFixit notes that the last iMac that shipped with removable RAM was a 2013 version. A previous 2012 version would also let users swap the processor for a new one. Image Source: iFixit While Apple certainly gets points for allowing users to upgrade the iMac without breaking the bank, it doesn’t mean that Apple actually wants you to do it. Servicing the iMac is still a chore and things can go wrong while you do it. iFixit gave the new desktop a 3/10 repairability score, which is pretty low. However, that’s “triple the score” of the 2015 iMac versions. Low bars and all that. Even so, at $1,299, a 21.5-inch iMac with Retina 4K display is certainly an interesting proposition, especially if you can keep it alive for a lot longer with the help of manual RAM and processor updates. If you want to embark on such procedure though, make sure you visit the teardown tutorial at this link before you get started.

(Reuters/ Thomas Peter) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn June 08, 2017 Apple CEO Tim Cook is trying to build a reputation for his company as a leading voice in privacy advocacy. In 2015, he even went so far as to say privacy is a fundamental human right. But after arrests in China announced yesterday (June 7), that reputation might be damaged. In early May, local police took 22 people with legitimate access to Apple’s internal database into custody, for selling private customer information such as phone numbers, names, Apple IDs, and other undisclosed data. The security bureau in Cangnan, in southern Zhejiang province, alleges that the network made more than $7 million (link in Chinese) selling the data. The Cangnan security bureau’s WeChat post announcing the arrests is unclear as to whether the suspects are directly employed by Apple, or by Apple distributors and contractors in China. The announcement first says that in January, Cangnan police suspected “domestic Apple employees” of collecting and selling users’ personal data. But it also says that the 22 arrests, made in May, included 20 people from “domestic Apple direct-sales companies and contractors.” Apple declined to comment. It’s unknown whether the data sold was strictly from Chinese customers of Apple. Also unknown is the extent and volume of data sold. The typical transaction was small, however, ranging from about $1.50 to $25 per sale, according to the security bureau. These arrests make it clear that even if Apple could make impenetrable devices, data can never truly be relied on as secure.

WWDC 2017 keynote: Taking it all in Video Apple's HomePod: Everything we know so far about this new smart Siri speaker This week, we learned that Apple’s much-rumored smart speaker is real, and it’s called HomePod. Now the wait begins—six months until it ships in December. But while we’re waiting, Apple’s still tweaking the product and getting it ready to launch. Sure, a few of us lucky souls were able to listen to a HomePod at Apple’s developer conference, but nobody outside of Apple has talked to one or picked one up. At the risk of stating the obvious, that’s because this is a product that’s not finished yet. Apple doesn’t want to publicly commit to a feature and then realize it can’t ship it; the product as the company conceives it today may not be the product that ends up in customers’ hands in December. What we know Apple The HomePod’s hardware has to be nearly final by now. At this point, some aspects of the HomePod are locked in. First and foremost, the hardware itself: It’s possible that Apple will tweak it here and there between now and when it goes into full production, but it’s unlikely to change much. That means the seven-inch tall speaker, covered in 3-D mesh fabric in black or white, is what we’ll get in December. The seven tweeters, four-inch woofer, and array of microphones, that’s a given. [ Further reading: The best surge protectors for your expensive electronics ] I can tell you that what I heard from the HomePod speakers in San Jose, I mostly liked. Certainly, the device can fill a room with impressive, dynamic sound. I’ve still got some questions about the processing the HomePod does to the sound—but we’ll get to that in a bit, since that’s likely driven by software that’s still a work in progress. But there’s no doubt in my mind that the HomePod’s speakers are impressive. Powering the HomePod is an A8 processor, the same processor used on the iPhone 6, iPad mini 4, and fourth-generation Apple TV. That processor will be tasked with a whole lot of signal processing, from filtering portions of the outgoing Apple Music track and routing it to various speakers to interpreting the input from the microphone array and recognizing when there’s a Siri command incoming. It’ll also be in charge of processing other Siri commands, talking to the network, and plenty more. The speakers and microphones may be a bit new for Apple, but the rest of this device is assembled from familiar bits of Apple’s hardware, software, and services. Of course, Apple has committed to Siri support for more than just music playback. General queries about news, sports, weather, and other general information should be there. Apple says you’ll be able to send texts via Messages, which sounds like the HomePod will be able to share phone and message information just like Macs, iPads, and iPhones can today. There’s also support for HomeKit. Right now, you need a fourth-generation Apple TV or an iPad resident in your house in order to schedule some HomeKit devices and control them all from outside your home. The HomePod will also serve as a HomeKit hub, so you don’t need one of those other devices to be present at all times. There are also some careful security decisions that Apple has had to make for a product that’s always sitting inside your house—for instance, while you can do a lot of home control with HomePod, there will be limits—so, for example, someone outside your front window can’t shout for your HomePod to unlock the front door. What we don’t know and what could change Apple What’s does the light at the top of the HomePod signify? We don’t know yet. A long lead time is required to manufacture and build up inventory of hardware, so Apple will finalize the HomePod hardware far sooner than it has to finalize its software. In fact, as an embedded home device, a new HomePod will probably connect to a network for the first time and immediately update its own software. That gives Apple a lot of time to tweak the onboard hardware. The thing I’m most curious about is how Apple chooses to handle the way music is processed by the speaker system itself. From Phil Schiller’s presentation in the Keynote and my own personal experience listening to the HomePod at WWDC, it’s clear that Apple is applying a whole lot of intelligence to breaking apart the components of a musical track and routing the audio to different speakers. The result is something that’s a little like surround sound—and all this from what is essentially a mono speaker. (I’m a bit surprised that the HomePod doesn’t appear to try to emulate stereo effects with its many tweeters, but at least for now Apple seems to suggest that for real stereo effects you’ll need to buy two HomePods and use them in concert.) With most speakers, to get the full effect you need to be sitting right in front of them, but the HomePod is firing off sound in all directions, so as I circled the HomePod I listened to, I never felt that my ears were falling out of the sweet spot. That said, the idea that Apple is processing the audio signal in order to route portions of it to different speakers might give some audiophiles pause. Even I felt that one one track, Stevie Wonder’s “Superstition,” Apple’s separation of bass and treble went too far—turning a crunchy compressed 70s tune into something that was noticeably different, and to my ears, not for the better. So I wonder if Apple will be spending the next few months tweaking its audio algorithms. Will the processing approach change based on the genre of a given song? Will a HomePod’s owner be able to control the aggressiveness it uses to process audio, just as many devices let us apply EQ settings? Will Apple offer different pre-sets, so different listeners can find the setting that sounds right for them? We just don’t know—and Apple might not know yet, either. We also don’t seem to know much about the swishy Siri logo at the top of the HomePod. It doesn’t appear to be a screen, per se, but more of an indicator area—perhaps different combinations of lights signal different kinds of activity or other status. There’s also hardware to control the volume of the device right on the top. There’s probably a lot more detail here that Apple’s holding off on discussing for now—perhaps because it muddies the core message, or perhaps because it’s not final yet. We don’t know what the process is that the HomePod uses to calibrate itself. When it comes out of the box, does it use its own microphones and some test tones to figure out the sound characteristics of its home? Or does it require calibration from an external source? Sonos’s calibration routine involves wandering around a room holding your smartphone to listen to pulses and tones being emitted from the speaker. I’d imagine Apple would like to avoid that if it could, but can it? We don’t know how good the microphones on the HomePod are, though Phil Schiller suggested that they’re excellent, able to understand you across the room at a normal voice while music is playing. We’ll have to see if HomePod can live up to that promise, but I’m hopeful. I have the sneaking suspicion that an array of good microphones will make Siri on the HomePod feel a lot more reliable than Siri on an iPhone or iPad. There’s a lot we don’t know... but that’s okay. This summer, we’ll all be learning about what’s coming this fall in iOS 11, macOS High Sierra, watchOS 4, and tvOS 11. At some point this fall there will be new iPhones, presumably. Meanwhile, in the background, Apple will be putting the finishing touches on the HomePod—and the new iMac Pro, too. I can’t wait to hear more details about both products—once Apple’s figured them all out. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Report: Siri Hobbled by Apple’s Obsession with User Privacy Report: Siri Hobbled by Apple’s Obsession with User Privacy By Ryan Whitwam on June 8, 2017 at 2:54 pm Comment Apple was the first major smartphone maker to focus on making a smart assistant an integral part of its phones when Siri debuted on the iPhone 4s. However, Apple has since been surpassed by Amazon and Google. A new report from The Wall Street Journal blames Apple’s lack of progress on equal parts hubris and an excessive concern with privacy. What many people forget about Siri is that it was a completely functional voice assistant app that was acquired by Apple in 2010. The version of Siri that launched on the iPhone 4s in 2011 was not substantially different from the version that ran as an app. Apple’s approach to developing Siri remained unchanged for several years, as the company’s engineers thought it was ahead of everyone else by a wide margin. According to the WSJ report, Apple’s feeling of superiority faltered in 2014 when a group of engineers from Cupertino attended an Amazon event that featured an Alexa demo. There, they say Amazon’s fledgling AI understand commands that would leave Siri scratching its digital head. They were also impressed with Amazon’s mastery of picking up speech from a distance and filtering out background noise, both features that were lacking in Siri because of Apple’s focus on the iPhone implementation. Siri’s development has reportedly also been slowed by Apple’s focus on prioritizing user privacy. That’s something that many consumers value, but it’s led to less data being made available to Siri. It slows development of new skills and limits the customization that can happen on the user’s end. Meanwhile, Google has leveraged its mountain of anonymized user data and powerful machine learning engine to teach Google Assistant how to understand context. Apple still approaches Siri development in a programmatic fashion. Google launched Assistant with its own powerful search tools and a number of big third-party integrations like IFTTT. Meanwhile, Amazon has given developers a versatile API that has resulted in hundreds of “skills” for Alexa. Apple only launched a third-party API for Siri in 2016, but developers have complained that it’s too restrictive to do anything useful. The lack of progress on Siri has led to several key people leaving the company, including Siri co-founders Adam Cheyer and Dag Kittlaus. They founded Viv Labs, which currently powers Samsung’s new Bixby assistant. Viv was acquired by Samsung last year for $215 million. With the HomePod, Apple is trying to bring Siri out of the phone, but recognizing speech from a distance is only one piece of the puzzle. An analysis of assistants by marketing firm Stone Temple notes that Siri only answered 62 percent of its 5,000-question test. Google and Amazon scored 90 percent. Apple has some work to do.

Here's what you need to know about smart speakers Posted: Thursday, June 8, 2017 4:23 PM EDT Updated: Thursday, June 8, 2017 4:25 PM EDT Apple unveiled HomePod, a new 7-inch tall speaker for playing music, checking the news and controlling other connected devices in the home. By Heather Kelly SAN FRANCISCO (CNNMoney) -- Apple is getting into the smart speaker market with the HomePod, the company's first entirely new product in three years. It's a relatively young hardware category made popular by the Amazon Echo. Now, more tech companies are rushing out their own versions of the device. You've probably heard about talking speakers, but perhaps you've wondered how they work and what they mean for your privacy. Here's everything you need to know about tech's hottest new gadgets. What is a smart speaker? A smart speaker is a small Wi-Fi connected speaker controlled with voice commands. To use the hands-free device, you speak a trigger phrase - "Hey Siri," "OK Google," "Alexa" - and then ask a question such as "what's the weather?" or make a request like "order a Lyft." The speakers are powered by smart assistants like Siri and Alexa that talk back. What is it used for? A smart speaker is primarily used to stream music and news, set timers and reminders, manage shopping lists, and control connected-home devices like lights or thermostats. Amazon recently added message and call options, so the speakers will likely be used even more for communication in the future. The Echo is handy for ordering things from Amazon Prime, but it struggles with answering basic knowledge questions. Meanwhile, the Google Home, unsurprisingly, is great for Googling things. Who makes them? Amazon created the smart speaker market in 2014 with the release of the Echo. Google followed in 2016 with Google Home, and Microsoft is currently working with Harman Kardon on the Invoke smart speaker, which uses voice-assistant Cortana. In early June, Apple announced the HomePod, but it won't be available until December. Third-party devices such as Lenovo's Smart Assistant also use Amazon's Alexa assistant. As of now, most smart speakers plug into a wall, so they're not portable. Amazon's smaller, battery-operated Tap device is designed to play on the go. However, you have to push a button to start Alexa voice conversations. Here's a look at the options available now or coming this year: Amazon Echo ($180); Echo Dot ($50), which connects to bigger speakers; the portable Echo Tap ($130); and Echo Show ($230), a speaker with a touchscreen and camera launching June 28 Google Home ($129) Apple HomePod ($329), which debuts in December Harman Kardon Invoke with Cortana, slated for a 2017 year-end launch. No pricing announced. What about sound quality? The Amazon Echo and Google Home are adequate speakers for the price point, but music lovers can connect them to Bluetooth speakers for better sound. The Echo Dot also attaches to existing speaker systems over Bluetooth or with an audio cable. Apple is marketing the HomePod as a much higher quality speaker -- and it is. When tested against Sonos speakers and the Amazon Echo, the sound was superior. Using its microphones to measure the size of a room, the HomePod "senses" its location and adjusts the sound accordingly. What services and apps do they work with? Each product is a way for a company to sell its own services, like Apple Music, Amazon Prime and Google Play. But the ability to work with third-parties is part of what makes them most useful. The Echo can play music from popular music services like Spotify, Pandora, TuneIn and iHeart Radio. It's currently the leader in this area with more than 10,000 third-party voice apps called "skills." Although most of these skills aren't useful, it's possible to order a pizza or flowers, get wine recommendations or check your bank account balance. Google has fewer third-party integrations and said it plans to add more to its platform soon. It's unclear if the HomePod will work with third-party services right away. Siri can do the usual smart assistant tasks, but the device's music commands are designed specifically to work with a $10 monthly Apple Music subscription. Without one, users can only ask Siri to play podcasts or BeatsOne radio. To listen to music from a library or any other services, you'll need to stream them via Airplay from an iPhone or iPad. What are the privacy concerns? Smart speakers have powerful microphones that are always listening. This can be an unsettling concept for people worried about privacy, but companies say they're not recording when not in use. Once the devices hear a wake word or phrase, they start recording and send your voice to the cloud to complete the request. Even though Apple, Amazon and Google encrypt the data, recordings are saved. In fact, police recently tried to get an Echo's recordings as evidence in a recent murder trial. The Home and Echo also include mute buttons. Apple did not say if or how its speaker could be muted. Who is it for? Anyone who is busy cooking, holding kids or doing other tasks at home will benefit from a hands-free computer. Because the devices understand your natural way of speaking, smart speakers are less complicated to operate than other gadgets, making it an easy-to-use tool for seniors. The list of tasks you can do with just voice is growing across all of these devices. The industry is betting this will be the future of how we interact with computers. Their common inspiration for what's ahead is Star Trek's omnipresent, voice-activated assistant "Computer," which could do everything from calculating a starship's trajectory to making a nice cup of tea.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple is the #3 Company on the Fortune 500 List for 2017 | Main June 08, 2017 A Rogue Group of Chinese Apple Employees Arrested for Selling Apple Customer's Personal Data   It's being reported in China today that Chinese authorities have confirmed that they've "uncovered a massive underground operation run by Apple employees selling computer and phone users' personal data." This may seem like a direct hit on Apple's carefully created policies to protect customer privacy. However, the illegal acts of one rougue group doesn't reflect on Apple directly. It may give Apple a minor PR headache in China temporarily, but such illegal activities aren't sanctioned by Apple. It's not like the case of Samsung getting caught collecting information on their Smart TV owners which was company sanctioned.   The Chinese report notes that "Twenty-two people have been detained on suspicion of infringing individuals' privacy and illegally obtaining their digital personal information, according to a statement Wednesday from local police in southern Zhejiang province.   Of the 22 suspects, 20 were Apple employees who allegedly used the company's internal computer system to gather users' names, phone numbers, Apple IDs, and other data, which they sold as part of a scam worth more than 50 million yuan (US$7.36 million).   Following months of investigation, the statement said, police across more than four provinces — Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian — apprehended the suspects over the weekend, seizing their "criminal tools" and dismantling their online network.   The suspects, who worked in direct marketing and outsourcing for Apple in China, allegedly charged between 10 yuan (US$1.50) and 180 yuan (US$26.50) for pieces of the illegally extracted data.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Apple Wants To Reinvent Home Audio, Whilst Giving You More Control Over Your Home The “Appocalypse,” According To Apple [VIDEO] Mac Apple Debuts Monstrously-Powerful ‘iMac Pro’ By Arron Hirst 10 hours ago Share Tweet We knew Apple was probably working on its most-powerful Mac, ever. But perhaps what no-one was expecting is for the company’s highest-end, pro-focused all-in-one to throw in … the literal kitchen sink. Arrive in the same desktop-redefining form-factor, the sheer power and performance that Apple is packing into its all-new, professional-aimed iMac …must be read to be believed, (and even then, you might not believe it). “Pros love iMac. So when they asked us to build them a killer iMac, we went all in,” the company explains. “An iMac with 8 cores is remarkable enough. But an iMac with up to 18 cores is an entirely different creature.” Complete with turbo boost speeds of up to 4.5GHz, Apple says that it ultimately built the iMac Pro to have both the power and flexibility to balance superb multicore processing, with great single-thread performance. So whether you’re rendering files, editing 4K video, creating real-time audio effects, or compiling your next five-star app, it all gets done at lightning speed. Proof, once again, that there’s strength in numbers. As for the beast behind the beauty? … iMac Pro features Radeon Pro Vega graphics, which, Apple says, is over three times faster than any previous GPU included in an iMac, as it explains that the just-launched graphics architecture packs the power of “a double-wide graphics card” …into a single chip. “All of which translates to higher frame rates for VR, real-time 3D rendering, more lifelike special effects, and gameplay at max settings. It’s one huge reason iMac Pro is power incarnate,” Apple says. But it doesn’t stop there as Apple’s monstrously-powerful desktop all-in-one for pros is now capable of producing 11 teraflops of single precision workflow, (22 teraflops at half precision), as its 8GB or 16GB High Bandwidth Memory and 400 GB/s of available memory bandwidth make the company’s most-powerful all-in-one ever built … scream. The above also makes the iMac Pro a perfect bedrock for the coming Virtual Reality paradigm. Showing off an impressive on-stage demo of the machine’s capabilities to power the most intense of VR solutions and environments, anyone who claims to be serious about the future of VR – should definitely be paying attention to the iMac Pro. “With the new Vega GPU, iMac Pro lets you do more than just immerse yourself in VR worlds. It lets you create them from scratch.” It’s even a power-house in memory — with up to 128GB (2666MHz DDR4 ECC). “So you can visualize, simulate, and render huge 3D models,” Apple says. Create multiple test environments for cross-platform development. Keep numerous apps open at the same time. And slice through data-intensive tasks like a hot knife through butter… … and don’t worry about the storage, as, (in addition to the company offering 2TB as its standard iCloud storage offering at that same £6.99/mo – as of this week), iMac Pro will be able to offer an additional 4TB in SSD at 3GB/s throughput – for those projects you want to keep right at hand. In terms of I/O you’ll find four Thunderbolt 3 ports, allowing you to connect up to two 5K monitors — should you need those… and with data transfer at a blazing 40Gb/s, that brand new 10Gb Ethernet should come in handy – too. Citing that the desktop’s 27-inch screen is its best ever, as it highlights 500 nits of brightness across 14.7 million pixels make for a stunning canvas to work on, along with a P3 color gamut and support for over a billion colors, Apple says that iMac Pro delivers spectacular true-to-life images. Topping it all off is a brand new look. Now available in Space Grey, Apple notes that the iMac Pro’s accessories are wireless, rechargeable, and beautiful to behold. Plus, the new Magic Keyboard includes a numeric keypad and comes with your choice of either Magic Mouse 2 or Magic Trackpad 2. Availability As for when you can get your own hands on this beast? … Well, just like HomePod, Apples top-of-the-line pro desktop solution will land this December … and that’s probably a good thing considering you’ll likely want to start saving now for its expected $4,999 (£3,870/AU$6,680) asking.

Here’s what you need to know about smart speakers Apple’s HomePod is coming. Here’s what you need to know about smart speakers Posted on Thursday, June 8, 2017 by CNN in Business News Apple is getting into the smart speaker market with the HomePod, the company’s first entirely new product in three years. It’s a relatively young hardware category made popular by the Amazon Echo. Now, more tech companies are rushing out their own versions of the device. You’ve probably heard about talking speakers, but perhaps you’ve wondered how they work and what they mean for your privacy. Here’s everything you need to know about tech’s hottest new gadgets. What is a smart speaker? A smart speaker is a small Wi-Fi connected speaker controlled with voice commands. To use the hands-free device, you speak a trigger phrase — “Hey Siri,” “OK Google,” “Alexa” — and then ask a question such as “what’s the weather?” or make a request like “order a Lyft.” The speakers are powered by smart assistants like Siri and Alexa that talk back. What is it used for? A smart speaker is primarily used to stream music and news, set timers and reminders, manage shopping lists, and control connected-home devices like lights or thermostats. Amazon recently added message and call options, so the speakers will likely be used even more for communication in the future. The Echo is handy for ordering things from Amazon Prime, but it struggles with answering basic knowledge questions. Meanwhile, the Google Home, unsurprisingly, is great for Googling things. Who makes them? Amazon created the smart speaker market in 2014 with the release of the Echo. Google followed in 2016 with Google Home, and Microsoft is currently working with Harman Kardon on the Invoke smart speaker, which uses voice-assistant Cortana. In early June, Apple announced the HomePod, but it won’t be available until December. Third-party devices such as Lenovo’s Smart Assistant also use Amazon’s Alexa assistant. As of now, most smart speakers plug into a wall, so they’re not portable. Amazon’s smaller, battery-operated Tap device is designed to play on the go. However, you have to push a button to start Alexa voice conversations. Here’s a look at the options available now or coming this year: Amazon Echo ($180); Echo Dot ($50), which connects to bigger speakers; the portable Echo Tap ($130); and Echo Show ($230), a speaker with a touchscreen and camera launching June 28 Google Home ($129) Apple HomePod ($329), which debuts in December Harman Kardon Invoke with Cortana, slated for a 2017 year-end launch. No pricing announced. What about sound quality? The Amazon Echo and Google Home are adequate speakers for the price point, but music lovers can connect them to Bluetooth speakers for better sound. The Echo Dot also attaches to existing speaker systems over Bluetooth or with an audio cable. Apple is marketing the HomePod as a much higher quality speaker — and it is. When tested against Sonos speakers and the Amazon Echo, the sound was superior. Using its microphones to measure the size of a room, the HomePod “senses” its location and adjusts the sound accordingly. What services and apps do they work with? Each product is a way for a company to sell its own services, like Apple Music, Amazon Prime and Google Play. But the ability to work with third-parties is part of what makes them most useful. The Echo can play music from popular music services like Spotify, Pandora, TuneIn and iHeart Radio. It’s currently the leader in this area with more than 10,000 third-party voice apps called “skills.” Although most of these skills aren’t useful, it’s possible to order a pizza or flowers, get wine recommendations or check your bank account balance. Google has fewer third-party integrations and said it plans to add more to its platform soon. It’s unclear if the HomePod will work with third-party services right away. Siri can do the usual smart assistant tasks, but the device’s music commands are designed specifically to work with a $10 monthly Apple Music subscription. Without one, users can only ask Siri to play podcasts or BeatsOne radio. To listen to music from a library or any other services, you’ll need to stream them via Airplay from an iPhone or iPad. What are the privacy concerns? Smart speakers have powerful microphones that are always listening. This can be an unsettling concept for people worried about privacy, but companies say they’re not recording when not in use. Once the devices hear a wake word or phrase, they start recording and send your voice to the cloud to complete the request. Even though Apple, Amazon and Google encrypt the data, recordings are saved. In fact, police recently tried to get an Echo’s recordings as evidence in a recent murder trial. The Home and Echo also include mute buttons. Apple did not say if or how its speaker could be muted. Who is it for? Anyone who is busy cooking, holding kids or doing other tasks at home will benefit from a hands-free computer. Because the devices understand your natural way of speaking, smart speakers are less complicated to operate than other gadgets, making it an easy-to-use tool for seniors. The list of tasks you can do with just voice is growing across all of these devices. The industry is betting this will be the future of how we interact with computers. Their common inspiration for what’s ahead is Star Trek’s omnipresent, voice-activated assistant “Computer,” which could do everything from calculating a starship’s trajectory to making a nice cup of tea.

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You BEIJING: Chinese authorities say they have uncovered a massive underground operation run by Apple employees selling computer and phone users’ personal data. Twenty-two people have been detained on suspicion of infringing individuals’ privacy and illegally obtaining their digital personal information, according to a statement on Wednesday from local police in southern Zhejiang province. Of the 22 suspects, 20 were Apple employees who allegedly used the company’s internal computer system to gather users’ names, phone numbers, Apple IDs and other data, which they sold as part of a scam worth more than 50 million yuan ($7.36 million). The statement did not specify whether the data belonged to Chinese or foreign Apple customers. Following months of investigation, the statement said, police across more than four provinces apprehended the suspects over the weekend, seizing their "criminal tools" and dismantling their online network. The suspects, who worked in direct marketing and outsourcing for Apple in China, allegedly charged between 10 yuan ($1.50) and 180 yuan ($26.50) for pieces of the illegally extracted data.

Hanna HowardJun 8, 2017 4:12PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestApple This week's Apple WWDC came with plenty of exciting announcements, including a new iPad Pro, a totally upgraded desktop iMac, and of course, Apple's Google Home/Amazon Echo competitor, the HomePod, which brings Siri to a whole new level. But the announcement we're most excited about is iOS 11 — which will totally change the way we use our iPhones (and hopefully, our new iPhone 8 come fall). After all, we're pretty much constantly glued to them. Below, here are the features of iOS 11 we're looking forward to the most. One-handed typingIf you've got small hands and a big 7 Plus, or are just often texting one-handed (like when you're also holding a latte or onto a subway pole) you'll love this. iOS 11 makes it easier to get your messages out when you're juggling a million things — just touch and hold the emoji key, select one-handed typing, and the keyboard shifts closer to your thumb. So no more struggle-reaching when you're trying to alert your BFF to an update on Queen Bey's twins. Using Apple Pay to repay our bestiesLet's be real, we only have space for so many apps (hello, storage space) and now that we'll be able to pay our friends back for that Starbucks run over iMessage using Apple Pay, Venmo may have to go. Of course, it won't work for our Android friends, so maybe the app is still safe. And speaking of storage space... Photo and Video CompressionNo word on whether they used Richard Hendricks' compression algorithm, but Apple has heard our cries when it comes to how much space our selfies take up. Seriously, is there anything more frustrating than going to take a pic and getting told you don't have enough storage space? Luckily, iOS 11's new compression means your photos and videos will take up half the space they used to. Now that deserves a celebratory selfie. Live PhotosAs much as we love Live Photos, one of our biggest pet peeves is that sometimes the best part of the photo is caught just before or after it snapped. Thankfully, Apple is giving us the ability to go into those files and not only select the best frame, but also loop them (AKA insta-gif) and "Bounce" them — which results in a Boomerang-like effect.

Tech giant Apple has introduced a Kannada keyboard in the latest version of its operating system, iOS11. That marks a triumph of sorts for users who had campaigned at least for five years to be able to write Kannada on their Apple devices. The latest release means iPhone and iPad users can now write notes and send text and email messages in Kannada. Malayalam is the other Indian language included in the latest iOS. “The decision to include Kannada and Malayalam keyboards in iOS11 is part of the company’s policy to support Indian languages. We try to add as many languages as possible, from across the world, with each update,” an official in Apple’s India division told DH. The company is headquartered in Cupertino, USA. Apple added Tamil in its iOS7 back in 2013. In iOS9, it added Hinglish (converting English to Devanagari script), Telugu, Punjabi and Gujarati. Hindi, Marathi, Bengali and Urdu are the other languages supported on its operating system. On Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled iOS11, which incorporates the Kannada and Malayalam keyboards, in San Jose. Apple has not announced a release date yet. However, if iOS10 release dates are any indication, then the beta version of the latest update should be available within a month. The final release is expected in September. The languages are available on devices that can update to the latest release. (The company cuts off support as it phases out older devices) Thousands of users had written to the Apple support group on Twitter, Facebook and email, demanding a Kannada keyboard. The Apple insider acknowledged the campaign, but attributed the inclusion to an internal process. “Including more and more languages is a continuous process. Kannada and Malayalam are part of the latest iOS because work on those keyboards was completed,” he said. The updated keyboard allows third party developers to come up with Kannada apps. So, is a Kannada user interface coming up for the operating system? “At the moment, it’s just keyboard support,” the Apple insider said. DH News Service Sustained campaign Kannada Grahakara Koota, a forum of Kannada consumers, has used Twitter and Facebook since 2012 to seek a Kannada keyboard. “It was a consumer-driven campaign. Google and Microsoft came up with Kannada support ages ago, but not Apple. We sent hundreds of mails and messages to them,” said Koota member Babu Ajay Kumar. Google recently expanded support for Kannada, offering more services in the language. It placed the language second-best among all Indian languages to adapt to the internet. Kannada is spoken by a little over five crore people, according to the 2001 census. “We’re happy with the inclusion in the latest iOS,” said Ajay Kumar. “Better late than never.” Email this page Print this page Tweet Go to Top Videos What's up at Bellandur Lake?

To support development needs, Apple is selling a special $599 External Graphics Development Kit directly to developers. Josh Farkas, CEO of Cubicle Ninjas, received an External Graphics Development Kit and subsequently tweeted his unboxing. The kit includes a Sonnet eGPU box, an AMD Radeon RX 580 and a Belkin USB hub. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? As noted in our hands-on post with High Sierra’s native eGPU support, the $599 bundle is a fair price when you consider how much each component costs individually. RX-series cards are also hard to come by at the current time. Most units seem to be on backorder, and those that are available are selling for a much higher price than normal. It is worth noting, however, that you don’t have to purchase the Apple-provided kit in order to take advantage of official eGPU support in High Sierra. You can use any supported graphics card, along with a supported eGPU box like the Akitio Node. There is a reported advantage to using Sonnet’s box, though, as it’s noted for being particularly quiet.

In addition to providing the self-described "biggest AR platform in the world," iOS 11—which will be available as a free update for iPhone and iPad users this fall—also takes several steps toward making modern life less of a chore. Below, we take a closer look at our favorite new features. Smarter Siri ​With iOS 11, Siri will receive fresh male and female voices that are more expressive than ever before. These new voices will be able to translate from English to a variety of languages, including Mandarin and Spanish. The new Siri will also give iPhone and iPad users personalized suggestions based on how they utilize the Safari browser and other standard Apple features. Send and receive money with Apple Pay Finally, Apple Pay will allow users to send and receive money to friends right inside Messages. Siri can also be instructed to send an Apple Pay payment, which will be stored in the user's Apple Pay Cash account. Apple Pay Cash balance can be transferred to a bank account or used as payment in stores and online. Do Not Disturb while driving Do not disturb while driving. Bravo, Apple. BRAVO. pic.twitter.com/3qSwBD8nAR — Steph Haberman (@StephLauren) June 5, 2017 To combat the growing problem of drivers being dangerously distracted by phone activity while on the road, Apple is introducing a new Do Not Disturb feature. When enabled, the driver's phone will be able to detect when a user is behind the wheel. Once driving is detected, notifications are silenced to ensure the screen remains dark. Favorite contacts can then be sent a standard auto-reply alerting them that the user is currently driving. Screen Recorder Apple didn't discuss this feature during the WWDC keynote Monday. According to Gizmodo, however, Screen Recorder was found by Reddit users while testing the iOS 11 beta for developers. The feature allows users to capture phone activity, with the option to edit and add annotations to the recorded content. Admittedly, this feature sounds like it could cause problems for some users. Better iPad experience In my brief usage, the iPad iOS 11 updates are a game changer for the device - and the screen on the 10.5inch model looked fantastic. — Mark Gurman (@markgurman) June 6, 2017 iOS 11 unlocks the full potential of iPad. The update, including the new customizable Dock, has been touted by Apple as the "biggest release ever" for iPad. Users will also have access to a new Files app for greater organization.

 This new iPhone feature could be bad news for your privacy Lucy Yang, INSIDER Jun. 8, 2017, 3:06 PM 163 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple iOS 11 could change the way we use Snapchat and Instagram. happydancing/Shutterstock The INSIDER Summary: Apple debuted iOS 11 on Monday, the next big software update for the iPhone and iPad. Coming this fall, iOS 11 has a bunch of useful new features that I'm excited to try. However, screen recording is one new feature that could do more harm than good. On iOS 11, people will be able to record your Snapchats and Instagram Stories without your knowledge or consent. People on Twitter are already freaking out. As you probably know by now, Apple debuted the next big software update for the iPhone on Monday. iOS 11 comes out this fall, and with it, a trove of cool new features including the ability to customize your Control Center, professional-quality camera filters, and a one-handed keyboard. GIFs will finally animate in Photos; Apple Maps might actually suck a little less. There's one feature, however, that I'm not sold on: screen recording.  So you can screen record on iOS 11 💀 pic.twitter.com/yR9jadNrWP — Faiz (@fvizs) June 6, 2017 I get why Apple added it. As someone who frequently records her iPhone screen, I know how annoying and time-consuming it is to rely on QuickTime Player to get the job done. That's the good part — iOS 11's screen recording feature will no doubt open new doors for content creators. The tool even lets you edit screen recordings on your iPhone, as seen below. But there's a catch. Screen recording will make it easier than ever for people to capture everything you do on social media. Think about it: Now, at least when someone screenshots your Snapchat or Instagram Story, you get a notification. When iOS 11 comes out, however, disappearing pictures, videos, and messages might become a thing of the past, threatened by the permanency of screen recording. As people on Twitter have already pointed out, soon enough, anything you share online with your friends and followers could be saved on someone's phone forever — and you won't even know it.  iOS 11 got a screen record feature? I'm deactivating Snapchat. pic.twitter.com/gwY0aVL9B6 — westwood (@habwestwood) June 6, 2017 You can screen record on iOS 11 y'all better stop sending nudes on snapchat lmao pic.twitter.com/sQ9rTBBhS4 — notliluzivert (@chilldarnell) June 6, 2017 IOS 11 is gonna expose people you can screen record snaps. rt to save a life pic.twitter.com/gI3w9lymSk — BB2deuce (@bb2deuce) June 6, 2017 So while it may sound dramatic, it's probably a good idea to be more careful about what you post on Snapchat, Instagram, and other social media platforms when everyone starts updating to iOS 11 in the fall.

Apple revealed features that will be included in the upcoming iOS 11 update at WWDC this week. The iOS 11 is expected to roll out this fall, coinciding with Apple’s new smartphone lineup, which will include the company’s much-anticipated iPhone 8, which will be the company's 10th anniversary iPhone. Read: Siri vs. Alexa vs. Google Assistant: Apple Struggling With Privacy Concerns iOS 11 Maps Going to the mall? Apple wants to help you out. The iOS 11 update will allow you to see floor plans, let you browse floors, view directories and search. The feature will be available at malls in select cities to start, including New York, Boston, Tokyo, Chicago and London. It’ll also work at airports, which means you will be able to see where security is and where food venues are. The airport feature will be available in select cities worldwide to begin. Apple will add more locations in the future. Maps will also allow drivers to see speed limits and provide lane guidance. iOS 11 Do Not Disturb While Driving iOS 11 will not only help out drivers with Maps but also with its new Do Not Disturb While Driving feature. The mode automatically senses when the user is on the road, using speed detection. The feature shows a blank interface, turns off notifications while driving and also sends an auto-reply message when people send you texts, saying you’ll answer later. If someone is trying to contact you and it’s an emergency, they’ll be able to type in “urgent” so they can reach you while the feature is on. You can also disable the feature if you’re just a passenger. iOS Siri Update Siri will come with an improved interface, which will show multiple results, and feature a male voice option. Siri also will work as your translator. You’ll be able to ask Siri how to say a phrase in a different language and the virtual assistant will translate it for you. The translations will be available in Chinese, French, German, Spanish and Italian, with more languages coming in the next months. Siri will also understand context, your interests and how you use your device to predict what you’ll do next. Using that knowledge, Siri will be able to suggest topics in the News app, give you better response suggestions in the iMessage app and make calendar alerts based on something you have booked in Safari. The knowledge Siri collects will be synced across your Apple devices.

Most importantly, the iPhone maker announced you will be able to make person-to-person payments with Apple Pay. You’ll be able to send and receive money using your Touch ID while you’re messaging your friends and family. Apple Pay will be integrated into iMessage with iOS 11. Your iPhone will be able to detect when someone tells you money is owed in an iMessage and will pull up Apple Pay as a suggestion. The money you receive will be added to your Apple Pay Cash Card. The card can be used to send money to others on your device, make purchases with Apple Pay and transfer the funds to your bank. iOS 11 Camera Improvements iOS 11 is solving a problem everyone struggles with: storage. The update will compress video with high-efficiency video coding, offering up to two times better compression, Apple said. That should help save storage space on devices and iCloud. The Memories feature on the Photos app will create movies based on certain events or topics, which will be viewable in portrait and landscape mode. Apple added improvements to Live Photos, including a Boomerang-like feature and the ability to save single frames. Extra Features On iOS 11 The iOS 11 update will also include a single-page Control Center. Using 3D Touch on Control Center options will give users access to more controls, including brightness, volume and music. iMessage will come with a redesigned drawer for apps and stickers. iOS 11 will also automatically synchronize iCloud and iMessage conversations.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts HomeKit gains easier setup with NFC/QR Codes, improved latency, support for sprinklers/faucets & more Christian Zibreg on June 8, 2017 1 Interesting new capabilities for HomeKit, Apple’s home automation framework, were announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference earlier this week. The new features were designed to make the smart home platform more flexible for users and even more accessible to third-party developers and device makers in order to encourage faster adoption. For starters, Apple no longer requires vendors to use dedicated encryption chips in their gadgets. But the big news is that hobbyists and enthusiasts (or just about anyone with an Apple developer account) are now permitted to create prototypes of HomeKit devices without being MFi-certified. Apple’s “What’s New in HomeKit” developer session provides a wealth of information on the new end-user capabilities for HomeKit, like easier setup with QR Codes and NFC, greatly improved responsiveness, support for new smart home device types, like sprinklers and faucets, and much more. HomeKit now implements new triggers and events, making it possible to automatically run scenes based on who is home, only at certain times, and with more types of accessories. HomeKit scenes and accessories can be controlled through iOS 11’s Control Center, with Siri, using the Home app on iPhone, iPad, iPod touch or Apple Watch, and via Apple’s new HomePod smart speaker. And with an Apple TV, an iPad or a HomePod actings as a HomeKit hub, you can control your smart home products from just about anywhere in the world. Sprinklers and faucets With support for two new product categories—sprinklers and faucets—users can now control water in the garden via Siri. Or, you could have Siri turn on the shower in the morning, knowing the water will be the right temperature by the time you finish your morning coffee. Greatly improved responsiveness Many HomeKit accessories use the low-energy Bluetooth standard. In order to reduce the latency which occurs when a Bluetooth accessory communicates with a HomeKit hub, Apple is rolling out a completely new system based on secure broadcast sessions that now send a notification to a HomeKit device. This reduces the latency between a new event and the actual accessory state change from a few seconds down to under a second. You won’t have to buy new products: when iOS 11 launches, all your existing accessories will take advantage of improved responsiveness. Easier setup On iOS 10, setting up a home accessory requires launching the Home app, turning on the accessory, tapping the Add option and scanning the special setup code printed on the product’s box to authenticate the device. It is currently not possible to pair a turned-off HomeKit device. With iOS 11, you can pair a HomeKit accessory by scanning its code while it’s powered off. Furthermore, Apple  now supports scanning QR Codes for HomeKit authentication. QR Codes can be as small as 10-by-10 millimeters so this seemingly small change will turn authenticating really tiny HomeKit accessories into a frictionless process. And with all-new support for NFC tags (who knew, right?), accessory makers can deliver easier experiences where authenticating a HomeKit device is as easy as tap-and-pair. New event triggers New events, triggers, recurrences and enhancements for mutable events allow for a significantly elevated flexibility of HomeKit scenes. HomeKit can now run scenes based on who is home, only at certain times, and more. Date-based events let HomeKit triggers to fire off only at certain times (like 5pm every day, for instance). Significant time events activate triggers on sunrise or sunset, with positive or negative offsets. For example, you could have HomeKit trigger your “I’m at home” scene an hour after sunset or have the lamps in your home turned on right before the sun goes down. A new convenience condition in iOS 11 makes it easy to create a custom condition between two significant events. As an example, you could have a scene running from one hour before sunset to one hour before sunrise. Another new iOS 11 condition allows HomeKit to execute a scene when a custom threshold is exceeded. For instance, you could set your air conditioning/heater to kick in when the temperature in your home rises above 76 degrees or when it’s between 50 and 76 degrees. A new presence event lets HomeKit activate scenes when a user arrives home , or leaves home. And with multi-user support, you now can have triggers activate automatically when the last known user leaves home (to shut down the lights, air conditioning, lock the doors and so forth) or the first user arrives home to an empty house. End events support specifying the time interval from the event execution time. Apple provided the example of opening a door at night, which triggers an event that turns on the outside lights for just a few minutes. Currently, there’s no way to have a HomeKit device enable a certain state for a period of time. And with recurrences, it’s possible to execute triggers only on certain days of the week. For instance, if you like to sleep a little longer on Saturdays, you can now restrict the execution of your “Good morning” scene to workdays only. Plus, HomeKit now supports creating an event that triggers once, then auto-disables itself. AirPlay 2 Apple also unveiled a new version of AirPlay, called AirPlay 2. AirPlay 2 supports multi-room audio and HomeKit, meaning your smart home products can now communicate with your AirPlay 2-enabled speakers or Apple’s own HomePod speaker. You can control multi-room audio playback through HomeKit, as long as your wireless speaker or home audio setup works with AirPlay 2. Apple-owned Beats, as well as audio equipment makers like Bose, Bang & Olufsen, Bowers & Wilkins, Marantz and many others have pledged their support for AirPlay 2. With HomeKit and AirPlay 2, “third-party audio apps will be able to get in on the multi-room audio fun,” said Apple’s software engineering chief Craig Federighi said onstage during the WWDC keynote. Relaxed licensing HomeKit has always been, first and foremost, about user security. And because Apple does not compromise about requiring HomeKit developers and vendors to use end-to-end encryption, HomeKit user data is far from being insecure as it unfortunately is with most other platforms for the connected home. For starters, all HomeKit makers must adhere to Apple’s strict “Made for iOS” (MFi) policies and use Apple’s authentication chips to guarantee user privacy and security with strong hardware-based encryption. On the downside, this complicates hardware development and makes HomeKit devices pricier than rival gadgets. The updated HomeKit specification now includes a new option allowing all the HomeKit authorization to go through software. Although software-based encryption is slower versus a dedicated chip, it has the benefit of shortened development times and lower cost. But more important than that, existing devices that currently lack HomeKit integration will now be able to implement HomeKit support after iOS 11 launches this fall in software, without requiring a hardware change. Apple now operates two HomeKit certification labs in the United States and is scheduled to open similar labs in the United Kingdom and China next month, which should help local vendors bring their HomeKit hardware to market faster. Apple also wants encourage hobbyists to build their own HomeKit devices. During WWDC 2017, the company announced that developers no longer have to be MFi-certified to build prototypes of smart home accessories. Not only that, but HomeKit developers can now use popular developer boards like Raspberry Pi and Arduino. Of course, MFi certification is still required before products can be sold to customers. That said, the fact that Apple now permits regular people to tinker with HomeKit and even build their own accessories from scratch, for personal use, without an MFi license, should help accelerate the adoption of the platform. These new HomeKit features are available across iOS 11, watchOS 4 and tvOS 11. macOS currently does not support HomeKit. HomeKit debuted two years ago at the 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference.

The aim of the show is that app developers compete to win the support of a mentor who will then back their app, helping with both money and know-how on developing a market beating app. It sounds like a great idea, but the opening episode is worth watching mainly for the sight of mutual incomprehension between developers and judges. The first episode of the show was premiered on the second day of Apple's WWDC conference, after which it was made available for free on Apple Music and iTunes. The next nine episodes will be launched weekly, and will be limited to subscribers of Apple Music. The original idea came from Will.i.am of Black Eyed Peas fame, who came up with the concept and pitched it to Apple. He is one of the show's judges, along with host Jessica Alba (founder of Honest Company), Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow, and VaynerMedia founder, Gary Vaynerchuk. One problem this raises is that while each of the judges is undoubtedly successful and charismatic, they're not known for their long history of developing winning apps, or even having companies that develop apps.     Each would-be entrepreneur introduces the idea of their app while moving down a long escalator for a minute - presumably like an elevator pitch, but made more visual. If at least one judge likes their idea enough to vote 'yes' while they're moving down, they get a chance to tell more about their idea. For much of the time, the judges looked either bored or confused while the pitch was being made. At various points they also backed out of potential mentoring situations because of lack of expertise. However, two of the judges did agree to help contestants to the next stage - that of meeting a venture capitalist in the hope of securing funding. Jessica Alba mentored Andrew Kemendo, developer of an app that uses augmented reality to help people choose furniture, while Gary Vaynerchuk mentored Jake Wayne and Lexie Ernst for their app which tracks your location and shares it with a chosen 'companion' so you can stay safe. In fact this app already had a sizable user base before the show, and the venture capitalist liked it enough to back it with $1 million in funding. The verdict of most people we've spoken to who watched the show was that the makers of Shark and similar shows needn't lose sleep if this is the best Apple can do. It's not funny and mainstream enough to be of general interest, and doesn't do the tech topics well enough or in enough detail to appeal to techies. Of course, thinking Apple's missed the mark is a dangerous idea - Apple has a long history of polishing ideas until they really are attractive. For the moment, watch Episode 1 for the amusement.   More Information Planet Of The Apps Website Related Articles Apple Previews App Pitching TV Show   To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.   WC3 Front-End Web Developer Professional Certification on edX 30/05/2017 This new Professional Certificate Program opens on edX today.

Android creator Andy Rubin burst back onto the scene recently with a new company, Essential, and a feature-packed smartphone featuring an edge-to-edge display, a 360-degree camera, and an all-in-one magnetic port to which you can "snap" different accessories. Details have been few and far between on Essential Phone, the company's new Essential Home device, and Ambient custom operating system, but Rubin provided a peek behind the curtain this week at the Wired Business Conference. After his keynote, Rubin—who just secured $300 million in funding for his new company—gave reporters, including PCMag, a very brief Essential Phone hands, and shed some light on why he thinks Essential can compete with smartphone and smart home giants. Ambient OS While Essential's website gives plenty of details and specs on the phone and smart home device, there is far less information about Ambient OS. Rubin wouldn't let reporters actually get past the lock screen while we handled the phone, but he hopes the custom, open-source Android operating system will stitch various platforms together—even iOS, if he can somehow convince Apple to let him. "Think about Apple. What Apple has with HomeKit is a bunch of individual consumer electronics companies enabling HomeKit with their products. These devices don't only speak to HomeKit, they speak to others as well," said Rubin. "Apple is trying to be the screen that drives these things." Rubin talked about using a drag-and-drop programming model (which sounds a bit like low-code app development) in Ambient OS to make app creation easier and "redefine what a developer is" with Essential. "We need to change who the installer is. Developing for smartphones is too difficult," said Rubin. "It's almost like you have to go somewhere like Udacity to be a good iOS or Android developer. "The reason we created a new OS is to solve the UI problem and redefine who a developer is," he continued. "Once you do the job of bridging these islands [between different mobile OSes], you rise above these other UIs and become a holistic interface for every product that might be in your life." Essential Home We also got a look at (but couldn't take pictures of) the large round LCD discs serving as the screen for the as-yet unreleased Essential Home. Rubin described the smart home device as "a big round LCD that underneath it is everything that's in a smartphone." "It's a new way to leverage the economies of scale of smartphones in different touch screens," said Rubin. He also mentioned that Essential Home will include an array microphone, but wouldn't give any other details as to whether that might play into more advanced calling or video-chat features in the device. The Key Is Interoperability Rubin said interoperability is the differentiator with Essential. He described Essential's development philosophy as an "anti-walled garden" approach with the open-source Android OS as one part of that and the magnetic accessory port as another. Rubin wants Essential's ecosystem to interoperate with every other system out there, and he thinks consumers want that, too. "We have a team of engineers—a lot of them—doing the job of other people to make our product work with theirs. Other companies are sitting there in their ecosystems expecting people to come to them and they get to say yes or no," said Rubin. "We're actively going out and connecting with people because that's where consumers want to live." Rubin added: "When there's this duopoly with two guys owning 40 percent of the market, there's a sense of complacency that 'okay, I'll just go to them.' That's the perfect time to start a company to disrupt them." What About Augmented Reality? When asked about whether augmented reality (AR) capabilities would be baked into the platform as Apple is doing with ARKit, Rubin said that while his Playground incubator has invested in AR companies, he's taking baby steps. He pointed to Project Tango as the standard for 3D tracking and depth perception in smartphones, but said he's still waiting for the "end product," a day when you might have a head-mounted display and somehow connect it to your smartphone...maybe with a magnetic port like that of Essential. "What's a developer going to build with AR? So far I've seen interactive media. Games, movies, or game-like movies where you're both a participant and a viewer," said Rubin. "That's too mixed reality for me, and the mixed part hasn't been proven. "When consumers are ready for it, whether it's a motorcycle helmet that overlays data or goggles they'll use for a board game [Rubin is an investor in CastAR], we'll be there. The problems with stuff like Oculus and HTC Vive right now are the price and the setup. They're not ready for primetime." Don't Call It a Modular Phone Rubin considers Project Ara the definition of modular: where you can remove a core component like the processor and replace it. "We're not doing that, which is why I prefer the term 'magnetic accessory,'" he said. Rubin called Essential a "pro consumer brand" that doesn't ask you to get a new weird dongle every time a new accessory comes out. With features like the snap-on 360-degree camera, Rubin said he wants to move the needle toward a format change in the future, and give consumers a more active role in driving smartphone innovation. Related Essential PH-1 vs. Galaxy S8: Sleek Flagships Face Off Essential PH-1 vs. Galaxy S8: Sleek Flagships Face Off "Consumers need to tell me whether there's enough innovation in this. The 360-degree camera and the magnetic accessory are two things," said Rubin. "We're in a saturated smartphone market where everyone who wants a smartphone has one, and the consumer doesn't get to feel the innovation anymore. The reason we built this magnetic connector is to continuously produce innovation and show it to the consumer in real time. It's almost like software updates for hardware." Wireless connectors are also important to Rubin's vision. He said Essential is using Wireless USB 3.0 and has transceivers working at speeds of 10 gigabits per second. "A wireless connector is the holy grail and we're this close to it," said Rubin. "The benefit of a wireless connector is that I don't suffer from what Moto Mod does, where every accessory has to be in exactly the same location. They've painted themselves into a corner because it has to match all these accessories or throw them away and come out with new ones. I can come out with a phone that as long as it has this magnetic area on it, you can use the accessory." Previous : Alexa, Make It Easier for Me to Stream a Movie Tired of Netflix?

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: Imran Taylor Apple’s ambitious iPhone 8 design could already be causing problems Chris Mills @chrisfmills June 8th, 2017 at 2:59 PM Share Tweet From everything we’ve heard so far, the iPhone 8 that Apple plans to debut later this year will be a departure from the status quo. Rumored new features include an OLED panel, edge-to-edge display, under-screen fingerprint sensor, and possibly even wireless charging. Any one of those would be a big undertaking for a phone company. Trying to do all four at once is just asking for problems, and according to new supply-chain rumors, problems are exactly what Apple is getting. Don't Miss: Let’s talk about the iPhone 8, which might make one of the worst design compromises we’ve ever seen Investment bank RBC has told MarketsInsider that a number of key iPhone 8 suppliers are having problems with the specifications and volume of parts needed for the iPhone 8, which could push production back by months. Samsung, the lead OLED panel provider, is reportedly struggling with integrating the fingerprint sensor under the screen. It’s “presented challenges,” according to RBC, which on its own could delay the phone’s launch by months. Broadcom, which manufactures some of the wireless components, and Analog Devices Incorporated, a sensor supplier, have also reportedly seen “slow growth in their supply chains this quarter,” which is a fancy way of saying that there’s production issues. Going from prototype to full-scale manufacturing is always an issue, and the specs and volume of components that Apple is demanding seems to be causing problems across the board. It’s unclear exactly what these delays mean in terms of the launch date for the iPhone 8. Traditionally, Apple has announced its new iPhone every year in September, and had it on shelves two weeks later. This year, it’s already expected that Apple will miss that launch date, although some kind of reveal of the device in September (with a launch a couple months later) is still possible. The big question now is whether Apple gets the phone out in time for holiday sales. Sure, the iPhone 8 is expected to drive a “super-cycle” of upgrades regardless, but a bump in sales from Christmas madness would go some way to justifying the insane expectations on iPhone 8 sales. RBC, for its part, doesn’t see the delay as a problem, saying “We think a shift in OLED production by 1-2 months doesn’t change the demand dynamics for iPhones (fairly captive demand) or undermines the positive iPhone upgrade cycle narrative.” That’s a fancy-ass analyst way of saying that iPhone owners are dumbly loyal and will basically buy whatever Apple makes.

(Bigstock Photo / mshch) Don’t drop your iPhone while reading this news, but Apple is planning a major shift when it comes to the repair of cracked screens on its devices. In an exclusive new report, Reuters says the tech giant will put its proprietary machines for making repairs into third-party businesses for the first time. Until now, Apple has closely guarded its Horizon Machine, only allowing them in its nearly 500 retail stores and mail-in repair centers. But screen repair is a multi-billion dollar global business, and Reuters reports that the change comes as wait times at Apple stores increase — as does pressure from several U.S. states with “right-to-repair” bills. While many of us have sought out the cheapest remedy for an all-to-common problem, fixing cracked screens goes beyond just the glass, in some cases, Apple says. The Horizon Machine is needed when the fingerprint sensor attached to the back of the glass gets damaged during a drop of the phone, Reuters reports, adding that only Apple’s device can tell the iPhone’s processor to recognize a replacement sensor. Without it, the iPhone won’t unlock with the touch of a finger. Apple, which refuses to say where the machines are made or by whom, told Reuters in an exclusive look at the repair process in a Cupertino, Calif., lab, that the aim is to make it look like the phone just came out of the box. The initial rollout aims to put machines in 200, or about 4 percent, of Apple’s 4,800 authorized service providers — such as Best Buy — worldwide over the next few months, Reuters reports. The company plans to double that figure by the end of the year. Writer and editor Kurt Schlosser covers the Geek Life beat for GeekWire.

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UWSaeN The images are being used to enhance Street View, a component of the company’s popular Google Maps app, as the firm searches for new features that will entice users ALSO READ Google Maps to ease transit in seven more Indian cities Google brands its service in pixels One reason staffers quit Google's car project? They were paid too much Google takes on Apple in India with music streaming service at Rs 89/month Google Play spend up 70%, India key contributor Google is coming across some unusual challenges as it seeks to capture eye-level imagery of the most remote parts of the globe.   In a recent foray into the Australian outback, Google’s amateur cartographers used a backpack to lug bulky camera equipment around Uluru, a popular tourist site also known as Ayers Rock. One hitch: they had to avoid photographing certain parts of the red rock formation that are especially sacred to the local Aboriginal people.   Having taken shots of many of the world’s streets using cameras on vehicles, Google is moving to more difficult locations. On the South Pacific island of Vanuatu, where it captured images of a volcano, the company sought to photograph lava without any of its cameras falling in. And in Cambodia, monkeys destroyed its equipment.   The images are being used to enhance Street View, a component of the company’s popular Google Maps app, as the company searches for new features that will entice users. Starting today, users will be able to take a continuous, virtual walk around much of Uluru.   Maps are becoming more important to the world’s largest technology companies as they chase billions of dollars in potential advertising revenue and invest in something that is crucial to the autonomous-vehicle industry. The value of ads that are based on a user’s location will grow to $32 billion by 2021 from $12 billion in 2016 in the U.S., according to estimates from BIA/Kelsey, a media and advertising consulting firm. These location-targeted ads will take up 45 per cent of the mobile-ad market by 2021, the firm said, up from 38 percent last year.   Google, a part of Alphabet Inc.,  has been cautiously adding advertising to Google Maps. Last year, it unveiled “promoted pins,” where location markers appear in different colors to advertise certain businesses. The challenge for Google is integrating ads without cluttering the app.   Competitors in mapping include Apple Inc. and a host of other players, including privately-held Here Technologies, which is part-owned by German automakers Audi AG , BMW AG and Daimler AG. In the market for general consumers, Google has a clear lead. Google Maps was the fourth most popular mobile app overall in the U.S., while Apple Maps was the 12th most popular, according to a 2016 report from comScore.   On Monday, Apple said it would add floor plans for airports and malls in cities like Hong Kong, London and Chicago to its Maps app. It also is updating the app to show speed limits and lane navigation for drivers. The company hasn’t said anything about extending its maps to remote locations.   While Here Technologies isn’t focusing on cultural sites like Uluru in the same way as Google is, it has a fleet of camera-equipped cars mapping roads in remote regions of the Philippines.   “Cars have been stuck in mud, cars have not been too successful in crossing creeks and rivers, and cars have been stuck in sand,” said Brent Stafford, Here’s Asia-Pacific director.   At Uluru, a roughly 2,800-kilometer drive northwest of Sydney in the central Australian desert, Google relied on amateur human cartographers, though in other remote locations, camera packs were donned by animals. An elephant helped to map in Thailand, and a camel wore a camera pack in the United Arab Emirates.   “This is not a case of driving up there in a four-wheel drive and just going off road,” said Casey Whitelaw, engineering director for Google Maps in Sydney.   Google was approached by tourism officials from Australia’s Northern Territory, where Uluru is located, to map the site. It also worked with Parks Australia, which operates the country’s national parks, and the Aboriginal community near Uluru. It is a spiritual site for Aboriginal Australians and tourists flock to the red rock to see it change colors at sunrise and sunset.   “I hope it’s not going to mean that people will look at it at home and think, ‘Oh, OK, well I don’t need to go to Uluru now,’” said Sammy Wilson, a local Aboriginal leader who also chairs the board for Uluru’s national park, speaking through an interpreter in the Pitjantjatjara language. “I hope that it will make them think about what more there is to learn and understand and appreciate from visiting here.”   Google was given a map that showed which areas of Uluru were too sensitive to photograph. Mr. Wilson offered a metaphor to explain why visitors are discouraged from taking pictures of some areas. He said Uluru as a whole is like a living room, a place to receive visitors. But particularly sacred areas around the rock are like a bedroom, a private area where visitors shouldn’t go.   By adding more remote sites to its maps, analysts say Google—which has a reputation for “moonshot” projects and public-minded goals like organizing the world’s information—is ensuring its consumers will continue to use its app, which offers opportunities to attract users to other company products.   Imaging places like a volcano “sounds like a very Google-y thing to do, even if that by itself is not something that can be commercialized,” said Colin Sebastian, a research analyst at Baird in San Francisco.

The company hasn’t said anything about extending its maps to remote locations.   While Here Technologies isn’t focusing on cultural sites like Uluru in the same way as Google is, it has a fleet of camera-equipped cars mapping roads in remote regions of the Philippines.   “Cars have been stuck in mud, cars have not been too successful in crossing creeks and rivers, and cars have been stuck in sand,” said Brent Stafford, Here’s Asia-Pacific director.   At Uluru, a roughly 2,800-kilometer drive northwest of Sydney in the central Australian desert, Google relied on amateur human cartographers, though in other remote locations, camera packs were donned by animals. An elephant helped to map in Thailand, and a camel wore a camera pack in the United Arab Emirates.   “This is not a case of driving up there in a four-wheel drive and just going off road,” said Casey Whitelaw, engineering director for Google Maps in Sydney.   Google was approached by tourism officials from Australia’s Northern Territory, where Uluru is located, to map the site. It also worked with Parks Australia, which operates the country’s national parks, and the Aboriginal community near Uluru. It is a spiritual site for Aboriginal Australians and tourists flock to the red rock to see it change colors at sunrise and sunset.   “I hope it’s not going to mean that people will look at it at home and think, ‘Oh, OK, well I don’t need to go to Uluru now,’” said Sammy Wilson, a local Aboriginal leader who also chairs the board for Uluru’s national park, speaking through an interpreter in the Pitjantjatjara language. “I hope that it will make them think about what more there is to learn and understand and appreciate from visiting here.”   Google was given a map that showed which areas of Uluru were too sensitive to photograph. Mr. Wilson offered a metaphor to explain why visitors are discouraged from taking pictures of some areas. He said Uluru as a whole is like a living room, a place to receive visitors. But particularly sacred areas around the rock are like a bedroom, a private area where visitors shouldn’t go.   By adding more remote sites to its maps, analysts say Google—which has a reputation for “moonshot” projects and public-minded goals like organizing the world’s information—is ensuring its consumers will continue to use its app, which offers opportunities to attract users to other company products.   Imaging places like a volcano “sounds like a very Google-y thing to do, even if that by itself is not something that can be commercialized,” said Colin Sebastian, a research analyst at Baird in San Francisco.

One hitch: they had to avoid photographing certain parts of the red rock formation that are especially sacred to the local Aboriginal people.   Having taken shots of many of the world’s streets using cameras on vehicles, Google is moving to more difficult locations. On the South Pacific island of Vanuatu, where it captured images of a volcano, the company sought to photograph lava without any of its cameras falling in. And in Cambodia, monkeys destroyed its equipment.   The images are being used to enhance Street View, a component of the company’s popular Google Maps app, as the company searches for new features that will entice users. Starting today, users will be able to take a continuous, virtual walk around much of Uluru.   Maps are becoming more important to the world’s largest technology companies as they chase billions of dollars in potential advertising revenue and invest in something that is crucial to the autonomous-vehicle industry. The value of ads that are based on a user’s location will grow to $32 billion by 2021 from $12 billion in 2016 in the U.S., according to estimates from BIA/Kelsey, a media and advertising consulting firm. These location-targeted ads will take up 45 per cent of the mobile-ad market by 2021, the firm said, up from 38 percent last year.   Google, a part of Alphabet Inc.,  has been cautiously adding advertising to Google Maps. Last year, it unveiled “promoted pins,” where location markers appear in different colors to advertise certain businesses. The challenge for Google is integrating ads without cluttering the app.   Competitors in mapping include Apple Inc. and a host of other players, including privately-held Here Technologies, which is part-owned by German automakers Audi AG , BMW AG and Daimler AG. In the market for general consumers, Google has a clear lead. Google Maps was the fourth most popular mobile app overall in the U.S., while Apple Maps was the 12th most popular, according to a 2016 report from comScore.   On Monday, Apple said it would add floor plans for airports and malls in cities like Hong Kong, London and Chicago to its Maps app. It also is updating the app to show speed limits and lane navigation for drivers.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Home vs Amazon Echo vs Apple HomePod: features comparison Features Newsby Robert Triggs12 hours ago 2 202 15 The battle for the smart home has been warring on for some time already, but Apple has just entered the fray with the introduction of its new HomePod. The HomePod was unveiled during the company’s WWDC 2017 keynote, and the smart home speaker is clearly designed to take on the likes of Google Home and the market leading Amazon Echo. So here’s how the devices stack up against one another. For starters, there’s a big difference in the price between these three products. We’re all used to Apple charging a premium for its products, but at $349 the HomePod is almost twice the price of Amazon’s $179.99 Echo and considerably more expensive than the $129 Google Home. One of the key differentiators, from Apple’s perspective, is that the HomePod offers up a superior looking speaker setup to its competitors, while still aiming to offer many of the same smart features as its rivals.   Amazon Echo Apple HomePod Google Home Assistant Alexa Siri Google Assistant Music support Amazon Music, Prime Music, Amazon Music Unlimited, Spotify Premium, Pandora, TuneIn, iHeartRadio, Audible Apple Music Google Play Music, Spotify Premium, YouTube Music, Pandora, iHeartRadio, TuneIn Multi-room Not currently Yes with AirPlay 2 Yes with Chromecast Audio Smart Home & third-party support Yes HomeKit only Yes Microphones 7 far-field 6 far-field + 1 low-frequency calibration microphone 2 far-field Speakers 2.0-inch tweeter + 2.5-inch woofer 7x tweeter + woofer 2-inch driver + 2x 2-inch passive radiators Connectivity Bluetooth & Wi-Fi Wi-Fi (Bluetooth currently unknown) Bluetooth & Wi-Fi Dimensions and weight 235 x 84 mm 2.34lbs 172 x 142 mm 5.5lbs 142.8 x 96.4 mm 1.05lbs Price $180 $349 $129 The HomePod comes with seven tweeter speakers and a dedicated woofer setup, each with a “custom amplifier” configuration. This is clearly a more substantial and expensive setup than the single tweeter and woofer combination offered by the Echo and the single speaker, dual passive radiator configuration touted by the Google Home. This makes the HomePod considerably bulkier than its competitors too, coming in at 5.5 lbs and 172 x 142 mm. The Google Home weighs 1.05 lbs and has 142.8 x 96.4 mm dimensions, and the slim Echo is 2.34 lbs and 235 x 84 mm. Apple's HomePod is being marketed primarily as a high-end home speaker with extra smart assistant capabilities. This is much different compared to the angle taken by Amazon and Google. Apple also made mention of transparent dynamic processing and audio beamforming capabilities to improve its audio input. The six far-field microphones and additional low frequency microphone stack up nicely against the Echo’s seven far-field mic setup, while Google’s technology only required two far-field microphones. None of them should have any problems picking up commands though, even in a bustling living room. Of course, we’ll have to wait and see exactly how much better the sound is, if at all, and if it’s worth the price tag. Apple’s premium audio offering may be a tough sell in this market which has proven itself to be quite price sensitive too. There’s always the option to connect a $50 Amazon Echo Dot up to a more premium Hi-Fi setup. Furthermore, we may see partner speakers from more renowned audio brands that support Alexa and Google Assistant appear in the not too distant future as well. See also: Google Home review – the future of the home? November 18, 2016 On the software and features side, in true Apple form, the HomePod system and third-party support is completely locked down, therefore offering a lot less choice than the established models. This may well change with time, but at launch the Amazon Echo and Google Home offer substantially more choice for both music streaming services and compatible smart home products. See also: The complete list of services with Google Home support 3 weeks ago Despite the audio focus, the HomePod doesn't support any third party streaming services at the moment. You'll have to make do with Apple Music. The HomePod only currently supports Apple Music, which will be a disappointment to fans of other popular services, such as Spotify or Pandora which are supported on Amazon and Google’s platforms. It’s a similar situation if you’re looking to stream to using a multi-room setup. The HomePod supports the more limited new AirPlay 2 Wi-Fi standard, which again doesn’t support these third-party services, while Chromecast Audio does. However, Apple’s Craig Federighi has suggested that third-party apps may be supported by AirPlay 2 at some point. This all ties into Apple’s proprietary play for the smart home market through its HomeKit product range. If you’re looking to integrate the HomePod with some other smart home products, then you’re limited to manufacturers that comply with Apple’s HomeKit standard. Amazon’s Echo range has taken a much more open approach here, opening up support for almost anything third party manufacturer through its Alexa Skills voice-driven platform. Of course, then there are the capabilities of the smart assistants to consider. We won’t go too deep here, but Google’s Assistant has proven highly capable when it comes to understanding more complex requests, contextual awareness, and the ability to ask follow-up questions. Alexa not so much on the contextual side but it does support a huge range of commands, while Siri sits somewhere in between not quite matching the intelligence of Google nor Alexa’s huge third-party catalogue. Echo and Home are clearly being publicized as connected smart speakers, with the assistants taking a key role when marketing the products. Apple is focusing more on the high-end home speaker angle, with Siri’s capabilities taking a little more of a backseat. Furthermore, it look like the HomePod is aimed more at those who are already sold on Apple’s ecosystem rather than those who use third-party services. This might not be a bad place to start in order to grab a share of the smart home market, but it might prevent the HomePod from being a breakthrough product. If you’re tempted by Apple’s proposition then you’ll be in for a wait. The HomePod isn’t going to land in consumer hands until December, and a lot could change by then, as could the competition.

Music Apple Wants To Reinvent Home Audio, Whilst Giving You More Control Over Your Home By Arron Hirst 12 hours ago Share Tweet After reinventing the music industry with the introduction of the iPod and iTunes, the computer industry with the introduction of the Mac – and redefining what would forever be expected from the wearable category with Apple Watch, Apple on Monday previewed its vision for the future of home audio … Set to see its launch officially late this year the firm’s completely reimagined home speaker solution, previewed for the first time – this week, will aim to rival not only other wireless speakers such as SONOS and Bose, but, perhaps more notably, other intelligent speakers. “HomePod combines Apple-engineered audio technology and advanced software to deliver the highest-fidelity sound throughout the room, no matter where it’s placed. This elegantly designed, compact speaker totally rocks the house,” the company explains. As for the technicals behind that sound: […] seven beamforming tweeters that precisely focus the sound, from very narrow beams all the way to true, consistent 360º audio. Measuring 6.8 in. (172 mm) in height by 5.6 in. (142 mm) across, and powered by the company’s own A8 chip, HomePod will specifically feature; a high-excursion woofer with custom amplifier, an array of seven horn-loaded tweeters each with their own custom amplifier, six-microphone array for far-field voice control and room sensing, internal low-frequency calibration microphone for automatic bass correction, and direct/ambient audio beamforming alongside being able to process audio at a transparent, studio-level dynamic. In addition to reportedly sounding great – thanks to its directional speakers that were shown during Schiller’s talk as being able to throw each underlying part of a track around the room, separately, HomePod will also arrive with a few other tricks up its sleeve … Arguably the most important of those is tight integration with Siri. Finally unlocking the doors for music fans everywhere to wirelessly control what they choose to listen to through the company’s accompanying streaming service – Apple Music, (a feature notably missing from most of the major official home audio solutions already out there), HomePod will -in addition- also allow for control of HomeKit-enabled appliances and accessories that already exist in your home… Siri has all kinds of answers. Because it has Siri, HomePod can hear and answer questions in the most popular categories. Timers. Clocks. Measurements. Translations. News. Sports. Weather. Traffic. And general knowledge. It’s great at the things you want to know, and do, in your home. How to command a room. Just say “Hey Siri, turn on the lights” or “cool the room” or “lower the shades.” A wide range of accessories work with Apple’s HomeKit platform — from air conditioners to garage doors to security cameras. Just add an accessory to the Home app, then control it with your voice on HomePod. Just as with Apple Music on the iPhone, iPad and Mac – the firm reiterates that using Siri on HomePod to indicate whether you like or dislike what is currently playing, will ultimately also influence HomePod’s understanding of your music tastes. “[…] Which means you can also just let it pick the songs. And when you open Apple Music on any other device, your playlists and preferences are right where you left them. Wherever you go, the beat goes on,” Apple says. Perhaps one of the lesser-talked about features of HomePod so far, though, is its ability to respond to your touch … “Tap the top of HomePod to play, pause, or adjust the volume,” the company explains on the product’s official mini-site, as it adds that the top of the speaker “also shows you when Siri is listening,” with ”an LED waveform that animates with your every word.” Availability HomePod will see its debut this December. The speaker will be available in two colour variants (black or white) and will retail for $349. Continue Reading You may also like...

Head below for a tour of the new features coming this fall… The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac Among the new features, Apple is making improvements to text detection and photo descriptions for VoiceOver users, it’s enhancing the large text experience system wide, introducing a new “Smart Invert Colors” mode, and has a brand new onscreen Accessibility keyboard for Mac users. Apple is also making sure Accessibility users will be able to benefit from new Type to Siri and Drag and Drop features arriving in iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra. Below we take a look at all these features and more coming to Apple’s new operating systems. Accessibility Keyboard for mac A new Accessibility Keyboard for macOS High Sierra brings an onscreen keyboard that has been designed specifically with accessibility users in mind. The new keyboard can be accessed from the Accessibility pane in System Preferences (as pictured above). It includes a system to add fully customizable keys with scripting actions so users can have a single button perform tasks such as opening apps, entering text, pressing keys, or initiating things like system events, typing suggestions, Dwell and AppleScripts. Smart Invert Colors Apple’s old invert colors option for accessibility will still be available going forward, but it’s now called “classic” as it introduces a new “Smart Invert Colors” mode. The new option doesn’t invert colors of content like graphics and images so you can continue to see content in its original form with all the same benefits of inverted colors for the rest of the UI. For example, the wallpaper and app icons on the Home screen don’t get inverted, and in the Photos app you’ll get the original photo content with the rest of the UI inverted. For apps like clock that already have a dark UI, Smart Invert Colors will know not to change anything. It’s also maybe the closest thing we’ve had to a dark mode for iOS. Text Detection One update for accessibility coming to both iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra is improvement to text detection in images for users with vision impairments. To accomplish this, Apple’s newest software will automatically do some basic text detection on images, allowing it to detect the text and speak it aloud to the user with a voiceover. Improved Photo Descriptions Improved photo descriptions will similarly do basic analysis to find out what’s in an image and describe it aloud to the user. Apple explained that the software looks for various key characteristics in the images such as the number of faces, expressions, overall scene, blurriness and brightness level. For the image pictured above, VoiceOver’s audible description would be, “1 face, 1 smiling, nightclub, blurry, bright.” Large Text Enhancements Apple showed off some new system wide enhancements arriving with iOS 11 for users that have the largest text options selected. There will also be new APIs that allow developers to adopt the improved larger text experience in their own apps with Dynamic Type. Type to Siri Type to Siri isn’t specifically billed as an Accessibility feature for iOS 11 and macOS Sierra, but during its WWDC sessions with developers Apple made a point of noting that the ability to interact with Siri using text input will make it available to many more users that have issues with voice control. Drag and Drop support Drag and drop is a highlight feature of iOS 11, especially for iPad users, and users of Accessibility features will also be able to benefit. Apple is introducing a new API to enable drag and drop with VoiceOver support, which means visually impaired users will be able to take advantage of drag and drop features when developers implement it.

Well, hold the front page, because Apple is reportedly planning to introduce at least one more small, but significant feature with this autumn’s update. One developer exploring the first tvOS beta has discovered AirPods can now be automatically paired with the Apple TV as part of the speaker options (via 9to5Mac). For iCloud accounts showing AirPods connected to an iPhone, users will be able to automatically listen to music and audio from video content without having to use the TV speakers or a connected speaker system. While Bluetooth headphones are already an option, in tvOS the automatic set-up feature means they won’t have to be paired for Apple TV. Related: WWDC 2017 highlights Users currently seeking to pair their Bluetooth headphones with Apple TV had to pair manually as they would with a non-Apple device. Seeing as automatic pairing is a big selling point for AirPods on iOS, macOS and watchOS, it’s good to see Apple complete the circle. Elsewhere on Apple TV, there’ll also be a new Home Screen Sync feature that will come in handy for those with multiple Apple TVs. Apple says it will “keep your apps and Home screens up to date across any Apple TV that uses this iCloud account.” Another feature, dubbed automatic appearance switching, will enable users to switch between dark and light modes depending on the time of day. tvOS will be released this autumn, probably alongside macOS High Sierra, watchOS 4 and iOS 11. Will this feature allow you to get more out of your AirPods? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.

Here's what's new and prices of models.More Apple launched its new range of Macs at the World Wide Developer Conference 2017 Monday. While the company hasn’t totally revamped the 2016 MacBook, it has introduced some pretty significant changes in the 2017 models. Read: WWDC News: MacBooks and iMacs Refreshed, macOS High Sierra Introduced Here is how the two MacBook models match up: Design: In terms of design, the MacBook Pro 2017 might seem pretty similar to its predecessor. It is the third time that Apple has used an ultra-slim chassis for the MacBook, which it had introduced back in 2015. The 2017 MacBook has the dimensions as its predecessor — it weighs around 920 grams and measures 0.52 inches in thickness. Apple also addressed complaints about the keyboard’s functioning on the 2016 MacBook Pro being under-responsive. The company has added some new butterfly switches such as the new Esc key. Display: While the 2017 MacBook Pro has the same 13-inch retina display as the 2016 MacBook Pro, but is supported by better graphics hardware. It will use an Intel Iris Graphics 640/Graphics 650 processor replacing the Intel Iris Graphics 540/ Graphics 550 processor in the 2016 MacBook Pro. The 15-inch model will also get an upgrade from an Intel HD Graphics 530 processor to Intel HD Graphics 630 processor. The discrete graphics will also be updated; the 2017 MacBook will have a 2GB Radeon Pro 555 or a 4GB Radeon Pro 560 replacing the 2GB Radeon Pro 450/455 or 4GB Radeon Pro 460 on its predecessor. Memory: Apple stated at WWDC2017 that the solid state drives (SSDs) on the 2017 MacBook Pro would be 50 percent faster than SSDs in previous models. Processor:  This might be the biggest change — the 13-inch MacBook 2017 comes with Intel’s 7th generation Kaby Lake 26GHz quad-core Intel i7 processor replacing the 29GHz Intel i5 dual-core processor on the 2016 model. The 15-inch MacBook Pro now has a 2.9 GHz seventh-generation i7 processor replacing the sixth-generation 2.7 GHz Core i7 processor on its predecessor. According to GeekBench 4 benchmarks, the new 15-inch MacBook Pro scored single-core and multi-core scores of 4,632 and 15,747 in single and multi-core tests, which is way more than the 2016 MacBook Pro’s scores of 4,098 and 13,155. This means that the 2017 MacBook Pro is 13 percent faster than the 2016 MacBook Pro in single core tests and 19.7 percent faster in multi-core tests. Touch Bar: Strangely enough, unlike the 2016 MacBook Pro, the MacBook Pro currently available in the stores does not have a touch bar. A model with the Touch Bar is expected to be available later.  Ports: The company has retained the single USB-C port from the 2016 MacBook Pro. Read: MacBook Pro Touch Bar Problems: Apple Users Complain Of 'Popping' Sound Coming From Laptop In addition to this, you can now configure the MacBook to add 16GB of RAM. Furthermore, it can now support a 4K desk monitor. While it is not known yet, the battery life on the new MacBook models is expected to be better than the 2016 models.

But there's more work to be done. By Jason Cipriani | June 8, 2017 -- 17:50 GMT (10:50 PDT) | Topic: Apple Apple on Monday announced significant changes are coming to the iPad's operating system this fall with the release of iOS 11. The changes demoed on stage made it clear Apple is working hard at changing user behavior - and perhaps more importantly, perception - of the iPad lineup. Instead of viewing and using the device for watching movies or passively checking email, Apple wants users to treat it as a computer. Or as ZDNet's Ross Rubin puts it, with iOS 11 Apple's iPad has a grown up. As someone who used to work primarily on an iPad Pro, and eventually grew too frustrated with the lack of meaningful updates to improve the computing experience, I am very intrigued and hopeful about the changes in iOS 11. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet The new app switcher, for example, makes it easy to visualize what you are working on and quickly find apps. Drag and drop eliminate unnecessary steps to share text or photos between documents and apps. The Files app will eliminate the need to bounce between apps to find a document. These are all things I've wanted on the iPad Pro from day one. MULTIPLE USER SUPPORT However, there's one feature I'm disappointed not to see in iOS 11: Multiple user support. Sharing a computer is commonplace among families, and why should the iPad line be any different? From a feature and perception standpoint, the iPad would certainly benefit from it. Proper multiple-user support on an iPad is no doubt a tricky feature to figure out. Allocating storage, managing user accounts and app installs all have to be taken into account. Yet, Apple solved those engineering challenges with Shared iPad for classrooms in January of 2016. As each student logs into his or her assigned iPad, the device will download apps, homework, and assignments. In other words, the device looks and works just as the student left it. It's unfortunate Apple hasn't yet decided to bring the same feature to the iPad for the average user, outside of a classroom. Perhaps the combination of releasing a $329 iPad to spur purchases amid a consistent decline of tablet sales is enough motivation to not release a feature that will surely cut back on the number of tablets sold. It's difficult to say why Apple continues to keep an important computer-like feature from the iPad lineup, but maybe, hopefully, one day soon, the iPad will gain one of the last features on my personal checklist for it to truly replace a laptop.

WSJ: How Siri went from virtual assistant market leader to laggard Internal cultural issues and employee departures have impacted Siri's evolution. Greg Sterling on June 8, 2017 at 2:04 pm More Siri has gone from being a competitive differentiator for Apple to nearly its opposite, a product seen by many as falling behind its rivals. Regardless of the empirical truth, it’s the widely-held view among tech industry insiders who help shape popular opinion. An article in the The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) provides an extensive look at how Siri went from market leader to its position as perceived laggard. The article suggests internal cultural issues and employee departures have slowed improvement of the virtual assistant: In the years since [Siri was acquired], former Siri team members say, progress has been slowed by a failure to set ambitious goals, shifting strategies and a culture that prioritizes user privacy — making it difficult to personalize and improve the product. The project also has suffered from the departures of key team members, some of whom went to competitors. Apple bought Siri in 2010. It was initially a ground-breaking addition to the iPhone. Recognizing the strategic importance of virtual assistants to the future of (conversational) search, Google enhanced its voice search capabilities and developed comparable functionality for Android devices. Just this past month it brought a specialized Google Assistant app to the iPhone to compete directly with Siri on Apple’s flagship device. Beyond this, the WSJ reports that Apple was “caught off guard” by the Amazon Echo (as was Google). It also says that Apple “spent years developing” the just-introduced smart speaker, the HomePod. That account contradicts the popular view that Apple developed the HomePod in response to the Echo. Recent studies have generally found Google’s Assistant to be the top performer vs. its rivals. However, Siri has done well in some studies, and so have Amazon’s Alexa and Cortana. The WSJ piece suggests that Apple’s narrow focus on the iPhone, a lack of vision and some level of  complacency have cost the company “its innovation edge,” which it enjoyed early on with Siri. However, a Loup Ventures study released in April had more positive assessment of Siri’s competitiveness: Siri performed well across the board, and ultimately came in second place in our assessment. Siri’s ability to interpret user commands accurately sets it apart from the others. Command is an important category for Apple, as it continues to make a push into homes with its HomeKit. By continuing to outperform Google Assistant, Siri offers the best connection between a user’s mobile life and home life, which Amazon will struggle to do without an integrated smartphone platform. As I wrote in January, Apple helped mainstream virtual assistants. Seven years ago, it was a novelty feature. Now, with consumers using voice to interact with devices more frequently, “nice to have” has become “must have.” Accordingly, a weaker Siri and a stronger Google Assistant (or Amazon Alexa) will ultimately impact iPhone sales and Apple’s larger ecosystem strategy. The company has got to see and invest much more in Siri as a core utility if it wants to remain competitive.

Video by Jefferson Graham SAN JOSE — It's not every day that Apple invites an app maker to its big developer conference for free, lets him hang around with CEO Tim Cook and schmooze with former First Lady Michelle Obama. But that indeed happened to Yuma Soerianto from Melbourne, Australia, who has achieved mini rock-star status this week at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. After all, he's ten years old and already has five apps in the App Store, with more on the way. "I only learned coding (the skill to make apps) from online," he says. "I never had the chance to talk to someone who could teach me coding, so it's a privilege to be here and learn from someone I can talk to." 10-year-old app developer Yuma Soerianto at the Apple WWDC conference  (Photo: Jefferson Graham) While he is clearly the youngest app developer at WWDC this week, Apple also touted the oldest in the Monday keynote. Japan's 82-year-old Masako Wakamiya  created the gaming app hinadan after retiring from a bank.

Cook himself called out Soerianto from the stage of WWDC, "I can't wait to see what he's going to accomplish next," said Cook. Yuma Soerianto, a 10-year-old app developer from Melborune, Australia, at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference  (Photo: Jefferson Graham) This is the second year in a row that Apple has invited an ultra young student (most are in their teens and college age) for WWDC. Last year's recipient was also from Australia, Anvitha Vijay. Apple invited Soerianto after he applied for the scholarship, showed his "Anyone Can Code," channel on YouTube, and his five apps. The apps are credited to dad Hendri , himself a designer and app developer, due to Apple's rules requiring developers to be of legal age. They were created on the family MacBook Air using Apple's Xcode software, using gaming and cartoon layouts. The apps range fromWeather Duck, where a talking duck gives you the weather report, to Kid Calculator, where Yuma's young voice reads out the numbers as they are generated. When not coding, attending school or doing homework, he studies martial arts. Related: Apple’s gift to schools: Free app development curriculum 6 people who've nabbed the nation's top jobs share a common trait He started coding at age 6, Yuma says, because his school didn't have "enough challenges to satisfy me." He was interested in tech, "how things worked, how apps worked, so I started coding games." Dad Hendri says Yuma does most of the work on the apps himself. "He codes the apps and decides on the layouts and functionalities," he says. "I give him some of the images to be used in the apps. I want him to focus on the fun programming part, and not be discouraged by doing too many tasks!" For coding help, Yuma looks for online assistance on Google "whenever he is stuck," his dad says. Yuma Soerianto amongst other app developers at Apple's WWDC conference  (Photo: Jefferson Graham) Yuma may sound like an adult, but he knows a good prank when he sees one. He says he gets asked this question in every interview: "What do you want to be when you grow up." His jokey response?  To USA TODAY, it's "Become a train." To the Sydney Morning Herald, it's "I want to be Batman." But seriously, his goal is to make apps that "can revolutionize the world. I want to fix problems." His message to other kids--get coding now. "If you don't start coding, you might lag behind."

Today, however, we’re learning once again that it may not only be hackers that we need to worry about, but rather the people who are tasked with maintaining the services our phones use and fixing our devices. Police in China have arrested 22 people suspected of illegally obtaining and selling data from Apple users. The difference here? Most of the people arrested are said to be Apple employees. That’s according to the Hong Kong Free Press, which reports on a statement obtained from police in China’s southern Zhejiang province. Police say that 20 of the 22 people arrested were Apple employees who obtained customer data from Apple’s internal systems. The data that was breached in this case includes names, phone numbers, Apple IDs, and “other data,” though though the fate of more sensitive information like passwords wasn’t listed. While that may mean that these users are safe from from other people accessing data stored in iCloud, it’s still concerning to hear that these employees are accused of then selling that information. Police say that in all, these employees made more than 50 million yuan ($7.36 million) by selling this information, charging anywhere between 10 yuan ($1.50) and 180 yuan ($26.50) per transaction. We’re not sure at this point just whose information was involved – whether it was just limited to Apple users in China or if it also involved theft from foreign users is up in the air. However, police did say that they were able to seize these employees’ “criminal tools,” though it’s unclear what those tools are. As the Hong Kong Free Press points out, selling personal information that belongs to consumers is fairly common in China, but it’s still worrying that those who have access to such information would turn around and sell it on the black market. Even more concerning is that when it’s Apple employees (or even employees who work with a third-party company that has access), there doesn’t seem to be a whole lot you can do to prevent it. We’ll see if anything more comes of this story, so stay tuned.

We’re slowly getting an idea of what to expect. 9to5Mac reports that AirPods will automatically pair with a user’s Apple TV. Previously, the earbuds only automatically paired with iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches that were associated with the same iCloud account. So maybe with tvOS 11 you’ll be able to watch TV without needing a whole speaker setup or even dealing with manually pairing. How many people want to watch TV with their AirPods? I’m not sure, but Roku did add a headphone jack to its remote. Maybe that’s a sign. tvOS also includes a new Home Screen Sync feature, which will keep your apps consistent across Apple TVs, and automated switching between dark and light mode. We also know it’ll support Amazon Prime Video.

Apple TV has not been included in the devices that automatically pair, however, but that’s changing with tvOS 11. Sony A6500 Starting with the first tvOS 11 developer beta, AirPods appear as a new speaker option automatically on Apple TVs with iCloud accounts connected to iPhones with AirPods paired. This means you can play music or easily listen to video from Apple TV through AirPods without using the TV speakers. AirPods with Apple TV work just like other connected Bluetooth speakers or headphones, but the automatic setup feature means you don’t have to manually pair AirPods to tvOS 11. Prior to tvOS 11, connecting AirPods to Apple TV required the method used to pair the wireless earphones to non-Apple products like Android devices: hold a button on the AirPods case, look for AirPods as Bluetooth speakers in the Settings app on Apple TV, and manually pair. tvOS 11 is still limited to one iCloud account at a time, however, so shared Apple TVs will still need to manually pair. For me personally, I never bothered to pair AirPods to the Apple TVs in my home, but I can see myself using AirPods with Apple TV now thanks to the convenient setup feature. Other tvOS 11 changes include a new Home Screen Sync feature for keeping app installs and arrangements the same across iCloud-connected Apple TVs and a new automatic switching feature between dark and light mode. tvOS 11 is currently only available as a developer beta, although the first tvOS public beta will start later this month.

New, 43 comments Apple’s peer-to-peer network already exists, and it’s called iMessage by Lauren Goode@LaurenGoode Jun 8, 2017, 1:07pm EDT share tweet Linkedin Jake Kastrenakes/The Verge Earlier this week Apple announced it will soon be rolling out peer-to-peer payments, effectively (bad pun alert) swiping at services from Square, PayPal-owned Venmo, and giant banks that already let you pay friends through mobile apps. Apple is well-known for biding its time while it watches other companies enter a market, then coming in later with a product or service it thinks will somehow be better. The peer-to-peer payments service is no exception; the question is whether Apple’s will actually be better than the others. The short answer is we really don’t know yet. I only saw glimpses of “Apple Pay Cash” at WWDC this week, and wasn’t able to pay a friend through iMessage myself. But I saw enough to make me think that Apple has a very distinct advantage with iMessage, even though it’s limited to iOS devices. At the same time, Apple still has some important feature and naming decisions to make before it officially rolls this out in the fall. Apple’s peer-to-peer payments are a part of Apple Pay, but they’ll happen in iMessage Apple’s peer-to-peer payments are technically a functionality of Apple Pay, but they’ll happen in iMessage. As with Square Cash, the balances you carry from your peer-to-peer exchanges will live on a “virtual card,” called Apple Pay Cash. That virtual card doesn’t live in iMessage. Instead, it appears to exist within Wallet, Apple’s other app for keeping track of credit and debit cards, loyalty cards, and boarding passes. So: the payments exchange is a function of Apple Pay, you’ll exchange the money in iMessage, and the virtual balance will live on the Apple Pay Cash virtual card in Wallet. I can’t help but think this should be less confusing. Maybe Apple should create its own payments and money-tracking app that offers passcode-protected access to your billing information, cards, iTunes purchase information, monthly cloud storage costs, the peer-to-peer option, and a log of your Pay Cash exchanges. Kind of like ... a bank app. Or maybe not; maybe creating a separate app for services that already work invisibly is a step backwards, and iOS users will be just fine paying in iMessage. But if Apple has a grander vision beyond the virtual balance customers will soon be keeping on their phones — which I think it does — then a bank-like app is one place to start. Another element of Apple’s new payments option that’s missing right now is the ability to just keep a memo of what you paid people for. Venmo’s open social network for payments is well-known; many users like Venmo for this reason. Square Cash’s ledger is private, but you still have the ability to later go back and see that I paid “$10 for pizza” or “$25 for pet sitting.” Currently there doesn’t appear to be anything in Apple Pay Cash that lets you do this, aside from the iMessage exchange that you’ll eventually forget, like “Hey can you pay me $10 for that pizza?” I suspect this is for privacy reasons — Apple has stressed privacy more than almost any other tech company — but I still think there needs to be some sort of option for this. The most obvious advantage for Apple in all of this, though, is iMessage, at least in the US. While there’s a very valid argument to be made that Venmo, Square Cash, and big bank apps will still be more useful because they work on both iOS and Android, Apple doesn’t have to worry about establishing a network for peer-to-peer payments. The network for payments already exists among iOS users: iMessage. It will be right there in the native messaging app, and the people you’re chatting with are probably the same people you’ll want to pay. iPhone users could find themselves becoming “P2P” people without even downloading a new app You could make the same argument for Facebook and its Messenger install base. You can also argue that Square has a little Square Cash app for iMessage already. But Apple Pay Cash also has the Apple brand behind it, which people give their payment information to the moment they sign up for an iTunes account or set up Apple Pay. If Apple’s on-stage promise of ridiculously easy peer-to-peer payments pans out in real life, than a lot of iPhone users may find themselves becoming “P2P” people without even having to download a separate app. Some of the initial reactions to Apple’s suggested payments feature, one that will subtly suggest you pay up if your friend happens to iMessage you a dollar amount, was that this will be awkward or rude. But to me it does seem smart, because it’s utilizing the intelligence on the phone in a way that I haven’t seen any other payment apps do yet. Think word suggestions in your messages, but instead of prompting you to type words, it’s reminding you to pay friends back. A lot of people are already familiar with mobile peer-to-peer payments, but there’s also still a lot of room for growth. According to Javelin Strategy and Research, the number of US mobile peer-to-peer users will grow from 69 million in 2015 to 126 million by 2020; by 2021, one in two consumers are expected be using P2P apps. And that’s just in the US. What’s more interesting about most current peer-to-peer payments services is that they actually don’t make money for the companies that offer them. So the value of them, at least for now, is luring people in to use other services from the same company. We won’t know exactly how convenient payments in iMessage and the Apple Pay Cash card are until it launches in the fall, and we’ll have to compare to it existing apps then. But it will have to offer a level of simplicity that other services don’t — whether in iMessage or in other areas of the payments service.

This underground network consisted of dozens of employees of direct Apple suppliers and other firms Apple outsources work to, and the group gathered users’ names, phone numbers, Apple IDs, and other data and then sold it piecemeal for between 10 ($1.47) and 80 yuan ($11.78) per data point, for a total of 50 million yuan ($7.36 million). It’s unclear if the data gathered was only on Chinese Apple users, or if it included users elsewhere too. Chinese scammers sold $7.36 million worth of iPhone data It took Chinese authorities, working out of the southern Zhejiang province, months to build the case before arrests were carried out this past weekend across Zhejiang, as well the Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Fujian provinces. The suspects in question worked in for companies with access to company databases and other tools containing sensitive customer information. The sale of data in China is nothing new. The country is rife with marketplaces for illegally obtained information, either gleaned from corporate or government databases. However, due to the perception that owners Apple products are more affluent than those with lower-budget smartphones, hackers and other data theft specialists may specifically target iPhone users in an attempt to extort them or gain access to more sensitive data stored in the cloud. Correction: An earlier version of this article mistakenly identified the suspects as official Apple employees in China. That is incorrect. The employees in question belong to Apple suppliers and companies Apple outsources work to.

In 2015 we reported that Apple hit number five on the list and noted that Apple had climbed from #56 to #5 in five short years. In the latest Fortune 500 list Apple comes in at #3 for the second year in a row. When watching the video below, be sure to go full screen to get away from this tiny spec of a video canvas.      Fortune: "After more than a decade of solid growth fueled first by the iPod music player and then by the even more popular iPhone, Apple finally appeared to hit a wall, with lackluster sales—relatively speaking—for other products such as the iPad and Apple Watch and a heavy reliance on upgraded phone models. But the most profitable publicly-traded company in the world is investing heavily in software and its efforts in new areas of opportunity, including automobiles, remain in development (and under wraps). Apple was founded in 1977 and is headquartered in Cupertino, Calif."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Apple (finally) starts its home invasion Alvin R. Cabral Filed on June 8, 2017 | Last updated on June 8, 2017 at 09.13 pm Share More > Vote Is the new HomePod wireless speaker from the Cupertino-headquartered tech monolith what fans have been waiting for? Here's a ringside view from Apple country When Tim Cook finally arrived at the last of the six 'important' announcements Apple was due to make at the Worldwide Developers Conference, a collective sigh of relief resounded at the venue. Of course, despite the fact that the previous five had already covered everything in the Apple spectrum, no one was expecting anything on the iPhone. Instead, it was all but a foregone conclusion that what the CEO was about to announce was the equivalent of putting Amazon's Alexa and Google Home on notice. "We have such great portable music, but what about our home?" Cook said. "Just like what we did to portable music, we want to reinvent home music." Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, actually did the honours of unveiling the HomePod - but not before taking a swipe at the competition, saying that none of them "have quite nailed it yet". Which begs the question: what does it take to actually nail it? For starters, the HomePod - just like the rivals it's aiming for - has one sole purpose: to make life easier while you're comfy at home (probably transforming you more into a couch potato, for those who already are). There are three things that Apple touts with the HomePod's arrival: Siri, music and smart home control. Siri has received some flak for not being that intelligent, and Apple has a great opportunity to change that with the HomePod, especially when Alexa and Home are receiving some pretty nice reviews. Apple's AI assistant is always listening, but the company has guaranteed that it doesn't collect any data unless you invoke the magic words. Privacy issues aren't really cool, but when you say 'Hey Siri,' something rather cool happens: a colourful small circle lights up on top of the HomePod, reminiscent of the all-too-familiar waveform your iPhone displays when you talk to Siri. At the demo area of the WWDC - where two HomePods in black and white were surrounded by us - members of the media, as if they were Hollywood superstars - I wanted to test its capabilities. Too bad, however, that the only response I got was those lights. And no, there are no LCD or other high-tech displays anywhere on the HomePod's overall mesh finish. And if you decide to burn some calories, walk over to the HomePod and tap that light; you will be able to play, pause and control the volume. This means only one thing: we will have to wait to find out what Siri can do in its new home. In the meantime, what we do know is that Siri can help you control your music and answer for you even some of the 'deepest' questions, such as finding out who's the bassist of a particular track - part of Apple's aim to make Siri a musicologist at your service. What Apple did, however, was give a sneak peek or rather, preview of the HomePod's sound. Some music was played on the sample units at the event, and I have to say, it sounded promising. So imagine that in your house: the HomePod senses where it is in a room - spatial awareness - and automatically adjusts the way it blurts out sound; doesn't matter if it's near a wall or in a corner. A HomePod can also detect if another HomePod is placed at home; they'd balance each other out so it would provide sound that's even smoother (for those who want to relax) or nerve-wracking (for the rockers). Apple wants to 'rock the house' for you. And since Siri comes with it, you'd expect this: you can order it around for anything related to your music, plus other Siri-esque services such as sending messages, what you have on your calendar and how bad the traffic is in a certain area. Among other initial offerings are: news, translations, stocks, unit conversion, reminders and alarms. Apple also wants to control your home. Well, actually, it wants you to control your home. Of course, Siri is the star here, but since it did nothing but cutely flash its lights at the demo, we again have to wait and look forward to what it can actually do. Schiller said you can do what you'd expect of it, from closing your blinds to controlling your air conditioner's temperature, to scheduling when lights should go on or off. Obviously, the HomePod will work with Apple's smart home tool HomeKit, which has amassed a healthy number of manufacturers that make stuff from lights to thermostats, including Honeywell, Yale Assure, Philips Hue, Carrier, D-Link, GE, Haier and iDevices. Other brands are sure to jump onto the Apple bandwagon. The HomePod, though not a new technology, is interesting in two aspects: how it stacks up against Amazon and Alexa, and whether it will it deliver on its vow of 'nailing' it. Cost could be an issue, because it's going to have a US price tag of $349 (Dh1,281) - way above the Alexa-powered Amazon Echo's $180 (Dh661) and Google Home's $129 (Dh474), though Schiller insists it's better-priced than a Wi-Fi speaker-plus-smart-speaker combo, which can go as high as $700 (Dh2,571). The UAE will have to wait for at least seven months, since the HomePod will start shipping in December initially to Australia, the UK and the US. By then, we'll have a clearer idea whether it's worth it to welcome the HomePod to our abodes alvin@khaleejtimes.com Alvin's a part-time optimistic and full-time eccentric.

During a WWDC developer session on Wednesday, Apple announced that it is opening up HomeKit to allow any Apple developer to build and prototype smart home accessories without first needing to apply for and be granted an MFi license. Developers who wish to release a HomeKit product will still need to pursue MFi certification, but the new policy will make it easier for new companies to get started with the process of developing HomeKit-compatible products. Even more significantly, however, Apple is going to begin allowing developers to integrate HomeKit security into their products at the software level, rather than requiring an Apple-designed authentication chip. This software-based authorization will be available to existing products as well, meaning that for the first time many legacy home automation products will be able to join the HomeKit club with merely a firmware update, rather than requiring users to replace hardware components to gain HomeKit compatibility. Apple emphasized that all of the same heavy-duty encryption would still be incorporated into the software design. When Apple first debuted HomeKit back in 2014, it followed Apple’s typically closed approach for accessory development, requiring partners to be members of Apple’s MFi program, as well as mandating that all HomeKit accessories include an Apple hardware chip to provide both authentication and security features. It was likely this policy that resulted in a very slow pace of adoption of HomeKit technology among many accessory makers, with the first HomeKit products not appearing on the market until over a year later, and existing home automation solutions such as Lutron Caséta and Philips Hue requiring the users purchase new hardware components to add HomeKit compatibility. These new changes to Apple’s HomeKit approach should make it easier for developers to release new HomeKit products, while also enabling many more established home automation products to more easily add HomeKit support. Comments Interested to see if developers like Chamberlain will pursue this software solution when they're so close to hardware releases. They announced in January that they would provide a hardware bridge this summer for existing users of their MyQ smart garage door openers to provide HomeKit integration. At an additional $50, this is a further investment into a $200 original purchase...and yet, a much simpler (and much cheaper) solution possibly lies in a firmware update. I wonder how many other products are so far into development that companies can't afford to flush their investment for this type of remedy.

The Apple HomePod should be a hot holiday gift, playing music wirelessly and understanding spoken commands. By Troy Dreier/For the Jersey Journal Apple is jumping into the connected home speaker market, announcing the HomePod this week. The HomePod is a rich, room-filling speaker that accepts voice commands and connects wirelessly to stored music libraries and the Apple Music service. It's more than a speaker, though, as it can tell you the news and weather, or control connected home electronics like lighting or shades. Look for the HomePod to go on sale in December for $350. The connected speaker market is the next big tech hotspot, and there are now three primary players. Amazon got in first with the Echo, which is the most versatile system. There are three Echo models available: the Echo ($179) which has a pretty decent speaker itself, the Echo Dot ($49) which can connect to external speakers, and the Tap ($129) which has an internal battery. I've tried all three and I'm impressed with how Amazon keeps adding functionality. Google got in next with the Google Home, a price leader at $110. The Google Home can tell different voices apart and ties in with the company's many helpful online services, like translation. Apple has decided to go for the high end of the market, and is positioning HomePod more as a luxury speaker than a hands-free assistant. The next version of iOS will support multi-room audio, making this part of a sophisticated whole-home audio system. Apple isn't competing against Amazon and Google; it's competing against Sonos. The HomePod will offer strong audio with an array of seven tweeters, each with its own amplifier, and an upward-facing woofer. The device can sense its position in a room and optimize audio playback for any location. All of this is controlled by Apple's custom-made A8 chip. With so many low-priced Bluetooth speakers already on the market, I think Apple might have a difficult time carving out a niche. I'm not convinced there are that many households that want to splurge for $350 speakers in every room--and those that exist probably already have Sonos systems. But I'm not counting it out: If anyone can make this work, Apple can.

Vanity Fair hive Sign In/Up business technology politics the players hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology The Players Sign In/Up Hey Siri America’s Most Valuable Company May Be in Danger Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Hey Siri America’s Most Valuable Company May Be in Danger Is Tim Cook falling behind? by Maya KosoffJune 8, 2017 10:24 am Email Facebook Twitter By David Paul Morris/Bloomberg. When Apple released the iPhone 4S in 2011, it touted a major innovation that no other device at the time could claim: a voice-activated virtual personal assistant, Siri. Siri was unlike anything else on the market at the time; you could ask it questions about the weather, use it to perform complex calculations, and have Siri make calls and send texts for you. But while Apple stayed focused on upgrading its flagship product, the iPhone, through the years, other competitors developed their own voice-activated assistants. Google Now launched in 2012, and Amazon launched Alexa and Echo in 2014, which, in addition to answering Siri-like queries, could do things like turn off the lights in your home. Microsoft announced its own personal-assistant software, Cortana, the same year. As artificial intelligence advances, voice-activated digital assistants are quickly becoming the next frontier in consumer technology. But Apple, which was once a pioneer in the market, is now playing catch-up with its rivals. On Monday, Apple announced its own stand-alone product to compete with Amazon’s Echo and Google Home: the HomePod, which the company is promoting as a sort of sophisticated music speaker with Siri built in. But HomePod, which Apple spent years developing, is still nowhere near as sophisticated as competing products. As The Wall Street Journal reports, Siri’s progress has been slowed for a number of reasons, including the departures of some Siri team members and a slow pace of innovation (possibly due to the fact that the iPhone is still Apple’s flagship product). Apple’s commitment to user privacy—as well as its relative lack of user data, compared to Google and Amazon—has also limited its ability to personalize Siri or anticipate users’ needs. Although Apple’s stock has risen dramatically under the guidance of C.E.O. Tim Cook, some critics suggest his company has coasted on the success of the iPhone and failed to deliver a new breakthrough product. Apple executives say Siri is improving. In an interview with the Journal, Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue boasted that Apple switched Siri to a machine-learning system, which improved the software’s performance. “The key about things like Siri is to make it not feel like something you have to think about,” he said. Apple is also punching above its weight when it comes to searches: while Siri fields 2 billion requests per week, it’s competing against Google, which, by the estimate of Danny Sullivan, who covers Google and search marketing, completes about 3.85 billion voice searches a day. But developers remain disappointed. In 2016, Apple announced 150 new intents, or commands, for Siri at its WWDC developers’ conference—still far fewer than the 12,000 available with Amazon. “People went from being happy and excited to sitting in workshops and realizing, ‘I can’t use it,’” Brian Roemmele, a developer who attended the conference, told the Journal. “Some went back to that attitude: Siri’s always going to be dumb. They moved on to developing for Google and Alexa.” Share Email Facebook Twitter Maya KosoffMaya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

The names for these next devices are not set – not publicly anyway. Final details for the next set of Google Pixel phones, be they a set of 2 or a set of 3, likely hinges partially on Apple’s plans for their 2017 set of iPhone devices. Will Google copy Apple’s plan? Short answer: no, that’s crazy talk. Lead times and required times for manufacturing don’t line up well for Google deciding on which Pixels to make with regard to iPhone sales. Instead, Google would – potentially – need to rely on rumors and leaked details for Apple’s next collection in order to make necessary moves in the market for a timely release. This is because of Google’s chosen yearly release schedule. Last year, for example, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL were revealed in October. Apple revealed their iPhone 7 collection in September of 2016, and in September of 2015 Apple revealed the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. It’s the trends that we’re watching most closely, here. Of course there’s always the possibility Google might release Pixel 2 early. Proof in the already public code pudding What’s interesting about the most public information available about Google’s next set of devices is the frequency with which they’re called out. Each time a code change to AOSP – the Android Open Source Project – is made and applied to a set of devices, it’s mentioned in the notes. These notes are available at the Android Open Source Project Gerrit listing site. Searching the site for the three code names of Google’s next several devices reveals the frequency with which they’re used as testing devices. These devices, in order of presumed display size, are: Walleye, Muskie, Taimen. The device with the fewest appearances is Taimen, followed by Walleye. The device that appears the most is Muskie. That device which, if history teaches us anything, is the device that’ll be closest to the Google Pixel XL. The idea that Google is using the XL of this bunch to test the most might – MIGHT – indicate that it’s the device Google favors the most. You’ll notice also that the first round of reviews of the Google Pixel smartphone lineup were – for the most part – made up of Google Pixel XL units. It could also be that it’s the Google XL that saw the best sales of the two in the first round of the Pixel being public. I feel like it’s safe to assume that Google’s work on AOSP would require only one device to be the main testing phone while the others are tested less frequently in one most-plausible case. That is that the next round of Pixel smartphones, be it 2 or 3 devices released at once, will be released with the same parts. For the most part, that is. The battery sizes will probably be different, and the displays will obviously be different sizes. But like the first round, the Pixel 2, XL 2, and XXL 2, will almost certainly be nearly identical in their implementation. Will Pixel 2 beat iPhone for price? The starting price of a Google Pixel is $649 USD – or $769 for the Pixel XL. If you look at the way Google sells the Pixel on their Google Store, they only really reveal the “XL” part in the buy screen – as if a larger display is a choice not unlike choosing a color for the phone, or storage size. Apple’s store shows the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus as two different phones. The iPhone 7 costs $649, while the iPhone 7 Plus costs $769. The prices of Apple’s main two iPhones match those of Google’s Pixel phones. If Apple releases an iPhone OLED model, it won’t likely have a display larger than that of the iPhone 7 Plus. It’s rumored to sit between the smaller and the larger iPhone, with a price that’s higher than that of the iPhone 7 Plus because of its premium features. If what we’ve gathered about the Google Pixel XXL (or whatever it’ll be called) above is true, Google’s newest device will cost more than the XL, too. But will Google’s entire lineup gain a set of border-less displays that resemble those of the iPhone OLED model? That’s the KEY question. As it is with devices rumored and tipped before their official reveal by their makers, take the entirety of the information gathered here with a grain of salt. Don’t make any giant cash bets on the possibilities here – but keep them in mind when heading in to the summer season for buying a new phone.

Any developer can now tinker with HomeKit products and prototypes can be built on top of popular boards like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. However, once ready for market, the device will still need to get MFi certification. Notably, Apple also made another major change to this process. Manufacturers are no longer required to integrate an authentication chip; rather, authentication can now be done through software. Any existing product or future product can do this software authorization. The devices just need a firmware update. Apple said it would still have all the same heavy-duty encryption running on it. (Of course, companies who have already gone through the process of integrating the authentication chip onto their device might be a little annoyed with this update.) These two changes could make a big difference in helping manufacturers get new HomeKit devices to market quicker. Over the last year we've seen significant increase in the number of HomeKit products available; however, we'd love to see even more!

Zeman   @phonescooper updated Yesterday, 11:40 AM The U11 is HTC's flagship smartphone for 2017. It competes directly with the iPhone 7 Plus, G6, and Galaxy S8+. HTC has always offered a unique experience on its handsets, and the U11 dials the unique factor up to, er, 11 with features like Edge Sense and Sense Companion. If you want a flagship that checks off all the right boxes and looks absolutely gorgeous doing so, the U11 may be what you seek. Here is Phone Scoop's in-depth review. AD       article continues below... Is It Your Type? The HTC U11 is the company's flagship smartphone for 2017. It competes well with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S8+ in terms of size, features, and cost — and throws in some unique tools not available from the competition. If you're in the market for a leading handset from a company other than Apple and Samsung, the U11 is a solid place to start thanks to its gorgeous design and top-level specs. Body You likely won't find a more visually arresting phone this year than the HTC U11. HTC has taken its years-long obsession with high design and turned it into a love affair with glass and metal. The U11 is similar to the U Ultra in that it relies on an all-glass, curved rear panel. It has a layer of stunning color underneath that simply dazzles and delights the eyes. Words fail to describe the insane beauty of this phone. Both the rear and front glass pieces are curved along all four edges and corners, providing a smooth, uninterrupted look. These front and rear glass panels sandwich a thin aluminum frame that provides the U11 with its rigidity and strength. U11   As amazing as the glass is, the overall shape of the U11 is disappointingly boring. The corners, curves, and basic footprint are very close in appearance to that of the iPhone 7 Plus, which is itself a somewhat outdated design. I deeply appreciate what HTC did with the U11's glass and coloring, but it deserves a better chassis. It's a bit like applying the world's best paint job to a Mazda rather than a Maserati. It's a great paint job, but the paint would look even better with some svelte curves. The HTC One 7, One 8, and 10 were all more interesting from a design/shape perspective. In terms of size, the U11 is really close to the 7 Plus and S8+. The U11 is shorter than both the S8+ and the 7 Plus, but wider than the former and thicker than the latter. We're talking by just a few millimeters (and sometimes less) here; all three phones are similarly sized. This means the U11 will be comfortable to use for most people, though those with the smallest hands may find it too big. It's often a two-handed phone. The smooth, rounded corners and overall slim profile mean the U11 slips into pockets with ease. It's a breeze to carry around and use. You can't ask for finer materials. HTC selected high-grade aluminum and Gorilla Glass front and back to give the U11 its luscious in-hand feel. I can assure you the chassis components are top quality and fitted together precisely. The glass panels are tucked into the aluminum panel snugly all the way around. Only LG and Samsung have crafted similarly appealing phones this year, in the G6 and S8, respectively. The U11 puts the iPhone 7 Plus to shame. There is a downside to all this friggin' beauty: the U11 is friggin' fragile. The 7 Plus is a bit tougher thanks to its all-metal rear panel. The G6, too, is tougher due to the flat front and curved shape of the screen. You can tell me "But Gorilla Glass!" all day long, and yet that's not going to stop the U11 from shattering when dropped onto hard surfaces from significant heights. In other words, you may want to wrap it up in a case. Fortunately one is included in the retail package. I appreciate the U11's pitch black front surface; the display and sensors are indistinguishable from the surrounding bezels. Even the home button, which doubles as a fingerprint reader, disappears into the inky blackness of the phone's face. Speaking of buttons, the home button is capacitive, not physical, and it works at the slightest touch. In fact, I found it to be almost too sensitive. Capacitive keys are on either side for interacting with the Android "back" and "app-switcher" functions. They work well. I appreciate the slimness of the side bezels, but the bezels above and below the display are much thicker than I'd prefer to see on a 2017 flagship. The screen lock button and volume toggle are perched on the right edge of the U11. I really like the feel of the screen lock button, which has distinct ridges to give it some texture. This makes it really easy to find by feel. Travel and feedback is really good. The volume toggle is longer and smoother. The profile is good, and so are travel and feedback. The invisible pressure sensors for the U11's Edge Sense feature (more on that later) are buried in the side edges. The combo SIM card / memory card tray is buried in the top edge of the phone. You'll need a paperclip or SIM card tool to remove it. It accepts nano SIM cards and microSD memory cards. The left edge of the phone is completely smooth and uninterrupted. The USB-C port, speaker, and a microphone adorn the bottom edge. Rather than use small holes for the speaker, HTC cut a single slot in the underbelly. The speaker hole is almost as big as the USB-C port. It looks odd. You won't find a 3.5mm headphone jack anywhere on the U11, as HTC has moved to USB-C audio for its high-end devices. This is just as annoying now as it was when other phone makers removed the headphone jack. HTC includes its own USB-C headphones in the box, as well as a USB-C-to-3.5mm adapter, but these are imperfect solutions to a completely avoidable problem. Like other handsets in this class, the U11 is water resistant, with an IP67 rating. It can handle rain, sprays, and a short immersion into a shallow amount of water. That means you'll be safe if you accidentally drop the U11 in the pool this summer, which is about all you can really ask. If there's one thing I loathe about the U11's mirror-like rear finish, it's the material's ability to collect the worst gunk from your hands. It takes two seconds flat to totally besmirch the glass surface with fingerprints and other grime in the nastiest possible way. Ew. I was constantly taking a polishing cloth to the phone's backside. Speaking of which, you cannot remove the glass panel; the battery is inaccessible. The U11 is a gorgeous, well-made piece of hardware that impresses. It's not perfect, but it's a fine balance of design, quality, and features. Screen The primary reason the U11 is physically wider than the S8+ and G6 is because HTC stuck with the more common 16:9 aspect ratio for the display. Where Samsung and LG went tall and narrow, HTC kept things wide. The 5.5-inch screen has quad HD resolution (2,560 x 1,440p). The pixel density is fantastic and everything on the screen is smooth. You can't spot individual pixels anywhere. Brightness is excellent, as well, and the LCD panel puts out an incredible amount of light. The U11 was completely readable outdoors under direct sunlight. Viewing angles are very, very good for an LCD with hardly any brightness drop or blue shift. Together, the brightness and resolution go a long way toward making the U11 a viable VR device with something like Cardboard, but it's not compatible with Google Daydream since that requires an OLED screen. Signal HTC engineered the U11 with fantastic LTE support, including Band 66, one of the newest, (currently useful with T-Mobile.) HTC plans to sell the phone unlocked directly to consumers, and it should work well on AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless and their myriad prepaid brands. Sprint will also sell the phone. The U11 is one of a handful of devices that supports Sprint's new HPUE technology for faster speeds (particularly at the cell edge in Band 41). I tested the Sprint model and came away impressed. The phone remained latched onto LTE service throughout the time I tested it and never once dropped the signal entirely. I was able to connect calls consistently on the first dial, and the U11 easily held onto calls over miles of highway driving. The phone didn't drop any calls, nor did it miss any. Data speeds were excellent across the board. In fact, the U11 was an LTE powerhouse. I streamed HD video and lossless audio without a single hiccup. The U11 is fast Fast FAST. Sound Call quality via the U11 is pretty good. Many calls sound fantastic, while just some were slightly distorted. The earpiece produces decent sound, and just enough volume. You need to crank it up all the way to hear calls in busy spaces. People always said I sounded good. The speakerphone is dramatically better. It produced much clearer audio and could handle being pushed all the way up without turning things into a distorted mess. The U11's speaker design is similar to that of HTC's own U Ultra. Gone are the awesome BoomSound stereo speakers that adorned some of HTC's classic handsets. The U11 has a high-frequency speaker in the earpiece and a low-frequency speaker in the speakerphone on the bottom edge. Together, the two push out full-range sound — but it's not true stereo. The sound is very good when you hold the phone normally. You can turn it up and easily fill a room with music. If you decide to turn the phone sideways to watch some video, it's pretty obvious (to me, anyway) that the highs are coming from one side and the lows are coming from the other. Turning on the U11's "theater mode" doesn't do much to mitigate the imbalance. The bottom edge speaker fires out a huge amount of audio and the earpiece simply can't match it. USonic Then there's the headphone situation. Because there's no 3.5mm headset jack, HTC included its own USonic headphones in the box. What makes the USonics unique is that they measure and map your inner ear and then rely on phone-based software to analyze and adjust the sound profile specifically for the shape of your ear canal. The tool shows you some EQ curves so you can compare the original curve to your personalized one, and you can toggle it on and off to compare. I have no doubt that these headphones sound better after applying the USonic tool. The U11 goes one step further than the U Ultra: its USonic headphones also include active noise cancellation. The headphones and U11 work together to listen to the ambient sound and use algorithms to generate the opposite wave length to tamp down the external noise. The result is clean(er), clear(er) music. The software works. Together, the customized sound profile and active noise cancellation make the USonic's some of the best in-box headphones I've ever heard. This is how USonic. USonic   HTC did include a USB-C-to-3.5mm adapter in the box, which should allow you to connect your U11 to legacy devices that offer only 3.5mm input. This adapter only works with HTC phones, and the U11 didn't work with a third-party adapter I tried. This annoys the living crap out of me. I don't care who's at fault, this stuff needs to just work. Battery HTC carried over the U Ultra's 3,000 mAh battery for the U11. I would have preferred to see a higher capacity battery, but 3,000 mAh is about on par with today's competing flagships (except for the S8+, which has a huge 3,500mAh battery.) I found the U11 makes it through a full day of use with a fair amount of power to spare come bedtime. The U11 surely has more battery left at the end of the day than the HTC U Ultra, which was close to dead at bedtime. As per the norm, I used the automatic screen brightness tool and kept all of the radios (Bluetooth, WiFi, GPS, etc.) on. I used the phone for messaging, social networking, emailing, streaming music and video, picture taking, and much more. The phone includes HTC's Power Saver mode, which conserves CPU cycles, limits location services, reduces screen brightness, and turns off vibration. The Ultra Power Saver mode is more dramatic; it basically turns the U Ultra into a glorified feature phone, which means the phone, messaging, and email apps run, but nothing else. This can add up to a day and a half of life to a nearly depleted battery. The U Ultra cannot charge wirelessly, which kind of stinks, but the Snapdragon 835 processor supports Quick Charge 3.0 and HTC was kind enough to stick a QC3 charger in the box. Bluetooth, GPS, NFC, WiFi HTC did a fine job with the U11's ancillary radios. The Bluetooth radio worked really well. I paired it with a number of headphones and speakers, as well as my car. Call quality through dedicated headsets and my car's hands-free system was very, very good. Music impressed me via Bluetooth when I streamed some tunes to my favorite speaker. The included NFC radio helped me pair the U11 with a variety of accessories. The phone also supports Android Pay for mobile payments if that's your bag. As far as the GPS radio is concerned, the U11 ran Google Maps flawlessly. Maps always pinpointed me to within 10 feet in just a couple of seconds. It doesn't get much better than that. Real-time navigation? Pshaw. No problem. I blindly trusted the U11 to get me to a remote field for one of my daughter's lacrosse games. It worked perfectly in the northern sticks of New Jersey. WiFi? Yeah, it rocked. view article on one page Next page: Software X Related Hands On with the HTC U11 The HTC U11 is the company's true flagship phone for 2017. It fills the Goldilocks spot in HTC's U series: better than the U Play, but smaller than the U Ultra, while also replacing last year's HTC 10. Review: HTC U Ultra HTC's flagship handset for the year is the U Ultra, a stunning slab of metal and glass. This powerful Android smartphone combines an attractive design with a solid spec sheet. HTC's U11 Just Wants To Be Squeezed HTC today announced the U11, a flagship smartphone that responds to squeezes along the side edge. According to HTC, the U11 will open the camera, dictate and send a text message, or even open email with a gentle squeeze. Review: LG G6 The LG G6 is a strong offering from the Korean company that goes toe-to-toe with the best from Apple and Samsung. The G6 features a gorgeous design, the best materials, a waterproof chassis, and killer cameras. Review: HTC Bolt for Sprint HTC's Bolt for Sprint is a larger, more grown-up version of the HTC 10.

This time around, however, the team didn't reveal the usual difficult-to-upgrade internals we've come to expect from Apple products. No, this time, Apple looks to have made its AIO surprisingly customisable, with the addition of user-upgradable RAM and a modular CPU. Related: WWDC 2017 That means users would be able to upgrade the CPU in the future – something Apple hasn't allowed on the 21.5-inch iMac for years. Recent models have come with RAM modules and the CPU soldered to the logic board, meaning the average user would not be able to customise either without the help of a professional. That said, iFixit does make clear that the processor won't be the easiest to tinker with, writing: "[The CPU] isn't the most accessible thing in the world—it's flipped onto the backside of the logic board, trapped behind a lot of other components, and buried under a glued-down pane of glass—but for the first time in years it's possible to replace or upgrade the CPU without a reflow station, and that's a big win." In terms of the RAM, Apple hasn't offered a 21.5-inch iMac with expandable RAM since way back in 2013, so it's a significant finding from the iFixit team. They add: "It may not be as accessible as the (dead simple) RAM hatch found in the 27" iMacs—but still, this is a major win for upgradability over all the 21.5" iMacs with soldered RAM that we've encountered in recent years." Unfortunately, RAM and CPU accessibility aside, iFixit still opted to give the iMac a low repairability score of 3/10. That's mostly due to the issues users will encounter trying to pry the machine open in the first place, but it's still better than the 2015 model, which scored a lowly 1/10.

The iOS 11 reveal made up a considerable chunk of the keynote, with plenty of exciting changes on their way. iOS 11 is not out till the end of the year, leaving plenty of time for last minute tweaks as the beta program gets underway. Let’s take a look at what it all means, and how you can try it out for yourself before the official release. A Slew of iPad-Specific Features iPad and iPad Pro owners rejoice, because your tablet is getting a few more features with the arrival of iOS 11. Apple seems set on transforming the iPad family into the laptop alternative it promised all along. The first is the arrival of the Files app, a proper file management solution in the vein of Finder. There’s also a dock, just like the dock you’ll find on macOS. This allows you to pin oft-used apps and switch between them just as you do on a Mac. New drag-and-drop features allow you to move text, photos, and files from one app to the other using Split View. You can even drag documents into the dock to open them in a specific app, just like on a Mac. Advertisement There’s also a new app switcher for iPad multitasking, with the ability to open multiple apps at once from the dock and have them both active on-screen at once. There are also a ton of improvements to Apple Pencil integration, including the ability to write directly into the Notes app, super-fast document markup, in-line drawing, and a new document scanner in the Notes app. Despite the commonly held belief that Apple has transformed the Mac through the process of “iOSification,” they’re now taking the opposite approach with the iPad by implementing longstanding Mac features. It may take a little more for the iPad Pro to really stand on its own as a laptop alternative Can the iPad Pro Replace Your Laptop? Can the iPad Pro Replace Your Laptop? The iPad Pro can do a lot, but can it do enough to completely replace the humble laptop? That depends.

Read More ? You probably stopped using them when you realized it takes a rather large number of taps to find the sticker or game you want. iOS 11 fixes this with a new floating app drawer that lets you launch any iMessage app with a swipe and a tap. It’s also possible to send money using Apple Pay to other users via iMessage. When you receive funds you’ll get an Apple Pay Cash Card added to your Wallet app. With this you can pay for goods anywhere Apple Pay is accepted, send it on to other friends, or withdraw it to your bank account. Finally, your iMessage conversations will now be kept in-sync via iCloud. If you delete a message on your iPhone, it will also be deleted from your Mac and iPad. Say goodbye to messy, out-of-sync conversations! Further Siri Enhancements Siri now sounds better than ever, with a new more eloquent and natural voice. You can now ask Siri to translate for you, from English to Chinese, French, German, Italian, and back again. According to Apple, you’ll need to set your language to US English for this to work. Siri now uses machine learning to use different tones and now comes with a male voice, as well as translation#wwdc2017 pic.twitter.com/UYmhazIQve — Sagar Vyas (@sags1995) June 5, 2017 Siri is also now context aware, so factors such as your location and calendar schedule will be taken into account when serving up information. Machine learning has been used to tailor the assistant to you like never before, with customized news, better QuickType suggestions, and Safari suggestions based on your habits. As ever, Apple has stressed that everything Siri sends to its servers is encrypted end to end. You can also turn off these smarter features Stop Siri & Notification Center Giving Away Your iPhone Secrets Stop Siri & Notification Center Giving Away Your iPhone Secrets Leaving your iPhone on the table while you go to the bar is okay if it's locked, right? After all, your mates can't access information or post slanderous messages on Facebook... right? Read More if you’re uncomfortable with your iPhone gathering data about you. Smarter Photos and Videos Live Photos allow you to capture the moment, as well as a still image, and iOS 11 can let you turn your Live Photos into loops or Boomerang-like bouncing videos. You can even capture long exposures, something you’d previously need to buy an SLR or fancy mirrorless camera for. Support for HEVC and HEIF (High Efficiency Video Codec and High Efficiency Image Format, respectively) means you can shoot higher quality video that occupies half the space of the current H.264 codec. Images will also consume less space, but remain compatible with other phones. Apple has also refreshed the Photos app with better filters for its Memories feature, plus there’s a new document scanner within the Notes app which lets you create digital copies Scan & Manage Your Receipts, Save Space, Paper & Time Scan & Manage Your Receipts, Save Space, Paper & Time Paper receipts are easily lost and hard to find when you need them most. Thankfully, going digital solves both of these problems. Read More without the need for a third party app. A New Customizable Control Center One of the most obvious changes in iOS 11 is a brand new completely customizable Control Center. The feature allows quick access to oft-used functions like volume and brightness with a flick up from the bottom of the screen on an iPhone, or via the app switcher on an iPad. In iOS 11, you can customize the menu to feature only the functions you actually use. All shortcuts and controls now appear on a single page, so there’s no need to swipe to get to media controls either. You can use 3D Touch to access more functions, and the current design looks pretty great too. A Fresh New App Store iOS 11’s App Store looks a lot like Apple News, which is a good thing because Apple News looks pretty good. The design focuses on clean lines and bold text, with visual elements like screenshots and videos taking center stage. There’s a new Today tab, which seems appropriate considering the pace of the mobile app space. Games and regular apps have also been spread across two tabs . Despite a few face lifts, the App Store has changed relatively little since being opened in July 2008, so it’s about time Apple gave it some love. AirPlay 2, Apple Music, and MusicKit AirPlay 2 represents a new era for wireless casting via Apple devices. The new standard allows you to manage multiple receivers individually throughout your house. Adjust volumes and enable or disable compatible devices using Apple’s HomeKit smart home system Getting the Most Out of Apple HomeKit and the iOS 10 Home App Getting the Most Out of Apple HomeKit and the iOS 10 Home App In this article, you’ll learn about the growing list of HomeKit-related products and how to control them. You’ll also see how to spot a compatible product in the marketplace. Read More . The first device to feature AirPlay 2 is Apple’s new HomePod speaker and connected home assistant, on sale in December. Apple is once again trying to work social features into Apple Music, with the arrival of recommendations from friends. You can now also have your own profile on Apple Music. You can use this to share playlists and your wider musical tastes with your friends. The company is also introducing MusicKit, an API for developers to interact with Apple Music. Apps like Shazam have been able to connect to Apple Music 9 Tips for a Better Apple Music Experience on iOS & OS X 9 Tips for a Better Apple Music Experience on iOS & OS X There's a lot Apple doesn't tell you about Apple Music. Here are some of the best tricks for making the most of your tunes. Read More for a while. A proper API should make these interactions more elegant and useful. All the Small Things Apple Maps receives a few small updates, including indoor mapping for “hundreds” of malls and airports in the U.S. This includes listing the shops beyond airport security and those on different levels within shopping centers. Apple also added lane guidance and speed limit information while driving. The new Apple Maps looks amazing, but let's see how it works. #iOS11 #WWDC2017 pic.twitter.com/x5OaTQLpxK — Rui Delgado (@rui) June 5, 2017 A new feature called Do Not Disturb While Driving does exactly what it says on the tin. Your iPhone will detect when you’re driving, using turn-by-turn navigation, or via connection with a Car Play device, and prevent any notifications from distracting the driver. This means your iPhone will answer incoming calls to notify the caller that you’re driving. Siri’s machine learning has also made its way into Apple News. The app now suggests content that’s more relevant to your interests based on what you like to read. There’s also a new curated tab called Spotlight (confusingly How to Use Spotlight on Your iPhone to Save Time How to Use Spotlight on Your iPhone to Save Time Spotlight has been around on iOS devices for a while, but it's gotten a whole lot more powerful with iOS 9.

Here's everything you need to know. Read More . But Apple’s live demo was impressive so hopefully the new tools can empower developers to push the technology further. There’s a new one-handed typing mode which moves the keys closer to the left or right-hand side of the screen, depending on which hand you’re using. iPad users even get an expanded QuickType keyboard, which puts symbols on the same keys as letters and lets you access them with a tap-and-flick. Finally, Apple is also making it easier than ever to buy and switch to a new iOS device or Mac, with Automatic Setup. Just hold your iPhone near another Apple device (software update required, probably) to transfer much of your personal and sensitive information including settings and passwords. For Beta or Worse You can sign up for the public iOS 11 beta at beta.apple.com. Though, beware that beta software is unfinished and likely to cause issues. If you’re curious about iOS 11, it might be worth installing the beta on something other than your main iPhone — an iPad or spare iPod Touch is a better choice Should You Buy Apple's Best iPod Touch Ever?

Twenty-two people have been detained on suspicion of infringing individuals’ privacy and illegally obtaining their digital personal information, police in Zhejiang Province said in a statement on Wednesday. Of the 22 suspects, 20 were Apple employees who allegedly used the company’s internal computer system to gather users’ names, telephone numbers, Apple IDs and other data, which they sold as part of a scam worth more than 50 million yuan (US$7.36 million). The statement did not specify whether the data belonged to Chinese or foreign Apple customers. Following months of investigation, police across more than four provinces — Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian — apprehended the suspects over the weekend, seizing their “criminal tools” and dismantling their online network, the statement said. The suspects, who worked in direct marketing and outsourcing for Apple in China, allegedly charged between 10 yuan and 180 yuan for pieces of the illegally extracted data, it said. The sale of personal information is common in China, which implemented on Thursday last week a controversial new cybersecurity law aimed at protecting the nation’s networks and private user information. In December last year, an investigation by the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper exposed a black market for private data gathered from police and government databases. Reporters successfully obtained a trove of material on one colleague — including flight history, hotel checkouts and property holdings — in exchange for a payment of 700 yuan.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials BLink Portfolio How-To Social Media Computers & Laptops Mobiles & Tablets Other Gadgets Apple seeks changes in phased manufacturing programme to set up unit Press Trust of India comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet New Delhi, June 8:   Apple has sought modifications in the government’s phased manufacturing programme (PMP) as it plans to set up a manufacturing unit in the country. The objective of the Electronics and IT Ministry’s PMP is to boost indigenous production of mobilephones by providing tax relief and other incentives on components and accessories used for the devices. The programme will be rolled out over a period of time. “The Department of Electronics and Information Technology is looking at this. They want alignment of duty structures on the mobile components which it proposes to make here. Apple’s plan does not fit into the current PMP,” an official said. The official added that the department is discussing the matter with the Cupertino-based technology major. Under the manufacturing programme, benefits are extended to parts and sub-parts as the manufacturing ecosystem evolves. It also aims at increasing domestic value addition for setting up a robust manufacturing ecosystem in India. An e-mail query to Apple went unanswered. Fiscal concessions Earlier this month, Apple indicated to the government that it is ready with a blueprint to begin manufacturing iPhones in India, but asked for fiscal concessions, including Customs duty waiver on import of components. Apple executives had made a detailed presentation on its road map for setting up a manufacturing unit in India to an inter-ministerial group headed by Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) Secretary Ramesh Abhishek. With sales tapering off in the US and China, Apple is eyeing India — the fastest-growing smartphone market in the world — and looking to set up a local manufacturing unit to cut costs. It, however, does not manufacture devices on its own, and rather does it through contract manufacturers. Besides exemption from Customs duty on imports of components and equipment for 15 years, Apple wants relaxation in the mandated 30 per cent local sourcing of components. The company sells its products through Apple-owned retail stores in countries such as China, Germany, the US, the UK and France. It has no wholly owned store in India and sells its products through distributors.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / Apple / The new iMac is Apple’s first upgradeable desktop in years The new iMac is Apple’s first upgradeable desktop in years Matthew Wilson 15 hours ago Apple, Featured Tech News It looks like Apple is taking a step back in the right direction as this week, it was confirmed that upgradeability has returned to the iMac line. The latest round of 21.5-inch 4K iMac all-in-ones see the return of upgradeable RAM and even a modular CPU, making it the first desktop from Apple to offer expandable memory since 2013. This news came to us via iFixit, which has already managed to get its hands on a new iMac to perform a teardown, revealing some key changes in design that make it possible to upgrade. That said, while the ability to upgrade is present, it’s not necessarily easy to access, so Apple’s official word on the matter would be that neither the CPU or RAM modules are user-replaceable. As iFixit puts it, a “tinker-happy user” could certainly double the base 8GB of memory as long as the right tools and a good guide are present. The modular CPU is significant from a repair standpoint too, as before, Apple would need to replace the entire logic board to fix specific hardware issues. In all, this is a good step in the right direction for Apple and hopefully, this also spells good news for the future Mac Pro. A more modular design would be beneficial both to users and authorised repair shops. There is a downside though, as most replaceable components are stuck behind the logic board, so most of the system does need to be taken apart to access those areas. KitGuru Says: The iMac only scored a 3/10 for repairability but the fact that Apple is willing to begin including replaceable components again is a good sign. Hopefully we will see this expanded further with the 2018 Mac Pro relaunch.

Tech Search Search Climate ChangeRichard Branson Calls President Trump ‘Naive’ For Leaving the Paris Climate Agreement United KingdomU.K. Election Deals Theresa May a Crushing Blow, Blurring Brexit Talks United KingdomSterling Drops as Theresa May Falls Short of Majority in U.K. Election EntrepreneurHere’s Where Most Startups Fail Fortune 500 Here’s What an Amazon Exec Says About Apple’s HomePod Don Reisinger Jun 08, 2017 Apple on Monday fired a shot over Amazon's smart home bow, but the e-commerce giant might not think it matters. Speaking to USA Today in an interview published on Wednesday, Amazon senior vice president of devices David Limp seemed unmoved by Apple's new smart home speaker HomePod. He told the newspaper that the HomePod is "a little different philosophically" from his own company's Amazon Echo. While he didn't discuss exactly how the devices differ, he told USA Today that the HomePod's $349 price tag makes it substantially more expensive than his company's alternatives, including the popular Amazon Echo. "When people are starting to spend … hundreds of dollar per speaker, I think generally they’re going to want choice," Limp said in the interview. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter Apple at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday unveiled the HomePod smart home speaker. The squat device comes with what Apple says, are high-powered speakers, and will support the company's virtual personal assistant Siri to control smart home devices, like smart light bulbs and thermostats. Siri can also be employed to play songs through the company's streaming service Apple Music. While Apple (aapl) didn't mention any competitors by name during the event, the company's HomePod has features that are strikingly similar to Amazon's Echo, another smart home hub that has built-in speakers, is powered by a virtual assistant named Alexa, and can help users power the smart home. However, the Amazon (amzn) Echo costs $180. Apple's HomePod will retail for $349 when it's released later this year. Another competitor, the Google Home (googl), costs $129. It, too, comes with a built-in speaker and voice controls through the smart assistant Google Assistant. Google has so far not commented on HomePod. Apple has in several areas, including smartphones and music players, joined markets after entrenched rivals and ultimately dominated them. And the company is attempting to do the same with the HomePod. But at least for now, Limp isn't so sure a device that's nearly twice as expensive as its popular Echo could achieve the same success. That assessment won't be put to the test until at least December, when Apple's HomePod is released. Until then, Amazon will remain the smart home market's most popular device maker.

The new, slightly redesigned iPad bridges the gap between the now discontinued iPad Pro 9.7 and the larger iPad Pro 12.9, bringing a 20 per cent increase in display size but a 40 per cent reduction in bezels for a similar footprint to 2016's model.  The iPad Pro 10.5 offers all the features and functions you'd expect from a Pro model with the latest processor, Smart Connector, Apple Pencil compatibility and a lovely slim metal build.

Twenty-two people have been detained on suspicion of infringing individuals’ privacy and illegally obtaining their digital personal information, according to a statement by police in east China’s Zhejiang Province. Of the 22 suspects, 20 were Apple employees who allegedly used the company’s internal computer system to gather users’ names, phone numbers, Apple IDs, and other data, which they sold as part of a scam worth more than 50 million yuan (US$7.36 million). The statement did not specify whether the data belonged to Chinese or foreign Apple customers. Following months of investigation, the statement said, police across more than four provinces apprehended the suspects over the weekend, seizing their “criminal tools” and dismantling their online network. The suspects, who worked in direct marketing and outsourcing for Apple in China, allegedly charged up to 180 yuan for pieces of data. On June 1, China introduced a cyber security law aimed at protecting the country’s networks and private user information. In December, a Southern Metropolis Daily investigation uncovered a black market for data from police and government databases.

PC Gamer News Reviews Hardware Pro Best Of More Magazine Meet the team Newsletter Signup Community Guidelines Affiliate Links About PC Gamer Search Popular E3 2017 Battlegrounds Games of 2017 PC Gamer Club Far Cry 5 Hardware Guides Apple's new iMac Pro costs $5000, but is it overpriced? By Tuan Nguyen We attempt to put together the new iMac Pro for less. Comments Shares Near the end of the company's World Wide Developer's Conference yesterday, Apple announced a new desktop PC. No, not a new Mac Pro like many were hoping for, but a new all-in-one iMac... Pro. Here are the specs: 27-inch 5K display with 500 nits brightness and P3 color 8-Core Intel Xeon CPU, configurable up to 18-Core 32GB of 2666MHz DDR4 ECC RAM, configurable up to 128GB 1TB PCIe SSD, configurable up to 4TB SSD AMD Radeon Pro Vega 56 GPU with 8GB of HBM2, configurable to Vega 64, 16GB Front 1080p FaceTime HD camera Built-in stereo speakers, with 4 microphones, 3.5mm headphone jack 10GbE Ethernet Four Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports Four USB 3.0 ports 802.11ac wireless with Bluetooth 4.2 SDXC card slot with UHS-II As far as specifications go, the iMac Pro is a pretty beefy PC, and in all the right places. It's got one heck of a CPU, and a yet to be announced AMD Radeon Pro Vega 56. Apparently from the iMac Pro specs page, AMD is going to announce a Pro Vega 64 as well. We reckon that these GPUs will be based on AMD's Vega Frontier edition, and not the consumer version of Vega that is supposed to be announced sometime in August. Apple says that the $5000 base price for the new iMac Pro is a good deal, comparing its new computer to similar systems, specifically HP, which Apple said would have costed you $7000 for a similar system. Could it work for gaming? Probably. Would it be the best gaming PC that Apple has ever released? Yes. Based on the CPU and GPU alone, the new iMac Pro would be a fantastic gaming PC. But the old adage is that Apple computers are overpriced for what they are and that if you DIY, you can get an equivalent system for cheap. So let's try it! We went to our friends at PCPartPicker and built a system that attempted to match the new baseline iMac Pro feature for feature, to see how much we would actually save: PCPartPicker part list: CPU: Intel - Xeon E5-2620 V4 2.1GHz 8-Core Processor ($408.99) CPU Cooler: NZXT - Kraken X62 Liquid CPU Cooler ($158.99) Motherboard: Asus - X99-E-10G WS SSI CEB LGA2011-3 Motherboard ($649.00) Memory: Crucial - 32GB (1 x 32GB) Registered DDR4-2133 Memory ($253.81) Storage: Samsung - 960 EVO 1TB M.2-2280 Solid State Drive ($479.99) Video Card: Zotac - GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11GB Founders Edition ($678.99) Case: Silverstone - TJ04B-EW ATX Mid Tower Case ($151.90) Power Supply: SeaSonic - PRIME Titanium 1000W 80+ Titanium Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply ($242.89) Operating System: Microsoft - Windows 7 Professional ($134.99) Monitor: LG - UltraFine 5K Display 60Hz Monitor ($1299.95) Other: ASUS Model ThunderboltEX 3 Expansion Card ($69.99) Keyboard: Apple - MB110LL/B Wired Standard Keyboard ($49.00) Mouse: Apple - MB829LL/A Bluetooth Wireless Laser Mouse ($79.99) Speakers: Logitech - Z130 5W 2ch Speakers ($18.99) Card reader: Kingston - Digital MobileLite G4 USB 3.0 card reader ($9.24) Total: $4686.71 What we end up with is an awesome PC that would give our high-end build competition. We also have a system that's a productivity powerhouse as well. Our build has Wi-Fi, 10-gigabit Ethernet ports, USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, and even Apple's own keyboard and mouse—although not the cooler space gray versions. Unfortunately, we only saved $313 by building it ourselves and that's only after sending in $25 worth of mail-in rebates. If you can build the exact same specs as the new iMac Pro, let us know in the comments. Specs aside, we're not going to get the svelte design of Apple's new iMac Pro, and its admittedly good manufacturing build and design. But you go into DIY knowing this from the get-go. What you do get in return though is the ability to expand internally, which the iMac Pro doesn't offer.  If you use NZXT's new BLD system, you actually end up paying NZXT more to build a machine than the $313 you would be giving to Apple to build the iMac Pro. This is also in-line with what system builders will charge, and in many cases you'll end up paying even more for higher-end boutique builders. So if we're comparing builders, Apple's actually a deal! Of course, $1,300 of our price tag is wrapped up in the 5K monitor. It's an understandable cost for Apple's build, especially when you consider the all-in-one design, but you can save a considerable amount of money—and still have a kick-ass gaming monitor—by building separately. For pros editing 4K video, the 5K display makes sense. This is the demographic the iMac Pro is targeting. For the average enthusiast though, a cheaper 4K display will suffice. While Apple may have charged a big premium for its computers years ago, it looks like this is no longer the case today. If you're in the market to spend this kind of money on gaming though, you'd obviously be better off with our extreme gaming PC build guide than an iMac Pro.

A Congressional report released yesterday said that Apple, America's most profitable technology company, used a complex system of international subsidiaries and tax avoidance efforts to shift at least $74 billion out of the reach of the Internal Revenue Service between 2009 and 2012. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)    Apple Uses Slick Ad Campaign To Push Climate Change Hysteria [VIDEO] Chris White 11:53 AM 06/08/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Apple ran a political ad during the NBA Finals seemingly meant to further the company’s climate change warrior campaign. The iPhone maker aired a political ad entirely out of Live Photos of various nature shots along with the late astrophysicist Carl Sagan reading sections of his Pale Blue Dot, a 1994 speech that attempts to further the study of astronomy. Sagan’s famous speech expounds upon the vastness of the universe in respect to the smallness of the planet Earth, and asks listeners to be good to each other and to the environment. WATCH:  Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has been publicly excoriating President Donald Trump for vacating a climate accord his predecessor signed in 2016 that sought to reduce the country’s greenhouse gas levels by 28 percent of 2005 levels. The company’s head honcho told reporters June 6 that the president should put his politics aside and sign the 200-member non-binding climate pact. “But in terms of, ‘do you interact with politicians or do you not,’ my view is that first and foremost things are about, can you help your country and if you can help your country and you do that by interacting, then you do it,” Cook said. “The country eclipses politics.” His Silicon Valley company’s vast solar power investments would have benefited had the White House kept the U.S. wedded to the Paris agreement. Apple acquired tax credits last year after kick-starting Apple Energy, a subsidiary company that produces and sells solar power. The company won federal approval from federal regulators last year to start selling excess energy from its various California and Nevada solar farms. Instead of buying solar electricity from another operator, FERC’s approval gave Apple the ability to sell the juice from its own clean power plants. Apple’s strategy bolstered Cook’s environmental credentials, gave them some independence from the broader U.S. electric grid, and allowed the company to take advantage of the investment tax credit (ITC), which helped reduce Apple’s tax burden. The credit gives breaks to owners of solar projects worth 30 percent of project costs.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Companies Rare pair of 'mythical' Apple sneakers hit eBay with staggering $36,000 estimate Apple made trainers for its staff in the 1990s, and although unloved then they are worth a fortune today. By James Billington June 8, 2017 17:02 BST This high-priced pair of rare Apple trainers could fetch up to $36,000 at auction.Heritage Auctions Apple may know a thing or two about stylish electronics but it hasn't always had a perfect track record when it comes to fashion. You may not know it but the company once created a pair of trainers, complete with Apple logo, that were ugly as sin. Despite this, a pair of these rare Apple Computer Sneakers is selling for crazy sums of money. Back in the 1990s Steve Jobs took inspiration from rival Sony who flaunted the uniformity he desperately sought from their Issey Miyake-designed wear and attempted to roll out his own company clothing. This included a pair of Apple trainers, which were issued to some of its first employees. The white leather 'sports' sneakers feature the 90s multi-coloured Apple logo stitched on the side and tongue and are about as stylish and nerdy as a pair of straight leg stonewashed jeans. The trainers, which were ditched by the staff, have achieved near mythical status over the years. Having the holy trinity of being an Apple product, vintage, and rare these classic kicks unsurprisingly come with a staggering price tag. The pristine pair, listed as size 9.5, is being sold by Heritage Auctions on eBay and through its own website on 11 June and they've already got a starting bid of $15,000 (£11,500). However, the seller believes they could ultimately fetch up to $36,000 (£27,000). This price tag, however, is unlikely to put off Apple fans who have been snapping up vintage Apple products and memorabilia for thousands. An Apple-1 computer (the first Steve Jobs created) recently sold at auction for $130,000 (£100,000) and fans have been splashing the cash on clothing Jobs once wore including $2,880 (£2,225) for one of his iconic turtleneck jumpers.

The iPhone 8 release will occur in October or November, RBC said. RBC's note echoes other reports in the industry. Todd Haselton | @robotodd 15 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters The next high-end iPhone 8 will be delayed by 1 to 2 months, RBC says    11 Hours Ago | 00:53 The high-end Apple iPhone 8 will be delayed, RBC Capital Markets said in an investor note on Thursday. RBC's note echoes earlier reports from several other companies including Cowen and Company, KGI and Drexel Hamilton. Apple is expected to introduce three new iPhones in September — including the iPhone 7s, the iPhone 7s Plus and a high-end iPhone 8. "Multiple supply chain data points continue to point towards a delayed OLED production ramp, with likely shift by ~1-2 months for volume OLED production," RBC said. "Hence, while we still think AAPL launches all three models simultaneously in September, the OLED model will see limited availability or delayed availability till mid October/November timeframe." As a result of the expected delay, RBC said it's cutting September and December quarter iPhone expectations by 2.5 million units per quarter. RBC revised its September quarter revenues to $225.4 billion and its EPS estimate to $8.90, from $227.2 billion and $8.97, respectively. RBC's concerns about new OLED panels are similar to those raised by other firms, which have pointed to alleged struggles Apple may be facing trying to implement a fingerprint reader embedded in the screen of the iPhone, instead of placing it below the display where it currently resides. Other firms don't agree. Morgan Stanley said last month that its colleagues at Morgan Stanley's Greater China Technology Research facility had not yet seen any indication of supply chain delays.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Let’s talk about the iPhone 8, which might make one of the worst design compromises we’ve ever seen Zach Epstein BGR News June 8, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Apple is a company that once prided itself on refusing to compromise the iPhone’s design and user experience. Most notably, Apple was years late to the phablet market because it wanted to find the ideal design for an iPhone with a larger display (and it must have, since it has reused the same design for three consecutive years). If recent rumors pan out, however, Apple’s upcoming new iPhone 8 makes one of the worst design compromises we’ve ever seen. Let’s take a few moments to talk it through. Don't Miss: With WWDC 2017 and iOS 11, Apple has shown us the end of the iPhone Here’s a render of an upcoming new Android phone by a company called Essential that’s getting some buzz among hardcore Android fans: It’s difficult to find the words to express how terrible the phone’s display design is. “Bezel-less” is the trend du jour in 2017, and it’s glorious when it’s done right. When it’s done wrong, you end up with something like this new Essential phone, with a hideous notch cut out of the top of the display. Do you really want a huge chunk taken out of the top of your UI? Lordy does that look awful… Apple would never do anything so ridiculous, right? Right? The iPhone 8 has long been rumored to feature a new design that dramatically shrinks the bezels surrounding its screen. The current crop of iPhones have much more wasted space surrounding their displays than top Android phones have had over the past couple of years, so the change will be a welcome one… if it’s done well. According to the most recent crop of rumors, Apple’s next-generation iPhone will look something like this render, which is sandwiched between the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+: Ugh. The idea of Apple removing the home button and embedding the Touch ID scanner into the phone’s display is fantastic. The idea that Apple would maul the top of the iPhone 8’s display just to get the corners as close as possible to being bezel-free is not. In terms of usability, a design like this would only make sense if the top portions of the screen were off-limits to the majority of the phone’s UI, reserved only for status bar items like signal strength and battery life. Then the background up there would always be black, and you wouldn’t be left with photos and other graphics that have a big chunk cut out of them. Of course, this would only work if Apple decides not to make the iPhone 8 in light colors, since the bezels on the face of the handset would need to be black. Read More If the render above does indeed resemble Apple’s final iPhone 8 design, and Apple doesn’t reserve that extra display space only for status bar items, it would be yet another example of a compromise to the user experience that feels very un-Apple. Would the Apple of the late 2000s have made an iPhone with a huge ugly notch cut out of the display? Would the Apple of the late 2000s have rushed out a redesigned MacBook Pro without the latest-generation processors, or released a wireless mouse that can’t be used while it’s charging? But hey, at least Apple will be able to brag about its nearly bezel-less iPhone 8 when it unveils the new phone in September, right?

Amazon executive claims that future versions of the Echo speaker could support rival software David Limp, senior vice president of devices at Amazon, made the comments He said he 'hopes' future versions of the Echo could support other assistants Apple released its HomePod speaker on Monday to taken on Amazon's Echo  If firms got behind the plans it would allow users to mix and match products By Tim Collins For Mailonline Published: 11:52 EDT, 8 June 2017 | Updated: 12:03 EDT, 8 June 2017 e-mail 5 View comments While they might currently be seen as rivals, Amazon and Apple's smart assistants could soon work together, according to a senior executive from Amazon.  He claims that future versions of the Amazon Echo device will support rival software. This could mean that users could choose whether to use Amazon's Alexa assistant on the device, or other assistants, like Siri.    Scroll down for video Amazon's senior vice president of devices at David Limp (pictured) told audiences at the Wired Business Conference held yesterday in New York that future versions of the Echo smart speaker could support rival software like Apple's Siri  INTEGRATED SMART ASSISTANTS  Apple unveiled its new $349 (£270) smart HomePod home speaker at its 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday. Amazon and Google's existing speakers have also proved popular with consumers since the Echo launched in the UK in 2016 and Home earlier this year. The speakers, driven by artificial intelligence and voice-enabled assistants have become a leading trend in the tech industry and Alexa now boasts support for more than 10,000 apps. But it would be more convenient for consumers if the systems could be interlinked, allowing users to mix and match smart products. Amazon's senior vice president of devices David Limp told an audience at the Wired Business Conference, held in New York yesterday, that the firm would be open to this. David Limp, senior vice president of devices at Amazon, made the comments at the Wired Business Conference, held in New York yesterday. 'You should be able to tell Alexa, "ask Siri X,"' he said. 'If Apple or Google want to come calling, my phone number is out there, they can call. 'I don't know if I can envision it but I hope that will happen on behalf of customers.'  The remarks may come as a shock after Apple unveiled its new $349 (£270) smart HomePod home speaker at its 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference only days ago. Amazon's existing speakers have also already been popular with consumers since the Echo launched in the UK in 2016. The speakers, driven by artificial intelligence and voice-enabled assistants, have become a leading trend in the tech industry and Amazon's Alexa now boasts support for more than 10,000 apps.

Share this article Share 'I think when people are starting to spend that amount of money for a speaker, call it hundreds of dollars per speaker, I think that generally they are going to want choice,' Mr Limp added. 'And we sell a lot of speakers on Amazon and we want to give people a lot of choice.' Apple's HomePod is designed to work with the Apple Music subscription service and can produce rich sound while tapping into the artificial intelligence power of Siri. Amazon's existing speakers have also proved popular with consumers since the Echo (pictured) launched in the UK in 2016 The new $349 (£270) smart 'HomePod' home speaker (pictured) will go on sale later this year, and use Siri to play music and answer questions (stock image) The firm has also overhauled its smart assistant's voice with a new AI version for both male and female versions, along with a new app that can show users on screen information. Siri can also now translate into different languages and it uses a new system to learn about its owner using 'on device' AI to learns about a person's likes and dislikes. The device uses a technique known as beam forming to personalise the sound for each room and listener. Two can also be linked together to form stereo speakers. It has six microphones, and is activated with the phrase Hey Siri. It can do everything from giving news, weather and sports to setting timers and texting people.  The speaker is expected to go on sale later this year. THE SMART SPEAKER WARS  The HomePod takes on Amazon's Echo and Google Home. It will have a higher price tag than the Amazon Echo range, which begins at $49 (£49) for the Echo Dot. The speaker will provide a hub for appliances via Apple's HomeKit system and establish a centre inside the home to lock people in to using other Apple services, according to the report. The HomePod will take on Amazon's Echo (left) and Google Home (right). Google's $130 (£105) Home speaker is triggered by the phrase 'Hey Google' while Amazon's Echo uses 'Alexa'. Amazon's smart speaker is available in two versions - the full sized $180 (£145) Echo shown here, and a smaller, $50 (£40) version called the Echo Dot. A speaker might help customers stay loyal to other services such as Apple Music, Apple Watch, Apple TV and AirPods.  Google's $130 (£105) Home speaker is triggered by the phrase 'Hey Google' while Amazon's Echo uses 'Alexa'. Amazon's smart speaker is available in two versions - the full sized $180 (£145) Echo shown here, and a smaller, $50 (£40) version called the Echo Dot. Amazon Echo uses Microsoft's Bing search engine to provide additional information, while Google Home uses the company's own Google Search. Both Home and Echo are continually listening for commands, though Google and Amazon say nothing gets passed back to them until the speakers hear a keyword — 'OK, Google' for Home and 'Alexa' for Echo. Google's Assistant software is also able to answer follow-up questions on the same topic, in a near-conversation style, but Echo as yet cannot. However, Amazon's Alexa software has a wider range of skills on offer that enable it to link up with and control more third-party devices around the home. A light comes on to remind you that it's listening. You can turn off the microphone temporarily, too.  Read more: Apple Events - WWDC Keynote, June 2017 - Apple Steve T-S on Twitter: "Ahead of iOS 11, a 'Files' app placeholder entry from Apple appears on the App Store.

Sporting the latest hardware — including Kaby Lake processors, AMD RX 580 GPUs, Thunderbolt 3, and even faster NVMe flash storage — the new iMacs finally provided the serious upgrade that all-in-one Mac fans had been waiting for. But one technical specification of the new systems introduced a few quirky notes and caveats: the RAM. Apple fans know that the company has a bit of an odd relationship with consumers when it comes to Mac RAM. From highly inflated RAM upgrade prices, to non-user-upgradeable RAM in most of its Mac configurations, to conflicting “official” RAM limits, things can be a bit confusing these days for anyone looking to buy or upgrade a Mac. Keeping with this awkward tradition, the RAM situation for Apple’s new iMacs is still just as confusing. So here’s a quick rundown of what we know so far when it comes to system memory on these new iMacs. iMac RAM Notes Apple noted during the iMac section of the keynote that its mid- and high-end 2017 27-inch iMac models now support a maximum of 64GB of RAM. While it’s good to see Apple raise the “official” limit, the previous 2015 27-inch iMac also supported 64GB of RAM just fine, even though Apple’s official limit was only 32GB. So if you’ve got a 2015 iMac and are considering the 2017 upgrade for the increased RAM limit, you may want to try a RAM upgrade instead. Sure, the new iMacs use faster DDR4 memory, but many applications value the quantity of RAM over the speed, at least to a certain degree. As mentioned above, only the mid- and high-end 27-inch iMacs support 64GB of RAM, with Apple taking the time to clarify that the entry-level 27-inch model is limited to 32GB. This was odd, as all three iMacs utilize the same chipset and processor platform. It was therefore not surprising to see our friends at Other World Computing quickly confirm that the entry-level iMac does indeed support the full 64GB of RAM. You won’t be able to buy more than 32GB of memory for the base 27-inch iMac via Apple’s online store configurator (why would you want to do that anyway?), but it’s good to know that you’ll be able to max out the RAM on all 27-inch models with the help of third party suppliers. While not new to the 2017 iMac update, it’s important to reiterate that the RAM is not user-upgradeable on the 21.5-inch iMacs. This means that those buying these machines will need to shell out the extra cash up front to ensure that they have enough RAM to keep their iMac running smoothly not just today, but for however many years you want the system to remain viable. That means spending an extra $200 for 16GB or $600 for 32GB at purchase. Ouch. The process to upgrade the RAM in a 2017 iMac is just as simple and easy as it was before. Check out Apple’s instructions for details. iMac Pro RAM Notes The upcoming iMac Pro, set for release this December, is an entirely different beast. Unlike the “standard” iMac, the iMac Pro uses error-correcting code (ECC) memory, which helps counter any errors or corruption that may occur while data is stored in memory. This is crucial for the reliability of mission critical applications and databases, although its benefits likely won’t be noticed by most prospective iMac Pro buyers who are primarily interested in the system’s computational and graphical capabilities. While “mobile” size SO-DIMMs with ECC exist, early marketing images from Apple indicate that the company is instead using full-size DIMMs in the iMac Pro. This means that Apple needed to rearrange the components to fit the larger RAM modules inside the iMac Pro’s chassis. For consumers, it means that the RAM in the iMac Pro won’t be officially user-upgradeable. The potentially good news is that those same marketing images — which, of course, may not represent the final design — show what appear to be socketed RAM slots. If true, iMac Pro owners could upgrade their RAM post-purchase, but only if they’d be willing to perform the complicated and risky iMac teardown procedure. For those unwilling to do so, you’ll be stuck along with the owners of the standard 21.5-inch iMac in needing to purchase your RAM up-front from Apple. We don’t have upgrade pricing yet, but we do know that the iMac Pro’s $5,000 base configuration with ship with 32GB of RAM, and that buyers will have the option to upgrade to either 64GB or 128GB at purchase.

June 8, 2017 at 8:21 EDT AM dhp June 8, 2017 This is what makes some people hate Apple and now I find these products and policies no longer defensible. RAM was the last thing that you could count on to give your Mac a little boost after a few years (along with SSD storage if you are willing to tear apart an iMac). And the worst part is there is no practical reason for it; a few millimeters thinner and a few grams lighter make no difference in a desktop system. My “new Mac” is an old HP minitower I bought on eBay. June 8, 2017 at 8:46 EDT AM dhp June 8, 2017 “It’s good to know that you can still upgrade the RAM yourself.” Only if you pay at least $1799 for your iMac. That’s ridiculous in 2017. June 8, 2017 at 8:50 EDT AM boltar June 8, 2017 iFixit now reports the new 21.5 iMac uses replaceable RAM in the form of two SO-DIMM slots – for those daring enough to take the iMac apart. June 8, 2017 at 10:07 EDT AM Old UNIX Guy June 8, 2017 iFixit is reporting that the RAM on the 21.5″ iMac is not soldered on, so if you’re willing to take the screen off you can get to it and upgrade it. It’s not trivial, but I’ve done it on other iMacs and it’s definitely doable… Old UNIX Guy June 8, 2017 at 10:20 EDT AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

The objective of Electronics and IT ministry's PMP is to boost indigenous production of mobile phones by providing tax relief and other incentives on components and accessories used for the devices. The programme will be rolled out over a period of time. "The department of electronics and information technology (DeitY) is looking at this. They want alignment of duty structures on the mobile components which it proposes to make here. In the current PMP, Apple's plan is not fitting," an official said. The official added that DeitY is discussing the matter component-wise with the Cupertino-based technology major. Under the PMP, benefits are extended to parts and sub- parts as the manufacturing ecosystem evolves. It also aims at increasing the domestic value addition for setting up a robust manufacturing ecosystem in India. An e-mail query to Apple went unanswered. Earlier this month, Apple Inc has indicated to the government that it is ready with a blueprint to begin manufacturing iPhones in India, but wants fiscal concessions, including Customs duty waiver on import of components. Apple executives had made a detailed presentation on its road map for setting up a manufacturing unit in India to an inter-ministerial group headed by Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion Secretary Ramesh Abhishek. With sales tapering off in the US and China, Apple is eyeing India -- the fastest growing smartphone market in the world -- and looking to set up a local manufacturing unit to cut costs. It, however, does not manufacture devices on its own and rather does it through contract manufacturers. Besides exemption from the Customs duty on imports of components and equipment for 15 years, Apple wants relaxation in the mandated 30 per cent local sourcing of components. The company sells its products through Apple-owned retail stores in countries like China, Germany, the US, the UK and France, among others. It has no wholly-owned store in India and sells its products through distributors such as Redington and Ingram Micro.

The objective of Electronics and IT ministry's PMP is to boost indigenous production of mobile phones by providing tax relief and other incentives on components and accessories used for the devices. The programme will be rolled out over a period of time. "The department of electronics and information technology (DeitY) is looking at this. They want alignment of duty structures on the mobile components which it proposes to make here. In the current PMP, Apple's plan is not fitting," an official said. The official added that DeitY is discussing the matter component-wise with the Cupertino-based technology major. Under the PMP, benefits are extended to parts and sub- parts as the manufacturing ecosystem evolves. It also aims at increasing the domestic value addition for setting up a robust manufacturing ecosystem in India. An e-mail query to Apple went unanswered. Earlier this month, Apple Inc has indicated to the government that it is ready with a blueprint to begin manufacturing iPhones in India, but wants fiscal concessions, including Customs duty waiver on import of components. Apple executives had made a detailed presentation on its road map for setting up a manufacturing unit in India to an inter-ministerial group headed by Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion Secretary Ramesh Abhishek. With sales tapering off in the US and China, Apple is eyeing India -- the fastest growing smartphone market in the world -- and looking to set up a local manufacturing unit to cut costs. It, however, does not manufacture devices on its own and rather does it through contract manufacturers. Besides exemption from the Customs duty on imports of components and equipment for 15 years, Apple wants relaxation in the mandated 30 per cent local sourcing of components. The company sells its products through Apple-owned retail stores in countries like China, Germany, the US, the UK and France, among others. It has no wholly-owned store in India and sells its products through distributors such as Redington and Ingram Micro.

Originally published as a novel back in 2013, the tale powerfully and frighteningly illustrates how the life of an 'ordinary', highly-respected woman can be turned totally upside down following a chance meeting. The four-part TV series, screened this spring, kept the nation on the edge of their seats as actors Emma Watson and Ben Chaplin played out the leading roles. Melton Mowbray-born Louise says: "I was delighted, of course, when the BBC showed an interest in adapting the novel for TV but I was totally unprepared for what followed. The drama sold to TV stations all over the world, the book went straight back into the best seller lists and the offers have been rolling in ever since." IN OTHER NEWS: Derby Book Festival: everything you need to know Louise, who will be talking about her latest novel Black Water at the Derby Book Festival tomorrow afternoon, at Quad, revealed that after going the long haul to get her novels into print, she thought her life had settled into a comfortable pattern of creative writing, alongside some teaching, journalism and literature reviews. Like most writers it took a lot of perseverance and hard work before she got her first break. She said: "Originally I studied a degree course in English Literature at Leeds University and, two years later, I decided to do an MA in creative writing at East Anglia University." Though inspired by her tutors and novelists Sir Malcolm Bradbury and Angela Carter, Louise reveals that for most of her 20s she was a typical 'writer in a garret' – living in London, doing all kinds of part-time work from bar jobs to cleaning, then scribing away in her spare time. IN OTHER NEWS: Find out how much the Derby flat with £25K guide price sold for "My break came when I became runner-up in two competitions, – a short story and a play for radio." An agent soon followed and Louise had her first work accepted for publication a week before her 30th birthday. An accolade to her hard work and perseverance?. "Yes it was a huge moment," she agrees, "and my advice to all those would-be novelists out there is "keep your nerve" it is definitely worth the struggle in the end." Louise admits that she is drawn to the darker side of life for the themes of her novels as viewers of Apple Tree Yard no doubt noticed. "I am interested in the more difficult human experiences because that is where the big stuff happens," she comments. "I try not to get trapped in any particular genre but I feel myself drawn to dark subjects because these are often the larger events in life for people. "Costume dramas have their place but life is not always nice or pleasant. In Apple Tree Yard I didn't set out to write a book that centred around violence but in many dramas which feature sexual assault we don't get to find out much about the victim. There is the danger that these scenarios themselves become sensationalist, stereotypical and gratuitous. "I wanted Yvonne to be an ordinary person who just got caught up in something that got out of control so people could identify with her." Louise adds that she passionately believes in the power of stories and the lasting impact they can have on the reader. "When we read novels we walk in someone else's shoes and imagine what they must feel like. "Books have a very important role to play in learning about others, that very human understanding which can come from a story, particularly if written in the first person narrative." Her own favourite author list includes Margaret Attwood, Hilary Mantel, Kate Atkinson and the Bronte sisters. "Wuthering Heights has to be one of my favourite classic novels – all that running across the moors and wailing," she smiles. Louise concedes that the success of Apple Tree Yard has put a level of pressure on her future work, which can sometimes lead to writer's block. "I'm glad that I had written my new novel, Black Warter before Apple Tree Yard was screened," she confides. Set in Indonesia in 1988, it features a man who has returned to the country after a 30-year absence. But, he has a dark secret. The country is now being ruled by a military dictatorship and the tale opens as he wakes up feeling very afraid that he is about to be killed. Louise will be giving a reading of her new novel tomorrow afternoon and also plans to give audiences a chance to chat with her and ask questions about her work. Louise Doughty will be at Quad in Derby at 2pm on Saturday, June 10. Tickets cost £10 (£8 concessions) and can be bought online at www.derbybookfestival.co.uk Derby Book Festival, which runs from June 9 to 17, will include more than 70 events and activities in venues across the city. It opens on Friday, June 9, with Sebastian Faulks in conversation with James Naughtie, who returns to the festival for a third time, in Derby Cathedral. Faulks's latest novel, Where My Heart Used To Beat, returns to the theme of love and war, which is particularly appropriate with the arrival in the city of the poppies exhibition at the Silk Mill.

The arrested employees reportedly worked in “direct marketing and outsourcing” roles for the company in the Zhejiang province. Sony A6500 While details are still light at this point aside from a police statement on the arrests, the report appears to describe an operation in which distributors with access to customer contact information were able to sell this information to the black market for profit. Exactly what information was accessed or how long the operation went on is unclear, although the report does not appear to suggest any security breach occurred but rather employees taking advantage of information generally available as part of the job. Of the 22 suspects, 20 were Apple employees who allegedly used the company’s internal computer system to gather users’ names, phone numbers, Apple IDs, and other data, which they sold as part of a scam worth more than 50 million yuan (US$7.36 million). Apple employees having access to customer contact information like customer names, email addresses, and phone numbers is not uncommon for a variety of roles including support positions, and nothing suggests more personal data beyond contact information was collected and distributed. The report also says that police say they have broken up the illegal operation following the arrests: Following months of investigation, the statement said, police across more than four provinces — Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian — apprehended the suspects over the weekend, seizing their “criminal tools” and dismantling their online network. The most challenging problem here seems to be balancing what necessary access employees have to customer data like contact information and how it can be used. In this specific case, the scale at which the operation reached is perhaps most surprising. The suspects, who worked in direct marketing and outsourcing for Apple in China, allegedly charged between 10 yuan (US$1.50) and 180 yuan (US$26.50) for pieces of the illegally extracted data.

Apple may pride itself on offering its customers privacy and promising to protect their data, but in China, Apple's own employees have been working against the company in a huge data theft scam. According to the Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP), Chinese authorities have been investigating the data selling scam for months and 22 people have now been arrested across the Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces. 20 of those are Apple employees. The scam involved using Apple's own internal computer system and tools in order to collect the personal data of individual customers. This included names, phone numbers, Apple IDs, and every other bit of information Apple stores on its systems about individual owners/users of its devices and services. Related How to Use Apple Support How to Use Apple Support With the data stolen, it was then sold on for between $1.50 and $26.50 per piece of information. In total, this underground operation is thought to have earned the suspects $7.36 million. One thing that remains unclear is whether the data stolen belonged to Chinese customers or includes records of users in other countries. According to HKFP, personal information sales are very common in China, so while it may be surprising this happened for anyone reading this outside of China (including Apple's management team), it won't be to the Chinese authorities and general population. Apple will have to respond by publicly sharing details of exactly what personal data was stolen before implementing further security to ensure no more employees can manage to steal so much data so easily.

Sharing a photo of the room on their Instagram account, The Home Edit – a company hired by Gwyneth to organise the playroom – wrote: "For everyone watching our stories yesterday, this is the AMAZING playroom we were organizing!

STORY: Take a peek inside Gwyneth Paltrow's perfectly organised pantry Another photo showed the other side of the lucky siblings' play room, with floor-to-ceiling book shelves and cabinets that were filled with their toys and books – all colour co-ordinated and neatly displayed in clear plastic boxes. "We just spent the most INCREDIBLE few days at @gwynethpaltrow's Hamptons house (#lifegoals)! Our favourite project from the trip (and of all time) was the playroom.

The same company that changed the face of computers with the iMac, revolutionized the music industry with the iPod, and changed our lives with the iPhone has become the world’s most profitable company at the expense of innovation, as it has only introduced one new product which is anything but revolutionary: the Apple Watch. In 2007:  Every technology company was competing to revolutionize every aspect of our daily lives with new types of phones, MP3 players, or computers. In 2017: technology is a wasteland of glass and aluminum monoliths that only try to revolutionize what’s in your pocket. Ever since the announcement of the iPhone, all tech companies have wanted to focus on is making the best smartphone. From 2001-2010, Apple introduced at least three products that have shaped the landscape of the tech industry. Since then, they have been resting on their laurels. They put all of their eggs into the basket that is the iPhone. They have let their Macbook pro line of computers become vastly under-powered and overpriced, even for Apple. They let the Macbook Air, which has been called by many sources the perfect laptop, become obsolete. They have stopped caring about trying to change our lives. They only care about putting out a new iPhone every year, and we are okay with that. However, this is problem is caused in part by us, the consumers. We have allowed companies to become obsessed with smartphones. Markets respond to consumer demands and all we have asked for, as the consumer, is more and more smartphones, and ultimately, we have stopped caring about how technology can change the world. But there is still hope in the age of new technology. With Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Google Home, we see that technology still has the capacity to thrive. Companies are starting to get that a smartphone isn’t all we need to push the boundaries of what we are capable of. Soon enough, we will lift our eyes from our screens and learn how to have a conversation with technology. We will remove the barrier that we hold in our hands between us and infinite knowledge. We will begin to see tech change our lives again. The ten year technological innovation slump is finally over and the future we are starting to see would have happened a lot sooner had the industry taken its eyes off of the smartphone just one second sooner.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Apple to Roll Out ‘Horizon’ iPhone Screen-Repair Machines Apple to Roll Out ‘Horizon’ iPhone Screen-Repair Machines By Ryan Whitwam on June 8, 2017 at 11:00 am Comment One of the concerns people expressed way back when the first iPhone launched was, “Aren’t glass phones going to break?” Well, yeah they are. In fact, Apple has been making a surprising amount of cash repairing broken iPhone screens over the years. It hasn’t exactly made it easy for third-party repair centers to replace the screens themselves, but that’s about to change. Apple is set to deploy its proprietary iPhone-fixing “Horizon” machine in more than 400 third-party repair centers across the world. Apple reportedly took in $1-2 billion fixing broken iPhone screens last year. If Apple fixes your screen, the warranty remains intact. However, take that busted phone to a third-party, and you’re more than likely going to void the warranty. A number of states have taken aim at restrictive rules about repairing devices with so-called Right-to-Repair bills. Apple says its decision to roll out the Horizon device is not related to these bills, but of course it would say that. Apple has refused to even confirm the Horizon machine existed until now. Previously, Horizon devices were only found in Apple’s retail stores and mail-in repair centers. Even with this new program, the hardware will not be available widely. Apple is starting its Horizon rollout by putting machines in 200 of the company’s 4,800+ authorized repair centers. It aims to get that number up to 400 by the end of 2017. Select Best Buy stores will be among the first to get their own Horizon hardware, but some smaller shops got a Horizon last year as part of a secret test. Credit: Reuters/Stephen Lams Reuters was given a chance to examine the device in real life, describing it as a gray box about the size of a microwave. Technicians begin by removing the broken screen, which may be in multiple pieces. A new screen is mounted by hand, but that’s only the start of the process. The iPhone is then mounted inside the Horizon machine, where special Apple software communicates with the hardware for 10 to 12 minutes. This step registers the new fingerprint sensor with the phone. For security reasons, only Apple can associate a new sensor with a phone. After the hardware is active, the Horizon machine uses a mechanical finger to poke the display in various places. Touch input accuracy is verified by the machine to make certain the new display is working correctly. Horizon also calibrates the display to match the original. The result is a perfect repair and no voided warranty. Owners will still have to put up with spotty repair quality until the machines to do this are more widely available.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Apple The inside story of how Apple’s Siri lost its lead over rivals Chris Smith @chris_writes June 8th, 2017 at 10:23 AM Share Tweet Siri may have been the first virtual assistant, but Apple failed to turn it into a leader. Google came out with Google Now and then Google Assistant, and Microsoft followed suit with Cortana. But Amazon dropped in, seemingly out of nowhere, with a voice-based virtual assistant that won the early fight of the voice assistant war. A new report revealed what went on at Apple since it first introduced Siri, and why Apple is now playing catch-up in this particular business. Don't Miss: New leak claims to reveal final iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s Plus designs Speaking to former Apple employees and developers The Wall Street Journal learned a part of Siri’s inside story. Apple certainly has a great foothold in the virtual assistant business thanks to the millions of iPhones and iPads out in the wild. But multiple factors, including internal reshuffles and talent departures, an apparent lack of vision clarity, but also the success of the iPhone and the increased focus on user privacy are factors that “helped” Apple fall behind with Siri. Sure, Apple has just given Siri new powers and a brand new HomePod, but it’ll be a while until it beats Amazon. “People at Apple’s anxiety level went up a notch” as they watched Amazon demoing Alexa’s capabilities, a former member of Apple’s Siri team told The Journal. All of a sudden, a voice-controlled device for the home was able to do more things and understand voice better than Siri. “A lack of urgency and difficulty bringing ideas to fruition,” kept Siri development back, The Journal says, after talking to former executives, close observers, and Apple users. One of the anecdotes the report details concerns the hiring of Bill Stasior, a former Amazon search executive who arrived at Apple to oversee Siri about a year of Steve Jobs’s death, the man who brought Siri to Apple. But Stasior’s focus was on search, not speech or language which made some members of the Siri team think that he didn’t “fully appreciate the product’s original vision.” Siri cofounders Adam Cheyer and Dag Kittlaus left the team and formed Viv Labs which was acquired by Samsung not too long ago. Half a dozen other members of the team followed. Apple’s insistence on protecting user data is also what hinders Siri development, the report says, as Apple gives up control of user data too fast to gauge the impact of new Siri features. “You’re hamstrung,” former Siri engineer Jason Douglas said. “The iTunes store has great data, but the scale of it is not Google or Amazon.” Finally, Apple’s reluctance to share Siri access is also one reason why the assistant failed to evolve at the same pace of Amazon’s Alexa. The Journal’s full report on the matter is available at this link, and it’s definitely worth a read.

Twenty-two people have been detained on suspicion of infringing individuals' privacy and illegally obtaining their digital personal information, according to a statement yesterday from local police in southern Zhejiang province. Of the 22 suspects, 20 were Apple employees who allegedly used the company's internal computer system to gather users' names, phone numbers, Apple IDs, and other data, which they sold as part of a scam worth more than 50 million yuan (USD 7.36 million). The statement did not specify whether the data belonged to Chinese or foreign Apple customers. Following months of investigation, the statement said, police across more than four provinces - Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian - apprehended the suspects over the weekend, seizing their "criminal tools" and dismantling their online network. The suspects, who worked in direct marketing and outsourcing for Apple in China, allegedly charged between 10 yuan (USD 1.50) and 180 yuan (USD 26.50) for pieces of the illegally extracted data. The sale of personal information is common in China, which implemented on June 1 a controversial new cybersecurity law aimed at protecting the country's networks and private user information. In December, an investigation by the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper exposed a black market for private data gathered from police and government databases. Reporters successfully obtained a trove of material on one colleague - including flight history, hotel checkouts and property holdings - in exchange for a payment of 700 yuan (USD 100).
