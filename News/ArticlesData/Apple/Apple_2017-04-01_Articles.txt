Photo: AP Topic Apple Going local: how Apple got back into Indonesia’s smartphone game The company’s planned US$44 million R&D facility is a small price to pay to take part in Southeast Asia’s largest economy By Resty Woro Yuniar 2 Apr 2017 Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on LinkedIn Share on Google Plus Share on Sina 0Comments Apple is investing in a research and development facility in Indonesia. Photo: AFP The resumption of iPhone sales in Indonesia is being lauded as a boon not only for consumers – but as a milestone in the country’s efforts to become Southeast Asia’s top tech investment destination and a demonstration of what governments can achieve in demanding firms “go local”. Apple officially resumed iPhone sales this week at six retailers across major cities in the country, after months of being barred from the market, having won over Indonesian authorities with a commitment to building a US$44 million research and development facility in Southeast Asia’s largest economy. That sweetener was enough to meet “local content” regulations that have since January required all 4G handsets to feature local content of at least 30 per cent – a rule that can be met in terms of hardware, software or (as in Apple’s case) an investment commitment. “Apple can now sell smartphones in Indonesia because it has committed to invest here,” said I Gusti Putu Suryawirawan, the director general of electronics at the industry ministry. Apple plans to build three innovation centres in Indonesia over the next three years. The first facility in Tangerang, on the outskirts of Jakarta, will start operating at the end of the second quarter this year and will employ up to 400 staff, according to the ministry. The tech giant’s re-entry into the Indonesian market is a key victory in Jakarta’s three-year battle to encourage foreign firms to take a greater stake in developing its phone manufacturing industry. Those efforts have in the past had mixed success. The government introduced the “Made in Indonesia” rules in 2014. In their early version, the rules focused heavily on requiring firms to set up local manufacturing facilities and left little room for flexibility. That caught many foreign vendors off guard: China’s Oneplus reacted by exiting the market in 2015, while Xiaomi responded by disabling the 4G capability on its Redmi Note 3 Pro phones. But since then, companies have slowly adjusted as the government has introduced more ways of compliance, such as investment. As a consequence, 65 per cent of the mobile phones sold in the country of 250 million people are now manufactured domestically, according to the Hong Kong-based research firm Counterpoint. Global brands that have set up facilities in Indonesia include BlackBerry, Samsung, Huawei, and Lenovo. Xiaomi announced last month it was ready to assemble phones in the city of Batam, some 1,000km from Jakarta, employing 1,200 workers to produce 500,000 smartphones per month. “There are 34 brands that have made phones in 20 facilities in Indonesia,” Suryawirawan of the industry ministry said. Overall, analysts estimate Indonesia had a capacity output of 39 million units last year. Other Asian countries have also introduced policies to boost their positions in the global smartphone value chain. India’s similar “Made in India” regulations help it earn investments from Chinese smartphone makers such as Xiaomi and Lenovo. Apple is also reportedly looking to make the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S models at its facility in Bangalore. While the policy has boosted investment into Indonesia’s smartphone industry, analysts said the country’s manufacturing ecosystem was still not as developed as in neighbouring Vietnam, Southeast Asia’s phone manufacturing hub that hosts facilities run by the world’s largest smartphone maker, Samsung. Phone-component shipments into Indonesia were valued at US$379 million in the first half of 2016, exceeding the total value for all of 2015, which stood at US$202 million, underlining how companies still import parts from first-tier suppliers in countries like China or Vietnam due to weak supply-chain ecosystems. As is probably true for its competitors, Apple’s latest investment in Indonesia could prove strategic; the nation is poised to be the world’s fourth-largest smartphone market by 2020 with nearly US$1 billion in total sales, according to research firm Euromonitor International. Apple’s share in the market was less than 1 per cent in the fourth quarter last year, according to International Data Corporation, leaving plenty of room for growth – Indonesia’s middle class is expected to grow in the next few years. “While the move may not yield immediate results ... in the long term it gives Apple an opportunity to understand closely the changing device trends [in Indonesia] where smartphone penetration by users is still around 45 per cent,” said Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint. Why Chinese phone makers find India a good call To comply with the regulations, Apple appears to have picked the investment route that requires companies to spend at least 550 billion rupiah (US$41 million) in Indonesia to automatically clear the 30 per cent threshold. Firms choosing this avenue need to carry out their investments within a year and renew the commitment annually – failure to comply would cause annual sales permits to be revoked. Apple had pledged to invest in the country until 2019, officials said. Next year, that threshold will rise to 40 per cent. Uber, Grab refuse to yield to taxis, from Jakarta to Bangkok Analysts said that tax incentives and business-friendly policies that favoured exports to other regions could help Asian countries attract investments from smartphone companies. Vietnam, for example, is offering tax incentives such as a 30-year tax holiday that puts just a 10 per cent tariff on mobile phone manufacturing, and a VAT exemption on technology transfers. “The underlying trend is that the biggest countries in Asia outside China are all looking to boost their domestic manufacturing,” Counterpoint’s Pathak said. “We estimate there will be a very strong competition between India, Indonesia and Vietnam to be an export hub.” ■ Resty Woro Yuniar recent articles Would a fatwa stop Indonesia’s ‘fake news’? 24 Mar 2017 1 Comments Ride-sharers refuse to yield to taxis on streets of Jakarta, Bangkok 20 Mar 2017 1 Comments Newsletter Sign-up Asian insights and analysis direct to your inbox.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Sunday April 2, 2017 News Local News Larger / SmallerNight Mode Apple festival’s juicy success Elanor Watt 2 Apr 2017, 10:57 a.m. Crowds flock to Spreyton for a slice of the Apple Festival. The pick your nose stall, the food and the cook-off were some the highlights from this year’s Spreyton Primary School Apple Festival according to school principal Toni Douglas. “The pick your nose stall is something you do not have to spend a lot of money on to get some enjoyment out of, and the cook-off between Ben Milbourne and Devonport Mayor Steve Martin was very popular as well, people got to sample the outcomes of that,” she said. FRESH PRODUCE: Amelia Willis of Shearwater enjoyed a fresh Spreyton apple at the Spreyton Primary School Apple Festival. Picture: Elanor Watt. The former MasterChef contestant cooked up a rhubarb and apple crumble out of the mystery box ingredients given to the two on the day and Alderman Martin made a vegetarian stir fry with crispy skin salmon. Mrs Douglas said the new attractions, stalls and entertainment enticed people from across the Coast to get a taste of the action. “The weather was perfect, the crowds came and kept coming, probably a few more than what we have had in previous years, and I suspect it is a combination of a beautiful day and also the number of activities on offer,” she said. Mrs Douglas said she thought the school was just as crowded as it has ever been and they were on target to raise as much money as previous years. “We rely on this to raise the funds we need for all sorts of resources for our school and our students – things we wouldn’t able to buy otherwise,” she said. “I would like to thank our organisers, they have pulled it all together with the help of staff and other parent volunteers  - we are really lucky to have such a positive and supportive community and thanks to them for coming out and making the day a success.” Click here to see snaps from the festival.

Samsung’s DeX proves the dream of shoving a small computer into a larger one isn’t dead Posted Mar 29, 2017 by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story See you tonight at the Boulder Micro-Meetup Since the dawn of machines, mankind has dreamed of shoving one small computer into a larger one. The vision resurfaced last week in the form of a strange Apple patent for a laptop-style device that slotted in an iPhone in place of the trackpad. Of course, Apple patents all sorts of crazy stuff. That’s just a thing that Apple does. The actual possibilities of such a device coming to market seem, at best, slim. But like clockwork, in amongst a deluge of announcements at today’s Samsung Unpacked event in New York is the DeX, a docking station for the Galaxy S8 that turns the newfangled phone into the base of a desktop computer. The system, designed to “facilitate the mobile workforce” features a swiveling curved HD display and a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Samsung says it worked with Microsoft and Adobe to customize apps for the experience, which I have to say in our quick demo seems to run a lot smoother than older attempts to capture the strange space. The system turns the Android experience into a full desktop (albeit with the limited processing power contained therein) and features  enterprise support from the likes of Citrix, VMware and Amazon. It’s a pretty limited case use, let’s be honest. Samsung’s got work stations at offices in mind here, so employees can just pop their phone and go to work. Though I’ve got to wonder how many road warriors as it were are running around with smartphones and no laptops. It’s an extremely narrow scope that’s plagued the category from the beginning. But it’s never stopped tech companies from reaching for the docking stars. And let’s be honest, the idea of being confined to a niche product category has never stopped Samsung from bringing a product to the market. The history of mobile computing is littered with such devices – small computers that magically transformed into larger ones with the help of a docking companion. And all have suffered a similar fate, courtesy of a limited market. Though in the best known case of the Palm Foleo, the project was simply scrapped before it started. A few months after it was announced, the miniature Treo-connected notebook was shelved as the company opted to focus on “core devices.” Perhaps that one had a fighting chance, given the netbook craze that would spring to life a few months later. Though Palm, it seemed, was ultimately doomed in this post-iPhone world. But hey, now we have webOS on smart refrigerators, so win-win. Or hey, what about the Motorola Atrix or the Asus PadFone? Microsoft pushed a docking station with the Microsoft Lumia 950. And odds are pretty good you’ve just altogether forgotten the Celio Redfly. But history has not. They all seemed like fun and interesting devices on release, but all suffered similar fates. And in a time when we’re all backed up and synced to the cloud, it’s hard to say precisely what benefit we’d get from a docking station for a specific line of devices. But hey, it’s there if you need it. Godspeed, Samsung DeX. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Samsung Electronics Founded 1969 Overview Samsung Electronics is a South Korean multinational electronics company engaged in consumer electronics, information technology and mobile communications, and device solutions businesses worldwide.

Samsung’s Bixby lays the groundwork for the company’s smart home play Posted Mar 29, 2017 by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story Samsung adds a controller to the Gear VR, will bundle both with Galaxy S8 pre-orders The Galaxy S8’s main selling point still isn’t fully formed. Announced the week leading up to today’s main event, Bixby is as much a key building block for the company moving forward as it is a shiny new piece of a flagship phone. The company is finally ready to make its play for the smart home, and the new messenger is going to be a key component. Consider this: The company hasn’t been nearly as aggressive in its bid to provide a unifying presence for connected-home devices. Sure, the company picked up SmartThings back in 2014, but the Kickstarter-funded company hasn’t promoted the technology with the same push as Amazon’s Echo or Apple’s HomeKit, even as interest in the technology has skyrocket. Strange, given the fact that it has the pieces to make a uniquely appealing play in a sea of like-minded solutions. After all, Samsung’s got something that Apple, Google and Amazon don’t: its own line of connected-home devices, from smart fridges to robotic vacuums. This week at Unpacked, the company is showcasing some key steps toward unification. In discussing the unveiling, the company has made mention of its “overall ecosystem strategy,” tied together through Bixby Home. The assistant will provide a centralized location akin to Apple Home, wherein users can control and monitor connected devices and set automated multiple smart home behaviors based on things like user proximity or time of day, similar to what Apple offers with Scenes. It’s clear, of course, that the Galaxy S8 is just the first step in Bixby’s growth. It likely won’t be long before the assistant rolls out to the rest of the company’s myriad device categories, starting with the a new router that was also announced at today’s event. Samsung’s growing home router play (which includes a number of 5G devices unveiled at MWC), is one speaker and integrated smart assistant away from taking on Echo and Google Home. Don’t be surprised if the company launches one of these devices by year’s end. Even if Samsung for some reason fails to make good on that promise, the company again has plenty of devices in the wild to lean on. Apple has already made it clear that the Apple TV is going to be a centerpiece of the company’s connected-home strategy. In lieu of a low-priced Echo-like device, the set-top box is the closest the company has to an always-on connect product that can serve as a smart-home hub. Samsung, for its part, has already announced that it’s going all-in on connected sets, giving all sets some level of smartness, moving forward. That’s a tremendous potential install base for the company. Pair that with all of the company’s connected washers and driers, refrigerators and the like, and we’re talking a large population of users who may have already opted into the company’s larger smart-home play without knowing it. It’s for this reason Samsung’s decision to build its own Smart Assistant makes perfect sense. Sure, on mobile Bixby feels like another me-too play as Siri and Alexa are already battling it out for Android users, but Samsung’s move is much larger, and like Amazon’s low-cost Echo, the company has been laying the groundwork all along. That means that, while Bixby is late to the party, adoption should be simple for anyone with a Galaxy device and connected Samsung home product. The company has been laying the groundwork for a larger product ecosystem, and if things go according to plan, the company’s new home assistant will be the thing that connects those dots. Of course, Bixby has to actually make it out into the world. And like Google’s Assistant, the platform’s success will depend in part on how many mobile devices it makes it on to. It was Google’s somewhat delayed roll out that helped open the door for Amazon’s Alexa play on mobile. The S8 and S8+ will launch with the virtual assistant, and certainly the next Note device and any flagship tablets from the company. But in order to make Bixby the ubiquitous language the company is hoping for, it’s going to have to extend beyond even Samsung devices. The company will need to bring its assistant to the Google Play — and dare I say it — Apple App stores. One of the key problems these assistants are working to solve is the creation of a unified, cross-device hub, rather than separate logins for each individual smart-home component. As such, the company will need to ensure that Bixby is integrated with as many devices as possible. The company’s stated third-party support for apps will be a big piece of that puzzle, but opening up the assistant to more mobile platforms will be a solid way to help loop people in to the assistant and overcome the company’s late start to the party. Still, the company will, at the very least, have a unique entry into the ever-escalating fight for the smart home. Like Apple, Amazon and Google, the company has found its own way into the space. And in some respects, Samsung may actually have the strongest potential foundation for a killer smart-home play, between Smart Things and a wide range of connected home appliances. Bixby might be hampered by a late arrival out of the gate, but if the company plays its cards right and delivers some truly seamless integration across devices, it may have hope for uniting the smart home after all. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Samsung Electronics Founded 1969 Overview Samsung Electronics is a South Korean multinational electronics company engaged in consumer electronics, information technology and mobile communications, and device solutions businesses worldwide.

Ciara Lee reports. Video Transcript A bite size victory... in a global fight. Apple has won its bid to stop banks from introducing their own contactless payment services on its devices in Australia. The decision by Australia's competition watchdog, the first of its kind, will stop the banks from introducing their own mobile applications on iPhones and Apple Watches. The banks had hoped to avoid transaction fees and get customers to engage more frequently with their own apps. And that would have been lucrative. Australia's contactless payment market is worth an estimated $84 billion a year. The banks involved - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac, National Australia Bank and Bendigo & Adelaide Bank- have yet to allow use of their cards with Apple Pay. A win for them would have given them more negotiating power. A loss, making them potentially vulnerable to higher Apple fees. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CMC MARKETS, MARKET ANALYST, MICHAEL HEWSON, SAYING: "Ultimately these four banks, by adopting a court case against Apple, could well find that it actually becomes more expensive for them to actually gain access to Apple's devices. So I think on a long-term basis, this is probably good for Apple, probably not so good for the Australian Banks in the short term." A win might also have sparked similar appeals for access to Apple's systems in other parts of the world. Apple does not allow any of its 3,500 bank partners in 15 global markets access to the technology behind its payment system.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 April 2017 by Military News Apple Makes a Smart Move to Expand in This Huge Market Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has made headlines this year for a flurry efforts to tap the potentially fertile Indian smartphone market. Earlier in 2017, Cupertino executives reportedly met with Indian government officials to discuss duty concessions that would allow it to set up local iPhone assembly operations, followed by reports that it will start manufacturing the iPhone SE there in April. These moves make it clear that it has set into motion a chain of events to make a dent in this market, where annual smartphone sales could double to 200 million by 2020, according to Euromonitor International. It’s no surprise that the latest Apple/India news is that the company has decided to aggressively expand its retail presence to grab a larger slice of India’s smartphone market. The Economic Times reports that Apple has set up „over 100” franchised stores in India and is looking at a big expansion of that number. Why Apple needs a stronger retail presence in India Apple’s global popularity hasn’t penetrated the Indian market, with Morgan Stanley in May of last year putting its brand awareness at a distant 10th position in India. The Cupertino-based smartphone giant trailed even BlackBerry , Sony , and domestic smartphone manufacturers in terms of popularity. Samsung reportedly became India’s largest single-brand retailer, with more than 2,100 stores, in 2015, and it has continued its expansion. Its service network now covers over 6,000 districts across 29 states, giving it an edge over the likes of Apple when it comes to after-sales service. What’s more, even China’s Oppo was ahead of Apple in terms of smartphone sales by value, with an estimated 8% of the market in August 2016 as compared to the iPhone maker’s 5.6%, driven by an aggressive offline sales strategy. The Chinese smartphone company aims to open 35,000 points of sale in India, along with 180 service centers. It has brought famous film stars on board, and has sponsored widely watched sports tournaments to push its brand in the Indian market and grow sales. The good news is that Apple is now taking a leaf from its competitors’ playbook. An Economic Times report says that the iPhone maker has set up around 100 small stores in India based on a franchise model. These stores will be branded as „Apple Authorized Resellers” and will be 450 to 500 square feet in size, according to the publication. What’s more, Apple is reportedly planning a sixfold expansion of these outlets next year in a bid to shore up its retail presence in the country. This is a smart thing to do, considering the progress that its rivals have made with their offline sales channels. Additionally, CEO Tim Cook believes that opening company-owned stores will be Apple’s long-term play in this market, and could help enhance the company’s brand. Another potential catalyst Apple will need to make its phones more affordable to drive popularity in India, making the iPhone SE one of its most important models for this market. The iPhone SE was recently retailing for as low as INR 19,999 (approximately $306 at the current exchange rate) for the 16 GB variant, putting the device in the mid-range segment of the market. This price included a limited-time, cash-back offer that was available to some purchasers. It looks as if Apple is clearing its iPhone SE inventory before an expected production ramp-up of the device in India. Image source: Apple. Mid-range smartphone sales are growing at a fast clip in India, along with a rise in the average selling price. The latest data from CyberMedia Research indicates that the average selling price of a smartphone in India rose 25% year over year in the first quarter of 2016, thanks to increasing demand for features and quality. Apple’s strategy of offering a sub-$400 smartphone through the offline channel clearly indicates that it is trying to drive foot traffic into its stores. It can then work its way up the value chain in the Indian market, as smartphone sales rise and consumer spending grows , paving the way for stronger revenue from this emerging market. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 April 2017 by Military News 3 Top Apple Suppliers to Buy in 2017 Strong earnings growth and the dominance of the iPhone, which more than 700 million consumers use worldwide, have combined to help Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)  stock rise more than 900% in the past decade. Apple is the largest company to trade on any U.S. stock exchange by market cap, and it has by far the most cash of any public company. It’s using that cash pile to make huge investments in research and development. But we’re not going to talk here about Apple. I want to focus instead on what companies have been benefiting from Apple’s success as they help supply the parts and services necessary for Apple’s continued growth. Here, then, are three key Apple suppliers that could also make top stocks for 2017. Image source: Apple. Micron Technology Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU)  is a semiconductor manufacturer that makes products for computers, consumer electronics, the automotive industry, industrial applications, and more. The company supplies the internal processing power of iPhones and other Apple products. Micron’s stock was a great performer in 2016, gaining more than 50% during the year, and looks on track to continue gaining in 2017. Micron’s NAND products, which are advanced rewritable memory devices, seem to have huge potential as cloud computing continues to grow, which could help to diversify and grow sales in the coming quarters. In its most recent quarter, Micron’s sales rose 58% year over year. The company does face some risks, including an increasing threat from major players in the field, including Intel . It also faces volatility in the prices for its products, the same thing that’s sent the stock tumbling in the past. In addition, Micron’s CEO recently announced his retirement, and so far a replacement hasn’t been named. It should also be noted that Micron stock is still off its November 2014 high, which was followed by more than a 70% drop over the next 18 months. Still, analysts expect Micron’s earnings to continue growing quickly, and the stock price looks attractive at less than 6 times forward earnings estimates. Texas Instruments Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN)  is an advanced semiconductor maker that makes chips and processors, including various components of Apple’s iPhone and iPad. The company recently got a major operational boost when it moved to a new type of chip for one of its main products that reduced production costs significantly — as much as 40%. For the full year of 2016, sales rose only about 3%, but earnings per share grew nearly 24%. The company showed strong momentum within its auto and industrial segments, two areas the company has been investing heavily in, and which seems to be paying off now. Sales are climbing faster now than they did in 2016, and management has guided for Q1 sales of as much as $3.43 billion, compared with $3 billion during the prior-year period. As for the stock’s valuation, it looks relatively cheap in its industry, trading at just 23 times earnings. It also comes with a nice 2.5% yield that’s grown very consistently over the past decade and is likely to continue growing, as the company has a payout ratio of less than 50% and strong cash flow. The progression of iPhone generations. The iPhone 8 is expected in fall 2017. Image source: Apple. Broadcom Last, but certainly not least, is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , which, following the 2016 merger with fellow semiconductor behemoth Avago, is a $94 billion company by market cap. Broadcom is a major supplier of wireless chips used in the iPhone, and there’s been speculation lately that Broadcom and Apple are working together on wireless-charging technology that could be in the iPhone 8, expected to be released later this year. That would be a major positive development for both companies. Thanks to the merger, Broadcom’s 2017 sales are likely to grow substantially from last year, but expect that growth to continue as the company expands its market share. The company’s long-term earnings growth potential looks even better, as it’s expected to grow around 15% annually over the next five years. While the stock looks expensive because of the cost of the acquisition, it’s trading at just 14 times forward earnings estimates, and it also pays a 2% dividend yield. Is it a good idea to invest in companies that might ride Apple’s coattails, or is it better to just invest in Apple itself? That’s a fair question, as Apple already looks like one of the best stocks to own in 2017 , and betting on its suppliers has been a gamble in years past. Apple has a history of squeezing suppliers on prices to protect its own margin, while new entrants in the chip space have left some companies with questionable growth prospects. However, each of the companies we’ve looked at have many more buyers than just Apple, and each also has its own unique growth prospects. Therefore, it wouldn’t be a bad strategy to consider both Apple and these suppliers as good stocks to own going forward. 10 stocks we like better than Texas Instruments When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Originally introduced as a feature exclusive to the iPad Pro, Apple boasts that the technology takes advantage of four-channel ambient light sensors “to automatically adapt the color and intensity of the display to match the light in your environment.” The end result is a display with more natural color tones, making for a more comfortable viewing experience in the process. Don't Miss: Using my iPhone for the next six months is really, really going to suck Barclays’ research note, originally obtained via MacRumors, reads in part: For the expected iPhone 7S models, as well as the iPhone 8, we think ams’s content increases due to the inclusion of its full spectral sensing ambient light sensor, as already seen in the iPad Pro for that device’s True Color screen functionality. We estimate this to be a material step-up in content from the $0.60 range to $1.00. Coupled with the edge to edge OLED display that will reportedly grace the iPhone 8, Apple’s flagship iPhone 8 this year will assuredly boast the most advanced display we’ve seen to date from Apple’s venerable iPhone. All the same, don’t expect the iPhone 8 to feature a curved display a’la the Samsung Galaxy S8. As we noted earlier today, Apple’s next-gen iPhone may feature a slight curve but won’t come close to matching what Samsung pulled off with its S8 lineup. Display technology aside, Apple’s iPhone 8 is shaping up to be a monster of a device that will undoubtedly usher in the most dramatic iPhone upgrade cycle we’ve seen to date. Some of the device’s rumored features include wireless charging, a blazing fast A11 processor, improved water and dust resistance, and much improved battery life. What’s more, the iPhone 8 will reportedly include a number of advanced 3D cameras that will presumably be used for facial recognition and augmented reality purposes. As far as storage is concerned, Apple with the iPhone 8 will finally start giving users more bang for their buck with 64GB said to be the storage option on the entry level model.

The event — scheduled for 4:30 p.m. Monday — will serve as a meet-and-greet for prospective students, who will have a chance to mingle with the center’s new piano, vocal and guitar instructors, as well as Apple Valley Mayor Scott Nassif. Co-owner Linda Hanley said until the expansion, the performing arts aspect of A Dancer’s Pointe was geared solely toward dance. “We eventually wanted it to become a performing arts center,” Hanley told the Daily Press, “and now we’re hoping our studio will foster all the arts in the High Desert.” Hanley and fellow co-owner Pam Cambridge worked for the previous owner until they purchased the center in 1999, and now — with the recent expansion into the suite adjacent to the dance studio — they’re excited for the new classes that will bolster the center’s artistic offerings. “With dance, I love to give back to the community,” Hanley said. “Now we’re doing it again with music. When children have something the love, it builds passion and that translates to their studies. And music can turn a bad day into a happy one.” Hanley’s husband, Thomas, worked for two months to renovate the suite formerly occupied by CCE Guns & Accessories. He constructed new walls and soundproofed three new rooms to personalize the students’ experience during lessons with instructors who will offer flexible schedules. Linda Hanley started playing music when she was 8 and believes the power of music exists everywhere. “My generation started young,” she said. “It was a big deal. We need to foster that more. I’m really big on Apple Valley and it’s great to give back to the community like this.” A Dancer’s Pointe Performing Arts Center is located at 18355 Highway 18.

Search Reviews iPhone Android How To Reviews iPhone How To Auto About Best Best Weight Loss Apps Best iPhone 7 Cases Best Budget Apps Things Apple Watch Can Do Best Alexa Skills Android Galaxy S7 Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Cases Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Deals Best Galaxy S7 Battery Cases Best Galaxy S7 Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Cases Deals Best Android Smartphones Under $200 [2017] Best Cheap Android Smartphones [2017] 9 Things to Know About the iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 Update Adam Mills03/31/2017 The iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 update is now available and today we take a look the most important things to know about the iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 update and its performance as we push into the month of April. The iPhone 5 is getting older which puts a greater importance on each update Apple releases for the former flagship. iOS updates for older devices can have a dramatic impact on performance. Sometimes its positive. Sometimes, unfortunately, its negative. Apple’s latest update to the iPhone 5 is a huge milestone upgrade. Its much larger than the iOS 10.2.1 update that came before it. If you’re making the move to iOS 10.3 from the iOS 10.2.1 update, your iOS 10.3 update will be substantial, several hundred megabytes. If you’re coming from something older than iOS 10.2.1 you can expect your update to be even bigger thanks to the features and fixes from previous iOS upgrades. They are baked into the iPhone 5’s iOS 10.3 update. This roundup will take you through our impressions of the iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 update’s performance and it will guide you through some of the key things to keep in mind as we push toward Apple’s next iOS 10 release. We’ll continue to update this roundup with new details as we get them so keep an eye out for frequent changes. iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 Update: Impressions & Performance   1 / 9 The iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 update is a big one and it'll only take you some time to download and install. It took us about seven minutes to download the update over a fast Wi-Fi speed network. It took a lot longer to install. Due to the file system change and the other features on board iOS 10.3, the iPhone 5's new software update took upwards of 15 minutes to install on our device. That's abnormal for an iOS update and it means you'll need to pay extra attention to the installation process.  We recommend setting aside 30 quiet minutes where you can monitor both the download and installation without distractions. Moving onto the update's performance.  We've been using the iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 update for a few days now and the update has been pretty impressive. We're using an aging AT&T model.  The iPhone 5's battery continues to work miracles. We haven't noticed any abnormal battery drain during our time with iOS 10.3 though that could certainly change down the road. If you do notice weird battery drain, take a look at our list of tips. Chances are, it's not iOS 10.3 causing the problems. We've tested the iPhone 5 and its new update with several different ISPs, routers and Bluetooth devices. We haven't noticed any major issues during our time with the upgrade. AT&T's LTE and 4G networks are working fine as well.  Random reboots were an issue for us on iOS 10.2 but we haven't noticed any during our time on iOS 10.3. That's a big improvement, for us at least.  The most noticeable change, outside of the new features, is to the speed of the device's user interface. Animations and transitions are fast and fluid and we haven't experienced any lag when opening up Control Center.  We also haven't noticed any lag when opening up and closing folders, something we did see on iOS 10.2.1. The movement is crisp. There's still some jaggedness when opening up some apps but hey, this phone is going on five years old. If you're already on iOS 10.2.1, iOS 10.3's features, fixes and security patches definitely make it worth a look. You could also see a boost to your device's performance.  If you're on something older than the iOS 10.2.1 update, make sure you dig into more feedback before you make the jump to iOS 10.3.  For more on the merits of iOS 10.3, see our list of reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3 update on your iPhone.   1 / 9 6 Responses 12/19/2016 Facebook lite apk Reply i like ios 10.2 more than 10.1. power berry slow lost 02/24/2017 Kent Reply After installing 10.2.1 on my iPhone 5s I started getting random reboots. At least 10 per day. If plugged into the charger, the reboots seemed to go away. 02/27/2017 Jarvis Reply Hi guys, I am using iPhone 5s with ios 9.3.3. I am getting reminders to update to whitetail 10.2.1 I’m not sure though, if I should go for an update or not since Internet is poisoned about 30% battery bug in ios 10. I’m new to iPhone, have almost no past experience of ios. As of now I am pretty satisfied with ios 9.3.3 just sometimes it becomes difficult to click on( x) while trying to close search box with some other minor hiccups, don’t know if it’s a software issue or hardware on my device. I’m kinda liking the health app. Although it is not measuring the floors climbed while it’s counting the steps taken. I am told it will count the floors climbed after I updated to 10.2.1 which kind of sounds weird. Please suggest me the right course of action. By the way what’s Jailbreak? Hoping to hear from you soon. 03/03/2017 Natasha Reply Updated to 10.2.1 yesterday and my phone wont start at all and has been at the Apple logo + loading bar screen for over 24 hours. :( 03/21/2017 Simone Reply I’ve been using iOS 10.2.1 on my iPhone 5c and I’m having really abnormal battery life it’s chargimg really fast and then when I use it for about 10 minutes it’ll go down by 20% I’ve restated and rebooted my phone but my battery life is still really abnormal please fix this 04/01/2017 Rick Devereux Reply I’m wondering if the disappearance of my toolkit with calculaor, flashlight, etc that used appear on first opening with an UP Slide before entering passcode had anything to do with the 10.2.1 software? The only thing I get now when I Up Slide on opening is a Music tool that does absolutely nothing for me as I don’t keep music on this phone. I can’t get rid of it no matter what I try, and I don’t know where to find the calculator, flashlight etc. I feel like I Apple just took my Swiss Army knife. grrr.

This tenth anniversary device will have to answer to a Galaxy S8 release that has delivered arguably the most innovative package that Samsung has ever produced. Thus, it is not surprising that rumors about this critical hardware release are already multiplying rapidly. Ultrasonic sensor The Galaxy S8 is notable for its radical design, and a new patent suggests that Apple may also introduce innovative new features into the iPhone 8. The document indicates that Apple is considering replacing the Touch ID system with an ultrasonic sensor, which will deliver two main advantages over the existing system. cicwdn / Pixabay Apple firstly suggests that the new technology would be unaffected by contaminants such as greece, lotion, and sweat. This is naturally a massive problem; who hasn’t attempted to utilize their iPhone on a crowded beach having applied sunscreen and encountered difficulties? The second advantage, as the consumer electronics giant sees it, is that the new technology will no longer struggle with too much or too little pressure influencing the quality of fingerprinting garnered. There is no news on where this technology could be manufactured for the iPhone 8, but it is possible that Apple could recruit Qualcomm in order to deliver this. Ceramic design Other reports this week suggest that there will be a third iPhone 8 unit released by Apple later this year. This would be a landmark in the iPhone range, as the Californian corporation has never previously released three handsets simultaneously. And the latest leaks suggest that this third iPhone device could actually be ceramic, at least if a report authored by Fast Company is to be believed. This ceramic device would cost in excess of $1,000, with Fast Company describing it as “something like a smooth black monolith, with few visual interruptions to its sleek design”. There still seems to be some disagreement over whether or not all models in the iPhone 8 series will benefit from OLED technology, or whether it will merely be the premium version. But there is broad agreement that this third version of the iPhone 8 will indeed diverge from LCD. Japanese website Mac Otakara is one of the sources suggesting that the most premium and newest features in the iPhone 8 will only be applied to a new version. The East Asian source suggests that this smartphone will be branded as the iPhone 8 Edition, just as Apple released a premium Apple Watch Edition previously. However, this publication also explodes the idea that Apple will release three models simultaneously, instead suggesting that the iPhone edition could be released several months after the standard iPhone 8 handset. 3D sensing linked Elsewhere, rumors of 3D sensing features being included in the next generation of iPhone continue to accelerate. Taiwanese Himax Technologies has reportedly been recruited by Apple in order to form part of the supply chain for the iPhone 8, with the company responsible for providing glass for a module constructed by Lumentum. It is believed that Lumentum, a component supplier, will provide the 3D sensing models to be utilized in the iPhone 8, with the front camera then delivering both 3D sensing and 3D modelling capabilities. Facial recognition will be a natural fit for this technology, while augmented reality and virtual reality functions will also likely feature. Tim Cook has previously spoken of the potential of augmented reality for the iPhone range. According to Digitimes, the module being developed will use technology known as vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser-based DOE (diffractive optical elements). A bit of a mouthful, I’m sure you’d agree! Chip-on-glass construction will also be utilized, with Himax and ChipMOS also involved in the process. This latest report is rather timely, as it follows on the back of Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan writing on the possibility of Himax being involved in the Apple supply chain for the iPhone 8. Other reports suggest that innovative technology developed by the company has the ability to reduce the size of 3D sensing components, making them more suitable for mobile products. Wraparound display Following on from the release of the Galaxy S8, it know seems extremely unlikely that the iPhone 8 will feature a similar wraparound display. Infamous Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously indicated his belief that the forthcoming Apple mobile will feature an edge-to-edge screen, enabling the Cupertino-based manufacturer to slim down the bezels included in the iPhone 8 significantly. Kuo also believes that Apple will be increasing the screen size of the iPhone 8 to approximately 5.8-inches, which would make perfect sense after Samsung showed off its latest 5.8-inch S8 release. If Apple does indeed release three models of the iPhone 8 in September, it is likely that the other two releases will retain the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays used in previous iPhone series. There is no word on branding as of yet, but these could also be named differently to the iPhone 8 module, possibly as the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. Wireless charging There is also good reason to believe that Apple will include wireless charging technology in the iPhone 8. One interesting morsel of information that has slid under the radar to some extent was the Californian corporation joining the Wireless Power Consortium just weeks ago. This organisation is responsible for overseeing standards involved with wireless charging technology, indicating that Apple may be about to produce devices that can be charged wirelessly for the first time. Meanwhile, although Apple is expected to embrace curved screen technology in the iPhone 8 generation, its approach may be slightly different to its Korean rival. JP Morgan analyst Rod Hall suggests that the screen in the tenth anniversary iPhone will be slightly less curved that the Galaxy S8, with Hall writing that “current indications are for less use of curved OLED which may result in a slightly less ‘infinity’ screen form factor.” UPDATE: 03-24-2017: We are well accustomed by now to seeing huge queues for new iPhone releases. And this may be even more prominent with the release of the iPhone 8, following news which has emerged this week. Paltry stock Three iPhone releases are expected in September, with the iPhone 8 been accompanied by two iPhone 7S models. But a new report suggests that the initial stock of the iPhone 8 will be so minimal that consumers can expect it to sell out almost immediately once preorders begin. It is noted that production for certain components to be utilized in the iPhone 8 can only commence in the third quarter, suggesting that Apple is likely to have enough stock to meet demand when the device launches. Image Source: iphone8plus.com This prediction is contained in a major new research note from the investment bank Barclays. It suggests that the majority of iPhone 8 stock may not be available until later in Q4. “Suppliers generally had good things to say about the upcoming iPhone 8 launch (for our purposes iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone Pro) as new features drive a more complicated manufacturing process and higher 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  - View Full Page Tags: Apple iPhone 8 Load Comments Send us your tips at tips(at)valuewalk.com Latest News From ValueWalk Healthy Gains Reported for Pension Returns at NJ State Investment Council Meeting Commerce Secretary Ross: We’ve been in a trade war for a long time Q1 2017 Letters Billionaire Phil Knight: Creating Nike Copyright © 2016 ValueWalk - Privacy Policy Follow Us: Developed by ValueWalk Team Sponsored Content - Resource Center

As MacRumors has covered over the past few years, tech companies love to prank their customers with silly products, out-there announcements, and largely weird press releases meant to highlight the jovial holiday. April 1, 2017 also marks the 41st anniversary of Apple, with Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne having solidified their partnership on this day all those years ago in 1976. Now, Apple itself has become a major target for April Fools' Day pranks, as well as various other companies, apps, services, and accessory makers that are well-known by Apple users. We have collected some of the more interesting hoaxes and jokes into a list below, but remember that some contain mildly NSFW content and language, so you may want to use headphones or watch the videos in a private location. -Siri-Siri is recognizing April Fools' Day in some of its responses today, including refusing to flip a coin upon request.-iFixit's Micro Tech Toolkit-iFixit has announced an all-new toolkit that it says is aimed at the smallest devices on the market, including the Apple Watch and AirPods. The $19.95 Micro Tech Toolkit comes with a magnetized driver handle, easy-to-open tool roll, micro pliers, micro spudger, an iFixit micro opening tool, and three precision bits. Thanks to the vast array of tools being sold on iFixit's online store, the Micro Tech Toolkit is at first a somewhat believable offering from the teardown site. For anyone not yet convinced of its status as an April Fools' Day prank, however, the accompanying launch video has testimony from iFixit's Micro Tech Tool Expert -- Howard the Hamster. Additionally, one repair story on the toolkit's storefront written by Ralph the Mouse appears to be a reference to Beverly Cleary's popular children's book The Mouse and the Motorcycle. -Ms. Pac-Man in Google Maps-Beginning yesterday, users discovered that Google has added a functioning version of the classic video game Ms. Pac-Man directly into its iOS Google Maps app. You can now control Ms. Pac-Man and hunt for ghosts and pellets in a re-skin of the game that turns the streets of your local neighborhood into a maze of Ms. Pac-Man corridors.-Netflix Live-Netflix launched an all-new streaming show it's calling "Netflix Live," allowing customers to receive fascinating tidbits of information about copiers, toasters, and pencil sharpeners from actor Will Arnett. The popular streaming company claims that the "live" show is a new addition to its ever-growing stable of original content, but -- as many have figured out since yesterday -- it's yet another one of Netflix's April Fools' Day pranks. For the morbidly curious, you can watch the 48-minute, not-actually-live burrito commentary series right now on the Netflix streaming device of your choice. If it's anything like last year's John Stamos: A Human, Being "documentary," it probably won't be on the service for long. -AirRings-Twelve South has revealed "AirRings," which the company says will let you "effortlessly transform your AirPods into earrings." AirRings come in different styles for both men and women, including cuffs, bands and drop style earrings, so you can listen to your music on AirPods without sacrificing your style. -USB-Speed of Light by Moshi-If you're tired of the confusing array of USB-Type A and USB-Type C cables, Moshi today announced the one USB solution to end them all: USB-Speed of Light (USB-SL for short). The accessory manufacturer calls USB-SL "the next-next-generation in charging and connectivity," and should top off your MacBook Pro in mere seconds. With the additional USB-SL to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter "the future is truly and literally at your fingertips," providing an internet connection so fast you can catch up on your email and other notifications that have yet to arrive. Similarly, the USB-SL to HDMI Adapter provides the ultimate, crystal clear video experience "from any point in time." -Other Pranks, Jokes, and Hoaxes:- · The T-Mobile ONEsie - a full-body wearable that provides truly unlimited coverage · Google Gnome - a lawn gnome version of Google Home · Petlexa - Amazon Echo's Alexa now understands your pets We'll update this post throughout April Fools' Day in the event that any new pranks surface.Tag: April Fools' Day Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Entertainment - 2 days ago< > Embed April Fools' Day Early Burger King Toothpaste 00:40 Burger King France got an early start to April Fools' by posting a video Wednesday advertising Whopper toothpaste.

Siri isn’t just about voice control. Apple uses Siri as the predictive engine behind apps in the Today screen and Apple is already using prediction in Messages with the QuickType keyboard that is able to pick up on your conversation style and offer up responses based on the conversation you are having. With iOS 11, you may see Siri come to new places on your phone and across your devices to make it easier to get things done. Expect to learn about iOS 11 in June and see it alongside an iPhone 8 in the fall. A major iOS 11 feature could upgrade Siri. A new report from The Verifier, outlines Apple’s rumored plans to add Siri to iMessage and iCloud. This would bridge the gap between your devices and allow Siri to be more useful on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. This new Siri iOS 11 feature could show up in iMessage to help you find answers to questions happening in the conversation. This could be about where to get lunch and then how to get there or a million other possibilities. With iMessage apps and Siri third-party access, this feature seems ready for introduction. Apple already holds a patent Siri in iMessage, which adds to the potential for this to come out this fall. With Siri iCloud integration you could see the predictive abilities of Siri that show you apps you might need on the Today screen expand to cover all of your devices. The report suggests that this will connect with the Mac and iOS devices to deliver actions . and suggestions no matter which device you use. Apple already uses Siri for predictive purposes. Apple added Siri to the Mac with macOS Sierra last fall and the company is already syncing tabs, documents, preferences and even AirPod connectivity across devices. Samsung is going big with a better personal assistant called Bixby on the Galaxy S8 and Google is now available on most Android phones. As Google and Amazon both take over your home with Google Home and the Echo with Alexa, Apple may be planning a takeover with new Siri integrations that sync between all of your devices. 8 iPhone 8 Features We Want in 2017 New iPhone 8 Design to Enable Features   1 / 8 Everyone wants a new iPhone 8 design, but most people don't know what changes they actually want. We're leading off our iPhone 8 feature wishlist with a new iPhone 8 design because it is a key part of enabling new iPhone 8 features. After sticking with a very similar design for three years there is an expectation of major changes for the 2017 iPhone and here are the things we would love to see Apple do with a new design. Shrink the overall size of the iPhone 8 Plus without lowering the screen size. Apple could do this by shrinking the bezels on the sides and bottom of the iPhone some to offer a smaller overall package. Apple could choose to change where you use Touch ID and how the home button works in new ways to make this happen. We definitely don't want a phone that is slim just to be slim, especially not at the price of battery life, but there is something to be said about an iPhone 8 design that trims some fat. The Jet Black iPhone 7 feels different than all the other colors. While it is more susceptible to scratches it is easier to grip, which is something we can definitely see Apple add to the new iPhone 8. KGI Securities Analyst Ming-Chi Kou predicts the iPhone 8 design will look include an all glass front and back with stainless steel metal on the edges of premium models. This could come together for an iPhone 8 design that looks like a cross between the iPhone 4s and the Jet Black iPhone 7.   1 / 8 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

By 2017-04-02 BBC: Apple has won a major regulatory battle in Australia that will likely see it retain control of its contactless payment technology. Four banks had wanted to negotiate with Apple to gain access to its payments technology for their own apps, avoiding having to pay fees to Apple. But the country's competition watchdog has now barred them from collectively bargaining with Apple. The decision is the first of its kind and could set a global precedent. In its final ruling on the case on Friday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said that the collective threat to boycott Apple was "likely to reduce or distort competition". What did the banks want? They wanted their own apps to have access to the contactless payment technology used in iPhones. The near field communication (NFC) system allows users to settle bills by holding their phone to a small terminal, with the money deducted from a bank card registered with Apple Pay. Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank and Bendigo & Adelaide Bank together command around two-thirds of Australia's credit card market. But so far, they do not allow their cards to be used with Apple Pay because they have never reached agreement on the conditions. Why did they want to bargain collectively? Doing so would have put them in a much stronger position against Apple. They wanted to convey to Apple that unless it gave them access to its iPhone technology, they would continue to prevent their customers from using Apple Pay. Apple Pay collects a fee from the bank for each transaction, meaning Apple risked a significant loss. But the commission said that ruling in favour of the banks would have reduced competition by forcing Apple to act more like Google, who's more open Android operating system allows contactless payments from individual apps. "It is a tricky issue for a competition regulator to force one competitor to adopt a strategy of the other competitor," ACCC Chairman Rod Sims explained. A big victory for Apple? It certainly looks like it. They can still negotiate with Apple individually, but with much less bargaining power than they had hoped for. If a single bank blocks its customers from using Apple Pay, it might well be the bank that loses out. Customers could be unhappy about being left out and switch to another bank. In fact, some of the other Australian banks that do allow their cards to be uses for payment via Apple have seen an increase in customers since the gridlock between Apple and that group of four. Representative for the banks said they were "disappointed" by the decision and would review their future strategies.

There is a fissure growing between European and US attitudes towards these global super-platforms – “the Gafa” as Brussels calls them (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) – and the UK will soon need to decide on which side it sits. Will we continue to let these corporations and their services grow unchecked? Will we try to challenge their dominance and impose obligations on them? Or will we “take back control” and find a third way? The approach we take to Google, Facebook and their Silicon Valley peers will affect us all. Who can honestly say that they go through a day without using one of these companies’ services? We wake to their alarms on our phones; we check our emails on their platforms; we do our shopping on their browsers; we navigate by their maps; they host our virtual identities. What we do about them is not just an economic or competition question, nor simply about privacy – important though these aspects are. It is a question about what sort of society we want and what sort of politics. It is a question that will help define the type of country we live in, post Brexit. This is because these tech superpowers are playing an increasing number of civic roles in our lives that affect our ability to participate in society and to communicate freely. With these civic roles they gain civic powers. This includes the power to communicate news, the power to enable collective action and the power to influence how we vote. How did you find this article? Maybe you are reading it in a printed version of the Observer. If so, you are in a minority. Perhaps you found it at theguardian.com. Or maybe, like more and more of us, you came to it via Facebook, Twitter, Google News, or another social media platform. More than half of us now use social media as a regular source of news. Newspapers are losing their role as editors and gatekeepers. On Facebook, for example, the news agenda is not set by an editor, but by an algorithm. The implications are profound. The brave new world of platform news is one of DIY news. It is a world in which we – the user – produce, publish and promote the news ourselves. It is a world in which we rely on our peers and on those we follow to discover stories. It is one in which we verify news rather than relying on established news organisations and journalists to do it for us. For some, this is an exciting, democratised new digital world. For others, it sounds exhausting, chaotic – a world of fake news and filter bubbles. As well as relying on the tech giants for our news, we are using them to organise ourselves. This includes running political campaigns, fundraising for social causes or co-ordinating collective action. It might mean as little as changing our profile picture or adding a hashtag to a tweet (#wearethe48, #brexitbritain, #remoaners). It could mean trying to save a local library or stop a bypass. Or it could mean starting a major protest movement. Wael Ghonim, who was closely involved in the Egyptian revolution of 2011, thanked Mark Zuckerberg. “This revolution started online,” he said. “This revolution started on Facebook.” Organising our political activity through these tech platforms will become the norm. For some, it has already. But are we, as a society, comfortable with this? Are we happy that they know which political causes we share or like, who we donate to, which we join, and who we are associated with? These are not public spaces, they are commercial private spaces, with their own rules and their own means of enforcing them. The tech giants’ dominance means that they are also becoming central to election and referendum campaigns. The Conservative party did not spend anything campaigning on Facebook in the run-up to the 2010 election, but in 2015 it spent more than £1.2m. “Facebook is a phenomenal campaigning platform”, said Craig Elder, who was the Conservative’s digital director during the campaign, “and we really, really exploited that”. During the referendum campaign, both the remain and leave campaigns relied heavily on the tech platforms to deliver their messages – including provocative and emotive videos. Yet, the way these platforms are being used, and the messages that are being sent through them, challenge both the principles and rules that have made British elections fair and open since the 19th century. As we spend more and more of our time using these platforms and their services, so their power grows. Those of us who use Facebook or one of its subsidiaries like Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger, now spend almost an hour a day on them. Commanding so much of our attention means that they can start to take on public functions. After the terror unleashed by Khalid Masood on 22 March, Facebook activated Safety Check, prompting those in the vicinity of Westminster to alert their network that they were safe. Facebook does the same after natural disasters. This is clearly of public benefit, but it is also the type of activity we used to associate with a public broadcaster like the BBC, rather than with a private commercial company. None of this would be such an issue were it not for the remarkable dominance of these companies. Despite their youth – established in 2004, Facebook is barely a teenager – these organisations now bestride our world like colossi. Their dominance stretches far beyond the commercial world into the political and the civic. We therefore need to decide how best to respond to them. Will Britain follow the route taken by Europe, and challenge the power of these tech superpowers? The European commission began antitrust action against Google in 2015. The German government is drafting legislation threatening fines of up to €50m if social media platforms do not remove offensive content. Will we take the laissez-faire route of the US and simply accept the dominance of these organisations as the price of a free market? Or will we find a third way, perhaps more progressive than either Europe or the US? As we untangle the Gordian knot of Brexit, Britain will need to decide.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news of the next iPhone generation using True Tone display tech. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Friday. True Tone iPhone: A new rumor claims that Apple will be using True Tone display technology in its 2017 iPhone devices, reports 9to5Mac. According to the rumor, the tech company will use the True Tone display technology in all of its 2017 smartphones coming out later this year. That includes the rumored iPhone 7s, 7s Plus and iPhone 8. AAPL was previously expected to introduce True Tone display tech in the iPhone 7 line, but didn’t. It first started using the technology with the introduction of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro last year. Retail Positions: Apple is planning to cut several retail positions from its physical stores, MacRumors notes. The company is reportedly planning to remove the “Business Manager, Business Events Lead, Events Coordinator, and Events Lead” positions. Employees in these positions started being told about the change earlier this week. They have been given the option to take a lower level job with less pay, or two months worth of severance pay. 911 Fix: Apple’s most recent update for iOS fixes an issue that could cause problems for 911 workers, reports BGR. The problem in the older version of iOS allowed a string of code to be executed that would tell an iPhone to repeatedly call 911. The problem was discovered by a teenage developer that posted the code online. He was later arrested after a flood of 911 calls hit emergency workers. The new update makes it so that users are now prompted twice before calling a number sent in a text message, which is how the exploit was executed.

We’ll let you browse its features and specs at the Verge — Dieter Bohn calls it “the nicest phone I’ve ever held” — and skip right to its most obvious trait: It just looks like a big screen. While Apple pioneered the all-screen phone concept with the first iPhone, Samsung and other companies have recently pushed it further, trimming the frame around the display so much that the forehead and chin on the new Galaxy S8 are barely there. For another example, Andy Rubin — the founder of Android, and before that one of the people behind the Sidekick phone — recently tweeted a teaser photo of another slick-looking, edge-to-edge device, presumably from the handset company he’s working on, called Essential. I'm really excited about how this is shaping up. Eager to get it in more people's hands... pic.twitter.com/LRzQCFSKTm— Andy Rubin (@Arubin) March 27, 2017 Last year, China’s Xiaomi also showed off a similar device, the Mi Mix “concept phone of your wildest dreams.” And it sounds like Apple is headed in this direction, too. Mac Rumors describes this year’s supposedly forthcoming iPhone 8 — expected sometime in the fall — as “a radical redesign, with an edge-to-edge display that does away with the top and bottom bezels where features like the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and the front-facing camera are housed.” Apple’s — if it’s real — could easily be the best of the bunch. And let’s not pretend a half-year’s head start will wildly change any broader competition between Samsung’s ecosystem and Apple’s. Buying a phone is a more complicated decision than just grabbing the one with the thinnest screen bezel. So this shouldn’t dramatically affect sales. But it’s worth noting that Apple — home of industrial-design legend Jony Ive, creator of unbelievably thin and elegant devices — will again look like it’s playing catch-up to a smartphone-design trend. Last time this happened, it was when Apple was a year or two late to the broader concept of bigger-sized phones, waiting until 2014 to ship the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which caught up to the larger screen sizes that most Android phones featured. This seems like less of a problem. Missing the boat on bigger phones suggested Apple wasn’t paying attention to what many of its current and would-be customers wanted, and that it was missing where the idea of a pocket computer was going. Apple caught up — the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were huge sellers — but it was noticeably behind the trend. This looks more like a release-timing issue, especially if Apple ships something similar this year. (If it doesn’t, that’s more concerning.) But beyond the cosmetics of looking cool and new, thinner borders also serve a functional purpose: You can fit more screen real estate — and, therefore, more space for apps, photos or videos — in a similar-sized device, which is a good thing. Samsung is offering the Galaxy S8 in 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch sizes — compared to last year’s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which is available in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sizes.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: REX/Shutterstock Trump’s Android phone has been repealed and replaced Zach Epstein @zacharye March 29th, 2017 at 9:12 AM Share Tweet Apple is a company known for many things, and class-leading gadgets is at the top of the list. The company’s iPod changed the way we listen to music, and the original iPhone turned the smartphone industry on its head, toppling giants like Nokia and BlackBerry in the process. Apple’s iPad marked the launch of a new multi-billion dollar product category, and the Apple Watch is the only smartwatch in the world that actually sells in any significant quantities. In fact, Apple is now the second largest watch maker in the world behind Rolex. Of course, Apple executives have also historically been known to make emphatic statements and then completely reverse course. “I don’t think it’s good that Apple is perceived as different; I don’t care about being different,” Apple co-founder Steve Jobs once said… just six months before the company’s famous Think Different campaign launched. And there are dozens of similar examples. Speaking of saying one thing and doing another, it looks like the president finally ditched his Android phone and switched to an iPhone. Don't Miss: Hidden changes in iOS 10.3 will give your iPhone a speed boost Just over one year ago, president Don Trump called upon all Americans to boycott Apple until the company agreed to help investigators unlock an iPhone tied to the tragedy in San Bernardino. “To think that Apple won’t allow us to get into her cellphone? Who do they think they are? No, we have to open it,” Trump said at the time, while being interviewed on Fox and Friends. “I agree 100% with the courts. In that case, we should open it up. I think security overall — we have to open it up. And we have to use our heads. We have to use common sense. Somebody the other day called me a ‘common-sense conservative.’ We have to use common sense. Our country has so many problems.” For those in need of a quick refresher, Apple refused to help unlock the phone and held firm on its stance. The company never unlocked the iPhone in question, but apparently Trump doesn’t care anymore because as of a couple of weeks ago, his Android phone has been repealed and replaced. Trump’s director of social media and senior advisor Dan Scavino Jr. confirmed the president’s change of heart in a tweet on Tuesday night. .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump has been using his new iPhone📱for the past couple of weeks here on Twitter.

Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Apr 1, 2017 at 2:10PM Strong earnings growth and the dominance of the iPhone, which more than 700 million consumers use worldwide, have combined to help Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rise more than 900% in the past decade. Apple is the largest company to trade on any U.S. stock exchange by market cap, and it has by far the most cash of any public company. It's using that cash pile to make huge investments in research and development.   But we're not going to talk here about Apple. I want to focus instead on what companies have been benefiting from Apple's success as they help supply the parts and services necessary for Apple's continued growth. Here, then, are three key Apple suppliers that could also make top stocks for 2017.   Image source: Apple. Micron Technology Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a semiconductor manufacturer that makes products for computers, consumer electronics, the automotive industry, industrial applications, and more. The company supplies the internal processing power of iPhones and other Apple products. Micron's stock was a great performer in 2016, gaining more than 50% during the year, and looks on track to continue gaining in 2017. Micron's NAND products, which are advanced rewritable memory devices, seem to have huge potential as cloud computing continues to grow, which could help to diversify and grow sales in the coming quarters. In its most recent quarter, Micron's sales rose 58% year over year.  The company does face some risks, including an increasing threat from major players in the field, including Intel. It also faces volatility in the prices for its products, the same thing that's sent the stock tumbling in the past. In addition, Micron's CEO recently announced his retirement, and so far a replacement hasn't been named. It should also be noted that Micron stock is still off its November 2014 high, which was followed by more than a 70% drop over the next 18 months. Still, analysts expect Micron's earnings to continue growing quickly, and the stock price looks attractive at less than 6 times forward earnings estimates.    Texas Instruments Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is an advanced semiconductor maker that makes chips and processors, including various components of Apple's iPhone and iPad. The company recently got a major operational boost when it moved to a new type of chip for one of its main products that reduced production costs significantly -- as much as 40%. For the full year of 2016, sales rose only about 3%, but earnings per share grew nearly 24%. The company showed strong momentum within its auto and industrial segments, two areas the company has been investing heavily in, and which seems to be paying off now. Sales are climbing faster now than they did in 2016, and management has guided for Q1 sales of as much as $3.43 billion, compared with $3 billion during the prior-year period.  As for the stock's valuation, it looks relatively cheap in its industry, trading at just 23 times earnings. It also comes with a nice 2.5% yield that's grown very consistently over the past decade and is likely to continue growing, as the company has a payout ratio of less than 50% and strong cash flow.  The progression of iPhone generations. The iPhone 8 is expected in fall 2017. Image source: Apple. Broadcom Last, but certainly not least, is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which, following the 2016 merger with fellow semiconductor behemoth Avago, is a $94 billion company by market cap. Broadcom is a major supplier of wireless chips used in the iPhone, and there's been speculation lately that Broadcom and Apple are working together on wireless-charging technology that could be in the iPhone 8, expected to be released later this year. That would be a major positive development for both companies.  Thanks to the merger, Broadcom's 2017 sales are likely to grow substantially from last year, but expect that growth to continue as the company expands its market share. The company's long-term earnings growth potential looks even better, as it's expected to grow around 15% annually over the next five years. While the stock looks expensive because of the cost of the acquisition, it's trading at just 14 times forward earnings estimates, and it also pays a 2% dividend yield. Is it a good idea to invest in companies that might ride Apple's coattails, or is it better to just invest in Apple itself? That's a fair question, as Apple already looks like one of the best stocks to own in 2017, and betting on its suppliers has been a gamble in years past. Apple has a history of squeezing suppliers on prices to protect its own margin, while new entrants in the chip space have left some companies with questionable growth prospects. However, each of the companies we've looked at have many more buyers than just Apple, and each also has its own unique growth prospects. Therefore, it wouldn't be a bad strategy to consider both Apple and these suppliers as good stocks to own going forward. Seth McNew owns shares of Apple.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Apple Hires Former YouTube and Spotify Executive Amidst of Its Focus on Video Content By Ali Salman Mar 31, 2017 14Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple is looking to bring more content to its platforms and in its efforts, the company has hired Shiva Rajaraman. The company continues to ramp up its interest and focus on video content and according to reports from The Information, the Cupertino giant has recently hired Rajaraman to work on the company’s music and video efforts. Let’s dive in to see some more details on the subject. Apple’s Interest In Video Content Grows As It Hires Google And Spotify’s Ex Executive The services sector is one of the major priorities for Apple. Rajaraman has no business in the smartphone category bit will contribute his efforts in the services sector of the company. Shiva Rajaraman is a veteran product manager who first worked at Google and then Spotify. Related SoundCloud For iOS Gains Support For Chromecast, Shared Playback And More Apple’s revenue from e-commerce or services business has recently excelled that includes the App Store, iBooks and Apple Music. According to the report, Rajaraman will report to the company’s senior vice president, Eddy Cue. While the new hiring does not point at anything in specific, it is clear that the company wants to use his expertise in the music streaming business. It is said that, over at Apple, he will work with a variety of products. Henceforth, there are still a handful of unanswered questions on the table. There are various aspects on how Apple can improve its music  streaming service and probably Rajaraman could pinch in some new ideas. Advertisement While Apple has yet to nail down its strategy for video content, there are certain disagreements among executives about the category’s long term direction. Executives have debated how to go forward in video. One idea that has been discussed is to bundle its music, news and book offerings with new video and cable services that could be activated via the iPhone and work on Internet-connected TVs. In terms of video content, the addition of Rajaraman on the team could possibly bring more clarity with respect to video content. The Cupertino tech titan was long said to be in works to develop a streaming TV package like YouTube TV or DirectTV Now. However, the company’s efforts went to waste as Apple struggled to negotiate with cable networks. Related iOS 10.3 Fixes Bug Causing iPhones To Call 911 Repeatedly If not now, the company will soon settle down on a video content approach. With all the hiring and inflow of expertise, we will see the impacts soon. There will be more to the story, so do stay tuned with us. This is it for now, folks.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Security Latest WikiLeaks Release Exposes Marble Framework, CIA’s Anti-Forensics Tool By Rafia Shaikh Mar 31, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Following the release of Year Zero and Dark Matter, WikiLeaks has now released the third episode of stolen CIA documents. Codenamed Marble, the vault contains 676 source code files of the agency’s anti-forensic Marble Framework. The framework was used to make it difficult for forensic investigators to attribute viruses, trojans, and cyberattacks to the CIA. WikiLeaks noted that the latest documents don’t include any exploit, but focus on the agency’s obfuscation techniques. CIA anti-forensics tools revealed in latest WikiLeaks release – the agency knows too many languages… The third trove of leaked CIA documents focuses on anti-forensics tools. WikiLeaks had released the first set of documents earlier in March, revealing details of several outdated security vulnerabilities that the CIA had stocked against iOS, Android, Samsung TVs, and several other products. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other tech companies mentioned in the first release had all said that the flaws were patched years ago. Security experts had said that the release wasn’t as groundbreaking as Julian Assange said it would be (he had claimed it’d eclipse Snowden leaks) and that the release just confirmed what everyone already knew CIA was doing in its targeted attacks. Related CIA Has Been Infecting iPhones Since 2008 – New “Dark Matter” Documents Reveal The second release came last week. Codenamed Dark Matter, it exclusively focused on Apple products, generally thought to be more secure than others. WikiLeaks had subtly suggested that the CIA could be infecting Apple products right in the factory, a claim that wasn’t supported by any of the leaked documents. Apple again said no security flaws mentioned in the release were active. One of the most astonishing – but expected – revelations included the fact that the CIA has been attacking iPhones since the very year they were launched. “Based on our initial analysis, the alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released. Additionally, our preliminary assessment shows the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013.” – Apple on release of Dark Matter. Today’s release doesn’t focus on tech companies, but the agency itself. In its press release, WikiLeaks wrote that the agency hides text fragments to make attribution harder, a standard in the criminal or state-sponsored hacking communities. Advertisement Marble does this by hiding (“obfuscating”) text fragments used in CIA malware from visual inspection. This is the digital equivalent of a specalized CIA tool to place covers over the english language text on U.S. produced weapons systems before giving them to insurgents secretly backed by the CIA. Marble forms part of the CIA’s anti-forensics approach and the CIA’s Core Library of malware code. It is “[D]esigned to allow for flexible and easy-to-use obfuscation” as “string obfuscation algorithms (especially those that are unique) are often used to link malware to a specific developer or development shop.” The press release also mentions a deobfuscator tool using which the CIA could reverse text obfuscation. Marble framework also has text examples in Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic, and Farsi, helping the agency further make it difficult for investigators to attribute an attack to the CIA. Related Over 300 Cisco Products Vulnerable to Critical Security Flaw Found in WikiLeaks’ CIA Dump WikiLeaks has stopped getting as much attention and trust as it did initially when it talked about releasing the Vault 7 documents. After repeatedly trying to exaggerate security situations to presenting demands to the tech companies before it could share source code, the organization has done little like the famous Edward Snowden, who unequivocally shared all the documents with the public without making any demands to the publications or companies. Apple and Microsoft have previously said that the organization has to share security vulnerabilities like everyone else, and won’t be treated differently. After the release of Dark Matter, Apple gave the following statement. We have not negotiated with Wikileaks for any information. We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn’t in the public domain. We are tireless defenders of our users’ security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users. It appears that WikiLeaks is finally moving away from its focus on tech companies and their products and to the agency itself. You can read more about the Marble Framework in these released documents.

First Betas of iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5, watchOS 3.2.2 & tvOS 10.2.1 Have Arrived – Download Now Apple updated its entire software lineup just yesterday and today we are seeing new betas of iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS already. The new beta updates are available to download straight from the Apple Developer Program website. But of course, you need to be a registered member in order to get up to speed with things. Related Download: macOS 10.12.5 Sierra Public Beta Now Available At this point, it’s too early to suggest what iOS 9.3.2, macOS 10.12.5, watchOS 3.2.2 and tvOS 10.2.1 bring to the table. But given their version numbers (Apple skipped one) it appears as though they’ll be patching a lot of bugs in the time to come. It also seems like Apple will be releasing a quick bug fix update in due course as well before the aforementioned betas hit final download channels. Before you go ahead and download the above betas onto your device, be vary of the fact that this is pre-release software at best. There are bound to bugs during day to day use. We cannot guarantee what might go wrong at all. Hence, it’s recommended that you go ahead with the installation on a device that is not your daily driver. Advertisement Apple Watch users should be well aware of the fact that once they update to any beta release, there’s no way of downgrading back to the public release. Once you have updated, you have to keep on following the beta route until you reach a final and stable build. Therefore, again, install watchOS 3.2.2 beta on a spare device rather than your primary one. Related iOS 10.3.2 Public Beta Now Available – How to Download We will dig deep into the above mentioned software to see what Apple has packed under the hood. Right now it seems as though the update focuses on bug fixes and performance related enhancements, ensuring our devices keep on ticking nicely. It’s highly likely Apple will push out public beta builds of iOS 10.3.2 and macOS 10.12.5 in due course. When that happens, we will inform our readers about it. In the meantime, sit back, relax, and hope Apple has packed something great in these updates.

Mount Storm Generating Station in Mount Storm, W. Va., in January. By Bloomberg News Apr 1, 2017 at 11:02 am | Print View Many of America’s biggest corporations including Apple and Wal-Mart Stores are sticking by their pledges to fight climate change even as President Donald Trump guts his predecessor’s environmental policies. Companies say their pledges, coordinated by the Obama administration, reflect their push to cut energy costs, head off activist pressure and address a risk to their bottom line in the decades to come. “This work is embedded in our business,” Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner said in an email. It’s “good for the business, our shareholders and customers; if ultimately we are able to positively impact the environment in the process, that’s a win, too.” Wal-Mart was one of 81 companies that promised to reduce emissions in the run up to the 2015 Paris global climate negotiations. The company upped its targets last November, saying it would get half its power from renewable sources by 2025. Trump signed an order Tuesday that tells the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider former President Barack Obama’s climate rules, and rescinds a series of orders Obama issued to embed consideration of climate change in government actions from where to lease buildings to whether to allow oil pipelines to be built. “Most big companies in the U.S. recognize that climate change is real,” Geoffrey M. Heal, a professor at Columbia Business School, said in a telephone interview. “They need to move ahead on the climate change front no matter what Trump’s government does.” Business’s biggest lobbying force supports Trump on this issue. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce welcomed Trump’s order calling that shift “vital to stimulating economic growth.” The group argues that Obama’s regulations held back economic growth, preventing business owners from constructing needed pipelines, roads and other infrastructure. It also warned that the climate push would lead to a jump in energy prices. But many of the group’s members and other corporate titans supported Obama’s Clean Power Plan, or have set their own goals. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest beer maker, also announced Tuesday that it would get 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Nearly 90 companies have made similar pledges, according to the Sierra Club. “We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted,” General Electric’s CEO Jeffrey Immelt, wrote in an internal blog post shared by the company. “We hope that the United States continues to play a constructive role in furthering solutions to these challenges, and at GE, we will continue to lead with our technology and actions.” Mars, the maker of M&Ms, committed to eliminating its emissions entirely by 2040. Andy Pharoah, vice president of corporate affairs, said that Mars is “disappointed the administration has decided to roll back climate regulations.” Technology companies including Apple, Amazon.com, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft also expressed their support for Obama’s policies. “We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth,” the companies said in a joint statement after Trump’s order was signed. Other companies, while stopping short of criticizing the Trump administration, said they would keep pursuing lower emissions in their own operations. Procter & Gamble, Nestle Inc., Ikea, Levi Strauss & Co. and Best Buy Co., which all signed the 2015 pledge organized by the Obama administration, said they still intended to honor their commitments. “We will continue to integrate sustainability into our business practices, operations, innovation, brand building and culture,” Damon Jones, a spokesman for Procter & Gamble said. Many energy businesses welcomed Trump’s rollback. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents oil and natural gas producers, joined the Chamber of Commerce in praising his move. So did the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the Clean Power Plan in court. “People are going to freeze in the dark because of the destruction of the reliable electric power grid under Obama and the Democrats,” Robert Murray, the president and CEO of coal-mining company Murray Energy Corp. said in an interview. “Mr. Trump is doing the right things.” Some environmental groups cautioned that action from the private sector, wasn’t enough to make up for the pullback in federal policy. “Policy is going to be required to get us where we need to be,” said Karen Palmer, research director at Resources for the Future.

That is because this question is a good one that requires more than a quick one- or two-sentence response. It is what I would call the “draft do-over” question. Joseph Lee asks (via e-mail): If you could re-do the first 2 rounds of last year's draft, would you take Tunsil or Decker over Apple and/or Michael Thomas over Shepard? Ed says: There are still many Giants fans who can’t/won’t let go of the idea that the New York Giants made a mistake last year by passing on offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil when they chose Eli Apple with the 10th overall pick. That’s where this debate has to start. First, though, I need to establish my view on how I will answer the whole “do-over” question. It’s not really fair to look back a year later and say, well, I would have done “X” because Player A had a better rookie year than Player B. The only way I can really answer this is to tell you what I would have done if the choice had been mine to make during the 2016 NFL Draft. Related Mock Draft Tracker: OT Ryan Ramczyk clear top choice for Giants Round 1 Giants fans know how this played out. The team’s top two draft targets for the 10th overall pick were believed to be outside linebacker Leonard Floyd and offensive tackle Jack Conklin. The Tennessee Titans traded up to No. 8 to grab Conklin, and the Chicago Bears moved up to No. 9 to get Floyd before the Giants could. That left the Giants needing to go to Plan B, or perhaps really Plan C. They chose Eli Apple, the young Ohio State cornerback who only had two years of collegiate experience. The fan base howled. How could GM Jerry Reese get caught flat-footed like that? And why Apple? Most draft boards had Vernon Hargreaves listed ahead of Apple among cornerbacks. And Tunsil, thought to be the best offensive tackle in the draft, was still available after his gas mask bong video exploded on the scene right as the draft was beginning. So, what would I have done? First, I would not have traded up. The Titans gave up a 2016 third-round pick and a 2017 second-round pick to move up. The Bears gave up an additional fourth-round pick to move up. Me? I would have kept the picks, like Reese did, and let the draft unfold. Would I have taken Tunsil? Not a chance, and that comes from someone who believes strongly that if you don’t have a good offensive line it doesn’t matter how many good play-makers you collect. You can’t use them to their fullest advantage. Related Report: Ben McAdoo attends Texas Tech’s Pro Day to watch QB Patrick Mahomes Think about the situation at the time. The video exploded the day of the draft. The facts weren’t in, teams didn’t know what exactly they were dealing with. They just knew that risk of getting involved with this player had just skyrocketed. That’s the only reason the player expected to be the first offensive tackle taken was still on the board with Conklin and Ronnie Stanley already having been selected. Now, think about the Giants. They were riding a streak of four straight seasons without making the playoffs. Tom Coughlin had been replaced by Ben McAdoo. Reese was on the hot seat, having been told to get the Giants fixed and knowing that failing to do so — for the 2017 season — might cost him his job. With everything that was unknown about Tunsil at the time and his job on the line, that’s a pick Reese simply could not make. And one that, if it was me, I could not have made, either. The other factor is the reality that the Giants’ drafts from roughly 2010 to 2013 weren’t good enough. Too much reliance on selecting athletes over players, or taking chances on players of questionable character who ended up not working out, left the Giants short on talent. In the last few drafts the Giants have placed more emphasis on character and production, and that has paid off. As for Taylor Decker, Offensive Line Scouting and Development Consultant Duke Manyweather had told me in the weeks leading up to the draft that in his view teams weren’t giving Decker enough credit. So, I’m not surprised he played well for the Detroit Lions as a rookie. Still, I don’t think I could have taken Decker in that spot. The player I really liked with Conklin and Floyd gone? West Virginia safety Karl Joseph, who went 14th to the Oakland Raiders. I will admit, though, that I didn’t know as much about Apple as I probably should have. If it had been me, I likely would have taken Joseph in that spot to pair with Landon Collins at the back of the Giants’ defense. In my view, though, what the Giants did worked out just fine. Apple had a nice rookie season and should be a good player for a long time if he stays healthy. Michael Thomas Photo by Jason Hanna/Getty Images Round 2 The question here is a specific one. Would I have selected wide receiver Michael Thomas instead of the receiver the Giants did choose, Sterling Shepard, in the second round? The answer is yes. Without any doubt. Now, that is an easy thing to say because Thomas, chosen by the New Orleans Saints seven picks after the Giants selected Shepard, had a better rookie season. Shepard, a really good player, had 65 catches for 683 yards and 8 touchdowns. Thomas ended up with 92 receptions for 1,137 yards and 9 touchdowns. He also averaged 1.9 yards per catch more than Shepard, 12.4 to 10.5. I am not, however, basing that answer on 2016 production. Remember, I said I wouldn’t go by “Player A had a better year than Player B.” I’m not. I simply felt, and still feel, that Thomas would have been perfect for what the Giants needed in 2016. He is 6-foot-3, 212 pounds and would have given the Giants the big-bodied outside receiver they did not have last season. Shepard, 5-10, 194, is a slot receiver and with Odell Beckham Jr. and Victor Cruz gave the Giants a smallish trio of receivers. Now, heading into 2017 the presence of the 6-4, 230-pound Brandon Marshall balances the Giants’ receiving corps, so that point might be moot going forward. Also, there is no intent here to diminish the reality that Shepard is a really good player who should get better. Given my choice between the two receivers, though, I would have taken Thomas in last year’s draft.

Conventional dark metallic materials can be produced using pure zirconium, or zirconium alloys. Such materials are expensive, heavy, and difficult to machine.   Titanium alloys are strong, lower weight alloys. Titanium alloys can be surface finished by conventional methods such as anodizing or surface coating treatments. However, such conventional oxidized or anodized surfaces typically have an average thickness on the order of nanometers.   Cosmetic finishing can be accomplished by physical vapor deposition (PVD) coating or plating to achieve a given color or finish. For example, dark parts can be made directly by applying a PVD chromium carbide coating on a steel or titanium substrate. However, there have been no efforts at preparing a native oxide on a compositionally modified titanium surface.   There is a need for alloys having the strength and cost-effectiveness of titanium, at a grey or black color   Dark Surface Finishes on Titanium Alloys   Apple's invention, found in their filing titled "Dark Surface finishes on Titanium Alloys," relates to a coated titanium alloy. The alloy has an oxidized coating disposed on a titanium substrate. The coating has a dark surface color. In various embodiments, the coating can have an average depth of at least one micron.   Titanium alloys have high tensile strength and toughness. By creating an oxidized surface coating (i.e., native oxide) or oxide-interdiffused coating at the titanium substrate surface, the resulting treated titanium alloy may have a dark color (e.g., grey to black).   In various embodiments, the oxidized coated titanium substrate or oxide-interdiffused coated titanium substrate has a grey to black color. In some variations, the oxidized coated titanium alloy can have an interdiffused portion of unoxidized surface coating   In one aspect, methods for creating a dark surface on a titanium alloy are provided. With reference to patent FIG. 1 noted below, a titanium alloy may be prepared, e.g., a titanium alloy may be machined to a desired form, optionally surfaced finished, and cleaned.   An oxidizable surface coating is deposited on the titanium substrate, and then oxidized by heat treatment. In certain embodiments, the oxidizable surface coating may be oxidized in air or under a pressure controlled environment. In certain embodiments, the oxidizable surface coating may be heat treated in a pressure controlled environment, e.g., under vacuum, to interdiffuse the oxidizable coating into the titanium alloy, prior to oxidation.   In certain embodiments, the oxidizable surface coating may interdiffuse into the titanium alloy during oxidation. The resulting oxidized coated titanium alloy may have a dark color or hue. The titanium alloy can be titanium metal, or any titanium alloy known in the art.   Apple's patent application 20170088927 filed in September 2016 is highly technical and one that only other engineers would actually enjoy exploring. But of course anyone can check out the details of this invention here.   Apple notes that use of titanium or titanium alloy could be used in future Apple products as noted in the patent figure above: iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and MacBook. Of course Apple lists other products that you could find in the patent such as Apple TV, iPods, remotes and more.   Durable Cosmetic Finishes for Titanium Surfaces   A second patent on titanium was published by USPTO on Thursday titled "Durable Cosmetic Finishes for Titanium Surfaces."   Apple's patent abstract states that "A method for providing a surface finish to a metal part includes both diffusion hardening a metal surface to form a diffusion-hardened layer, and oxidizing the diffusion-hardened layer to create an oxide coating thereon. The diffusion-hardened layer can be harder than an internal region of the metal part and might be ceramic, and the oxide coating can have a color that is different from the metal or ceramic, the color being unachievable only by diffusion hardening or only by oxidizing.   The metal can be titanium or titanium alloy, the diffusion hardening can include carburizing or nitriding, and the oxidizing can include electrochemical oxidization. The oxide layer thickness can be controlled via the amount of voltage applied during oxidation, with the oxide coating color being a function of thickness. An enhanced hardness profile can extend to a depth of at least 20 microns below the top of the oxide coating."   Apple's patent application 20170088931 that was filed in December 2015 could be reviewed in full for details here.   Device Structures Formed from Porous Metal Bonded to Plastic   Apple's invention generally relates to bonding a plastic to a metal, and more particularly to filling pores or other apertures in the metal with a material that bonds more strongly with the plastic than does the metal alone. Typically, the material filling the pores may create a chemical or mechanical bond having higher bond energy than a metal-plastic bond. The material may be an adhesive, such as a heat-curable adhesive, in certain embodiments.   Pores may be formed in the metal substrate by chemically etching the metal, using nano-molding technology to create pits or other apertures in the metal, blasting the metal, abrading them metal, and so on. The resulting pores (or other apertures) may accept the adhesive, which may fully or partially fill the pores. The adhesive may be sprayed or brushed on, or otherwise deposited. In some embodiments, the metal may be dipped in the adhesive.   Waterproofing Impact Resistant Advantages   One advantage to this process of plastic on metal is to provide waterproofing as well as decorative and aesthetically pleasing surfaces on the device. Waterproof thermoplastic surfaces do not rust or corrode and thus are preferred over some metal surfaces which may not be as resistant to these elements. In addition, in order to protect the metal surface and certain electronic components, a watertight seal may be desirable between the thermoplastic material layer and the metal housing of the device.   In patent point #36 they further note that "In addition to providing a waterproof or other liquid-proof bond, the strength of the bonds between the materials may provide some degree of impact resistance to the electronic device. The increased bond strength thus results in a sturdier, more durable product.   Apple's patent FIG. 2 noted above particularly illustrates the plastic cover surface #130 and the metal body #120 in cross-section, showing a sample seam or joint between the two. Apple further notes in their filing that "The plastic section #130 may be transparent in certain embodiments and may form a cover surface," illustrated as a MacBook cover in FIG. 4. Patent FIG. 3 is an exaggerated view of the FIG.2 where the metal and the plastic meet.   Apple's patent application 20170094824 was filed in September 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Android Users to Overtake iOS Users in Apps Spending in 2017: Report Haamiz Ahmed 3 days ago Android has finally managed to catch up to iOS when it comes to their users spending money on apps. At least according to a forecast by App Annie. According to a report released by App Annie, Google Play Store combined with 3rd party Android stores will top Apple’s App Store in 2017 in terms of consumer spending. China is The Main Culprit As for how Google managed to surpass Apple, the main reason for that is China, especially because of how Chinese third party Android app stores are a major point of competition in the country. Smartphone manufacturers like Huawei and Xiaomi as well as companies like Tencent and Baidu offer their own custom-flavored app stores for Android apps. Danielle Levitas, App Annie’s senior vice president of research, says, What a lot of people don’t realize is how huge China is. Even if device sales slow, it’s the biggest smartphone channel, and that’s not going to change. Statistics and Predictions In 2016, third party Android app stores made $10 billion. That number is expected to rise to $36 billion in 2021, according to App Annie. This year app spending via third party stores is predicted to double which will help Google surpass Apple in 2017. Total app spending is expected to stand at $41 billion this year just a tiny bit higher than Apple’s $40 billion. Last year Android app spending was $27 billion in total (including third party stores), with Apple leading at $34 billion. 5 Year Prediction Going 5 years into the future, in 2021 the total app spending is expected to be $139.1 billion with Apple contributing $60 billion to the total amount. Android stores will have a $79.1 billion share. App Annie’s Data App Annie provides analytics and market intelligence for app developers. Their reports are cited by industry leaders across the world. The forecast in the above report used data from major publishers economic conditions, conversations with stakeholders and past performance according to Ms. Danielle.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s specs and features listed in new report Chris Smith @chris_writes March 28th, 2017 at 12:23 PM Share Tweet Apple may see monster iPhone sales this year, according to a new report, thanks to the redesigned iPhone 8 that should convince more people than ever to upgrade to Apple’s 2017 handsets. The new analysis comes from JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall, who says that Wall Street may have not properly assessed the incoming iPhone “super cycle.” Don't Miss: Galaxy S8: Specs, release info, and everything else we know right now “We believe that Street numbers still fail to capture the size of the likely replacement cycle assuming Apple delivers a compelling product this year,” Hall said in a note seen by Business Insider. In all, Hall expects Apple to sell as many as 260 million iPhones this year, which would represent a massive increase compared to last year’s tally (211 million). The iPhone 8, or iPhone Pro as it’s labeled in the report, will apparently cost more than $1,000. According to Hall, Apple may be looking to control demand for the iPhone 8 by setting a higher price. Even so, the iPhone 8 should account for 41% of the total number of iPhone shipments in the fourth calendar quarter. The premium price should also offset the increased cost of materials — the analyst expects the iPhone Pro to cost $65 more to make than the iPhone 7. The report also seemingly reveals some of the specs and features headed to the iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s. The high-end iPhone will feature an “edge-to-edge” OLED screen, a “structured-light-augmented” main camera that would allow re-focusing of pictures after they’re taken. The front-facing camera should sport 3D facial recognition features and 3D camera effects. The iPhone 8 might lack a fingerprint sensor, Hall notes, but that’s probably something that won’t happen. One interesting detail Hall offers concerns the size of the phone. He believes Apple’s 5.85-inch iPhone will be as big as a 5.5-inch iPhone. According to him, Apple looked into making a 5.1-inch iPhone that would be about the same size as the 4.7-inch iPhone, but decided against such a device for this year. Wireless charging and a front-and-back glass design are two things the iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s will have in common, according to the report. The iPhone 7s, meanwhile, might get a 3D front-facing camera as well, and might see some other improvements for the rear camera.

Apple's lawyers drop BIG hint about return of retro device The MacBook Pro 2017 will bring what Apple CEO Tim Cook has been saying about "redefining Pro" that may start with a more powerful and faster Kaby Lake processor and at the very least 64GB of RAM. The iPad Air, for example, was last week replaced by the iPad, which first launched in 2010 by Steve Jobs. Notetaking app Evernote today announced that its latest beta release supports the Touch Bar secondary display on Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro. Meanwhile, some rumors claim that after a disappointing MacBook Air previous year, Apple has already made a decision to discontinue the series. Rumor has it that Apple is gearing up for a discontinuation, starting with ceasing production for the 11-inch variant, followed by cutting down prices for the cheapest unit in the series. There are also rumors that since the MacBook Pro offers nearly the same features as the MacBook Air, the tech giant is now gearing up to have the MacBook Air series replaced with the MacBook Pro series. Since a reduction in retail cost often suggests that a more current model will arrive, tech enthusiasts have speculated that Apple might introduce a new model of the MacBook Air soon. The MacBook Air, which is best known for its lightweight and Svelte feature, has been overshadowed by the new MacBook Pro. While some are convinced that the tech giant will discontinue the series, others are hopeful for the line to make a comeback. If Apple will not put an end to the MacBook Air, consumers should expect to see the company unveil a new installment in early 2017. AMD might take a part in the MacBook Pro hardware since there are some reports that the upcoming RX 500 series GPUs might found their way onto the upcoming laptops.

This past Wednesday, the Korean-based tech giant officially unveiled the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, two stunning devices that may actually give Apple’s vaunted design team a run for its money. Both the S8 and S8 Plus boast impressive specs, but we can’t help but focus on the eye-catching displays Samsung managed to engineer. Design wise, both devices feature minimal bezels which wrap around a curved and immersive Super AMOLED display. Appropriately, Samsung refers to the design as an “Infinity Display.” In effect, Samsung managed to incorporate an incredible amount of screen real estate into a relatively compact form factor. As a point of reference, the S8 display is about 18% larger than the S7 display. Don't Miss: A word of warning to anyone who hasn’t already updated to iOS 10.3 On the other end of the smartphone spectrum, Apple is expected to launch a brand new redesign of its own later this year with the iPhone 8. Apple’s next-gen smartphone is said to feature an edge to edge OLED display, but one analyst believes that it still won’t be able to match what Samsung managed to pull off with its S8 lineup. In a newly published research note (via The Street), JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall writes that while Apple’s iPhone 8 design might closely resemble Samsung’s S8 design, the display itself will be slightly less curved. “While Apple’s new OLED form factor looks similar,” Hall writes, “current indications are for less use of curved OLED which may result in a slightly less ‘infinity’ screen form factor.” Notably, Hall’s assessment aligns perfectly with a number of other reports we’ve seen spring up from the Apple rumor mill recently. Just two weeks ago, for example, the Nikkei Asian Review published a report claiming that the display on the iPhone 8 will feature a ‘gentler curve’ compared to Samsung’s smartphone lineup. Having said that, the iPhone 8 may very well be the sleekest iPhone model we’ve seen yet, but it may not be able to match the “Infinity Display” Samsung wowed us with this week. Still, don’t expect that to hamper iPhone 8 sales in the slightest. Remember that Apple hasn’t changed the iPhone form factor in nearly three years, which is to say that the iPhone 8 will likely trigger the largest iPhone refresh cycle in history.

Earlier this week, Apple finally finished their beta testing malarky and released iOS 10.3 for users. You can read more about the different features added in the update here. Users who have updated to the new iOS 10.3 system have noticed that since they updated, their device has freed up a lot more memory for them. According to 9t05mac, the new Apple File System (APFS) in the update replaces the now 30-year-old HFS file system that has been a staple of Apple's products. After 30 years, it was probably time for an upgrade, and while the day-to day change for users may seem minimal, the new file system optimises the space on your device. This means, hallelujah, that your iPhone can seemingly store more data and there's been a noticeable freeing up of memory on devices. This is down to how APFS calculates available and used data. However... A word of warning for users. Once you update your phone to iOS 10.3 and your file system is upgraded to APFS, you will not be able to roll back without wiping your phone and reinstalling an older iOS build. Advertisement This is significant because if something does go wrong and you want to go back to an older version, all your files will have been converted to APFS and you won't be able to recover your data. To ensure that this doesn't happen to you, make sure to back up all your data before you update. This can be done in iCloud settings or in iTunes.

While the update, per se, is pretty big on its own, bringing quite a handful of changes to the operating system, the real world performance is always something that remains to be seen. So let’s shed some light on how iOS 10.3 stacks up against iOS 10.2.1 in a speed test comparison. iOS 10.3 Shows An All Round Improvement In Different iPhone Models Apart from a bunch of new features, the update also incorporates Apple’s new file system, APFS. The Apple File System leads to a noticeable jump in performance and fluidity of the operating system. The comparison ranges from the iPhone 5 to the iPhone 6s, which will provide a deeper insight to what the latest firmware has to offer in terms of performance. Check out the comparison below for an in-depth detail. Related SoundCloud For iOS Gains Support For Chromecast, Shared Playback And More As per the speed test comparison conducted by iAppleBytes, boot times have slightly improved on all variants of the iPhone on which the speed test was performed. Notably, the boot up speed was more evident on older iPhone models. It is definitely a plus for older iPhone models to feature faster boot up speed since they incorporate older internals. Advertisement The app load time on all iPhone models running iOS 10.3 was observed to be faster. However, the system animations and transitions have been shortened in iOS 10.3, which contributed in opening the apps faster. Overall, this contributed in a much smoother system performance. Related Apple Hires Former YouTube and Spotify Executive Amidst of Its Focus on Video Content In addition to this, when iPhone models running iOS 10.3 and iOS 10.2.1 were compared in benchmark results, the comparison did not yield out a gigantic difference. So no major bump in performance can be experienced if we solely base our judgement on the benchmarks. Nonetheless, if you use one of these devices on the latest iOS version, 10.3, you will definitely provide improved performance. On all iPhone models, the iOS 10.3 operating system showed more or less the same score. If you have updated your iOS device to the latest iOS 10.3 firmware and have noticed that the device is taking longer to boot up, do not be alarmed. This is because the new Apple File System takes time in conversion that takes place during the first boot after updating. You will notice that the subsequent boot ups are faster as can be seen in the videos above. This is it for now, folks. What are your thoughts on the iOS 10.3 vs iOS 10.2.1 speed test comparison?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Rumor Upcoming iPhone 8 Could Look a Lot Like the Galaxy S8 That’s Getting Announced Today By Omar Sohail Mar 29, 2017 15Shares Share Tweet Submit With Apple upgrading the design of the upcoming iPhone 8, and with different reports calling it the iPhone Edition, the latest rumor popping up reveals information that the smartphone might bear a similar design language to the Galaxy S8. Samsung’s flagship is going to be announced in a couple of hours, so it looks like we will know the full extent of what to expect from the radically changed iPhone 8. Renders of the iPhone 8 Also Show a Similar Design to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 – Took a Look at These Images A changeup of the iPhone from its current lineup obviously means that Apple is going to be taking a huge gamble with the exterior of its iPhone 8. Previous rumors have consistently stated that the upcoming phone will sport a near bezel-less display, as well as saying that the Home button might cease to exist completely. Whether it is going to be mounted at the rear side of the phone or embedded within the display, is yet to be seen. Related All Three iPhones Coming in September Are Rumored to Feature True Tone Displays – Here’s What That Means For now, the latest information coupled with renders provided by iDrop News state that sources that have spoken to a Foxconn employee and they have said that in addition to sporting a brand new look, the iPhone Edition will also have dual-lens setup. However, what is going to be different about this lens setup is that they are going to be arranged vertically. This approach is most likely going to be implemented when you want to get better depth of field from your snapped images. Advertisement With the iPhone 7 Plus featuring a horizontal dual-lens configuration, most of the detail when shooting in ‘Portrait Mode’ ends up getting blurred if it is not a near-perfect shot, so it is possible that with the introduction of this particular setup, the hurdle is eradicated permanently. Related The iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus & iPhone 8 Will All Feature Wireless Charging; Apple Watch 3 Will Support LTE – Apple’s Supply Chain Reports Apple has also been rumored to switch from LCD to an OLED display, which will result in higher level of brightness, rich colors, not to mention contributing a small amount to higher battery life. Alongside the iPhone 8, we will also be seeing the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, which are expected to follow the same design as its predecessors. How did you find these renders and the rumors that came with them? Let us know all your thoughts in the comments below.

As MacRumors has covered over the past few years, tech companies love to prank their customers with silly products, out-there announcements, and largely weird press releases meant to highlight the jovial holiday. April 1, 2017 also marks the 41st anniversary of Apple, with Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne having solidified their partnership on this day all those years ago in 1976. Now, Apple itself has become a major target for April Fools' Day pranks, as well as various other companies, apps, services, and accessory makers that are well-known by Apple users. We have collected some of the more interesting hoaxes and jokes into a list below, but remember that some contain mildly NSFW content and language, so you may want to use headphones or watch the videos in a private location. Siri Siri is recognizing April Fools' Day in some of its responses today, including refusing to flip a coin upon request. iFixit's Micro Tech Toolkit iFixit has announced an all-new toolkit that it says is aimed at the smallest devices on the market, including the Apple Watch and AirPods. The $19.95 Micro Tech Toolkit comes with a magnetized driver handle, easy-to-open tool roll, micro pliers, micro spudger, an iFixit micro opening tool, and three precision bits. Thanks to the vast array of tools being sold on iFixit's online store, the Micro Tech Toolkit is at first a somewhat believable offering from the teardown site. For anyone not yet convinced of its status as an April Fools' Day prank, however, the accompanying launch video has testimony from iFixit's Micro Tech Tool Expert -- Howard the Hamster. Additionally, one repair story on the toolkit's storefront written by Ralph the Mouse appears to be a reference to Beverly Cleary's popular children's book The Mouse and the Motorcycle. Ms. Pac-Man in Google Maps Beginning yesterday, users discovered that Google has added a functioning version of the classic video game Ms. Pac-Man directly into its iOS Google Maps app. You can now control Ms. Pac-Man and hunt for ghosts and pellets in a re-skin of the game that turns the streets of your local neighborhood into a maze of Ms. Pac-Man corridors. Netflix Live Netflix launched an all-new streaming show it's calling "Netflix Live," allowing customers to receive fascinating tidbits of information about copiers, toasters, and pencil sharpeners from actor Will Arnett. The popular streaming company claims that the "live" show is a new addition to its ever-growing stable of original content, but -- as many have figured out since yesterday -- it's yet another one of Netflix's April Fools' Day pranks. For the morbidly curious, you can watch the 48-minute, not-actually-live burrito commentary series right now on the Netflix streaming device of your choice. If it's anything like last year's John Stamos: A Human, Being "documentary," it probably won't be on the service for long. AirRings Twelve South has revealed "AirRings," which the company says will let you "effortlessly transform your AirPods into earrings." AirRings come in different styles for both men and women, including cuffs, bands and drop style earrings, so you can listen to your music on AirPods without sacrificing your style. USB-Speed of Light by Moshi If you're tired of the confusing array of USB-Type A and USB-Type C cables, Moshi today announced the one USB solution to end them all: USB-Speed of Light (USB-SL for short). The accessory manufacturer calls USB-SL "the next-next-generation in charging and connectivity," and should top off your MacBook Pro in mere seconds. With the additional USB-SL to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter "the future is truly and literally at your fingertips," providing an internet connection so fast you can catch up on your email and other notifications that have yet to arrive. Similarly, the USB-SL to HDMI Adapter provides the ultimate, crystal clear video experience "from any point in time."

In January Forbes reported that "A White House advisory panel issued a report recommending that the U.S. strengthen protection of the semiconductor industry, especially against threats posed by Chinese policies to dominate the sector.   Prime Minister Shinzo Abe recentlly met with President Trump and it was about business matters and security. So the Japanese government stepping into the bids for Toshiba, a semiconductor company, and bringing up "security" as a concern is for sure a move to ensure that an American company wins the bid for Toshiba.   Yesterday morning Barron's Tech Trader Daily posted a brief report titled in-part "Apple For Toshiba?" The report noted that "In the bidding for Toshiba's NAND flash unit, Japanese publication Yomiuri Shimbun this morning reports Apple is possibly among the bidders, citing unnamed sources (see the translation of the Japanese report below). This follows a report from Nikkei late yesterday that chip maker Broadcom is interested. Prices talked about thus far have been as high as $18 billion for the unit. Late last night Reuters stepped in with a report on the matter titled "Apple, Amazon, Google join bidding for Toshiba chip unit." Their report basically repeated the Barron's report.   Apple farms out their production for Macs, iDevices and accessories so that they could focus the bulk of their investments on softare and engineering companies, setting up R&D centers around the world and building out new Flagship Apple stores.   Is it impossible for Apple to be in the bid for Toshiba? You can never say impossible with Apple, but it's higly improbable. There's no doubt that Toshiba holds a lot of technology that Apple could be interested in, especially memory products where they over rely on market leader Samsung.   But unless Apple is taking a new turn in investment philosophy and wants to move away from Samsung rapidly for future products, dropping Apple's name into the bidding war for Toshiba could have been simply to get instant headlines. The Nikkei reported on Thursday that there were ten serious bidders for Toshiba and Apple wasn't one of the them.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

That isn’t entirely accurate, although you will hear that popular misconception often repeated even by some patent professionals. At best the statement is only half correct. It is true that you cannot impermissibly read from the specification into a patent claim. Obviously, when you add the critical term “impermissibly” into the mix that has to mean that there are times when it is appropriate to read into a patent claim from the specification, which is indeed true. In fact, there is no blanket prohibition against reading into a patent claim from the specification. The trick, obviously, is to know when it is permissible and when it is impermissible. Before we can address this question head on allow me to take a step back to fill in two gaps. First, the term “specification” as being used here relates to the written disclosure that makes up that patent application and is not a part of the patent claims or Abstract. The specification (i.e., the written description) will include a description of the invention and of the manner and process of making and using the invention in full, clear, and exact terms such that those skilled in the technology field or science to which the invention pertains will be able to make and use the invention. The specification must also completely describe at least one specific embodiment of the invention, whether the invention is a process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter or improvement thereof, and must explain the mode of operation or principle of operation wherever possible.

Second, any patent, or patent application, contains a variety of different sections that contain different, albeit redundant information. Generally speaking, a patent is divided into a specification, drawings and patent claims. Only the patent claims define the exclusive right granted to the patent applicant. The rest of the patent is there to facilitate understanding of the invention articulated in the patent claims — which is referred to as the claimed invention. Therefore, patent claims are in many respects the most important part of the patent application because it is these claims that define the invention for which the Patent Office has granted, or will grant, protection. Before proceeding let’s initially answer the pending question: Can you read into a patent claim from the specification? The answer is yes. The point of the specification is to act as a dictionary or glossary for the patent claims. You absolutely can define terms and concepts in the specification and those meanings will be imported into the claims. What you cannot do, however, is fail to incorporate an element or characterization into the claim and then point to it in the specification and say it is implicitly in the claims. You read definitions into the claims, which requires the claim having at least a placeholder that refers back to the specification. You cannot forget to include something in the claim and save yourself because it is in the specification. With that out of the way, let’s take another step back and fill in some more gaps again. The whole purpose of the specification, as already briefly mentioned, is to facilitate understanding of the claimed invention. Indeed, in a patent application you can define the terms you will use in the patent claims to provide the meaning you specifically intend. This specifically defined meaning will apply during any claim interpretation, whether that claim interpretation takes place during patent prosecution with the patent examiner or once the patent has issued.  But what happens when you do not define a term in the specification?  Well, that really depends.  As a general rule the ordinary plain meaning of the term as would be understood by someone of skill in the relevant technology area or science will be used. That may or may not be bad, and it may or may not be what you intended. This issue came up several years ago during the patent war between Apple and Motorola, Judge Richard Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued a ruling, while sitting by designation as a trial judge.  See Apple v. Motorola No. 1:11-cv-08540 (N.D. IL., Jan. 17, 2012). Motorola had argued that Apple’s U.S. Patent No. 7,479,949 was invalid because it used the term “heuristic,” thereby rendering the claims invalid as being indefinite and in violation of 35 U.S.C. 112(b). In fact, the term “heuristic” was used well over 100 times in the ‘949 patent, but it wasn’t ever specifically defined. Motorola’s primary evidence of indefiniteness consisted of statements in various depositions taken during discovery.  The nine listed inventors were deposed and most of them conceded that the term “heuristics” is “sort of a vague word.”  They were also unable to suggest an appropriate definition.  Nevertheless, Judge Posner agreed that the definition of heuristics provided by Apple for purpose of claim construction was appropriate and keeping with the patent disclosure.  Apple defined “heuristics” to mean “one or more rules to be applied to data to assist in drawing inferences from the data.” This is certainly a reasonable definition, but it was not provided in the patent application filed. Judge Posner, citing Solomon v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 216 F.3d 1372, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2000), explained that it is inappropriate to consider inventor testimony when assessing validity under section 112(b).  For the uninitiated that may seem odd, but the question isn’t whether inventors or even someone of skill in the relevant technology area can define any particular term in a vacuum. Rather, the question is whether the invention is particularly defined in the specification and whether someone of skill in the relevant technology or science who read the specification would understand.  In essence, the inquiry is one of a totality of circumstances based on the law, with an eye toward what was disclosed in the specification. If you read the ‘949 patent it is clear that the term “heuristic” was being use by the attorneys who wrote the application to mean one or more rules. But the lesson for our purposes is this: When you do not define the terms you use in a patent application itself it can be an expensive and unpredictable process to get to the meaning that will be ultimately be accepted by the court. Judge Posner ultimately decided that the term “heuristics” as used in the specification of the ‘949 patent was entirely consistent with the definition provided by Apple. Of course, this would not have been an issue if Apple had defined the term “heuristic” in the patent application. This is not to suggest that the attorneys representing Apple made a mistake, hindsight is always 20-20 and the context of how they were using the word “heuristic” does seem abundantly clear, but rather this story should be illustrative of why it is best practice whenever possible to define what you specifically want understood by the terms and concepts you use in a patent application. When I teach this topic the example I tend to use relates to “standard room temperature.” If you have invented a process that needs to be carried out at 68 degrees F you might say that the process can or should be carried out at standard room temperature, for example. In the U.S. standard room temperature is generally referred to as 20 degrees C, which is 68 degrees F. But in some parts of the world what qualifies as standard room temperature is a bit warmer, sometimes up to 25 degrees C. So this illustration is particularly useful for several reasons. When you say standard room temperature did you even know that it has an accepted meaning in the scientific community? Were you aware that the meaning could vary depending upon whether the person reading the disclosure is in the United States or some other part of the world? This is where defining what you mean could be particularly important.   Let’s assume for a minute that the process will work from 19 degrees C to 24 degrees C, but not over 24 degrees C or under 19 degrees C. If you simply say “at standard room temperature” that is not precise enough, and indeed inaccurate (at worst) or confusing (at best). But could you define “standard room temperature” as being between 19 degrees C and 24 degrees C? Absolutely! Generally speaking, the Manual of Patent Examining Procedures explains that an applicant is entitled to be his or her own lexicographer, giving their preferred meaning by clearly setting forth a definition of the term or concept.  This can allow the applicant to even give meanings to terms that are somewhat different from the ordinary and customary meaning(s), although you can’t define terms so that they are diametrically opposite to their ordinary plain meaning.  See e.g. MPEP 2111.01.  So you couldn’t say, “when I say ‘up’ I mean ‘down’ and when I say ‘down’ I mean ‘up’.” So what if you said something like this: “The process should be carried out at between 19 degrees C to 24 degrees C, which is sometimes in this disclosure referred to as standard room temperature.” That would be perfectly fine. Moreover, if you then used the term “standard room temperature” in the claims you would be importing that definition provided (i.e., between 19 degreesC  to 24 degrees C). If you do not define terms in the specification then they are given their ordinary plain meaning as would be understood by one of skill in the relevant technology area or science. So returning to our example of “standard room temperature,” if you did not define the range you wanted to be considered as “standard room temperature” and just used that term in the claims there would be difficult questions to answer. You could pretty much guarantee that an argument would be made that standard room temperature means nothing more than 20 to 25 degrees C, which capture temperatures that won’t work, but not all that do work. You might even have to deal with an argument that standard room temperature is only 20 degrees C because, after all the application was filed in the United States so the meaning as understood in the U.S. should govern. Therefore, defining terms and concepts can be particularly important.

By: Samden Sherpa Published: Saturday, April 1, 2017, 18:30 [IST] Earlier we reported that Microsoft had signed a deal with Samsung for the newly launched Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones. Moreover, as per the partnership between the two companies, the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus would come as Microsoft edition models. And that's not just it, customers paying a visit to Microsoft stores may not see Windows phones on display only. Rather, they will see Galaxy S8 smartphones in the shelves also. However, with this move, it looks like Microsoft is getting into phone retailer business. SEE ALSO: Samsung Galaxy S8, S8 Plus Microsoft Edition models pegged for April 21 release With such aim, Microsoft may not be satisfied with having Samsung as the only partner onboard. While retailer business requires having more brands in the loop, surprisingly, Microsoft has yet again signed a deal with Apple to sell iPhones in its stores. The signing of the deal now means that customers won't be seeing Samsung phones only. They will see iPhones as well. On the other hand, the new iPhones will be branded as Microsoft Edition as well. Softpedia reports that the iPhones will have the Microsoft logo on the back. A Microsoft spokesperson has also told the publication that this new deal can be interpreted as an effective way to boost store traffic, thus leading to bigger sales for the company. The representative further stated, "Our deal with Apple helps us provide customers with easy access to our services even if they choose a different mobile platform. We respect everyone's decision to use Android or iOS, and this is why we're trying to help them make no compromise. Bringing Microsoft apps on as many devices as possible is a priority." SEE ALSO: Microsoft testing its latest AI chatbot 'Ruuh' in India Now that the deals are closed, the Microsoft Edition iPhones will be on sale from April 1 and it will come with out of the box customization kit that with replace Siri with Cortana, a default Mail app with Outlook, and iCloud integration with OneDrive. In addition, the iPhone 7 Microsoft Edition will be available in Silver, Rose Gold, Matte Black, and Jet Black colors. As for the pricing, the new iPhones will start at $899 (approx Rs. 58,261).

(AAPL) Boycott Apple Inc. Stock Hits Another Record High: How Much Further Can AAPL Run? View All Posts Donald Trump is apparently learning more and more every day that being President is much more difficult than just blurting out whatever comes to mind. Source: Sunnyc Sure, you can call for a boycott of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones before you’re elected, but after you’re in the White House, the government decides what kind of smartphone you’re going to use… even if it happens to be an iPhone. So while you might think you’ll be able to do anything you want when you become president, that’s not actually the case. He seems to be learning the hard way why it’s best to keep your mouth shut until you find out what you’ll actually be able to do so that people don’t call you out for doing the opposite of what you said you would do, like use an iPhone when you said no one should use an iPhone. White House Social Media Director Dan Scavino, Jr. revealed on Twitter that Trump is using an iPhone now. .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump has been using his new iPhone?for the past couple of weeks here on Twitter. Yes, it is #POTUS45 reading & tweeting! — Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) March 29, 2017 Although Scavino clearly states that the President has been using an iPhone for the “past couple of weeks,” CNN Money notes that a “tweet bearing the hallmarks of Trump’s combative style was sent from an Android device as recently as Saturday.” Mobil Phones a Matter of National Security The issue of him using an unsecured phone prompted some Democrats to send an official letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis in February requesting details about the kinds of mobile devices the President is using. Apple Inc. Launches New Red iPhone 7, New iPad As President of the United States, Donald Trump has access to some very sensitive information, so U.S. intelligence agencies must ensure that he has the most secure smartphone possible. He has been criticized for using an older, unsecured Android phone even after his inauguration, despite the report that he had ditched the phone. Now instead of using an Android phone to tweet, he’s supposedly been using the government-issued iPhone. It’s unclear whether it’s a custom model designed specifically for the President or just a standard model. Officials will not say whether any security measures are in place on Trump’s mobile devices. When Barack Obama was in office, he used various devices, including a specialized BlackBerry long after most people were using an iPhone, and later, a stripped-down phone with pure security in mind and few features. Trump Called for iPhone Boycott The tech community has always paid close attention to what kind of smartphone the world’s leaders are using, and in Trump’s case, the use of an iPhone has been met with a healthy heap of derision. While on the campaign trail, he called for a boycott of Apple’s devices until the company complied with the government’s demand to help unlock the iPhone 5c used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. An Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone Factory in America? Maybe Not. Interestingly, that very issue could be one reason the government has decided that the iPhone is secure enough for the President. Apple refused to unlock the phone used by a deceased man officials say is a terrorist, and government hackers were having a difficult time unlocking it, at least until they bought an exploit from a third party. Even before being elected, he didn’t seem to be locked into his call for a boycott because tweets were posted from both iPhones and Android phones. Some, however, have suggested that his aides were using Apple devices to post tweets while Trump himself used an Android phone. The post Donald Trump Now An iPhone User After Calling For Apple Inc.

(File photo | AP) NEW YORK: US tech giant Apple is expected to host an event where it will unveil the new iPad Pro lineup, a larger iPhone SE model with 128GB storage and new Apple Watch bands. "Rumours widely suggest at least a trio of new iPad Pro models will be unveiled as early as this month, including an all-new 10.5-inch model with slimmer bezels and updated 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch versions," tech website macrumors.com reported on Tuesday.  The new 10.5-inch iPad Pro will not include Home button and is also rumored to have a higher-resolution display and quad microphones.  The updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro is expected to feature a 12MP rear camera and True Tone display using advanced four-channel ambient light sensors to automatically adapt the colour and intensity of the display to match the light in the surrounding environment. Apple is also said to launch a 5.8-inch iPhone 8 with an OLED display, that may be called 'iPhone X', along with two other devices -- updated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (with brand names as iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus). The company is also planning to introduce a new connector type for accessories for the iPhone, iPad and other devices through its official Made-for-iPhone (MFi) licensing programme. Called 'Ultra Accessory Connector' (UAC), the eight-pin connector is slightly less thick than USB-C and near half as wide as both USB-C and Lightning.  TAGS Apple New launch iPhone O P E N Professional Courses Sponsored link Technology Courses Sponsored link Jobs Wisdom Jobs Sarkari Result Freejobalert Latest Bob Dylan receives his Nobel Literature prize 400 CRPF jawans hospitalised in Kerala JCO killed in IED blast along LoC in Poonch Drunk Britons arrested for harassing AI air hostess 29 stranded Keralites to be brought back to Kerala by next week Soviet era Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko dies at 84 40 cows carcases recovered from UP farmhouse Gallery Movie stars who hid their actual identity behind their pseudo names FBI releases never seen before pictures of  9/11 Pentagon attack arrow Videos Dangal girl Sanya Malhotra plans to climb Mt.

(File photo | AP) SAN FRANCISCO: After a hacker or a group of hackers threatened to remotely wipe data from millions of iPhones including photos, videos and messages, Apple has denied any such breach into iPhones. The hackers, who call themselves 'Turkish Crime Family', asked for $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum (a form of crypto-currency) or $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards in exchange for deleting a large cache of iCloud and other Apple email accounts, Vice blog Motherboard reported. Reacting to the threat, Apple told Fortune on Wednesday: "There have not been any breaches in any of Apple's systems including iCloud and Apple ID. The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services." The hackers claim to have access to nearly 559 million Apple email and iCloud accounts. The hackers provided screenshots of alleged emails between the group and members of Apple's security team and threatened to reset iCloud accounts and remotely wipe victims' Apple devices on April 7 unless Apple pay them. The Apple spokesperson, however, said that Apple is "actively monitoring to prevent unauthorised access to user accounts and are working with law enforcement to identify the criminals involved." According to reports, several email accounts and passwords may belong to an earlier breach at the professional networking site LinkedIn in 2012. However, Apple customers who secure their iCloud accounts with the same passwords they use with other online accounts must go for new, strong passwords, the report added.

BEIJING: A Beijing court has overturned a ruling that Apple's iPhone 6 violated a Chinese manufacturer's patent which saw the US tech giant ordered to cease selling the smartphone in China. In May last year the Beijing intellectual property bureau had ruled that Apple violated design patents of Chinese maker Shenzhen Baili with its iPhone6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and would be barred from selling those models. Sales, however were not suspended while Apple appealed against the administrative order. The Intellectual Property Court in Beijing on Friday ruled in favour of the California-based firm. The court "quashes the decision of the bureau" and "recognises that Apple ... has not infringed the design patent filed by the company Shenzhen Baili", according to the verdict reported by the state judicial daily Renmin Fayuan Ribao. The intellectual property bureau, an administrative body of Beijing municipality, had ruled that the two Apple phones infringed a Baili design patent. It had accused the US firm of having "copied" the exterior design of Baili's 100C smartphone, which is characterised by a curved edge and rounded corners. But the Beijing court ruled that the iPhone 6 had features that "completely change the effect of the entire product ... and both phones are easily distinguishable in the eyes of consumers," finding Baili's claim was without legal basis. When it took on Apple in December 2014, Baili was a promising electronics firm, backed by internet giant Baidu and eager to tap the telecoms boom. But since then the company has collapsed, hit by public criticism of its products seen as poor quality and more so by China's ultra-competitive smartphone market which has seen many start-ups go under. Even Apple is under pressure. While China, along with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, remains its second largest market after the US, the Cupertino-based company saw its turnover in this "Greater China" region fall 12 percent in the last quarter of 2016. Apple's market share has plummeted in mainland China, falling behind local competitors such as telecoms giant Huawei, newcomers Oppo and Vivo, and "internet of things" pioneer Xiaomi.  Apple has already had intellectual property problems in China.  In May 2016 a maker of "iphone" branded leather goods won a lawsuit filed by Apple as the court ruled Xintong Tiandi had registered the word as a trademark in 2007, while Apple smartphones did not officially go on sale in China until 2009.

But in this eternal, yearly battle of smartphone Top Trumps, which device is worth your money: the iPhone 7 or Galaxy S8?  Here’s my breakdown of the five features that give the Samsung Galaxy S8 an edge over Apple’s flagship handset. Stay tuned for my top reasons why the iPhone 7 is a better choice. If you’re not familiar with my buying guides, check out my breakdowns for the ,  , and . Bixby Bixby can’t compete with Siri in knowledge, but can with in-phone assistance. Samsung’s second foray into an artificially intelligent personal assistant has some promise. No, it’s not as accomplished as Apple’s Siri – or any other mobile AI from a major rival – but its goals are slightly different, which should pique your interest. Unlike Siri, Bixby doesn’t act as a knowledge base for all of your questions (although this is something it tries to do, but not very well), but rather offers a helping hand for in-phone actions. For example, you could ask Bixby to send a picture you’re looking at to a friend without leaving the Gallery app. The assistant contextually understands what you’re doing on the phone and the app you have open – offering assistance within that app to both help you navigate but also speed up tasks and by spotting trends in your behavior. This is exemplified by Bixby’s camera feature. Taking photos of landmarks and, as Samsung explained, a bottle wine will bring up additional information about it. So if you want to know where to buy the wine you’ve just ordered, or even what it’s called, a snap will tell you that. This approach to a personal assistant solves the issue of ‘feature overload’ that most smartphones suffer from, particularly Samsung phones. New features and ever-shifting UI design concepts means lots of good software ideas go completely unused. An assistant that helps you discover and use them is what we need for 2017 smartphones. More than a phone © Provided by Forbes Media LLC The S8 as a desktop PC. The S8 as a desktop PC. These PC capabilities of the S8 aren’t to be sniffed at. In essence, once Samsung’s flagship is connected to the – and an accompanying mouse and keyboard – it becomes a souped up Chromebook. The partnership with VMware means it supports a Windows virtual machine, giving you some additional Windows-related functionality. In fairness, how useful this is to the everyday customer is questionable. But having remote access to your PC, or even the dexterity of typing a full document powered by your phone is useful for on-the-go business users. The only thing Apple might be working on is a similar docking station that doubles up as a laptop shell, as detailed in . But, you know, it’s a patent so it’s entirely likely this may never happen. Samsung actually missed a trick here, a laptop shell with a built in screen and dock for your phone would’ve made the S8’s PC capabilities much more consumer friendly.   Similar frame, more display © Provided by Forbes Media LLC The Galaxy S8's long, (almost) bezel free display. The Galaxy S8′s long, (almost) bezel free display. Samsung has clearly been ‘inspired’ by the iPhone 7’s design, so much so that a quick glance at the S8 and you might mistake it for an Apple product. But one thing the S8 has over the iPhone 7 design is that ‘infinity’ display, as Samsung calls it. The thinned out bezels and maximised screen size is 2017’s design trend, which the Korean company seems to have nailed. In , the the iPhone 7’s 65.6% screen-to-body ratio pales in comparison to the S8’s 83.6%. The dimensions, too, aren’t dissimilar considering how much more display you’re getting: iPhone 7 dimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm Galaxy S8 dimensions: 148.9 x 68.1 x 8 mm MicroSD © Provided by Forbes Media LLC The S8 supports up to 25GB of expandable storage. The S8 supports up to 25GB of expandable storage. Samsung found a between the discrepancy of read and write speeds between external and internal memory in the S7, so expandable storage shouldn’t harm performance. With that in mind, The S8’s additional 256GB – on top of the 64GB that comes as standard – of storage dwarfs the maximum option available on the iPhone 7 (256GB). It also means that you’re more likely to get huge increase in storage capacity for free… Promotions Many carriers are offering some good initial deals on the Galaxy S8, including free 256GB micro SD cards and a free Gear VR. Other carriers are offering a free bluetooth speaker and a to selected music streaming services. Samsung’s pre-order site, too, is currently offering; ‘hand delivered replacements’ *cough*, a one-to-one set up service, training sessions and 24 month financing with 0% APR. Apple, on the other hand, is offering a similar 24 month financing deal. But you’ll end up paying an extra £106 (£805 in total) for the iPhone 7 128GB rather than £699 if you pay upfront. Apple doesn’t tend to give away freebies when you purchase an iPhone, and carriers aren’t in the habit either. Mainly because Apple doesn’t need to.  Strong sales numbers following a major launch for Samsung means exorcising last year’s demons and finally putting the Note 7 story to bed. So I’d wager that we’ll see increasingly dramatic promotions a few months down the line to boost next quarter’s results. If you’re still unsure about the Galaxy S8, should quench your knowledge thirst.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

That's how often I use an Apple TV. I have three at home, and one of them always comes with me on vacations. As I type this, my TV is displaying one of those amazing Aerial screen savers (of the Great Wall of China, by the way). I use Apple TV all of the time; that's how I know it needs to get better. Apple TV is an interesting product in Apple's line-up. For much of its lifespan, it was considered a "hobby." That's Apple CEO Tim's Cook's word. Though Apple execs never marketed the device as strongly as they do iPhones and Macs, personally, I was sold the moment iOS supported AirPlay for Apple TV. [ Related: Video review: Apple's new AirPods ] Sure, every major platform ecosystem now has the capability to stream images and video to another device hooked up to a TV, but the ability to do so on the Apple TV debuted almost seven years ago. For me, AirPlay has always the best way to easily display movies and photos on an HDTV, and it was the only way to get iTunes content onto a TV. The integration with other Apple products through AirPlay has been an important feature check for those in the Apple ecosystem. Whenever I considered the alternatives, -- everything from Google Chromecast to Roku and the Amazon Fire Stick -- the fact that I stored my content in iTunes and the convenience of AirPlay gave Apple TV the edge. Software updates, yes. But... As of now, the Apple TV hardware hasn't been updated in 520-plus days and counting. The current model arrived in October 2015. Usually, I'm not concerned about the length of time between updates. Apple has a solid history of supporting its hardware lines with consistent software updates. Case in point: An update for Apple TV arrived on Monday, eliminating the "scrolling through long lists" issue I would have complained about. So it's not as if Apple has abandoned its hobby, like so many Android devices that won't see any updates long before their usefulness is over. Despite a dearth of hardware updates, new features, security updates, and bug fixes continue to trickle in for Apple TV. But there are some things software can't fix, and Apple under Cook seems to have but one priority when it comes to regular hardware updates -- the lucrative iPhone line. Given the revenue the iPhone brings in, this makes sense. But when you consider other products like the Mac Pro -- which hasn't been updated now in three years -- and the Mac mini, the question becomes: What's going on here? To be blunt, I'm concerned that Apple TV is a core product that is being ignored in an era of increased competition from smaller and cheaper alternatives. The iPhone -- the "corest" of Apple products -- is safe from being outgunned by competition because every resource at Apple is dedicated to it. The Mac notebook and iMac lines are beholden to Intel's processor launch schedules, but remain more or less competitive with similarly-specced PCs. But the Mac Pro and Mac mini continue to languish. I don't want the same thing to happen to the Apple TV. It's easy to second-guess Apple's strategy, especially since the public isn't privy to the data corporate decisions are based on. Yet that doesn't change the fact that the Apple TV -- for all of the software updates it's received -- needs major hardware updates if Apple wants to keep the device competitive. It's time for 4K The Apple TV needs 4K support, as soon as possible. I understand why a 4K model hasn't been rushed to market -- mainly because 1080p high-definition is the sweet spot for most TVs. Meeting the demands of most users is a financially sound decision. It's a safe decision. Certainly, the processors capable of decoding 4K video would have eaten into profit margins, or forced higher Apple TV prices. But remember when Apple used to be the forward-thinking company? Okay, maybe that's a tad inflammatory. In many cases, Apple products are (or at one point were) market leaders in forward-thinking. Think about the original iPod, iTunes, the first iPhone and iPads. Or the latest MacBook Pros, and the shift to USB-C ports. Going all in on USB-C was a very 'Bondi Blue iMac' decision by Apple. But I'm concerned about the Apple TV. 4K isn't an inevitable future possibility, it's happening now, in more and more households as potential cord cutters look for viable solutions. Embracing 4K lets current 4K TV owners in the Apple ecosystem use their TVs as God intended, and it gives developers a higher resolution canvas to design for. And in case you haven't noticed, 4K TV sales are soaring as prices plummet. Thankfully, the arrival of 4K on the Apple TV seems to be coming soon. But that's not the only thing needed. ...And gaming? This may be a stretch, but why not ship the Apple TV with game controllers? It doesn't have to be complicated; even something as simple as ancient SNES controllers would work. If Apple were to leverage its position and ship game controllers with the next Apple TV, it would give developers consistent hardware standards to write games around. Right now there are third-party options for controllers -- as well as the capability to use an iPhone as a game controller -- but that's not enough. If Apple wants its Apple TV to be a Trojan horse into the living room, the company needs to give buyers (and developers) something to cheer about. An Apple TV that's also a gaming machine could be a major differentiation from competing devices, and it would allow Apple to attract users who might not want to pay PS4 and Xbox money for gaming. Gaming could and should be treated as part of the next Apple TV's core functionality. There's been much talk over the years about Apple's desire to revolutionize the living room TV with Apple TV, but that hasn't yet happened. An Apple TV revamp doesn't need to reinvent the wheel to gain a bigger foothold; it just has to do what it does now, at higher resolutions and -- if Apple needs to justify a higher starting price -- offer real gaming support. So what's it going to be Apple -- stick with the hobby or get serious?

Ten years ago, laptop sales overtook desktop PC sales to become the dominant hardware platform for computing. Now smartphones are about to do to laptops what laptops did to desktops. But wait, you may ask. What's wrong with laptops? Apple has run out of good laptop ideas For the past decade, Apple has led and dominated the laptop market with design and innovation. The company has been moving toward better quality, so-called "Retina" screens. Apple’s keyboard designs and unibody aluminum construction have been heavily imitated. The company used to dazzle the industry by sweating the small stuff, like the MagSafe power connector and lights that shine through aluminum. It's not just that Apple innovated. It's that its laptop innovations evolved their products toward elegance and usability. And that's over. After years without a significant new laptop design, their latest release, last year's MacBook Pro, landed with a thud. The laptop was seriously underpowered — called by some a MacBook Air at a MacBook Pro price. The company ditched its incredibly popular MagSafe power connector in favor of USB C power. And that Touch Bar! Some like it, others hate it. Either way, the innovation turns away from elegance and simplicity toward awkward interface design and complexity. Most reviewers and users either hate the Touch Bar or like the Touch Bar, but few love it. The keyboard is a mixed bag. Its short key travel thrills some and annoys others. And the touchpad is way too big. Users report constant accidental taps. Apple's attempt to be more elegant and minimalist has had the opposite effect. By offering only four USB C ports, the laptop itself has become simpler. But USB C requires the user to buy ugly, awkward, easy-to-lose dongles and adapters for all those devices and media we use that don't support USB C. Yuck! The best thing that can be said about the MacBook Pro is that it's faster and has a better screen than previous models. But this is inevitable and expected, not revolutionary. There's nothing about this laptop that's going to drive the industry to imitate. Rivals are more likely to see the new MacBook Pro as an opportunity to provide something different, not something similar. Most importantly, is the MacBook Pro worth the price? We'll get to that question in a minute. But first, let's look at all the trends happening this year that conspire against the laptop in general. Flying the unfriendly skies The U.S. and U.K. governments recently banned all non-medical electronic devices larger than a smartphone as carry-on for U.S.-bound flights on specific airlines from specific airports in the Middle East and North Africa. Passengers are required to check their laptops. The ban may have been implemented in response to two recent laptop bomb explosions — one blowing a hole in an airplane flying from from Somalia to Djibouti and the other wounding six people in a Somali airport. These events coincided with intelligence chatter finding increasing sophistication by Al Qaida in building laptop bombs. One congressman said at a recent security conference that more countries would be joining the ban. There are several assumptions we can make about the ban. First, like so many security measures, the ban may spread globally and eventually include all flights. For the next few years, it may become impossible to use a laptop on a commercial flight. Second, such a ban will affect laptop sales. Many travelers won't want to place an expensive laptop in checked luggage for fear of loss or theft. The general fear, uncertainty and doubt around laptops on airplanes is enough to change consumer behavior. And the frequent flier is the laptop industry's best customer base. Third, the ban will be an incentive to develop alternatives so passengers can travel without laptops. Wait, what alternatives? The docking smartphone alternative Samsung announced this week its upcoming Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones, and the public is impressed. But even more impressive is a Galaxy S8 peripheral called the DeX Station. The DeX is a smartphone dock into which you plug a keyboard, mouse and monitor. DeX enables you to use your Galaxy S8 as a desktop PC. (Instead of a monitor, you can also plug in a TV or projector.) The dock outputs at a 4K resolution, and it supports Ethernet for faster connections. I expect some of you business users to buy two — one permanently installed in your office and another in your home office. That would enable you to use your smartphone full time as your only device, even as you benefit from the giant screen, full-size keyboard goodness of a desktop PC everywhere you work. You can take it with you on trips, and use it in hotel rooms to plug into the room's big TV. Years ago, the use of a phone as a desktop PC wasn't practical. But now, thanks to the cloud and the emergence of strong, even enterprise-capable apps for Android phones, a smartphone docking setup makes perfect sense. The DeX Station costs $149.99 and ships in late April, according to Samsung. At that price, you still can get a bigger screen and better keyboard than what you get on a laptop, and at a fraction of the price — even if you have to go out and buy a monitor, keyboard and mouse. It's possible that even Apple may get into the docking racket. Apple last week published a patent application for a clamshell laptop-like device that runs off an iPhone. The iPhone is inserted in the same spot in front of the keyboard where the touchpad now sits on a MacBook Pro. The phone not only powers the device entirely, but you use the iPhone's screen as the touchpad. This would give you the laptop experience without the laptop price. Better still, you'd use iOS instead of OS X, and could use a single device for everything. You can bet that if Samsung and Apple are enabling the use of smartphones instead of desktops or laptops, the rest of the industry will do so as well. In fact, a small company called Andromium, which makes the Andromium OS (an app that gives Android the look and feel of a desktop OS) is offering for pre-order something called the Superbook. It's a $129 laptop-looking "shell," that's powered by an Android phone. I think the practice of docking in general, and docking a smartphone in particular, will go mainstream fast. The smartphone-size laptop alternative Docking isn't a new idea — even docking a smartphone isn't new (consider Microsoft's Continuum, for example). What's likely new is the embrace of docking as a mainstream alternative. Here's another old idea that's about to go mainstream: clamshell smartphones. In 1997, a company called Psion perfected the so-called personal digital assistant, or PDA. Psion did this through amazing industrial design. The Psion Series 5 had a surprisingly large and touch-typeable keyboard. Sadly, this perfection was washed away by the rising mobile phone movement, which replaced PDAs. Now, the same designer who created the Psion Series 5, Martin Riddiford, is re-creating it as a dual-boot Android and Linux smartphone called the Gemini PDA. He's designing it for a company called Planet Computers. Planet Computers The Gemini PDA is a clamshell Android phone that you can use instead of a laptop. While closed, the Gemini PDA can be used as a phone. While open, it can be used as an Android smartphone with a built-in keyboard — or a Linux laptop that fits in your pocket. In fact, the smartphone-size PC idea is emerging more generally, including in the gaming space. Even Apple has a patent for a clamshell iPhone, which uses a bendable screen. If users want a physical, touch-typeable keyboard, in other words, they won't need a laptop to get one. 3 more trends fatal to laptops All these alternatives provide incentives to use smartphones instead of laptops. And there are three more trends — the last of which will close the lid on laptops once and for all. The first fatal trend is that young people are already choosing smartphones over laptops, even without docking and clamshell smartphones. ComScore reports that the use of laptops and desktops among younger people is on the decline. Some 20 percent of millennials use their smartphone as their only computing device, according to a recent report, and this percentage grows each year. Raw demographics alone favor the end of laptops. The second fatal trend is that the industry is champing at the bit to move everything off Intel and onto ARM. (Intel and Intel-compatible chips have powered desktop and laptop platforms for decades; the smartphones and smartphone apps run on ARM chips.) Once laptops, especially laptops from Apple, run ARM chips, they'll run iOS and Android instead of OS X and Windows. And at that point, they'll essentially be identical to docking solutions, but more expensive. The third and final fatal trend can be found in your wallet. Smartphones are becoming amazing. The Galaxy S8 is amazing. And this year's iPhone is expected to be mind-blowing as well. The new phones have cameras that rival DSLRs. They have performance that rivals desktop PCs. They run increasingly amazing apps, including professional-quality apps. Unlike laptops, smartphones are exciting. And they're expensive. Consumers are now ready to pay $700, $800 — even $1,000 and upwards for a phone. (Already a top-of-the-line iPhone 7 with AppleCare costs $1,100. The iPhone 8 is expected to be more expensive.) Consumers will pay this amount because smartphones are worth it. This is especially true if they don't have to shell out $1,500 or more for a laptop as well. Laptops are too boring and expensive. The industry is churning out new designs that enable smartphones as laptop replacements. Young people are favoring smartphones. The industry wants to use smartphone OSes. And consumers are spending more on smartphones, which will make us spend less on laptops. The dominance of laptops is over. You may never buy another laptop. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

But if you don’t need a break from the 24-hour news cycle… Just about every week these days are “Startling Intelligence Revelations” themed, and for this edition House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence chair Devin Nunes spent the last few days defending against accusations that the investigation he’s leading into Russian election meddling is deeply flawed. Take a look at this timeline if you’ve been having trouble keeping up with all the commotion (who hasn’t?). Meanwhile, on Thursday the Senate Intelligence Committee had a public hearing about its own Russian election interference investigation, and Senator Marco Rubio alleged in testimony that in addition to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, his staffers were also the target of Russian hacking during his 2016 bid for president. In other news, the hunt for a nonlethal gun is heating up, Pornhub and sister site YouPorn are both taking the important step of implementing HTTPS encryption, while hackers are still threatening to breach millions of iCloud accounts and even remotely wipe iPhones connected to those accounts. It’s probably bunk, but change your password and enable Apple’s two-factor authentication just in case. Some organizations still struggle to minimally secure their online databases, endangering millions of people’s personal data. And if you’re worried that your internet service provider will sell your online browsing history (you should be, it is) it might be time to consider setting up a VPN. And there’s more. Each Saturday we round up the news stories that we didn’t break or cover in depth but that still deserve your attention. As always, click on the headlines to read the full story in each link posted. And stay safe out there. Hacked Dishwasher Is Yet Another Reminder of IOT Security’s Deep Flaws Last weekend a German security researcher discovered a vulnerability in the internet-connected Miele Professional PG 8528 dishwasher, an industrial “washer-disinfector,” used in facilities like restaurants and hospitals. The bug allows an attacker to access the device, plant malware on it, and potentially use it as a jumping off point to compromise other devices on the dishwasher’s network. Perfectly exemplifying the larger problem with internet of things insecurity, a successful hack of the dishwasher could end up causing problems in a restaurant or have severe consequences in a medical settings. “An unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit this issue to access sensitive information to aide in subsequent attacks,” researcher Jens Regel wrote. There is currently no patch for the bug. Apple Briefly Accepted a Humanitarian App That Tracks Drone Strikes, But Then Rejected It Again An app that sends users push notifications for every new drone strike mentioned in the news has been rejected by Apple’s App Store 13 times. It was approved once before in 2014 after five attempts, and remained live for about a year before Apple pulled it again. Creator Josh Begley (who is also the research editor at The Intercept) reported on Tuesday that the app had finally won approval again—only to be taken down again several hours later. Google Researcher Finds Second Critical Vulnerability in LastPass Password Manager Google researcher Tavis Ormandy discovered a major vulnerability in the password manager LastPass this week that would allow an attacker to access user passwords and even spread malware. Ormandy hasn’t publicly disclosed how the exploit works, but says he found a way to execute code within the LastPass browser extension in all major browsers and on Windows and Linux (it may work on macOS as well). “We are now actively addressing the vulnerability. This attack is unique and highly sophisticated,” LastPass said in a blog post. While LastPass resolves the issue, the company suggests mitigation strategies like launching websites through the LastPass Vault, and enabling two-factor authentication on as many accounts as possible. Ormandy discovered another vulnerability in LastPass two weeks ago, and the service has also been breached in the past. Password managers are naturally subject to extensive scrutiny by researchers and attackers alike, but so many flaws in LastPass, even when addressed quickly, could become a problem for the company. Apple Patches Vulnerability in Server Certificate Validation On Tuesday, Apple released patches for a bug in iOS and macOS that allowed remote code execution in the web server authentication function of the two operating systems. The vulnerability, disclosed by researchers at Cisco’s Talos Intelligence Group, could have allowed an attacker to use malicious certificates to dupe the validation system that checks whether web servers a user is trying to connect to are identifiable and trusted. This could have endangered web browsing, email server connections, and could have allowed an attacker to plant a malicious certificate in a user’s macOS keychain. Go Back to Top.

The twice-broken clock: Never right about the Apple Watch Video Watch SwapBots spring to life thanks to augmented reality Much as April showers bring May flowers, April showers also apparently bring doom and gloom about this year’s iPhones which won’t be arriving for months. So, not so much flowers, more like fertilizer. Writing for the very fine folks and editors and sponsored content and videos you might like at Business Insider, Rob Price gets the help of Gene “Apple is totally making a television set you can believe that, mister” Munster to tell us how terrible the iPhone 8 or 10 or Pro or whatever the heck it’s going to be will be for Apple. “THE $1,000 PHONE: The huge problem Apple must solve before it launches the new iPhone.” (Tip o’ the antlers to Daniel Foss.) HUUUUUGE. Indeed, it is one of the greatest problems of our time. Other than all the others. …a lot is riding on this. And a lot that could go wrong. Booga… [moves six inches closer, does jazz hands] …booga! The Apple Watch, for instance, was supposed to open a new category of consumer wearables, but the devices have appealed to only a small niche. An estimated 25 million is a “small niche”. The Watch outsells the Amazon Echo but the Watch is a failure while the Echo is a hit. OK. No one wants the Apple Watch of phones. No one wants a successful product that owns its category. That sounds like a lot of stress. To be clear: These are not predictions for what Munster, or Business Insider, thinks will happen. So, it’s kind of like the difference between porn and actual sex. Aaaand here comes the pizza delivery guy up the walk! Rather, they're theoretical scenarios that Apple is no doubt discussing internally and that — if they come to pass — could have huge consequences for the most important company in the tech industry. Naturally, they’re all disaster scenarios. Which, you know… Nobody goes to see movies about asteroids that hit the Earth only to explode like a piñata, showering candy everywhere. See? You didn’t even know that was an actual movie from 1998 starring Steven Segal and Teri Hatcher called Candygeddon. Totally faded at the box office. Also, was not an actual movie. [Munster’s] concern is that the rumored high price for the iPhone 10 — about $1,000 — would limit its appeal somewhat. You think? Well, good news, Apple will also be introducing a line of 7s iPhones. Christmas is saved. Long story short, Munster’s concerns are “Very expensive!”, “The tech could flop!” and “New stuff costs money to make!” Of course, these are all brand new concerns and nothing that Apple has ever dealt with before so this all very concerning what with all the concerns. All this disaster porn and no popcorn. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Twitter Facebook It’s not game over for Apple TV -- yet Software updates have kept the device current, but new hardware is essential to besting rivals Michael deAgonia (Computerworld (US)) 01 April, 2017 21:40 - - - - print email Comments Every day. That's how often I use an Apple TV. I have three at home, and one of them always comes with me on vacations. As I type this, my TV is displaying one of those amazing Aerial screen savers (of the Great Wall of China, by the way). I use Apple TV all of the time; that's how I know it needs to get better. Apple TV is an interesting product in Apple's line-up. For much of its lifespan, it was considered a "hobby." That's Apple CEO Tim's Cook's word. Though Apple execs never marketed the device as strongly as they do iPhones and Macs, personally, I was sold the moment iOS supported AirPlay for Apple TV. [ Related: Video review: Apple's new AirPods ] Sure, every major platform ecosystem now has the capability to stream images and video to another device hooked up to a TV, but the ability to do so on the Apple TV debuted almost seven years ago. For me, AirPlay has always the best way to easily display movies and photos on an HDTV, and it was the only way to get iTunes content onto a TV. The integration with other Apple products through AirPlay has been an important feature check for those in the Apple ecosystem. Whenever I considered the alternatives, -- everything from Google Chromecast to Roku and the Amazon Fire Stick -- the fact that I stored my content in iTunes and the convenience of AirPlay gave Apple TV the edge. Software updates, yes. But... As of now, the Apple TV hardware hasn't been updated in 520-plus days and counting. The current model arrived in October 2015. Usually, I'm not concerned about the length of time between updates. Apple has a solid history of supporting its hardware lines with consistent software updates. Case in point: An update for Apple TV arrived on Monday, eliminating the "scrolling through long lists" issue I would have complained about. So it's not as if Apple has abandoned its hobby, like so many Android devices that won't see any updates long before their usefulness is over. Despite a dearth of hardware updates, new features, security updates, and bug fixes continue to trickle in for Apple TV. But there are some things software can't fix, and Apple under Cook seems to have but one priority when it comes to regular hardware updates -- the lucrative iPhone line. Given the revenue the iPhone brings in, this makes sense. But when you consider other products like the Mac Pro -- which hasn't been updated now in three years -- and the Mac mini, the question becomes: What's going on here? To be blunt, I'm concerned that Apple TV is a core product that is being ignored in an era of increased competition from smaller and cheaper alternatives. The iPhone -- the "corest" of Apple products -- is safe from being outgunned by competition because every resource at Apple is dedicated to it. The Mac notebook and iMac lines are beholden to Intel's processor launch schedules, but remain more or less competitive with similarly-specced PCs. But the Mac Pro and Mac mini continue to languish. I don't want the same thing to happen to the Apple TV. It's easy to second-guess Apple's strategy, especially since the public isn't privy to the data corporate decisions are based on. Yet that doesn't change the fact that the Apple TV -- for all of the software updates it's received -- needs major hardware updates if Apple wants to keep the device competitive. It's time for 4K The Apple TV needs 4K support, as soon as possible. I understand why a 4K model hasn't been rushed to market -- mainly because 1080p high-definition is the sweet spot for most TVs. Meeting the demands of most users is a financially sound decision. It's a safe decision. Certainly, the processors capable of decoding 4K video would have eaten into profit margins, or forced higher Apple TV prices. But remember when Apple used to be the forward-thinking company? Okay, maybe that's a tad inflammatory. In many cases, Apple products are (or at one point were) market leaders in forward-thinking. Think about the original iPod, iTunes, the first iPhone and iPads. Or the latest MacBook Pros, and the shift to USB-C ports. Going all in on USB-C was a very 'Bondi Blue iMac' decision by Apple. But I'm concerned about the Apple TV. 4K isn't an inevitable future possibility, it's happening now, in more and more households as potential cord cutters look for viable solutions. Embracing 4K lets current 4K TV owners in the Apple ecosystem use their TVs as God intended, and it gives developers a higher resolution canvas to design for. And in case you haven't noticed, 4K TV sales are soaring as prices plummet. Thankfully, the arrival of 4K on the Apple TV seems to be coming soon. But that's not the only thing needed. ...And gaming? This may be a stretch, but why not ship the Apple TV with game controllers? It doesn't have to be complicated; even something as simple as ancient SNES controllers would work. If Apple were to leverage its position and ship game controllers with the next Apple TV, it would give developers consistent hardware standards to write games around. Right now there are third-party options for controllers -- as well as the capability to use an iPhone as a game controller -- but that's not enough. If Apple wants its Apple TV to be a Trojan horse into the living room, the company needs to give buyers (and developers) something to cheer about. An Apple TV that's also a gaming machine could be a major differentiation from competing devices, and it would allow Apple to attract users who might not want to pay PS4 and Xbox money for gaming. Gaming could and should be treated as part of the next Apple TV's core functionality. There's been much talk over the years about Apple's desire to revolutionize the living room TV with Apple TV, but that hasn't yet happened. An Apple TV revamp doesn't need to reinvent the wheel to gain a bigger foothold; it just has to do what it does now, at higher resolutions and -- if Apple needs to justify a higher starting price -- offer real gaming support. So what's it going to be Apple -- stick with the hobby or get serious? 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Follow him on Twitter at @JLTechWord. He's doing the "write" thing! One thing that irks many passionate Windows phone fans more than almost anything else is Microsoft's apparent lack of passion for its mobile platform. Whether there is or was an actual lack of passion from Microsoft is irrelevant. As a company that hoped for a broad consumer embrace of Windows phones, the perception of disinterest from Microsoft was just as detrimental as an actual lack of the same. Windows phone fans who accuse Microsoft of a less than optimal affection for its mobile efforts often cite a lack of marketing. This accusation certainly seems valid considering what we've seen (and haven't seen) in the way of advertising of Windows phones. This perception is particularly apparent when we consider the amount of marketing that comes from far more successful smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung. But marketing takes many forms, and if you ask Microsoft, it would likely argue the company did invest liberally in marketing Windows phones, just not in the manner one would expect. We'll look at those other marketing methods in this piece and consider if in hindsight Microsoft might do things differently to market its ultimate mobile device: the ultramobile Surface PC. The face of in-your-face marketing You can't forget what never leaves your field of view. Microsoft's competition seems to subscribe to this belief, but Microsoft itself has not embraced that philosophy. Beautiful, well-crafted, seducing iPhone and Samsung Galaxy ads have consistently graced our television screens for years. Knowing that thousands of consumers were being lured into the Apple and Google ecosystems by these seductive ads has been a pain point for Window phone fans. We've been forced to helplessly watch as unrelenting marketing from entrenched market leaders yielded greater market and mindshare for those companies. Many people have concluded that those same efforts, combined with Microsoft's lack of equally consistent investments, led to the decreased market share and mindshare of Windows phones. Lest we forget, Microsoft did come out of the gates running. Early in Windows Phone 7 history, even up to Windows Phone 8, Microsoft and its carrier partners peppered memorable Windows phones ads on TV. This Lumia 1020 commercial is a classic: Those highly visible television spots were less consistent than the persistent flow of ads from rivals Apple and Samsung. Compared to those rivals' connected tapestry of ads that communicated a consistent narrative to consumers, Microsoft's sporadic TV spots were like a collection of disconnected "short stories" that struggled to connect with consumers. Consistency matters. A lack of consistency, therefore, precludes the establishment of a sound foundation. Choosing your battles By the time Microsoft entered the space with its attention-getting attempts, its rivals were entrenched, and consumers were deeply invested in Apple's and Google's ecosystems. The millions of dollars rivals were pouring into television ads were reaffirming messages to the already-converted masses and pulling others into the fold. Perhaps Microsoft deemed the costs of fighting a battle for the iPhone- and Android phone-focused minds of the masses via costly TV spots too risky an endeavor. No one knew about Microsoft's mobile platform with the unique tiled interface, after all. Consequently, Microsoft's television ad campaign strategy would have had to be a persistent, long-lasting and very expensive three-pronged endeavor. First Microsoft would have had to build awareness for a virtually unknown platform in a "noisy" space where consumers didn't think another viable platform existed. Secondly, Microsoft would have had to educate consumers via succinct (approximately 30 seconds) but effective ads about the merits of its unique platform. Third, in a space where consumers only wanted iPhones and Android phones, Microsoft would have had to persuade users that Windows phones were a better option. Microsoft likely calculated a war of TV ads a lost cause. To pry users' hearts and minds from the ads that reaffirmed what they had already embraced with ads that would garner their enduring attention would have required profound creativity and dedication. If rival companies were not already entrenched, and consumers were not already thoroughly aware of and invested in those ecosystems, and Microsoft's efforts did not require building awareness of and educating the masses about an unknown entity, Redmond may have pursued more aggressive television campaigns. Given what Microsoft was up against, however, it likely deemed the probability of success for an ad campaign of that magnitude too low to commit to investing the necessary resources. Thus, Microsoft focused its marketing efforts elsewhere. Connecting products as a marketing strategy During Microsoft's Convergence 2015 event, Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Chris Capossela shared his marketing strategy: ... my second transformation agenda item for Microsoft is this notion of using our amazing innovation engineering resource pool to build marketing into our products. Capossela shared Microsoft's attempts to mimic the success Apple and Google achieved by building marketing into their products. This strategy is designed to lead to an interconnection of products where the use of one product would give rise to the use of another. The following graphic is a snapshot in time. The size of the circles represents how many people were using a particular company's product, and the lines represent the connections between products. Yellow represents Apple, purple Google, and blue Microsoft. Clearly, the crisscrossing network of yellow and purple lines reflect that both Apple and Google succeeded in building connections that lead users from one of the respective company's products to another. Capossela acknowledged how in the U.S., Apple needed only to advertise the iPhone and iPad, and that was sufficient to ensure a user buy-in to Apple's broader ecosystem. Microsoft's clearly-disconnected graph represented a profound need to improve interconnections between its products and services. Capossela said the following: And the beautiful thing about having lots of lines is that you don't have to market all of your products. You only market the locomotives. And then when someone uses your locomotive, it pulls along the cabooses. Build marketing into its products, then acquire, engage and enlist Any Windows phone fan at any stage in the platform's history would agree that Microsoft needed to acquire more Windows phone users. Fans who have bemoaned the lack of aggressive television ad campaigns would certainly agree. They would argue that massive financial investments at the first stage of Capossela's "acquisition, engage and enlist" marketing strategy were necessary. There was even a time when Capossela would have agreed. Acquire Capossela stated the following: How much marketing should I put at the top on acquire, how much should I put in engage, how much should I put in enlist? Think to yourself, if you were spending a dollar on this business, where would you spend it in the funnel? I think most people would say acquire, and that's what I said in the beginning. The reality is we have no issue with acquisition, zero. Tons of people know the brand. I can do a press release, and all of a sudden, 'Oh my gosh, Office is on the iPhone, let me go download Word and Excel and PowerPoint.' Capossela used Microsoft's release of Office for the iPhone and Android, which resulted in tens of thousands of immediate downloads because users knew the brand, as an example. No marketing required. Millions of people use Windows PCs and Microsoft services. People knew the brand. Windows phones were another product in this broadly accepted and deeply integrated, personal and professional ecosystem. Consequently, the company chose a marketing strategy as part of which it hoped to leverage the Microsoft and Windows brands and the integration of the phone in its broadly accepted ecosystem of products and services rather than the heavy marketing of Windows phones at the "acquisition" stage. Microsoft likely perceived Windows as the "locomotive" that would pull the Windows phone "caboose" forward. Engage Microsoft chose to "connect the product lines," such as an initial exclusivity of Cortana on Windows phones. Fans may remember Group Program Manager for Cortana Marcus Ash asserting Cortana exclusivity on Windows phones as a draw to the platform. Other connections were the company's promotion of a default inclusion of Office on Windows phones and limited integration with Xbox games. Given the advantage of hindsight, such a heavy dependence on "engaging" users as a primary marketing method with so little effort at the acquisition stage may have been a naïve miscalculation on Microsoft's part. Microsoft may have overcalculated the strength of its brand in relation to what investments would have been needed to break significantly into the mobile space. Perhaps a more balanced approach would have led to greater success. Especially because Microsoft's strategy also includes bringing the breadth of its software and services to competing platforms, which undercuts exclusivity advantages Windows phones would otherwise have had. Marketing, it's in there Capossela shared how Microsoft seeks to use engineering to build marketing into its products and expend less money on marketing: It's using a resource that we have a lot of, engineering at Microsoft, and it's counterbalancing a resource that we frankly want to spend less on, marketing, in order to get people to experience the full ecosystem and fill out those lines on that blue, purple, orange chart, to really compete ecosystem to ecosystem as opposed to product to product. The Surface, Surface pen and OneNote integration is a great example of how Microsoft leadership got various teams to work together to achieve such a high level of product cohesion. Now that Devices Chief Panos Panay and the Surface team are building Microsoft's ultimate mobile device, can we expect a similar cohesion of current innovations, such as mixed reality and digital inking? Could Microsoft have done more with Windows phones in the past? Capossela stated: One of the things we realized immediately is marketing dollars spent around engagement can be effective, but actually product design is far more effective at getting people to be deeply engaged in your products. That statement assures us of both Microsoft's investments in quality design and of the company's desire to minimize marketing dollars. Apple's and Samsung's philosophies seem to embrace Microsoft's vision for quality of design but also a less reserved approach to aggressive financial investments in marketing. As Microsoft learned from Apple's and Google's integration of services, perhaps a lesson can be gleaned about more liberal marketing expenditures in time for the debut of the ultramobile Surface PC. Enlist The final stage of Capossela's marketing strategy is enlisting. It is at this stage that diehard Windows phone loyalists play an active role. It is also the stage that costs Microsoft nothing in the way of marketing. In fact, it is to this stage that any company hopes to transition a sizable portion of its user base. Apple and Google have acquired, engaged and enlisted hordes of fans who, through word of mouth and other means, passionately advocate for those platforms. The millions of Windows phone fans who make up the less than one percent of the smartphone market are a vocal, passionate but faint whisper among the thunderous rumbles of the competition's enlisted fans. Caposella shared the following about how Microsoft views its fans: Then we figure out what a fan looks like, what is someone who loves our stuff, is loyal to our stuff, and we can enlist them to talk about how they use our products, we can enlist them to be a voice piece, a better voice piece of our company, even though they don't work for our company. Microsoft obviously failed to acquire and engage a relevant number of Windows phone fans. One may wonder how Microsoft might have been able to use its fan base to promote Windows phones if the company had achieved a more impressive measure of success. As it stands now, the company's Insider Program and the program's leader Dona Sarkar are clearly meant to keep fans engaged, and through software build releases keep them talking about the platform. Without the Insider Program, the hopes of many Windows phone fans would have long withered away, and with them, Microsoft's free marketing resource of enlisted fans. History is the best teacher When Microsoft reenters the mobile space, it won't be with a smartphone but (presumably) with an ultramobile Surface PC. As a PC first, with telephony attributes, it will not be positioned to compete directly with smartphones, though it will overlap the smartphone space. This ultramobile Surface PC will be a category-defining device that Microsoft will need to introduce to the masses proactively. Hopefully, the company will have learned from past mistakes that a more balanced marketing approach of television ads combined with the integration of services is more effective than an overreliance on one method over the other. The fact that the ultramobile Surface PC will be part of the Surface family bodes well for the product. Microsoft has been far more aggressive about its advertisements, promotions, partnerships and product placements of Surface PCs than it has been for its phones. Microsoft's confidence in both its Surface brand and its PCs is evident. Smartphones, however, have been the company's Achilles heel. Will Microsoft execute more balanced marketing for its ultimate mobile device? It will be interesting to see if Microsoft will combine its confidence in its Surface brand and PC prowess with a more balanced approach to the marketing of the ultramobile PC. Microsoft has learned from competitors how to engineer marketing into its products. But has the company learned that for certain product categories, television marketing campaigns are likely a necessary supplement to its existing marketing?

Skip TV ads. Go digital with ads on facebook, linkedin, instagram, pinterest, snapchat, and twitter. 2. Put a free Surface cell in the hands of every Microsoft and carrier partner employee. Theirs to keep. 3. Hire secret shoppers and let all retail employees know they're out there. $50 cash on the spot to employees who ask if they've seen the new Surface phone. Another $50 if they post on social media about getting the bonus (so other employees will know it's real). 4. Co-marketing. When I go to ATT's website, I see big slide show images of the latest Samsung or iPhone device they offer. Where's the Surface phone? This is co-marketing. Microsoft pays the carriers to feature their phones. It's not a concept with which Microsoft seems too familiar. 5. Discount volume purchases. If a company has decided to kill BYOD and issue phones, offer discounts just as is done with volume licensing for Microsoft software. 6. I don't know if it's a US thing or a California thing, but here, you have 14 days to return a phone and cancel the purchase. Microsoft should announce they don't think 2 weeks is long enough to fall in love. Offer a 3-month "we'll buy it back, no questions asked" guarantee that you'll love the Surface phone. I spotted a Surface 2-in-1 in Matt Czuchry's hands on the 1st episode of Netflix original Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. Obviously paid placement. But episodes 2-4? All Macs and iPhones. Who dropped the ball on this one? Same goes for early seasons of House of Cards. Frank Underwood had a Windows phone. This is product placement. Microsoft should learn more about it. 0 3 days ago Reply chokiyumi Excellent article Jason! Love your writing style and passion, never boring ^_^. Microsoft needs to strongly focus in advertising their coming line of "surface phone" or ultra mobil pc within the professional/business market. As a counselor, I rely on Windows to get all of my work done. Whether is progress notes at the office, using my surface tablet for demonstration of relaxation techniques to my patients, or doing extra work from my 950xl on the go, such as finishing notes on word or sending my weekly invoice to billing using Excel. I have used pixel c tablet and nexus 6p...true, they are capable of doing what I can do on windows but they lack the raw power of getting things done the way it was meant to be. With apple, same story. People these days have accustomed to the routine of a phone device that has a nice camera, an app store (which 90% of the apps are garbage, money stealing, spyware, and waste of time) and has a brand name that "makes you cool owning one". It is a sad reality and perhaps there is nothing wrong with it. However, Microsoft has so much to offer, why try to compete in such world? Their focus should not be a common mainstream but a professional and reliable mainstream... How? By not comparing it to what is already out there. It needs to advertise it as a category of it's own. As a powerful machine that nothing else out there could be compared to it. By giving productive people a reason to think twice about what a true mobile device can do. Also, I came across an article about the future of apps. It seems like applications are expensive to maintain to companies likes Bank of America, etc. And so they prefer people to use their mobile version of their .com. In a near future, not too far away, perhaps apps will truly disappear in favor of mobile version with quick access, no update required and doesn't take space in your memory. In a world like that, the ultra mobile pc or "surface phone" will truly shine. 0 3 days ago Reply chokiyumi Excellent article Jason! Love your writing style and passion, never boring ^_^.

I know someone is gonna say "lagdroid" but honestly those people probably haven't touched an Android phone since 2012. My S7 edge flies in comparison anything Windows 10 Mobile has put out.

Plenty of people still had yet to buy their first smartphone, and ecosystem/app investment simply is vastly overhyped since we all know more people who have owned a smartphone from more than one ecosystem, than those that have only owned a device from a single ecosystem. Windows Phones had great ads, such as the "The smartphone beta test.. " or the "Smoked by Windows phone". So I don't believe it was marketing. Not was carrier salesmen ignoring WP isn't actually a marketing issue either. The problem, like with many other Microsoft products, they simply failed to follow through. MS expects third parties developers and hardware manufacturers to carry their products to market dominance without a full commitment of first party development beyond the first year or two. Sounds a lot like what happened to W10M, right?

Advertsing is the last piece of the puzzle. You need a good Product, it needs to be Packaged right, Positioned and Priced right too. MS has a different product (W10 OS), lousy packaging (compare 950 to any other flagship) , ok price but no developer support and a totally confused positioning so advertising can do nothing much in this situation. Apple & Google have better products and models. Just accept it and move on. I have owned all the flagship Windows phones and currently use the 950 but the software just doesn't feel stable. And, no, I am not wedded to MS that I have to have a Windows phone. Advertising is not going to sway me, more apps, more stable platform will.

MS needs to bring back the Android bridge for Windows 10 mobile to be successful. With out this one thing it will have a very difficult time getting any traction due to the app gap. Get the users with the Android bridge, THEN concentrate on the developers getting native apps. After this they need combine Xamarin and UWP to make UAP (Universal App Platform). Many will say that Xamarin is already a free part of VS and what ever. The problem is there is too much difference between Xamarin and UWP especially in the GUI. It needs to be truly write once, and deploy to multiple platforms or at least as much as is feasibly possible. Write platform shims for the different operating systems that can then be targeted by a single .net code base. There is some indication that MS is going this way, but it feels like it is taking forever and we don't know how deep this consolidation will go. This is possible. Additionally they need to bring Java and swift as native languages to .net to compliment C# and VB. This will go a long way to attract developers that don't want to go to the bother of learning a new language. Further more they need to create a compliment to UAP that is aimed at native development that covers C, C++, and objective C. Much of this is already there they just need to develop the platform shims that will translate base commands to platform specific commands. If MS does all this, it would crazy not to develop FIRST on Windows then port to other platforms. To further attract users MS needs to flesh out its eco-system. They need to bring Windows holographic to mobile, they need to get more echo competitors to market, they need to get car-play compatibility and if possible get some car companies to adopt native versions of windows in their in car systems. They need to have a better smart home integration possibly even a built in MS developed app that integrates with 3rd party systems. They need to have a cheaper alternative to the xbox for TV, to compete with the roku, amazon fire, and android tv. They also need to work with television manufactures to offer a version of windows built in to a TV. Next thing is MS services need to become platform agnostic. Things like Edge, Groove, Microsoft Video, and Ebooks need to be on all popular operating systems. They need to be the best in their respective classes. They need to extend each of these platforms to third parties so that they can be enhanced by plug-ins and extension to become platforms in their own right. This will inspire platform loyalty through cross platform availability. MS needs to ensure that they service the rest of the world as well as they do the US. They need to know, where ever you are Microsoft will be there too. Basically ecosystem, ecosystem, ecosystem 3 4 days ago Reply finbaar But there is no hardware to run the ecosystem on.

Microsoft will NOT change their ways now. They've realized they messed up in almost every aspect of marketing the phones, from the model selection, to the carrier selection to the sure you can upgrade - sorry you can't.  They spent, what $13 billion dollars on... something. They are not going down that rabbit hole again.  Sure, a Surface phone could be marginally successful and stem the bloodloss, just like Bing when it started out against Google, but Microsoft is not going to spend billions doing it.  The other reason, it's not a phone.  At least that's what the indications point to.  It willl be a multi-function communication and computer device, ergo, the old way of marketing just won't work.  Microsoft may try some new angles.  Maybe they'll follow in HP's footsteps and just cater to enterprise and the remaining hard core fans. Microsoft may learn from it's mistakes, but, like the Band, or heck, even the Zune, we know, it will always be around to make more of them. There will be a smattering of mobile devices.  Die-hard fans will swear by them.  Microsoft will continue to develop new and wonderful things, but what we know now as Microsoft mobile and your traditional smart phone, that ship has sailed.  In the end, "It just doesn't matter". Micorsoft mobile will never be as popular as Android or Apple.  That's not a bad thing, just an inconvenient truth.  1 4 days ago Reply calbro @mongo46; Microsoft's failure happened because they didn't have the mobile market at heart because of their entrenchment in the enterprise world and make a boat load of $. They had the product line(920,1020,1520 and later 950) and a very good Nokia staff that actually had the market growing but I believe insiders at Microsoft warred against going after the mobile arena which also is very progressive which is not a fit in a slowed conservative habitat inside of Microsoft's managerial heiarchy which Balmer had to fight against something I don't think alot of folks recognized and that is what capsized the mobile strategy. This infighting is what lead to the Vista fiasco of releasing a new OS after the busiest shopping season of the year rather waiting which would have allowed time for drivers development for products  which made no marketing sense. The new CEO let a lot of them go something perhaps Balmer should have done instead of dealing with those stiff conservative minded executives who had to much power which led to disaster and a company having to rebuild a positvie image. 0 4 days ago Reply Great deal +1020 0 4 days ago Reply peterh_oz Every second advert has logos for the Apple & Android app stores, because they're the only apps being built.

Because the marketing in all markets suggested it would work for all languages, which never really came true, and is still a problem. For many markets I think windows phone because of this, got a negative image of false promises and would look and feel like a half baked product. Marketing is tough business. I don't think there is a golden solution, and a lot is still luck. I think word of mouth is still the best marketing. So the fans and wi dows mobile livers will remain a valuable group. I think what would help the most if microsoft could show fans and lovers for windows mobile and 10 a a well rounded build for once. Granted windows 10 is still an ever evolving OS, but I do believe there is such a thing as a polished and "finished" version within that model. So farI haven't seen or experienced a build that met that criterion to date. I think if microsoft could wow the fans with that I believe the adoption rate and satisfaction and install base would increase greatly. 0 4 days ago Reply hotphil Whilst I agree with many points in this piece, there's the usual elephant outside the room: This piece and Microsoft continue to miss the fact that there are markets and customers outside the US. MS can have the best product and marketing in the world, but if they keep to the same policy of excluding most of the world then they may as well not bother. In fact, it's counter-productive: in this global age potential consumers get to hear of products wherever they are launched, but potential MS customers then always find out that MS aren't making stuff available in their territory so they head off to see if there's any alternatives that are available in their market. 2 4 days ago Reply Moses D You nailed it brother!

They've already let it fall out of the minds of customers. They've delayed it too long. They've allowed the 950 and W10M make even their most devout follwoers doubt Microsoft's commitment. Marketing is going to be meaningless if there's no tangible proof of commitment. For the customer base Microsoft has a shot with, marketing isn't the key. IF it were about marketing, this site would have died long ago, as we would have left for iOS and Android. Enterprise customers will want to see what it can do, more than hear what it might be able to do someday. Marketing was the failure point of WP7 and WP8. Since then, it's been less about marketing and less about production. Why am I likely to (at least temporarily) go Android in 2017? It's not because Microsoft hasn't marketed to me well. It's because they've fallen totally silent, allowed mediocre hardware to be the only option, and shown very little progress on mobile software, thanks to kicking the mobile can down the road both at RS1 last summer and RS2 this spring. 0 4 days ago Reply five-one-three Its honestly much better to widen the gap between Windows Phone and the Surface Phone, they dont want it to be saddled with the failures of Windows Phone as it wont run that OS.

I've gone through WinCE, Palm, Blackberry, iPhone, Nokia Lumia 1020, and back to iPhone. Functionality the 1020 was the best but as companies, like Delta, began dropping support for the OS, my experience became tedious. As far as connections are concerned, Windows still provides me with the best experience. My desktop, laptop, and Lumia were seamless, even more so than is my Apple system. I know I'm whining but I like my apps. My 1020 worked flawlessly with my Toyota Entune system,  even allowing me to respond to text via voice recorder recognition. My iPhone has never done that! But where did my apps go? I really like live tiles and could rearrange them to suit my travel needs. The dedicated camera button was amazing. I never missed a shot fumbling with my phone and never needed to carry a travel camera. But I missed my apps. I guess MS never saw "Field of Dreams."

When a consumer sees a product placement after having seen a commercial for the same product, only then does the affirmation for the brand occur and the desire for purchase reinforced.  If Microsoft continues to invest in product placments then they also need to develop high intrigue consumer ads in order to make those product placements effective and cost efficient. 1 4 days ago Reply M_A_Adams I don't think they want to learn from the past!  Nor do I think that Nadella really cares if the mobile product succeeds -- if it fails then, oh well, it was started before him therefore not his fault. Sort of what the republicans are saying about Obamacare!  The problem is that MS doesn't really know how to market these products.  I think the problem was that Windows 8 was so hated by the critics (even though it was a solid OS) that they skipped on trying to point out how you could make all your devices work in a very similar way!  That marketing might have save the RT by the way.  Just like the tablet and desktops, it showed an issue with their marketing that popped up with (I think) Vista.  Previous to that, all major OS release came with tremendous fanfare as well as ways to not only show off all the new features, but also to teach the people the basics of how to use them.  Unfortunately, I think for whatever reason, be it budget, personnel, or a combination of them -- either they are not capable of selling or truly do not care. -1 4 days ago Reply Garry Terry I want a phone, not a phablet, I want a phone. I want a phone that will do all the cool stuff, but I want something small enough to comfortably carry or wear on a belt. I also want an operating system that is NOT droid or iOS. So, that leads us to a Windows device. Call it anything you want, but don't forget that mobile can mean lots of things to different folks. To me it means phone. To have one device with decent battery life that is rugged, waterproof and has good sound volume and runs Windows 10 Mobile would be great. I love my Verizon Lumia 735, but would never carry it on heavy equipment with greasy hands. Microsoft has developed/made fantastic phones (as well as plenty of other stuff). Marketing of their phones was slack. For years I went into different cell phone stores asking for a Windows phone, only to get laughed at or told "why?" when I told the sales associate that I wanted a Windows phone. More ofthen than not they had them in a back room in the store and rarely on display. What will fix that? Demand, incentives and training sales staff  to beome proficient on a Windows OS.

I enjoy the removable back (I got 5 back covers to rotate the look), external storage, and the usual great camera. There are also drawbacks though that sometimes do give me headaches, such as the subpar speakers, grainy front camera (I'm not sure if this is just me but selfies don't look great at all under darker lighting), and of course the random reboots here and there (obviously I've signed myself for that when I step onboard with Windows 10 mobile, INSIDERS FAST but still..).

I was starting to worry that my phone might have faulty BT, but then it seems to work fine with FitBit Charge 2 and - ironically - with my old BT headset for Playstation 3. Luckily, I don't require BT much on my personal phone... still, it is disappointing that one of basic phone features nowadays somehow has managed to devolve, and on flagship phones.

If your going to go where the people are then why are you starting a brand new mobile OS? People are not going to be there for sure. You need to support this platform with your own dedicated (and preferably exclusive) offerings until you get more people. But they went through with their strategy anyway. They released software for Apple that didn't make it to the phone until way later, they released useful apps like the authenticator for Android first and in the meantime gave their fans essentially a place holder of an app until way later. Then they started changing the UI of the phone to be more friendly to those who use Apple or Android systems, cutting off features that made the OS fresh and unique. Trying desperately to please everyone from other platforms while stripping away everything that made Windows on phone interesting, more functional and different from the rest. Thus ******* of the fans further. So what did the fans do? They went "where the people are". And that wasn't on Windows Mobile.

It's still going to be a 5 to 6 inch device with glass on the front, camera on the back, speakers, etc.  Some thought watches or Hololens type devices would take this space over, but I don't that's going to happen for a variety of reasons. I can't read a comic book, watch Netlfix or flip through Facebook photos on a watch. I could on a Hololens and it'd be neat, but then I have this thing on my head all day long.  0 4 days ago Reply nikon133 Well... depends on how you look at tech. I think that laptops were next to desktops, once tech improved to a level where it can be portable. Tablets and convertibles were next to laptops. That said, having new format does not necessarily kill old one - it branches out, sort of. As you have said, at some point existing tech matures to a level where improvements are incremental within same form factor, but new form factors are made possible by tech improvements. I think there is next for mobile. There are wearables. Augmented reality. Phones actually capable to replace computers in meaningful way, easy to carry around, used as computer in office, plugged to full size peripherals through docking station. Convertible phones? Microsoft and partners have given us a glimpse where mobiles can go - Continuum dock for 950/950 XL, desktop dock and laptop "shell" for HP Elite X3 (with cloud-virtualised desktop apps)... ... but, in order to go further in these new directions, Windows Mobile has to be strong. Branches need to be healthy in order to grow, metaphorically speaking. Otherwise they wither and fall off. Kind of like what is happening to current Windows Mobile branch, sadly. In their infancy, new formats need that initial value before new ideas they are built on take off and mature; compatibility with previous format, strong ecosystem (even if legacy one)... a beachead. Who would buy, say, Playstation VR, if Sony has released it with new console, with no marketshare and very few games available? But as it was released into existing PS4 world, with big user base and many games available (legacy games with no VR support) it has much easier job to grow. It has identity. Visibility. A chance, I think. 1 4 days ago Reply John Bagg Great article Jason.  It seems that the 1020 was the last major marketing push.  Windows phone was the only smart phone I ever owned until last year, all the way back to the BlackJack.  Sold the 950 on Ebay, and bought a used Galaxy.  I became so frustrated with Microsoft's apparent lack of care for my loyalty, that when Belfiore used the iPhone to tweet, and my continual begging of my bank to develop a Windows app was finally answered with a resounding "No", I gave up.  Ironically, it was about a month before Mary Jo Foley gave up on her phone.  Why did I leave?

But really, 15% in Italy doesn't get them anywhere, especially since none of the high end devices sold at all and sales dropped soon after as the Moto G and other Android phones caught up on the low end.

I didn't see it, but that would explain why it was so popular. Any other tv ads for other models? No...and it's reflected in how well It's sold and known in the general population. As for targeting enterprise...do you know how long it takes enterprise to adopt to new hardware? The company I'm working for is still using some hardware from last decade, and has only recently seen new technologies starting to be used, like servers running ssd hard drives, and even Windows 10 on a few test PCs...people passing by the PC ask, is that an IMac? Otherwise its still Windows 7 in the office, and cash registers using Windows XP POS edition in the stores (which I assume and hope is still supported by MS), again last decade stuff. We are using more of Microsoft's cloud technologies as our old servers running Outlook and Office break down (I guess it's cheaper than buying and maintaining the hardware and software updates). But phones are hardware, and half of the phones used are Samsung S4, the other half is the S7. So if Microsoft is hoping our company to adopt Windows phones, it won't happen until at least 2020 when we have to replace half of the S7s that we have. On the other hand Consumers will adopt new technology either now or next year when the price drops to 50% of what it is this year. If they have to wait longer, it's already forgotten in favor of the next cycle of technology. Unfortunately, Microsoft has chosen to "retrench" their phones just outside that window of consumer consciousness and so its been forgotten by all but the fans...which will probably only hold for another year, tops, before the rate of dropout for fans reaches almost 100% 2 4 days ago Reply bub78 Yes, the 1020 ad focused on the 41mp camera.

Even if that device existed, the amount of marketing and reassurance they would have to provide to the public isn't overcomable in my opinion.  The only way for them to gain consumer confidence is to display some themselves.  They should start releasing phones, 1st party apps, 1st party games, and keep even current users interested.  I understand they want to put everything on hold (at least on the hardware side) but that was their worst mistake.  Keeping at least some new devices in the low range and mid range category would have brought SOME attention to the platform now that people are starting to be a little more open to the Windows 10 OS. 8 4 days ago Reply DrunkasaurusRex I agree 100%. A foldable phone that runs Windows x86 apps on ARM would be really cool but it would be so out of the ordinary that we definitely would have heard about it by now.

They're positioning HoloLens in that space too, and I'm sure if it's successful there we'll see a commercial release the same way we saw computers slowly creep into every home, we'll see HoloLens do the same thing.

WP7 was a decent start, but then telling all 7 users they were on a dead-end device when they announced WP8 was horrible, especially to any who had recently bought a Nokia 900.  The "partnerships" with the carriers may have been somewhat necessary, but the employees didn't care about WP devices unless you specifically asked for one.  I think if they could have built up better mindshare and not messed w/ their fan base, more apps would have followed.

Given that Microsoft's marketing of its mobile devices is something that consistently comes under fire in this community this article which gives a picture of how Microsoft markets and has marketed (which isn't covered much anywhere else to this extent and depth) while also incorporating the company's future mobile efforts that interest the community is relevant. My passion as a writer, particularly within this setting, are often a drive to inform and provide context to the readers. All readers here have varying degrees of knowledge about the things we talk about here (as do we writers of course). Thus many of the readers of this piece may not have been aware of Capossela's marketing strategy to incorporate marketing into products in luei of a television campaign. Informing the thousands of readers who may not have know that may have helped them see Microsoft's marketing strategy in a different light. Furthermore, it may have helped them to set expectations about how a potential Surface may be marketed if Microsoft continues with this strategy. Or it may have equipped readers who didn't know with more information so that they can contribute to the ongoing dialogue of MS mobile efforts in a more informed manner. I like to help elevate the conversation, give people a little more to think about than the rhetoric in an echo chamber. 🙂 3 4 days ago Reply bleached At what point is marketing not the answer and you just need a better product?

No Google Maps, 3rd party clearly inferior.  Eventually, biggest mistakes were made by Microsoft themselves. In situation where PC market is saturated and Microsoft cannot grow much further - they are, what, 10% short of having it completely, give or take? - they should have really focused on mobile market. Give OS for free. Give OEMs more flexibility. Aggressively pay devs to port popular apps to Windows Phone. And market it like there's no tomorrow. Other thing MS hasn't done successfully was tying WP to whole MS ecosystem. With almost everyone having Windows PC, they should have found a way to make Windows Phone must-have for Windows computer users. Offer better WinTunes and Store (iTunes are crappy on PC, but still big part of iPhone success). Buy YouTube before Google did, and invest heavily in other media.

Whereas on android, they they needed to show what their devices' could do that devices from other OEMs couldnt ...there was features and UI to compete for. ...and had they advertised both device's it was only going to make WP look worse. As much as I loved it back then, Android was feature and app rich. 0 4 days ago Reply techiez and the few unique features that Lumia was able to get was due Nokia literally hacking the OS to put features onto it. 0 3 days ago Reply kenzibit Panos Panay's intro to the Lumia 950/XL was spectacular imo.

The Lumia 950 introduction was nothing more than an afterthought and certainly not spectacular. Part of that is that the phon ewas so far removed from where he was (going) with Surface and he was probably just told to include it. The big problem is that for Mobile to succeed you need to be able to reach out to and understand consumers, neither of which Microsoft is capable of. The Surface phone will _not_ be your average joe smart phone, it will be a fairly pricey and powerful device geared comepletely towards enterprise. If any consumers want to hop on fine, but it's not the focus, never was and never will be. 3 4 days ago Reply 19Michael87 He did present it with passion though, he sold me on the device!

I think he did a god job of presenting them considering he knew they were dead products. He knew MS made them just to get something out there and they were not going to put any marketing behind them. He also knew that only 1 of them was going to be carried by a carrier and even then, only 1 carrier. Kinda hard to get excited about presenting a product knowing all of those things. 3 4 days ago Reply Podster16 Days?

The introduction of the 950/XL convinced me even then that Microsoft had squandered any talent it got from Nokia and was vomiting on their own product.  W10M has been almost a complete disappointment to me and my wife, after having been HUGE cheerleaders of both WP7 and WP8.  Somehow, both my wife and I allowed ourselves to be convinced to throw away a total of $1200 on a pair of Lumia 950 devices. And we have regretted it daily. Despite having what was then the latest hardware, the camera was a huge disappointment compared to my 1020, and the performance of W10 on the device is quite a bit slower than WP8.1 on my 1020 (with exception of the camera app itself).  Even on the latest build, 15063, I can run things side by side and the 1020 just leaves the 950 in the dust.  So, I have really very little confidence MS knows what it's doing here.  I have a Surface Pro 3 and my wife has the SP4, and we love these devices.  But I just don't believe that MS will come out with a smartphone (or WHATEVER they are going to call it) that's as impressive.  I want a device with a camera that is so much better than the competition that there's no debate. If I'm going to have to put up with how horrible the user experience is in W10M, the device better be a LOT snappier.  And if the design and solidness of the hardware is going to be like the 950 or like every other Android device, then there's just no point. 11 4 days ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Twitter The laptop is dead Here's my open-and-shut case on why the venerable laptop is on its way out Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 01 April, 2017 22:00 - - - - print email Comments You may never buy another laptop. Ten years ago, laptop sales overtook desktop PC sales to become the dominant hardware platform for computing. Now smartphones are about to do to laptops what laptops did to desktops. But wait, you may ask. What's wrong with laptops? Apple has run out of good laptop ideas For the past decade, Apple has led and dominated the laptop market with design and innovation. The company has been moving toward better quality, so-called "Retina" screens. Apple’s keyboard designs and unibody aluminum construction have been heavily imitated. The company used to dazzle the industry by sweating the small stuff, like the MagSafe power connector and lights that shine through aluminum. It's not just that Apple innovated. It's that its laptop innovations evolved their products toward elegance and usability. And that's over. After years without a significant new laptop design, their latest release, last year's MacBook Pro, landed with a thud. The laptop was seriously underpowered — called by some a MacBook Air at a MacBook Pro price. The company ditched its incredibly popular MagSafe power connector in favor of USB C power. And that Touch Bar! Some like it, others hate it. Either way, the innovation turns away from elegance and simplicity toward awkward interface design and complexity. Most reviewers and users either hate the Touch Bar or like the Touch Bar, but few love it. The keyboard is a mixed bag. Its short key travel thrills some and annoys others. And the touchpad is way too big. Users report constant accidental taps. Apple's attempt to be more elegant and minimalist has had the opposite effect. By offering only four USB C ports, the laptop itself has become simpler. But USB C requires the user to buy ugly, awkward, easy-to-lose dongles and adapters for all those devices and media we use that don't support USB C. Yuck! The best thing that can be said about the MacBook Pro is that it's faster and has a better screen than previous models. But this is inevitable and expected, not revolutionary. There's nothing about this laptop that's going to drive the industry to imitate. Rivals are more likely to see the new MacBook Pro as an opportunity to provide something different, not something similar. Most importantly, is the MacBook Pro worth the price? We'll get to that question in a minute. But first, let's look at all the trends happening this year that conspire against the laptop in general. Flying the unfriendly skies The U.S. and U.K. governments recently banned all non-medical electronic devices larger than a smartphone as carry-on for U.S.-bound flights on specific airlines from specific airports in the Middle East and North Africa. Passengers are required to check their laptops. The ban may have been implemented in response to two recent laptop bomb explosions — one blowing a hole in an airplane flying from from Somalia to Djibouti and the other wounding six people in a Somali airport. These events coincided with intelligence chatter finding increasing sophistication by Al Qaida in building laptop bombs. One congressman said at a recent security conference that more countries would be joining the ban. There are several assumptions we can make about the ban. First, like so many security measures, the ban may spread globally and eventually include all flights. For the next few years, it may become impossible to use a laptop on a commercial flight. Second, such a ban will affect laptop sales. Many travelers won't want to place an expensive laptop in checked luggage for fear of loss or theft. The general fear, uncertainty and doubt around laptops on airplanes is enough to change consumer behavior. And the frequent flier is the laptop industry's best customer base. Third, the ban will be an incentive to develop alternatives so passengers can travel without laptops. Wait, what alternatives? The docking smartphone alternative Samsung announced this week its upcoming Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones, and the public is impressed. But even more impressive is a Galaxy S8 peripheral called the DeX Station. The DeX is a smartphone dock into which you plug a keyboard, mouse and monitor. DeX enables you to use your Galaxy S8 as a desktop PC. (Instead of a monitor, you can also plug in a TV or projector.) The dock outputs at a 4K resolution, and it supports Ethernet for faster connections. I expect some of you business users to buy two — one permanently installed in your office and another in your home office. That would enable you to use your smartphone full time as your only device, even as you benefit from the giant screen, full-size keyboard goodness of a desktop PC everywhere you work. You can take it with you on trips, and use it in hotel rooms to plug into the room's big TV. Years ago, the use of a phone as a desktop PC wasn't practical. But now, thanks to the cloud and the emergence of strong, even enterprise-capable apps for Android phones, a smartphone docking setup makes perfect sense. The DeX Station costs $149.99 and ships in late April, according to Samsung. At that price, you still can get a bigger screen and better keyboard than what you get on a laptop, and at a fraction of the price — even if you have to go out and buy a monitor, keyboard and mouse. It's possible that even Apple may get into the docking racket. Apple last week published a patent application for a clamshell laptop-like device that runs off an iPhone. The iPhone is inserted in the same spot in front of the keyboard where the touchpad now sits on a MacBook Pro. The phone not only powers the device entirely, but you use the iPhone's screen as the touchpad. This would give you the laptop experience without the laptop price. Better still, you'd use iOS instead of OS X, and could use a single device for everything. You can bet that if Samsung and Apple are enabling the use of smartphones instead of desktops or laptops, the rest of the industry will do so as well. In fact, a small company called Andromium, which makes the Andromium OS (an app that gives Android the look and feel of a desktop OS) is offering for pre-order something called the Superbook. It's a $129 laptop-looking "shell," that's powered by an Android phone. I think the practice of docking in general, and docking a smartphone in particular, will go mainstream fast. The smartphone-size laptop alternative Docking isn't a new idea — even docking a smartphone isn't new (consider Microsoft's Continuum, for example). What's likely new is the embrace of docking as a mainstream alternative. Here's another old idea that's about to go mainstream: clamshell smartphones. In 1997, a company called Psion perfected the so-called personal digital assistant, or PDA. Psion did this through amazing industrial design. The Psion Series 5 had a surprisingly large and touch-typeable keyboard. Sadly, this perfection was washed away by the rising mobile phone movement, which replaced PDAs. Now, the same designer who created the Psion Series 5, Martin Riddiford, is re-creating it as a dual-boot Android and Linux smartphone called the Gemini PDA. He's designing it for a company called Planet Computers. Planet Computers The Gemini PDA is a clamshell Android phone that you can use instead of a laptop. While closed, the Gemini PDA can be used as a phone. While open, it can be used as an Android smartphone with a built-in keyboard — or a Linux laptop that fits in your pocket. In fact, the smartphone-size PC idea is emerging more generally, including in the gaming space. Even Apple has a patent for a clamshell iPhone, which uses a bendable screen. If users want a physical, touch-typeable keyboard, in other words, they won't need a laptop to get one. 3 more trends fatal to laptops All these alternatives provide incentives to use smartphones instead of laptops. And there are three more trends — the last of which will close the lid on laptops once and for all. The first fatal trend is that young people are already choosing smartphones over laptops, even without docking and clamshell smartphones. ComScore reports that the use of laptops and desktops among younger people is on the decline. Some 20 percent of millennials use their smartphone as their only computing device, according to a recent report, and this percentage grows each year. Raw demographics alone favor the end of laptops. The second fatal trend is that the industry is champing at the bit to move everything off Intel and onto ARM. (Intel and Intel-compatible chips have powered desktop and laptop platforms for decades; the smartphones and smartphone apps run on ARM chips.) Once laptops, especially laptops from Apple, run ARM chips, they'll run iOS and Android instead of OS X and Windows. And at that point, they'll essentially be identical to docking solutions, but more expensive. The third and final fatal trend can be found in your wallet. Smartphones are becoming amazing. The Galaxy S8 is amazing. And this year's iPhone is expected to be mind-blowing as well. The new phones have cameras that rival DSLRs. They have performance that rivals desktop PCs. They run increasingly amazing apps, including professional-quality apps. Unlike laptops, smartphones are exciting. And they're expensive. Consumers are now ready to pay $700, $800 — even $1,000 and upwards for a phone. (Already a top-of-the-line iPhone 7 with AppleCare costs $1,100. The iPhone 8 is expected to be more expensive.) Consumers will pay this amount because smartphones are worth it. This is especially true if they don't have to shell out $1,500 or more for a laptop as well. Laptops are too boring and expensive. The industry is churning out new designs that enable smartphones as laptop replacements. Young people are favoring smartphones. The industry wants to use smartphone OSes. And consumers are spending more on smartphones, which will make us spend less on laptops. The dominance of laptops is over. You may never buy another laptop. Join the TechWorld newsletter!

Twitter It’s not game over for Apple TV -- yet Software updates have kept the device current, but new hardware is essential to besting rivals Michael deAgonia (Computerworld (US)) 01 April, 2017 21:40 - - - - print email Comments Every day. That's how often I use an Apple TV. I have three at home, and one of them always comes with me on vacations. As I type this, my TV is displaying one of those amazing Aerial screen savers (of the Great Wall of China, by the way). I use Apple TV all of the time; that's how I know it needs to get better. Apple TV is an interesting product in Apple's line-up. For much of its lifespan, it was considered a "hobby." That's Apple CEO Tim's Cook's word. Though Apple execs never marketed the device as strongly as they do iPhones and Macs, personally, I was sold the moment iOS supported AirPlay for Apple TV. [ Related: Video review: Apple's new AirPods ] Sure, every major platform ecosystem now has the capability to stream images and video to another device hooked up to a TV, but the ability to do so on the Apple TV debuted almost seven years ago. For me, AirPlay has always the best way to easily display movies and photos on an HDTV, and it was the only way to get iTunes content onto a TV. The integration with other Apple products through AirPlay has been an important feature check for those in the Apple ecosystem. Whenever I considered the alternatives, -- everything from Google Chromecast to Roku and the Amazon Fire Stick -- the fact that I stored my content in iTunes and the convenience of AirPlay gave Apple TV the edge. Software updates, yes. But... As of now, the Apple TV hardware hasn't been updated in 520-plus days and counting. The current model arrived in October 2015. Usually, I'm not concerned about the length of time between updates. Apple has a solid history of supporting its hardware lines with consistent software updates. Case in point: An update for Apple TV arrived on Monday, eliminating the "scrolling through long lists" issue I would have complained about. So it's not as if Apple has abandoned its hobby, like so many Android devices that won't see any updates long before their usefulness is over. Despite a dearth of hardware updates, new features, security updates, and bug fixes continue to trickle in for Apple TV. But there are some things software can't fix, and Apple under Cook seems to have but one priority when it comes to regular hardware updates -- the lucrative iPhone line. Given the revenue the iPhone brings in, this makes sense. But when you consider other products like the Mac Pro -- which hasn't been updated now in three years -- and the Mac mini, the question becomes: What's going on here? To be blunt, I'm concerned that Apple TV is a core product that is being ignored in an era of increased competition from smaller and cheaper alternatives. The iPhone -- the "corest" of Apple products -- is safe from being outgunned by competition because every resource at Apple is dedicated to it. The Mac notebook and iMac lines are beholden to Intel's processor launch schedules, but remain more or less competitive with similarly-specced PCs. But the Mac Pro and Mac mini continue to languish. I don't want the same thing to happen to the Apple TV. It's easy to second-guess Apple's strategy, especially since the public isn't privy to the data corporate decisions are based on. Yet that doesn't change the fact that the Apple TV -- for all of the software updates it's received -- needs major hardware updates if Apple wants to keep the device competitive. It's time for 4K The Apple TV needs 4K support, as soon as possible. I understand why a 4K model hasn't been rushed to market -- mainly because 1080p high-definition is the sweet spot for most TVs. Meeting the demands of most users is a financially sound decision. It's a safe decision. Certainly, the processors capable of decoding 4K video would have eaten into profit margins, or forced higher Apple TV prices. But remember when Apple used to be the forward-thinking company? Okay, maybe that's a tad inflammatory. In many cases, Apple products are (or at one point were) market leaders in forward-thinking. Think about the original iPod, iTunes, the first iPhone and iPads. Or the latest MacBook Pros, and the shift to USB-C ports. Going all in on USB-C was a very 'Bondi Blue iMac' decision by Apple. But I'm concerned about the Apple TV. 4K isn't an inevitable future possibility, it's happening now, in more and more households as potential cord cutters look for viable solutions. Embracing 4K lets current 4K TV owners in the Apple ecosystem use their TVs as God intended, and it gives developers a higher resolution canvas to design for. And in case you haven't noticed, 4K TV sales are soaring as prices plummet. Thankfully, the arrival of 4K on the Apple TV seems to be coming soon. But that's not the only thing needed. ...And gaming? This may be a stretch, but why not ship the Apple TV with game controllers? It doesn't have to be complicated; even something as simple as ancient SNES controllers would work. If Apple were to leverage its position and ship game controllers with the next Apple TV, it would give developers consistent hardware standards to write games around. Right now there are third-party options for controllers -- as well as the capability to use an iPhone as a game controller -- but that's not enough. If Apple wants its Apple TV to be a Trojan horse into the living room, the company needs to give buyers (and developers) something to cheer about. An Apple TV that's also a gaming machine could be a major differentiation from competing devices, and it would allow Apple to attract users who might not want to pay PS4 and Xbox money for gaming. Gaming could and should be treated as part of the next Apple TV's core functionality. There's been much talk over the years about Apple's desire to revolutionize the living room TV with Apple TV, but that hasn't yet happened. An Apple TV revamp doesn't need to reinvent the wheel to gain a bigger foothold; it just has to do what it does now, at higher resolutions and -- if Apple needs to justify a higher starting price -- offer real gaming support. So what's it going to be Apple -- stick with the hobby or get serious? Join the TechWorld newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

By Mukul Sharma  |   Published: 03rd December 2016 01:10 PM  |   Last Updated: 03rd December 2016 01:10 PM  |   A+A A-   |   0 Share Via Email Let’s say you’re driving in your fancy stretch limo to a particular destination, wherever the heck that is. The only assumption is that you’re free to drive at any speed you choose (I mean it’s your car for the love of Mike) with no traffic jams or cops out on the take to nab you. For the first half of the journey (and by half I mean half the overall distance between the starting point and your finishing point) you drive at 20 kilometres per hour. You then realise that it’s all taking way, way much too long, and that you’re going to be majorly late for your serious and favourite mob meeting. You therefore decide that you’re going to increase your speed so that your overall average speed for the whole journey will be 40 kilometres per hour. How fast do you have to drive for the remaining part of your journey in order for your average speed for the whole journey to be 40 kmph? (Incidentally and strangely enough the answer’s the same, whatever the total distance of your journey.) THROUGHPUT  (The overbaked problem of yesterweek was: “A PEAR, an APPLE, a LEMON and a BANANA all add up to an ORANGE. If each letter represents a number between 0 and 9 -- both inclusive -- solve the equation.”). The answer to PEAR + APPLE + LEMON + BANANA = ORANGE is 9782 + 89947 + 47530 + 180808 = 328067. It was a tough one even by Googling standards and required sheer force. Phew! -- Charanjit Singh Pardesi, cspardesi@gmail.com. This can be solved by using a computer running C language. After compiling and running the program, the computer solves the equation denoted by the letters to allocate a corresponding number to the numeric variables that reads as N = 0, B = 1, R = 2, O = 3, L = 4, M = 5, G = 6, E = 7, A = 8 and P = 9. The numeric equation then transforms into 9782 (PEAR) + 89947 (APPLE) + 47530 (LEMON) + 180808 (BANANA) = 328067 (ORANGE) thereby solving the riddle. -- Shashi Shekher Thakur, shashishekher@yahoo.com. (The second half-baked one was: “Okay so you’ve managed to get that peeled hardboiled egg into a wide-ish necked bottle. How do you get it out now without breaking the bottle? Two answers are preferable but even one will do.”) One of the best methods to remove an egg from a bottle is to tilt the bottle such  that the egg comes to the opening and then to blow air inside the bottle with your mouth. This causes air pressure behind the egg to rise and eventually the egg comes out. -- ReubenRomal Thomas, reubenromal123@gmail.com Another method would be to apply oil to the inside of the mouth of the bottle, hold it upside down in one hand and bring it down smartly across your other arm (much like handing a bottle of thick ketchup which refuses to budge in the normal way). -- Kishore Rao, kishoremrao@hotmail.com. The egg can be taken out by increasing the pressure inside the bottle in two ways: (1) invert the bottle; now the egg will be at the neck and just closing it. Then heat the top end of the bottle and the egg will come out pushed by the hot air inside. (2) Hold the bottle horizontally and blow air strongly into the bottle and quickly tilt it slightly so that the egg just closes the opening and watch it comes out of the bottle. -- Ramesh Kumar, rameshkumarthayyil@gmail.com. (The unbaked third problem was to get an unpeeled hardboiled egg into a similarly necked bottle without breaking the shell -- plus how to get the contents of an egg out without breaking the shell.) First soak the egg in vinegar which softens the shell. Then light a taper inside the bottle and take the vinegar-soaked egg and put it on the top of the bottle. The fire can’t live without any oxygen so it will try to suck it from the entrance. When the fire does this it sucks the egg into the bottle. -- Narayana Murty Karri, k_n_murty@yahoo.com. Simply put it under a hen. The contents (young chick) will break the shell when it is ready to come out! -- Dhruv Narayan, dhruv510@gmail.com BUT GOOGLE THIS NOW 1.

The iPhone 5 is getting older which puts a greater importance on each update Apple releases for the former flagship. iOS updates for older devices can have a dramatic impact on performance. Sometimes its positive. Sometimes, unfortunately, its negative. Apple’s latest update to the iPhone 5 is a huge milestone upgrade. Its much larger than the iOS 10.2.1 update that came before it. If you’re making the move to iOS 10.3 from the iOS 10.2.1 update, your iOS 10.3 update will be substantial, several hundred megabytes. If you’re coming from something older than iOS 10.2.1 you can expect your update to be even bigger thanks to the features and fixes from previous iOS upgrades. They are baked into the iPhone 5’s iOS 10.3 update. This roundup will take you through our impressions of the iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 update’s performance and it will guide you through some of the key things to keep in mind as we push toward Apple’s next iOS 10 release. We’ll continue to update this roundup with new details as we get them so keep an eye out for frequent changes. iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 Update: Impressions & Performance   1 / 9 The iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 update is a big one and it'll only take you some time to download and install. It took us about seven minutes to download the update over a fast Wi-Fi speed network. It took a lot longer to install. Due to the file system change and the other features on board iOS 10.3, the iPhone 5's new software update took upwards of 15 minutes to install on our device. That's abnormal for an iOS update and it means you'll need to pay extra attention to the installation process.  We recommend setting aside 30 quiet minutes where you can monitor both the download and installation without distractions. Moving onto the update's performance.  We've been using the iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 update for a few days now and the update has been pretty impressive. We're using an aging AT&T model.  The iPhone 5's battery continues to work miracles. We haven't noticed any abnormal battery drain during our time with iOS 10.3 though that could certainly change down the road. If you do notice weird battery drain, take a look at our list of tips. Chances are, it's not iOS 10.3 causing the problems. We've tested the iPhone 5 and its new update with several different ISPs, routers and Bluetooth devices. We haven't noticed any major issues during our time with the upgrade. AT&T's LTE and 4G networks are working fine as well.  Random reboots were an issue for us on iOS 10.2 but we haven't noticed any during our time on iOS 10.3. That's a big improvement, for us at least.  The most noticeable change, outside of the new features, is to the speed of the device's user interface. Animations and transitions are fast and fluid and we haven't experienced any lag when opening up Control Center.  We also haven't noticed any lag when opening up and closing folders, something we did see on iOS 10.2.1. The movement is crisp. There's still some jaggedness when opening up some apps but hey, this phone is going on five years old. If you're already on iOS 10.2.1, iOS 10.3's features, fixes and security patches definitely make it worth a look. You could also see a boost to your device's performance.  If you're on something older than the iOS 10.2.1 update, make sure you dig into more feedback before you make the jump to iOS 10.3.  For more on the merits of iOS 10.3, see our list of reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3 update on your iPhone.   1 / 9 6 Responses 12/19/2016 Facebook lite apk Reply i like ios 10.2 more than 10.1. power berry slow lost 02/24/2017 Kent Reply After installing 10.2.1 on my iPhone 5s I started getting random reboots.

I am getting reminders to update to whitetail 10.2.1 I’m not sure though, if I should go for an update or not since Internet is poisoned about 30% battery bug in ios 10. I’m new to iPhone, have almost no past experience of ios. As of now I am pretty satisfied with ios 9.3.3 just sometimes it becomes difficult to click on( x) while trying to close search box with some other minor hiccups, don’t know if it’s a software issue or hardware on my device. I’m kinda liking the health app. Although it is not measuring the floors climbed while it’s counting the steps taken. I am told it will count the floors climbed after I updated to 10.2.1 which kind of sounds weird. Please suggest me the right course of action. By the way what’s Jailbreak? Hoping to hear from you soon. 03/03/2017 Natasha Reply Updated to 10.2.1 yesterday and my phone wont start at all and has been at the Apple logo + loading bar screen for over 24 hours. :( 03/21/2017 Simone Reply I’ve been using iOS 10.2.1 on my iPhone 5c and I’m having really abnormal battery life it’s chargimg really fast and then when I use it for about 10 minutes it’ll go down by 20% I’ve restated and rebooted my phone but my battery life is still really abnormal please fix this 04/01/2017 Rick Devereux Reply I’m wondering if the disappearance of my toolkit with calculaor, flashlight, etc that used appear on first opening with an UP Slide before entering passcode had anything to do with the 10.2.1 software? The only thing I get now when I Up Slide on opening is a Music tool that does absolutely nothing for me as I don’t keep music on this phone. I can’t get rid of it no matter what I try, and I don’t know where to find the calculator, flashlight etc. I feel like I Apple just took my Swiss Army knife. grrr.

More videos Banks, Apple in stoush over digital wallets A draft decision from the ACCC denies several of the big banks from negotiating as a bloc with Apple for access to its NFC technology. They had sought, but on Friday failed, to get the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to allow them to collectively deal with Apple in an attempt to get access to iPhones' near-field communication controller - which is akin to its internal antenna. As far as Apple is concerned, this is its proprietary stuff and the world's biggest company has never been one for sharing. Related Content Banks will have to go it alone in Apple Pay fight It hasn't let any other bank around the world into this tent and it's frankly fairly strange that the Commonwealth Bank, the National Australia Bank, Westpac (plus a couple of smaller banks) thought that, even together, they could muscle in. In essence, the ACCC thought a deal between the banks and Apple would be anti-competitive. Advertisement This is not to say that the banks can't sign up for Apple Pay. They can and ANZ already has. They key difference is that ANZ has paid Apple to allow its cards to be used via the Apple Pay app. In other words, ANZ's card is allowed to communicate with Apple's app and enable the phone to operate as a tap-and-go payment mechanism. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The banks were seeking access to Apple's antenna inside the iPhone so they could use their own bank apps and their own digital wallets on the iPhone. Photo: Getty Images The other banks were seeking access to the Apple's antenna inside the iPhone so they could use their own bank apps and their own digital wallets on the iPhone - which is not surprising given they have spent billions developing them. In this case, the iPhone would just become a conduit. And, as importantly, Apple Pay is more expensive because it takes a fee on all transactions it is used for. Unlike Apple, Google's Android phones offer open access and allow banks' proprietary apps but Australians are big iPhone users so there is plenty of pressure from customers who want to use their iPhone instead of carrying around plastic in their wallets. The question is whether the banks without Apple Pay will have no choice but to go back to the negotiating table. It's a fair bet that the answer will be yes. 45 comments Comment are now closed Sort comments by Oldest Newest Advertisement HuffPost Australia Coalition Vows To Push Ahead With ...

You can install the 560–650 MB update via Settings > General > Software Update or through iTunes. The biggest new feature in iOS 10.3 is one you may not notice: it introduces Apple’s new Apple File System (APFS), which will eventually replace the legacy HFS+ file system currently in use on all of Apple’s platforms (see “What Apple’s Forthcoming APFS File System Means to You,” 24 June 2016). It remains to be seen what, if anything, this will mean for iOS users, but for now, the primary impact is a longer update process than usual while it converts the existing file system. At iMore, Rene Ritchie has a good rundown on APFS’s benefits. So far, I’m finding iOS 10.3 snappier than 10.2, but it’s impossible to say if that’s due to the new file system. Regardless, we always recommend backing up your devices before updating, but doing so is even more important with iOS 10.3. Owners of Apple’s new wireless AirPods will appreciate that iOS 10.3 lets you track the little earbuds with Find My iPhone. You can either track their location on a map or make them play a locator tone. The sound is played on both AirPods and can be muted on each one individually, so if you drop one AirPod, you can silence the one you have so you can better hear the one you’re looking for. Given that replacing just a single AirPod costs $69, this new feature is extremely welcome (see “Apple’s Wireless AirPods Were Worth the Wait,” 20 December 2016). However, there’s a catch: the AirPods must be connected to (and thus in range of) a paired device for this feature to work. So while you should be able to locate an AirPod that disappeared into the couch cushions, you likely won’t be able to find one that you lost during a run. iOS 10.3 brings support for cross-device iTunes movie rentals, which Apple first introduced in iTunes 12.6 (see “iTunes 12.6,” 21 March 2017). Now, finally, you can rent iTunes movies on one device and watch them on another, though you’ll need iTunes 12.6, iOS 10.3, and tvOS 10.2 to do so. Siri sees a few improvements with iOS 10.3, including support for paying bills in supported apps, scheduling in ride-booking apps like Lyft, and checking cricket scores and statistics for Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council. If you own a car that can be controlled via an automaker app, you gain some cool Siri capabilities, such as checking your car’s fuel level and lock status, turning lights on and off, and activating the horn. It’s probably still easier to slam your hand into the steering wheel than to say, “Hey Siri, BEEP!” Speaking of cars, CarPlay gets a few new additions, such as app shortcuts in the status bar, Up Next and the current song’s album in Apple Music’s Now Playing screen, and access to daily curated Apple Music content. Apple has rethought identity in the Settings app. Your identity now takes center stage above all other settings and provides a shortcut to a new, more coherent screen to handle your personal information, payment options, security settings, account information, and Family Sharing. Apple has also addressed the problem of Calendar spam, which made the news late last year (see “How to Stop iCloud Calendar Spam,” 29 November 2016). You can now delete unwanted invites and report them as junk. HomeKit sees some welcome improvements in iOS 10.3: you can now trigger scenes with switches and buttons, and the Home app now shows Accessory battery levels. Other improvements include being able to search for “parked car” in Maps, a new widget and 3D Touch action for the Podcasts app, the option to share podcasts with full playback support in Messages, and hourly weather forecasts in Maps if you 3D Touch the current temperature. Also, iOS 10.3 addresses a bug with Maps that could prevent it from showing your location after resetting Location & Privacy settings, as well as improving VoiceOver stability. There are a couple of additions not mentioned in the release notes. In iOS 10.3, developers can now respond to App Store reviews. I’ve also noticed one small change in Mail: a count of unread Inbox messages in the back button when viewing an email thread. Lastly, iOS 10.3 includes a total of 67 security fixes! When Should You Upgrade? -- Honestly, although Apple doesn’t even mention the move to APFS in its user-level release notes, that’s the main reason to hold off. If there’s some subtle problem that surfaces only once hundreds of thousands of devices have updated to iOS 10.3, you don’t want to be among that group. So we recommend waiting at least a week before installing iOS 10.3, and perhaps longer if you don’t use AirPods, suffer from Calendar spam, or automate your house with HomeKit. After that, though, give it a whirl and enjoy the new features!

Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-03-28 23:38 I think the change in the iOS file system, which is part of the APFS version of the OS, is the most significant change in iOS 10.3. Almost, I'd say, earth shaking, or, at least, groundbreaking. APFS will be coming to the Mac in the near future, which means iOS and macOS will be truly compatible for the first time. This will provide significantly improved interoperability between iOS devices and the Mac. It should be particularly important for the iPad, which people use for actual work from time to time. The lack of an accessible file system provided iOS with both security and simplicity. But those advantages have been overshadowed as iOS has gotten more capable and the iPad in particular has become more like a computer than was originally imagined. Once iDevices and the Mac have parallel and compatible operating systems, the sky's the limit. Of course, the impact of this change on developers will also be important, if not frightening. And I certainly agree with Josh that it would be wise to hold off on the upgrade until you find out what early adopters (otherwise knows as unpaid beta testers) discover about iOS 10.3. If experience is any guide, the upgrade will have plenty of problems that will need sorting out. I will do the same when the macOS receives the APSF upgrade. If we are lucky it will solve more problems than it creates. Be that as it may, right now, for me at least, macOS 12.3 Sierra is stable. I'm not in a hurry to break it. Reply barefootguru   2017-03-29 15:43 APFS does have a lot of advantages, but I'm not following what you're saying: - Until now both iOS and macOS *have* shared the same HFS+ filing system, so that's not changing. - Apple released the iCloud Drive app in iOS 9 for users to view some of the file system; and AFAIK has no plans to expose more of the underlying file system. - APFS is transparent to developers in all but a few edge cases. Reply brent  2017-03-30 04:24 since this will brick your TidBITS app, will you be upgrading it? Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-30 15:52 Probably not because very few people actually use the app. It's basically just a dedicated RSS reader, so most people are better served by an RSS app, Apple News, or just email. Reply brent  2017-03-30 16:10 understand. thanks! i look forward to your email every week. keep up the good work!

He came up with the spin-wheel interface for iPods, led the digital music revolution with iPod and iTunes, and helped reinvent mobile phones with the iPhone and the App Store. Schiller, who reports now to CEO Tim Cook, was in Bengaluru on Friday - his first trip to India - for the launch of the company's App Accelerator, a platform that will support iOS developers on design, quality and performance of their apps. The accelerator will assist developers to build apps using its programming language Swift that was created for iOS, Apple TV and Apple Watch. In an interview with TOI, Schiller talks about how they want to offer the best for Indian customers and developers. When did India show up on Apple's radar? Hard to say to a day. Over the last few years, it's grown dramatically in importance to us. This is a very exciting change, we see the opportunity for a huge market and a very young population and we want to be important here. We want to make products that this market loves. Our driving ambition in every market is to be the best, and not the cheapest, with whatever that means to customers. In India, we want to be the best provider of the things we do. We have started asking ourselves what it means to be the best in India - how is it like other markets and how is it different. Distribution can be different, network infrastructure is different. How are you tapping into India's vibrant developer base? We have a large base of developers here in India. The software talent is remarkable and the entrepreneurial spirt is second to none. Our rough estimate is just under half a million registered developers and if you include the extended number of people that are working with them on their apps, that should be somewhere around three quarters of a million people in the iOS app economy. We want to help them be more successful in the local market and there is a great opportunity for developers in India through our App Store to reach to the world. We want to use things that Apple is good at to assist these developers, like user interface design, we also want to give them our knowledge of the latest tech, the new frameworks and the new APIs. You were one of Steve Jobs's closest colleagues, you shared the dais with him on blockbuster product launches. How did you deal with the pressure? Steve was a truly remarkable person and a great mentor for all of us at Apple. Over the years, he worked hard to put in place people and a system to try to keep alive the spirit of the company he founded. And I would like to think that still matters to all of us who work at Apple. His passion for great products, sensitivities of the intersection of tech and design, customers and experiences, and taking responsibility for everything - from the chips we use to the buying experience - are some of the many things that he taught us. Apple's fortunes sank in 1997, the year you rejoined the firm. How did Jobs and his team including you think about resurrecting a company that was nearly out of business? Apple was almost out of business. Steve tried to bring together a bunch of us to save the company and it seemed an impossible task at that time. One of the great things Steve did and taught us all was how to stay focused, how to make tough choices and to say no to a lot of things that were going on and that were good but were diluting resources and we needed to all come together and just make a few great things that could help save Apple at the time. We had to first get back to doing things that mattered. One of the things he did that's fascinating to me organisationally is he reorganised Apple in a way like a startup. Apple was then divisionalised, like most large corporations are, and in order to pull everyone together, he got rid of that division structure. And no one ever imagined Apple could grow to become a large company maintaining that functional structure like a startup. What's the next big thing for Apple? We are really excited about the work we are doing with Homekit and IoT (internet of things). Our homes are going to get smarter and smarter. There are so many everyday things we can do at home with technology and what's critical is making it secure for customers. We are working with content creators so that Apple TV not only provides a great experience, but apps on the phone work together with Apple TV so that it knows what you really like to watch.

In fact, saying that these are fine phones is an understatement. India Today Tech will take a better look at the device in reviews when they launch in India, but even from whatever Samsung has told so far it is easy to see that these phones are at top of their game. But amidst all the goodness that the Galaxy S8 seem to pack in its sleek metal and glass body, there is one part that seems to have got the raw deal, and that is the rear camera. The rear camera in the Galaxy S8 didn't get much stage time when Samsung released these two phones. For that the reason could be as innocuous as the fact that Samsung didn't have enough time to talk about everything sweet and nice in these phones. But a more likely possibility is that Samsung didn't have much to talk about the Galaxy S8 cameras because the hardware is very similar to what the company used last year in the Galaxy S7. Also Read: Samsung Galaxy S8 & S8+ have a weird fingerprint scanner but that's okay Overall, the only new bits in the rear camera of the Galaxy S8 come in the form of software improvements. Samsung says that it now makes it easier for users to access various modes in the phone's camera app as well as uses multi-photo method to improve photo quality. On the front, the Galaxy S8 comes with an improved selfie camera that clicks 8-megapixel images unlike the 5-megapixel camera in the Galaxy S7. Where is the dual camera? It's not that the Galaxy S8 camera is going to be shabby. The Galaxy S7 camera is utterly fantastic in most circumstances and the Galaxy S8 is going to be similar. Reports says the Galaxy S8 does have a newer image sensor in the form of Sony-made IMX333. Although this too will click 12-megapixel images, just like the IMX260 inside the Galaxy S7, it is possible that there is some fine-tuning in the sensor that may help Galaxy S8 manage better photos. Then the same F1.7 lens, which does duty in the Galaxy S7, is there inside the Galaxy S8. In other words, in most cases you will be probably click the same sort of fantastic photos with the Galaxy S8 that you can capture with the Galaxy S7. And that might be the problem. The Galaxy S7 is already a pretty good shooter. And that poses a problem for Samsung. How do you improve a camera that is already so good? In future we will get better answers The Galaxy S7 is already a pretty good shooter. And that poses a problem for Samsung. How do you improve a camera that is already so good? In future we will get better answers. But for now, there is some hint coming from Apple and Google, two companies that sell premium phones like the iPhone and the Pixel. Apple too faces the dilemma similar to what Samsung does. It too already has phones that can click some amazing photos. So how does it make something that is already good even better? Last year, Apple answered that question with the dual-camera setup in the iPhone 7 Plus. The image sensor size (and pixel quality) in the iPhone 7 Plus was more or less similar to what was there in the iPhone 6 Plus. But by adding a different lens with longer focal length (56mm) to the camera, Apple suddenly changed the game. The extra lens not only allows iPhone 7 Plus users to click more candid photos with a closer and different perspective, but also use modes like Portrait that help shoot better people photos. And more significantly dual camera in the iPhone 7 Plus makes it a more fun to use camera because of the "zoom" that second lens provides. Google, meanwhile, hasn't jumped on the dual camera bandwagon. But it is pursuing a different path in search of a great camera phone. It is putting an extremely large image sensor in its phones -- Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P were first, followed by the Pixel and the Pixel XL. The quality of image sensor inside the Pixel phones is really good. And that is why the Pixel phones, when combined with Google's fantastic HDR+ mode, use photos that have lots of details and rich colours. The large pixel size of the IMX378, which is the sensor inside the Pixel phones, also helps these Google phones click fabulous low light pictures. Missed chance for Samsung?But the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus neither go the large-sensor route and nor for the dual camera feature. And that I think is a missed opportunity. I have no doubt that the Galaxy S8 will click amazing photos. It will be one of the best phones to click photo.  But compared to the best in the business, which is Pixel and the iPhone 7 Plus, it seemingly looks a little behind the curve. Technically, and that does make the photos clicked with Pixel stand out, the Galaxy S8 camera may not match the wonder that is Google's phone, especially when used to shoot photos in low light. And on the fun part, it may not match what the iPhone 7 Plus offers, or what Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 Plus, which is bound to have dual camera, may offer. Also Read: Galaxy S8+ and Galaxy S8: 10 features that make these Samsung phones unique In fact, the absence of dual camera on the Galaxy S8 is really surprising. Nowadays, almost all the high-end phones are coming with one. LG G6 has dual cameras, although I suspect LG's camera may not be as fun to use as the one in the iPhone 7 Plus. The LG G6 camera has wide angle lens as an extra and the using that for different perspective is more difficult compared to using a telephoto lens. Then there are phones from Huawei, which are using dual lens cameras to great effect, particularly to shoot low light scenes. The Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus neither go the large-sensor route and nor for the dual camera feature. And that is probably a missed opportunity The companies that are not doing the dual-lens cameras will probably do it this year. May be Samsung too will do it, but with the next Note device. May be Samsung is working on some new camera tech but that wasn't ready in time for the Galaxy S8. May be I am judging the Galaxy S8 camera by its specification sheet and too early. May be it will surprise us. All of that could be true. But so far it seems that Galaxy S8 could have been an even better -- and it is no doubt a very fine phone -- if it had a more exciting camera in it.

The first of its kind decision by the Antimonopoly Committee of Australia puts a ban for banks to have access to contactless payment technology used in iPhone and Apple watch. Apple allows its users to pay bills directly via their smartphones using the NFC system. The system in turn has access to the accounts in Apple pay.

When iPhone and iPad sales flatlined a little around the iPhone 6s era, Foxconn slipped into decline. From Q3 2015 to Q3 2016, Foxconn’s revenue was declining on a year-by-year basis. With little structural change in the business, a decline was expected for the fourth quarter of 2016. But once again, analysts underestimated the iPhone 7. Don't Miss: It turns out the Galaxy S8’s best new security feature isn’t very secure at all Net profit was up 30 percent for Foxconn compared to the same quarter in 2015, a major jump by any measure. The fact that it beat analysts’ predictions of a loss — and beat it by $660 million — shows how far off some predictions were. Net profit was T$68.77 billion ($2.26 billion), up from T$52.93 billion in Q4 2015, according to Reuters. The turnaround was mostly attributed to increased iPhone sales. Apple drives about half of Foxconn’s profits, so it makes sense that Apple’s record shipment of iPhones in Q4 last year would see Foxconn turn around sharply. Other investments, such as Foxconn’s in-house manufacturing robots division and its purchase of screen-maker Sharp, are also starting to pay dividends. With a strong 2016 final quarter on record, Foxconn is now well set up for a record year. Apple is expected to release three new iPhone models this year, including updates to the iPhone 7 generation and an all-new iPhone 8 (also referred to as the iPhone Edition or iPhone X). Those updates promise a growth in the number of iPhone sales overall, and if the iPhone 8 actually sells for more than $1,000 as has been rumored, the profit margin on every iPhone could also go up. Add in a revamped iPad line with a new budget model, and things are looking rosy for Foxconn.

Four banks — Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank — wanted to negotiate with Apple to gain access to its payments technology used in “Apple Pay” for their own apps, avoiding having to pay fees to Apple, the BBC reported on Friday. The banks do not allow their cards to be used with “Apple Pay” because they never reached agreement on the conditions. By collectively bargaining with the Cupertino-headquartered tech giant, these four banks wanted to convey to Apple that unless it gave them access to its iPhone technology, they would continue to prevent their customers from using Apple Pay. In its final ruling on Friday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said that the collective threat to boycott Apple was “likely to reduce or distort competition”. The commission said that ruling in favour of the banks would have reduced competition by forcing Apple to act more like Google, whose more open Android operating system allows contactless payments from individual apps. “It is a tricky issue for a competition regulator to force one competitor to adopt a strategy of the other competitor,” ACCC chairman Rod Sims was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, the banks have said that they were “disappointed” by the decision and would review their future strategies. The near field communication (NFC) system used in “Apple Pay” allows users to transact by just holding their phone to a small terminal, with the money deducted from a bank card registered with Apple Pay. –IANS sku/ksk/vm Tags Apple Pay Australia banks used CanIndia New Wire Service Related Posts Trump urged to follow international standards to analyse deficit Apr 2nd, 201701 Beijing, April 2 (IANS) The Chinese government on Sunday urged US President Donald Trump to analyse the...

Is Apple planning something big for the iPhone 8 display? by Joe Roberts 23 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments Now the Galaxy S8 launch is out the way, the iPhone 8 speculation is going to become even more prevalent, if that's possible, and today we've got a new analyst prediction. A research note from Barclays Investment bank, obtained by MacRumours, includes the claim that Apple will be adding a "full spectral sensing" ambient light sensor for the purpose of a "True Color" screen to its upcoming iPhones. Yes, all the three models Apple is expected to launch are thought to be getting True Tone displays, with early predictions suggesting the company will introduce an iPhone 7S and 7S Plus alongside the iPhone 8. Related: iPhone 8 Apple’s True Tone display is currently available on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but it seems, if the note is accurate, the company is looking to roll out the feature to new devices. The technology works using four-channel ambient light sensors, and changes the color and intensity of the device's screen to better match the ambient light in its surroundings. According to this latest note, on the upcoming iPhones, new sensors, said to be supplied by Austrian semiconductor manufacturer AMS, will be embedded in all three phones' displays according to the note. Barclays analysts Andrew Gardiner, Hiral Patel, Joseph Wolf, Blayne Curtis, and Mark Moskowitz write: "For the expected iPhone 7S models, as well as the iPhone 8, we think ams's content increases due to the inclusion of its full spectral sensing ambient light sensor, as already seen in the iPad Pro for that device's True Color screen functionality. We estimate this to be a material step-up in content from the $0.60 range to $1.00." We haven't yet heard rumours of True Tone technology on the iPhone 8, with most display-related rumours claiming Apple will switch to OLED technology for the new handset, after using LCD panels for years. Of course, as with all these rumours, we're unable to verify the True Tone claims, so take the prediction with a pinch of salt. Apple is expected to debut the new iPhones (if there are indeed three) later this year, so stay tuned for all the news and rumours in the run up to their launch.

Four banks -- Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank -- wanted to negotiate with Apple to gain access to its payments technology used in "Apple Pay" for their own apps, avoiding having to pay fees to Apple, the BBC reported on Friday. The banks do not allow their cards to be used with "Apple Pay" because they never reached agreement on the conditions. By collectively bargaining with the Cupertino-headquartered tech giant, these four banks wanted to convey to Apple that unless it gave them access to its iPhone technology, they would continue to prevent their customers from using Apple Pay. In its final ruling on Friday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said that the collective threat to boycott Apple was "likely to reduce or distort competition". The commission said that ruling in favour of the banks would have reduced competition by forcing Apple to act more like Google, whose more open Android operating system allows contactless payments from individual apps. "It is a tricky issue for a competition regulator to force one competitor to adopt a strategy of the other competitor," ACCC chairman Rod Sims was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, the banks have said that they were "disappointed" by the decision and would review their future strategies. The near field communication (NFC) system used in "Apple Pay" allows users to transact by just holding their phone to a small terminal, with the money deducted from a bank card registered with Apple Pay. --IANS sku/ksk/vm (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

The company has achieved record improvements right across the board, from advocating the success of Apple's Supplier Employee Education and Development (SEED) program, since 2008 had over 2 million people have participated, to announcing that more than 2.4 million workers were trained on their employee rights last year alone. In the report, Apple also states that compliance with 60-hour maximum work weeks for employees has reached 98% which is the highest to date. Suppliers have also reduced carbon emissions by a whopping 150,000 metric tons, equivalent to taking 31,000 cars off the road for a year. This is a commendable feat, however without sounding like a prude environmentalist, there are around 1.2 billion vehicles on average pumping carbon into the atmosphere on the road today, so we still have a way to go, but every little bit helps. Apple also announced there were around 705 audits in 2016 which is a spike up from 574 in 2015. During the assessments, it was found that three suppliers failed to meet environmental, labor, or health and safety standards and were so removed from Apple's supply chain. Apple's senior director of supply chain responsibility, Paula Pyers, stated in an interview with Buzzfeed that 2016 was Apple's most favorable year in regard to chain improvements. Pyers also affirmed that Apple will always hold its suppliers accountable, regardless of government policy. “We’ve been really clear with our suppliers that, notwithstanding any changes to regulations — or deregulation, if you will — we’ll continue to run the same program we’ve been running for the last six years. We will continue to drive third-party audit programs. We’ll continue to dig really deep, and stand up accountability and our incident report system. Candidly, we don’t plan any change in that which we are doing." Apple is also campaigning for industry-wide transparency on conflict materials such as tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold (3TG) after reports of child labor and dangerous work conditions in the Congo came to light back in March. Industry-wide transparency is something which the Trump administration is considering to scrap, however, more companies like Apple need to enact a change for the better.

An undisclosed portion of sales of the phone will support The Global Fund to Fight AIDS. But the product is strangely missing from the Chinese version of Apple's website, which promotes a red phone but has no mention of the disease. Apple didn't respond to my question about why that's the case. But my colleague Jingsi Christina Wu, a professor of media studies at Hofstra University, said the Chinese government probably didn't approve of the (PRODUCT)RED message. Although HIV/AIDS is a major public health challenge for China, she said the government doesn't generally like to acknowledge it openly. Part of the problem is its association with homosexuality and sexually transmitted diseases in general — subjects the government still considers somewhat taboo. VIDEOS TOP JOBS According to Human Rights Watch, the country has threatened and suppressed the work of HIV activists. It's understandable that Apple is concerned about keeping the Chinese government happy; the country has banned other technology companies, such as Facebook and Twitter. But for Apple, the decision likely won't be worth the costs. Instead, it could have negative repercussions far beyond the country. In our hyper-connected world, there's no such thing as a local public relations strategy. Brands may tailor their messages differently for particular parts of the world, but anything they do can easily be accessed via the internet by customers in other nations. HIV activists around the globe are not going to be happy to hear that Apple isn't actively promoting this product in China. So the move may call the company's commitment to fighting the disease into question -- which is, of course, the opposite of the company's intended goal in launching (PRODUCT)RED. Ikea made a similar mistake in 2012, when it airbrushed images of women out of their catalogues in Saudi Arabia. This may have seemed appropriate for the local market, but when women in other parts of the world found out, they were outraged. "It is impossible to retouch women out of reality," Sweden's then-trade minister told the press. The company later apologized and acknowledged that the decision was not in line with its values. Similarly, a 2014 Cadillac commercial about the American dream that made fun of workers in other countries who take "the whole of August off" was perceived as "anti-French" in the French media. As one Paris-based magazine complained, "The latest advert for the luxury brand leads us to believe the French are lazy, spending their time relishing their paid holidays. Charming." The company later clarified that it was meant to serve as a "brand provocation." That's why global companies need to choose values they can defend globally -- and uphold them consistently. This apparent concession to the Chinese government is especially discordant with the brand identity Apple has worked hard to cultivate. Last year, for example, chief executive Tim Cook stood up to the U.S. government by fighting an order to unlock the cell phone of a terrorism suspect, arguing that it would undermine civil liberties. And he took a controversial stance against North Carolina's legislation restricting the rights of transgender people to use bathrooms matching their chosen gender identities -- even at the risk of alienating conservative customers. » Next page...

Matthew Dunnnews.com.au@mattydunn11 OPINION: FOR a long time there have been tongue-in-cheek suggestions that Apple should be considered a religious cult instead of a tech brand, In my view, it’s hard to deny this fact. From mercilessly defending the smallest criticisms of the tech giant’s products online to lining up for days outside of its flagship stores to be one of the first to get an ever so slightly better iPhone, Apple has been able to attract fanboys unlike any of its competitors. And while the “Cult of Apple” might be well-deserved, it appears the tech giant is starting to take it for granted and constantly banking on the fact its customers will stick by the company regardless of the decisions it makes. I understand we live in a ruthlessly capitalist society and companies need to keep making a profit in order to survive, but I can’t help but feel Apple is delivering its customers the middle finger over and over again. It’s primary focus seems less on making our lives easier and more on making them more money. Take the tech giants latest 9.7-inch iPad for example. The product is a thin, elegant and powerful tablet with a starting price of $469, which makes it a relatively cheap solution to those not wanting to drop the money for a new laptop. On the surface its all very kosher, but when mobile repair website iFixit pulled apart the iPad in the name of helping the consumer, it discovered a nasty little secret that is not great news for anyone who breaks the device. As with the predecessor model, the iPad has been built in such a way that it would be almost impossible for customers to perform a DIY fix on the product, which means customers are forced to rely on Apple to perform repairs — generally the most expensive option. According to iFixit, which gave the iPad a repairability score of just 2/10, there a number of features that can actually do more damage to the device during a fix. “Just like in previous iPads, the front panel is glued to the rest of the device, greatly increasing the chances of cracking the glass during a repair,” iFixit wrote. “Gobs of adhesive hold everything in place. As with its Air 1 predecessor, this ranks among the most difficult battery removal procedures we’ve seen in an iPad. “The LCD has foam sticky tape adhering it to the front panel, increasing chances of it being shattered during disassembly. “You can’t access the front panel’s connector until you remove the LCD.” All of these factors combine to make a simple fix much more difficult and costly if things go wrong, meaning the safest option is to drop some serious cash at Apple’s Genius Bar — this could only be made slightly cheaper if you have invested in an Apple Care plan. Apple has been contacted for comment on this issue. One of the most common issues with the iPhone might have just gotten more expensive to fix. Source: SuppliedSource:Supplied The iPad isn’t the only product to introduce this type of repair monopoly, with Apple’s forthcoming iPhone 8 tipped to be designed to ensure the tech giant gets your money from one of the most common problems people have with their device — a cracked display. It has to do with the device tipped to have a full-screen OLED display without a physical home button, meaning the Touch ID fingerprint-reading sensor will be moved into the screen itself. As it currently stands, the Touch ID sensor is the only part of the iPhone that has to be replaced by Apple because it is paired with the Secure Enclave — a chip providing all cryptographic operations for data protection, including Touch ID, Apple Pay and passcodes. Given the fingerprint data is actually stored on the Secure Enclave, it is impossible to get replacement Touch ID sensors to work on your existing phone. “[The secure data] is encrypted and authenticated with a session key that is negotiated using the device’s shared key that is provisioned for the Touch ID sensor and the Secure Enclave,” Apple wrote in a security document. So, essentially, new touch sensors will not be able to work as the component cannot be paired with the existing Secure Enclave in your phone — a feature needed to ensure someone can’t take data from your encrypted phones by simply putting in a new button assigned to their finger. Apple is able to get around this problem with the tech giant has a “calibration machine” located in every flagship store that is capable of recalibrating the new sensor to work with your existing phone. The machines are believed to cost between $20,000 and $60,000, and to ensure they remain hidden from the public, an Apple employee said it’s impossible to even photograph one. Apple denied to comment on this issue. Apple MacBook removed all of its legacy ports.Source:Supplied While the iPhone 8 repair monopoly remains purely speculative at this point in time, there is past evidence of Apple putting profit in front of consumer satisfaction. Remember the donglegate controversy that surrounded the 2016 release of Apple’s MacBook Pro line-up? In case you forgot, Apple removed all of its MacBook Pro legacy ports, except for the 3.5mm headphone jack — a strange choice given it removed that very port from its iPhone 7 because it believed it was an outdated and irrelevant feature. The decision meant there were no longer ports for USB 3, HDMI, SD Card or even Apple’s MagSafe connector, with the tech company opting for four USB Type-C ports. While USB-C is the next-generation industry standard as it offers ultra-fast data transfer speeds, device charging and video output, it meant Apple customers were forced to buy a number of dongles to effectively use their new MacBook Pro. As the latest iPhone 7 charging cable is USB 3 to Lightning, a dongle was needed so customers can charge Apple’s latest smartphone on its most recent MacBook Pro. With no HDMI port on the new laptops, another dongle was be required to hook your MacBook up to a television screen. There was also the need to purchase additional dongles to use SD Cards, VGA and Thunderbolt 2 connected devices, and Ethernet cables. At the time of release, adding all of these products to your shopping basket from Apple’s online store put an additional $378.85 to the cost of the MacbBook Pro. Thankfully, after the heavy backlash Apple slightly reduced the price of its dongles — but it was still making a profit from it’s “valued customers” don’t you worry about that. Apple also denied to comment on this issue at the time. Apple AirPods were another one of Apple’s issues.Source:Supplied Just this week, Apple caused another stir when it was discovered owners of older iPhones might soon be forced to upgrade, with Apple tipped to cease support for previous models of its phones. Despite being supported by the iOS 10.3 update Apple released earlier this week, the tech giant is tipped to drop the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and the fourth generation iPad later this year. Eagle-eyed analysts made the discovery when looking into the code of the iOS 10.3.2 beta, which was made available to developers shortly after the iOS 10.3 release. IT specialist Zeph. McLearan tweeted a picture of Apple’s code showing it makes no mention of any of the older 32-bit devices in the iOS update — only including modern iPhones with 64-bit processors. Although the gadgets would still function in theory, it would be impossible to install the latest apps or downloads official Apple patches to protect hackers from exploiting security holes. Apple has the option to build in support at a later date as the firmware is still in beta testing, but its something to be mindful of if you own any of the above mentioned products. In addition the cost of add-ons, repairs and replacement of its devices, Apple also has shown it doesn’t mind making its customers wait for products it has advertised. The iPhone 8 hasn’t even been released yet, but industry reports are already suggesting Apple will be struggling to get the tenth anniversary edition iPhone out in time for Christmas — despite likely showcasing the product in September. This will be nothing new for the tech giant which saw similar problems with the launch of its flagship products last year. During the September launch, Apple provided an answer to the removal of the headphone jack in the form of its AirPod wireless earbuds. Apple said the product would be available for $A229 from late October, but the AirPods didn’t go on sale until just before Christmas. The AirPods were just one of the delays from the launch, which started with the Aussie teenagers who lined up outside of the Apple store for more than 72 hours to secure a jet black iPhone 7 Plus, only to be told the units weren’t available in stores because they were already sold out. In fact, the jet black model of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus became increasingly rare, people ordering the phone had to wait more than a month to get the product. I mean, it’s cool that you make great products Apple, but how about putting a little more thought into your consumers because the fanboys might not stick around forever.

Towards the end of his tenure, he moved into a confidential role within the firm's hardware technologies division.  After leaving Apple in 2015, Hillman spent a year working at robotics outfit Zoox, before eventually being picked up by Facebook, which spent $2 billion to acquire Oculus in 2014.  As Bloomberg notes, the move is interesting because Hillman has a history of developing consumer products at one of the biggest tech firms on the planet. And according to a job listing for the head of hardware gig, that's precisely what he'll be doing at Oculus, with Hillman being brought in to "set the strategy and execute on Oculus' consumer product roadmap." This is the second major hire Facebook has made in its virtual reality division this year. Back in January, the company made Xiaomi's former global vice president, Hugo Barra, its new VP of virtual reality. "There's no greater calling in our industry than taking breakthrough tech and making it available to the greatest number of people," wrote Barra at the time, making Facebook's consumer VR ambitions crystal clear. "[I'm] really looking forward to doing just that at Facebook."

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Hidden changes in iOS 10.3 will give your iPhone a speed boost Image Source: Oliur Rahman, Pexels Zach Epstein @zacharye March 28th, 2017 at 10:43 AM Share Tweet After releasing a few hundred different beta versions over the past month or so, Apple on Monday finally released iOS 10.3 to the public. Eager iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users rushed to download and install the update, and they were greeted with some nifty new features. In a post on Monday afternoon, we went through the eight best new features in iOS 10.3, including a new Find My AirPods feature, updates to the Maps app, Apple’s new file system and more. There was one feature in particular that we listed in the post that deserves more attention though, and not many people realize it’s even there. Don't Miss: It’s probably time to admit the Galaxy S8 design is better than Apple’s iPhone 7 design When Apple releases any new iOS software, hardcore Apple fans always rush to download and install it immediately, regardless of what new features Apple adds. This is a good thing for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that new iOS software always includes security updates that are crucial. iOS 10.3 is no different — it’s packed full of security fixes that users should be eager to install immediately. Of course, the user-facing features are typically the main draw for new iOS updates, and iOS 10.3 has a few nice additions and changes. One set of changes in particular is worth noting, but it’s hiding in plain sight so most iPhone and iPad users won’t even notice it’s there. Apple engineer Renaud Lienhart‏ tweeted on Monday afternoon about something that we mentioned in passing in our post covering the best new features in iOS 10.3. “iOS 10.3 feels ‘snappier,'” he said, “because many animations were slightly tweaked & shortened, for the better.” iOS 10.3 feels “snappier” because many animations were slightly tweaked & shortened, for the better. — Renaud Lienhart (@NotoriousBUGS) March 28, 2017 Long story short, Apple has made a number of small adjustments to the animations that are played when the user does things like opening an app, closing an app, or switching from one app to another. Longtime iPhone users may recall that Apple did something similar back in 2014 with iOS 7.1. The speed difference back then was much more dramatic and noticeable, but the improvements in iOS 10.3 are still nothing to scoff at. If you have an iPhone or iPad and haven’t yet updated to iOS 10.3, a faster UI should be reason enough to install the update as soon as you can. iOS 10.3 is available to download in iTunes, or as an over the air (OTA) update accessing in the Settings app by navigating to General > Software Update.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Shutterstock Hidden feature in iOS 10.3 will make living with 16GB iPhones a lot easier Chris Smith @chris_writes March 29th, 2017 at 6:50 AM Share Tweet Apple earlier this week released a bunch of updates for its various mobile operating system, including iOS 10.3, the next major upgrade for iPhone and iPad. We already showed you some of the best features of iOS 10.3 and explained why the iPhone will suddenly feel snappier after the update. But it looks like there’s one more hidden perk in iOS 10.3 that users will certainly appreciate. The operating system now gobbles up less storage than before, which should make living with a 16GB iPhone or iPad a lot easier than before. Don't Miss: iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s specs and features listed in new report Apple finally killed the 16GB storage tier this year, which is great news for new iPhone and iPad buyers who get to buy an iOS device that has at least 32GB of memory on board. But there are plenty of iOS users out there still rocking 16GB devices who probably feel the pain of not having sufficient storage space. iOS 10.3 will fix the problem, Apple Insider explains. While upgrading a 256GB iPhone 7 Plus to iOS 10.3, the site discovered an increase in available storage space of almost 8GB. The device has over 40,000 photos and more than 200 apps installed before and after the update. Image Source: Apple Insider Not only did the overall capacity estimate shot up from 248.5GB to 252.14GB, but the available storage jumped from 75.45GB to 83.26GB for an increase of 7.81GB, as seen in the image above. That doesn’t mean your 16GB iOS device will suddenly get a massive storage boost. The more memory you have, the report explains, the more free space iOS 10.3 will reclaim. The reason why this happens appears to be one of the major features of iOS 10.3, but one that users will hardly notice. APFS, short for Apple File System, is now the new file system running on Apple’s devices. That’s why the iOS 10.3 update took so long because Apple moved from the dated HFS+ system to its brand new innovation. AFPS manages how files are stored on the iPhone. It’s optimized for flash storage, and it’s apparently more efficient at optimizing how storage is consumed by the system and apps. It’s likely Apple will continue to improve storage management in the future to squeeze out as much free memory as possible for the user. In the meantime, if you still haven’t updated your device to iOS 10.3, this might be a great reason to do it.

He says, "We have a large base of developers here in India. The software talent is remarkable and the entrepreneurial spirit is second to none." | TNN | Updated: Apr 1, 2017, 08.34 AM IST Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing. BENGALURU: Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, was one of Steve Jobs's closest friends and confidantes, and a product keynoter. He came up with the spin-wheel interface for iPods, led the digital music revolution with iPod and iTunes, and helped reinvent mobile phones with the iPhone and the App Store. Schiller, who reports now to CEO Tim Cook, was in Bengaluru on Friday - his first trip to India - for the launch of the company's App Accelerator, a platform that will support iOS developers on design, quality and performance of their apps. The accelerator will assist developers to build apps using its programming language Swift that was created for iOS, Apple TV and Apple Watch. In an interview with TOI, Schiller talks about how they want to offer the best for Indian customers and developers. When did India show up on Apple's radar? Hard to say to a day. Over the last few years, it's grown dramatically in importance to us. This is a very exciting change, we see the opportunity for a huge market and a very young population and we want to be important here. We want to make products that this market loves. Our driving ambition in every market is to be the best, and not the cheapest, with whatever that means to customers. In India, we want to be the best provider of the things we do. We have started asking ourselves what it means to be the best in India - how is it like other markets and how is it different. Distribution can be different, network infrastructure is different. How are you tapping into India's vibrant developer base? We have a large base of developers here in India. The software talent is remarkable and the entrepreneurial spirt is second to none. Our rough estimate is just under half a million registered developers and if you include the extended number of people that are working with them on their apps, that should be somewhere around three quarters of a million people in the iOS app economy. We want to help them be more successful in the local market and there is a great opportunity for developers in India through our App Store to reach to the world. We want to use things that Apple is good at to assist these developers, like user interface design, we also want to give them our knowledge of the latest tech, the new frameworks and the new APIs. Apple has somewhat had a love-hate relationship with developers globally. Have you reduced the friction points since you started running developer relations? I would always like to think that we have a love-love relationship. But we have certainly had to get better as to how we run the business and listen to developers. And over the last year and a half, we have put a concerted effort to say that our App Store has been open for 8-9 years and so much growth is in front of us. And developers tell us that our effort has been showing. They have seen it in our review times, in the business models that we are opening up with subscriptions. Also Read: Apple opens its Accelerator program in Bengaluru You were one of Steve Jobs's closest colleagues, you shared the dais with him on blockbuster product launches. How did you deal with the pressure? Steve was a truly remarkable person and a great mentor for all of us at Apple. Over the years, he worked hard to put in place people and a system to try to keep alive the spirit of the company he founded. And I would like to think that still matters to all of us who work at Apple. His passion for great products, sensitivities of the intersection of tech and design, customers and experiences, and taking responsibility for everything - from the chips we use to the buying experience - are some of the many things that he taught us. Apple's fortunes sank in 1997, the year you rejoined the firm. How did Jobs and his team including you think about resurrecting a company that was nearly out of business? Apple was almost out of business. Steve tried to bring together a bunch of us to save the company and it seemed an impossible task at that time. One of the great things Steve did and taught us all was how to stay focused, how to make tough choices and to say no to a lot of things that were going on and that were good but were diluting resources and we needed to all come together and just make a few great things that could help save Apple at the time. We had to first get back to doing things that mattered. One of the things he did that's fascinating to me organizationally is he reorganised Apple in a way like a startup. Apple was then divisionalised, like most large corporations are, and in order to pull everyone together, he got rid of that division structure. And no one ever imagined Apple could grow to become a large company maintaining that functional structure like a startup. What's the next big thing for Apple? We are really excited about the work we are doing with Homekit and IoT (internet of things). Our homes are going to get smarter and smarter. There are so many everyday things we can do at home with technology and what's critical is making it secure for customers. We are working with content creators so that Apple TV not only provides a great experience, but apps on the phone work together with Apple TV so that it knows what you really like to watch.

Here’s why. By Emily Bary March 31, 2017 4:32 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large After covering Apple for more than a decade, Gene Munster left his job to start a firm that invests in virtual reality. Photo: Brian Ach/Getty Images for LocationWorld 2016 Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst, made a few ripples on Wall Street last year when he decided to leave his job to start a venture capital firm called Loup Ventures focused on virtual reality, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and robotics. Depending on your view of the future, it was either a stroke of genius or a big mistake. VR, after all, has largely been a failure, despite years of hype. Munster concedes the technology is struggling for mass acceptance. But the analyst sees a bright future for his new slice of the tech world. “The reason I left my job is I feel like the combination of these four themes are going to have a more radical change on our lives in the next 10 years than even mobile did,” he told Barron’s Next earlier this month. They could eliminate 70% of current jobs within the next 30 years, Munster says, with artificial intelligence handling the sort of work that accountants and lawyers now do. VR and AR, meanwhile, could change communication, entertainment, and more. (AR, unlike VR, allows you to see your real surroundings behind virtual overlays.) The underlying tech may be powerful but the current applications are clunky. We asked Munster why he believes in VR and how players like Apple and Facebook might fare in a changing world. Excerpts of the conversation follow. In the past you said you thought AR might be the selling point of the next iPhone. Do you still think that? Initially it’s an add-on. The new screen is going to be one of the bigger features, and maybe the wireless charging. And then they’ll talk about the 3D camera and bring a couple developers up who will kind of show some non-Pokemon, non- Snapchat AR. We just did a survey of 500 people in the US, and 16% of them had an interest in AR. It’s just hard for people to even conceptualize what it is. It’s too strong to say that it’s a selling point initially. It’s a feature that will evolve to be a selling point. More from Barron’s Next Never Mind the Apple Watch, AirPods Are the Future Facebook CEO on VR: ‘It’s Going to Take 5 or 10 More Years’ Apple: Maybe It’s Time to Focus Less on the iPhone What do you think of Snap as an AR company? Snap is an AR company around communications. That means there’s a new way that people communicate, by using filters and geotags. When you think about how AR evolves and how people communicate in that new paradigm, Snap understands that you have to figure out the camera in order to be successful there. The story for them in the next year is probably going to be from a stock perspective and it will probably be more disappointing…[But,] we’re optimistic about Snapchat over the next five years, that they’re going to own the communication layer in AR. What about VR? I imagine skeptics ask you why you believe in this when the technology is nowhere near where it needs to be. If you look at our four themes -- VR, AR, AI, and robotics -- VR is the one that’s the most controversial. I can’t remember someone outside the VR world who believes it’s going to be game changing longer term. We think that once it’s indistinguishable from the real world, that’s when you can teleport yourself for education and entertainment. It becomes exponentially more appealing once you reach that, and we’re about five years away. Indistinguishable from the real world -- what does that mean? If you watch [sports on] high-definition TV, it’s like actually going to a game. It’s indistinguishable. Imagine putting on a headset and actually feeling like the quality of it is as good as high definition television in 4K. Headset-wise, are we talking cheaper phone-powered devices like Samsung’s Gear VR, or more sophisticated ones like Facebook’s Oculus Rift? The mainstream ones are going to be something that’s not even out right now. It’s going to have to be the quality of Rift but be wireless. There’s just too much involved with Rift right now for it to be mainstream. If you look at the spectrum, there’s Rift and the HTC Vive on the high quality side, which are really cumbersome in terms of setup. The easy to use stuff would be Gear VR, but the quality is not good. Google Daydream is probably going to be a step in the direction of higher quality. We’re still a few years away [from the ultimate winner] but it’s probably going to be something that is a dedicated VR experience -- it won’t be your phone.

Photo: iFixit Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Apple has finally acknowledged that there is a structural problem with its iPhone 6 Plus which causes the device's screen to freeze and become unresponsive. The condition, which is accompanied by grey flickering bars at the top of the screen, was christened "touch disease" by the US-based iFixit repair advocacy group in August. Although the existence of the issue had been known for months, Apple had refused to acknowledge that it was widespread or offer any solution beyond its standard out-of-warranty replacement service. The service involves swapping a damaged iPhone 6 Plus for a refurbished one at the cost $519. Under a new policy announced on Friday, Apple will repair iPhone 6 Plus devices affected affected with the touch screen problems for a service fee of $228.95. To qualify, however, the device needs to be in "working order" with a screen that is "not cracked or broken". "Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device," the company said. The company has also agreed to reimburse iPhone 6 Plus owners who paid for repairs related to the issue using Apple or Apple Authorised Service Providers. iFixit co-founder Kyle Wiens​ previously told Fairfax Media that because of a design flaw in the iPhone 6 Plus, it was likely that many of the popular devices would eventually succumb to the condition. The issue was caused by what Mr Wiens called "design anorexia" - the imperative to make smartphones ever thinner and lighter. It relates to the 2014 "bend-gate" incident, when some iPhone 6 Plus owners found that their devices had been bent out of shape after carrying them in their back pockets. Bending or frequent dropping of the phone can cause the touch-screen controller chips to be dislodged from their mounts on the phone's logic board. Apple subsequently upgraded the quality of the aluminium used for the casing on the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in what was seen as a tacit admission that the material used in the earlier model was too flimsy. ​Earlier this year, a number of aggrieved iPhone 6 Plus owners in the US filed a class action suit, accusing Apple of fraud and violating California consumer protection laws and seeking unspecified damages. The story Apple agrees to repair iPhone 6 Plus 'touch disease' malfunction ... for a price first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

 How one analyst thinks Apple could hit $200 Kif Leswing Mar. 28, 2017, 11:38 AM 2,468 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty/Andrew Burton UBS analyst Steven Milunovich believes Apple might be able to hit a $200 stock price if everything goes right for the company over the next few years.  "For Apple to hit $200, iPhone needs to continue to grow beyond F18, new product categories must be established, and buybacks should exceed $50bn per year, boosting the P/E to 17x," Milunovich wrote in a note distributed to clients on Tuesday.  Basically, Apple still has lots of upside left, even at its price of $141 at publication, especially if CEO Tim Cook decides to pursue more aggressive buybacks. However, Milunovich does see some downside risk too, especially if the iPhone underperforms and whatever next big product Apple is working on — the car, or augmented reality — gets delayed or underwhelms.  In the near term, UBS sees "double-digit" iPhone growth next year and high single-digit iPhone growth in fiscal 2019. Apple's iPhone performance will affect "Apple's narrative" as it goes through three phases, according to the note. First comes the "super cycle" later this year, as a redesigned iPhone spurs a bunch of user upgrades, then it shifts to an "sustainable growth phase," as Apple's services business throws off reliable annual revenue, and finally, in 2019 and beyond, Apple will move into an "innovation phase" as it chases the next big thing.  "As investors adjust to a post-super cycle reality and become comfortable with new growth expectations, we expect focus to shift to 'the next big thing,'" Milunovich wrote.  Here's the most likely scenario, according to Milunovich, which sees Apple stock hitting about $175 in two to three years:  UBS Here's the scenario which could take Apple to $200 by 2019: UBS UBS rates Apple a "buy" and raised its 12-month price target to $151.  Visit Markets Insider for constantly updated market quotes for individual stocks, ETFs, indices, commodities and currencies traded around the world.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple’s MacBook Pro Dongle Sale Ends Today By Tyler Lee on 03/31/2017 18:16 PDT It is no secret that USB-C will eventually become the standard and will ultimately replace the current USB ports, and we’ve already seen companies start to make that change, namely Apple who decided to equip its more recent laptops with only USB-C ports. What this means is that for now, consumers will have to rely on dongles to get the job done. As if the MacBook Pros weren’t expensive enough, the fact that you’d have to buy dongles to use legacy accessories means more money spent, which is why last year Apple decided to hold a promotion where they would discount dongles and accessories to make the transition to USB-C easier (and cheaper), and that sale ends today. The sale was originally meant to conclude at the end of 2016, but Apple extended it to the 31st of March, 2017 which is today, so today is basically your last chance to get in on this deal before the prices go back to their normal levels. While the discounts on the cables and adapters aren’t much, the real “winners” are on the LG UltraFine displays where you would actually end up saving hundreds of dollars. For example the LG UltraFine 4K is currently available for $524 where it would normally be $700, while the LG UltraFine 5K is priced at $974, which is a pretty steep discount from its original price of $1,300. If you’d like to get in on this deal, head on over to Apple’s Online Store for the details. Filed in Apple >Computers. Read more about laptops and Macbook Pro.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Industry Accelerator launched today, Bengaluru now core of Apple apps Accelerator launched today, Bengaluru now core of Apple apps Just under a year after CEO Tim Cook announced it, Apple on Friday launched its App Accelerator at Yelahanka in Bengaluru. By: Nandagopal Rajan | Published: April 1, 2017 6:48 AM Just under a year after CEO Tim Cook announced it, Apple on Friday launched its App Accelerator at Yelahanka in Bengaluru. (Source: Reuters) Just under a year after CEO Tim Cook announced it, Apple on Friday launched its App Accelerator at Yelahanka in Bengaluru. The accelerator, the first from Apple anywhere in the world, will handhold Indian developers when it comes to skills and tools and onboard them on best practices. India is already an important developer location for the company with tens of thousands of developers coding for iOS. Here to launch App Accelerator Bengaluru and also meet top Indian developers, Philip Schiller, senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, told indianexpress.com there are lots of reasons for doing something like this in India. “One, there is an incredible developer base here with incredible software talent and it is growing stronger and stronger for iOS development. We have around half a million registered developers here and growing dramatically and there is probably about three-quarters of a million involved in the app economy with other related jobs. It is a large base, but out of an even larger software community, so it can grow larger still. Then, India is an exciting global market for Apple with incredible growth potential.” The impact of developers, he said, will help with the impact of Apple products in India and the rest of the world. “Developers here can make software that everyone around the world is interested in.” Visibly impressed by the “great entrepreneurial spirit” he has seen here along with the innovation and creativity, he said Apple will be able to bring its expertise in under interface design and ease of use to this community. At the accelerator, Apple experts will lead weekly briefings and offer one-on-one app reviews. Also on offer will be guidance on Swift, Apple’s programming language created to build apps for iOS, Apple TV and Apple Watch. Schiller, who is on his first visit to India, said they have already seen some incredible developers at the App Accelerator Bengaluru like Practo and Reliance Games create innovative apps to meet customers’ needs in India and around the world. He said Apple will continue to encourage developers create apps for India as well as help them reach a larger market around the world, “and that is the benefit of our app store model”. “I don’t think one has to happen without the other,” he said. Open to iOS developers in India through a sign-up process, the facility will help the community refine skills for developing iOS apps and transform their quality and performance. It will feature Apple Technology Evangelists who will provide specialised briefings for over 500 developers every week with detailed app analysis feedback. Apple is expected to start local assembly of devices in India soon, but Schiller, who said he is not involved with the manufacturing plans for India, said there was a very competent team working with the government to get the best product to users in India. “The team we are building in India is extremely talented and we are excited to grow it. I think this is an amazing marketplace and we have a lot to learn from it and our decision to increase invest in this market is a great thing to be doing.” You might also want to see this: Schiller suggested that a different pricing strategy for India was unlikely as “we don’t say let’s try and make it more affordable in this market in comparison to another”. Apple, he said, has a strategy of pricing the products globally in a fair price around the world. Schiller said that like their products, Apple’s marketing strategy also tries to be as consistent as possible worldwide. “But there will also be things we will do that are unique to this market as we learn from customers and developers that there is an opportunity to do something special here. The app accelerator is exactly that.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

Streaming TV, a smarthome hub, new freaking Macs, the list goes on. But something new on my mind I wish Apple would do, an Apple owned and operated virtual private network (VPN). With the current government in the U.S. selling us out to broadband providers and surveillance capitalism on the rise, an Apple VPN would be a welcome port in the storm. Apple VPN The idea occurred to me during Wednesday’s Apple Context Machine. The original idea was for me and Jeff to revisit old rumors about Apple launching an NVNO or even a high-speed broadband service like Google Fiber. It would be great to get our Internet access from a company not predicated on surveillance capitalism. In the middle of that conversation, though, I had a better idea. What I really want is an Apple VPN. I want an Apple VPN owned and operated by Apple, with built-in support in iOS, macOS, and tvOS. I want to be able to turn it on with a switch, and I’m willing to pay extra for it. Building a VPN would be easier than any physical network and could be rolled out to Apple customers through software. More importantly to me, I would trust Apple to clearly and concisely layout its privacy and security policies for such a service, and to then stick by those policies. Apple’s track record in this area is excellent. Surveillance Capitalism I’m sick to death of surveillance capitalism. This is the practice of offering services, and even physical products, for free or a nominal fee, in order to amass a sellable profile. Surveillance capitalists spy on your life, your data, the people you know, the things you do, and everything else about you so that you can then be sold to advertisers. Worse than advertisers using our data to peddle targeted products—which in and of itself isn’t bad—is that those companies will inevitably be hacked. Hacked companies have a track record of not telling us our information is resting comfortably with Chinese/Russian/criminal hackers who will use to steal from us or even steal our identities. The Republican party voting to let ISPs sell our data—and making it harder for any future government to reverse that decision—is merely the latest insult heaped upon one surveillance capitalism example after another. Google’s entire business model, and Facebook’s, too. Home wiretap devices like Amazon Alexa and Google Home. TVs that spy on us. Every single product or service where we, the consumer, are the product being bought and sold on the open market. It’s funny because it’s true I’m sick of it. Apple’s Track Record on Privacy Apple is all but alone among platform providers selling us products at a profit rather than engaging in surveillance capitalism. There are very interesting companies like Purism built on evading surveillance capitalism, but I like Apple products. Plus, Apple says privacy is important and works hard to preserve it. Here are six examples of Apple CEO Tim Cook on the importance of privacy: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I found those examples with three seconds of searching. My point is Apple is the one tech giant talking about this stuff and doing something about it. There are many great VPNs, but there’s a level of trust we must convey on the VPN provider when it comes to privacy. In addition, VPNs require some level of technology savvy. Apple is ideally situated to make a real difference in minimizing our exposure to surveillance capitalism with a VPN that’s broadly accessible. I’ve not heard that Apple is working on a VPN. Being software-based, though, it is the kind of technology Apple could develop in secret. But an Apple VPN sure would be a welcome addition to the Apple family. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr Tags: Apple, privacy, Purism, security, VPN 6 Comments Add a comment geoduck March 31, 2017 an Apple VPN would be a welcome port in the storm. Pun intended. I like the idea however in Andrew Orr’s article today about VPNs he said don’t use providers in a Five Eyes country. The Five Eyes are Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States. This refers to the level of cooperation surrounding their spy agencies like the NSA and GCHQ. So while I like the idea I would want the option of not routing through Cupertino or Prineville or Reno or South Carolina, or anywhere in Canada or the other Five Eyes countries. The VPN I’m experimenting with lets me route through any of their servers. Currently some of my traffic goes through Germany and some through The Netherlands. One thing I am running into though is Siri. Neither Siri nor Dictation will work when the VPN is on. Siri comes back with a message saying “could not connect”, and dictation just won’t start. Turning the VPN off solves the issue, but this is a pain. What I’d like is the ability to tell my Mac or device to use the VPN for these apps and not for those others. That would be very useful. March 31, 2017 at 8:43 EDT PM xmattingly April 1, 2017 This is a brilliant idea, Bryan. Obviously our government places no value nor has any incentive to mind its own damn business (as well as leaving our tracks bare to anyone who wants to buy and sell it). Since so many Apple customers have multiple devices connected to cloud services, this to me seems like a great feature that they could provide like no other tech company. April 1, 2017 at 12:49 EDT AM geppo74 April 1, 2017 In order to do it in a good fashion, Apple shouldn’t officially own the company providing the VPN service. There are many legal aspects related to traffic logs which have to be taken into account; regulations changing on a nation basis when not on a state basis for US. What Apple instead could develop is a new semi-proprietary protocol for VPN, more secure than the actual ones, proving an open source API fairly easy to be adopted and used on any platform, including Windows system and of course *nix derived systems. This will guarantee them revenues coming from patent rights, which will pay the bills for substaining this opensource project, as well as “investing” (i.e. controlling without owning) in minor companies providing the VPN service globally. April 1, 2017 at 5:19 EDT AM Lee Dronick April 1, 2017 Just how private is a VPN? Are some more so than others? How easy is to personally identify you without one? April 1, 2017 at 8:02 EDT AM jdoc April 1, 2017 Bryan- I’m completely and entirely on board with you dislike of Google, et al, and their respective models of making money. I despise this slimy approach to doing business. But don’t think for one moment that this is purely a Republican issue. Remember- Eric Schmidt Google literally had a seat at the table of inner sanctum (Obama’s WH) 150+ times over the last 8 years. Can’t stand our government in instances like this. April 1, 2017 at 8:42 EDT AM gprovida April 1, 2017 Three issues: VPNs are complex with all sorts of “features” and strange licensing terms. Therefore, it is critical that aside from legalese do you trust the company, in case of Apple, I do. Commercial exploitation of my private data by ISPs and others is risky, annoying, and i find a serious violation of my privacy. There is NO remedy from the US Congress who are the lapdogs of marketing and advertising. Therefore, an Apple VPN option would be very very very very welcome and I could trust to not mess up my streaming services and apply across all devices, Macs, iPads, iPhones, Watches, and TVs. In other words, any way I might access the Internet is protected. I realize not perfect, but a huge leap forward. Government spying is a much more complex issue related to which Government, whether under a “real” warrant” versus the carte blanche that security agencies have, and does their intrusion open security vulnerabilities. While I wish we had the EU protections and priority, US OK, but others Iran, China, etc are awful. So not expecting Apple to fix these.

Huawei, founded by former army engineer Ren Zhengfei three decades ago, has emerged as one of China’s most recognisable consumer brands. A relatively new entrant in mobile devices, it has rapidly grabbed market share from Apple and Samsung with premium phones and is now ranked third globally. However, that expansion comes at a cost, as the company boosts spending to keep up. Its main business of networking equipment is also slowing as phone carriers rein in network rollouts and prepare for the advent of faster 5G standards. And smartphone competition at home from the likes of Oppo is intensifying. Net income inched 0.4% higher to 37.1bn yuan (€5bn) in 2016, the company which is based in Shenzhen said yesterday. That was its slowest pace of growth since a profit decline in 2011. Its net margin dipped to 7.1% from about 9.3% the previous year. That level of profitability is “appropriate,” said Eric Xu, the current rotating chief executive. Huawei said it spent 14.6% of its 2016 revenue on research and development and will set aside $10bn (€9.3bn) to $20bn annually for that purpose as it ramps up research into everything from artificial intelligence and wireless technology to cloud computing. It has also begun keeping a closer eye on the bottom line. Xu pledged in December to cut extravagant marketing events and warned against “blind optimism and rhetoric.” Mounting expenses would damage efficiency and profitability, he said in a memo to staff. “We’re paying more attention to efficiency and scaling back on investments that cannot bring value,”said Xu. Under the current rotation he will cede the helm this week. The company blamed a rapidly expanding consumer business for weighing on margins. Revenue grew 32% to 521.6bn yuan, said Huawei, a closely held company that discloses only basic finances. That was a tad ahead of its own expectations. However, the consumer division outstripped that pace, increasing revenue 44% to 179.8bn yuan by shipping 139m smartphones in 2016. Huawei has become less dependent on its traditional networking business as the company attempts to grow sales from cloud computing and smartphones. About 56% of its sales came from the telecoms-carrier business last year, down from about 60% in 2015 and about two-thirds in 2014, according to previous reports. It has declared its intention of becoming the world’s largest smartphone player within half a decade and Huawei is said to be aiming for $33bn in 2017 revenue for its consumer electronics business, which include smartphones, tablets and wearables. However, that business is under assault at home. It lost its top position in China’s smartphone market last year to Oppo Electronics, which attacked rural areas and lower-tier cities. And Vivo ranked just behind Huawei domestically in the December quarter, according to research firm IDC. While Huawei has voiced ambitions to expand abroad, it remains heavily reliant on its home market. China contributed 45% or 236.5bn yuan of revenue last year compared with 42% in 2015. A little over half of its smartphones were shipped within the domestic market in the quarter ended December, according to IDC. Deputy chairman Guo Ping will now become CEO. Guo started as a project manager at Huawei nearly 30 years ago and once headed the smartphone business. Huawei employs a unique rotating-CEO mechanism after Ren excused himself from daily operations more than five years ago.

Elegant all-in-one digital creation solution. Fast performance. Super-thin display with fantastic image quality. Responsive, accurate touch screen for art and design work. Cons Doesn't use the latest components. Lacks expandability options. Bottom Line The Microsoft Surface Studio is a gorgeous desktop PC and a capable digital creation tool in a single package. It brings innovation to a relatively stagnant space and provides an elegant solution to multi-product work for artists and designers. By Matthew Buzzi Digital art creation, engineering, architecture, and graphic design are complicated, and often require multiple computers and peripherals. Microsoft sets out to change that—and to bring more creatives to the Windows platform—with the Surface Studio (starting at $2,999; $4,199 as tested), a touch-screen all-in-one (AIO) PC that can stand upright like a traditional desktop display or recline to serve as a digital canvas, letting designers draw, sketch, and edit as they would on a dedicated drawing tablet or physical medium. It's all wrapped up in a thin, thoughtfully designed package, making it equal parts attractive, innovative, and useful. It's expensive and lacks cutting-edge components, but the Surface Studio still manages to easily earn our Editors' Choice endorsement for high-end AIO PCs. //Compare Similar Products Compare HP Envy 34 Curved All-in-One (2017)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple iMac 27-Inch With Retina 5K Display (2015)   %displayPrice%%seller% Digital Storm Aura   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell XPS 27 (7760)   %displayPrice%%seller% Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell OptiPlex 24 7000 Series All-In-One (7440)   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Veriton Z4820G-I5650TZ   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Envy All-in-One (27-b010)   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo ThinkCentre X1   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple iMac 21.5-Inch With 4K Retina Display (2015)   %displayPrice%%seller% Corsair One Pro   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell XPS Tower Special Edition   %displayPrice%%seller% Digital Drafting Board First, a quick rundown for the uninitiated: The Surface Studio is an all-in-one PC, the first desktop in Microsoft's hit Surface line, which has set the benchmark for convertible laptops. In keeping with that spirit, but tying it squarely to your desk, the Studio's super-thin 28-inch touch screen can tilt from an upright setup (what Microsoft calls Desktop Mode) to a reclined, canvas-like state (Studio Mode). The screen is just 0.44-inch thick, while the components and ports are all housed in a base that measures 1.26 by 8.66 by 9.84 inches (HWD). Our other top pick AIO, the 2017 HP Envy 34 Curved All-in-One, takes up even more desk space with its incredible ultra-wide screen, but there's no touch functionality. The Studio's design and build are gorgeous. The look is undeniably iMac inspired, but the convertibility and glinting metal legs attaching the screen to the base give the Studio its own distinctive look. The "gravity hinge" can stop at any point between fully upright and reclined. It slides effortlessly between modes, and it's satisfying to push the screen down or up with a single finger. View All 11 Photos in Gallery As for the display itself, it bears a PixelSense resolution of 4,500 by 3,000, which includes 63 percent more pixels than a 4K television (192ppi). The Apple iMac With 5K Retina Display, by comparison, has a 27-inch screen with 5,210-by-2,880 resolution, though it's tough to compare directly because the Studio's aspect ratio is also different than standard wide-screen. Its 3:2 ratio was chosen with designers in mind, as one inch on the screen represents one inch in reality, better mirroring physical work in a digital space. The screen shines, with an incredibly crisp and vibrant picture that suits the work many creative types will use it for. The colors are bold and bright, as the display uses 10-bit color depth and supports the P3 and SRGB color gamuts, which you can swap between on the fly. It's brilliantly bright on the default Vivid color profile (so much so that the maximum setting hurt my eyes up close at times, driving me to lower it down a notch). You won't have to worry about images appearing too dim. Fingerprints do smudge up the screen, but you can really only see them when it's powered off. Of course, exceptional screen quality alone is not what will have designers flocking to the Surace Studio en masse. Its convertibility is what makes this high-end all-in-one desktop a real artist's workstation. With the display folded down, it becomes infinitely easier to draw directly on it compared with a traditional upright monitor, and that's what gives the Surface Studio its unique value. Microsoft is aggressively targeting the creative demographic, which has been Apple's bread and butter with the iMac and MacBooks for years. This vibe was unmistakable in its debut presentation of the Studio, and is doubly obvious with additions in the Windows 10 Creators Update like Paint 3D and upgrades to Windows Ink. By embracing touch capability on the hardware and software fronts (while Apple continues to relegate touch to iOS only), the Surface Studio could feasibly become the go-to one-stop-shop for designers and artists. More importantly, it continues the transformation of Windows and PCs as stodgy and business-centric to stylish, versatile platforms for a new generation of professionals, creatives, and students. That brings us to the topic of price, which will likely have many potential buyers balking. The Surface Studio is clearly an expensive product—even the starting configuration costs $2,999—but it's priced relatively competitively when you look at what you're getting. Comparably sized drawing displays don't double as powerful computers, or feature the Studio's engineering, but still cost upward of $2,000 or more. For example, Wacom's 27-inch QHD Cintiq is $2,799, and while you can hook it up to a PC or Mac for digital creation, you'll still need to buy that computer. When accounting for graphics, processing, storage, and a super-high-resolution display, the Studio's price actually starts to look reasonable. Ports and Peripherals All ports are located on the back of the base. They're a bit difficult to access, particularly when the screen is reclined, since you have to reach around it or turn the whole machine around. But it's not terribly frustrating, and keeps the flush, sleek look intact. There are four USB 3.0 ports (one is a high power port), an SD card reader, a mini DisplayPort connection, and a headset jack. USB-C connectivity is notably absent here. The Studio comes with a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse, both of which connect via Bluetooth 4.0. These are also very iMac-like in look and feel, and they get the job done. I don't find the low-profile mouse particularly comfortable, but Apple faithfuls likely won't mind it. The keyboard is satisfying to type on. The Surface Pen stylus is also included. It works well with the Studio, and there's little to no latency between strokes and response on the screen. The "eraser" is a customizable button, as is a skinny strip along the side you can set as right click, paste, or something else depending on your workflow. By default it brings up the Windows Ink Workspace software for quickly launching into note-taking and drawing. There are magnetic strips on either side of the display, like the Surface Pro, to attach the Pen when not in use. We also tested the Surface Dial ($99), though it isn't included. The Dial is not an instrument for drawing or editing in and of itself, but an aid for tool and menu selection. You can press and spin the Dial to scroll through various on-screen options, which feels very satisfying. (Stay tuned for a full review of the Dial.) Placing it directly on the display and pressing down brings up a digital radial menu around the physical Dial with options like Volume, Brightness, and Undo, which looks and feels very futuristic. It doesn't take long to learn, and I was flipping between settings and changing tools with ease within a few minutes. Whether or not this will speed up your process depends on your workflow, but it definitely helped me save time shooting up to the toolbar and back to my canvas. Future software will better integrate with the Dial, giving you more options like a radial digital color wheel, and we'll test those features when they are available. The bottom of the Dial is rubber to help grip the screen, but I found that it slowly slides down when the Studio is at any angle other than fully reclined. This shouldn't be a problem most of the time—the Dial will most likely be used alongside the Pen in Studio Mode. Keeping the bottom clean helps grip, and the Dial also works if it's simply sitting on your desk. Outside of the peripherals, the Studio integrates 802.11ac Wi-Fi and wireless support for Xbox controllers (connecting them to a PC typically requires you to purchase Microsoft's Wireless Adapter). You also get two front-facing cameras. One is a 5-megapixel cam for Windows Hello sign-in. When you set up Hello, it will scan your face once and recognize you in the future, allowing you to log in by standing in front of the screen instead of typing in a password. The other 1080p camera is for video chats. Speakers are also built in to the Studio, and have a loud maximum volume with good sound quality. They're of better quality than most built-in speakers on standalone displays, though certainly not up to par with those on the room-shaking Dell XPS 27 AIO. Under the Hood While the design and functionality are worthy of high praise, I have a few reservations about component selection. The Surface Studio a fast system by any measure (see the performance numbers below), but for the high-stress workloads of creative users, some inclusions could be cause for concern. Though generally speedy, thanks in part to 32GB of memory, the Core i7 Skylake processor and GTX 980M graphics card are a generation behind. This could be because the Studio has been in development through the launch of newer components (using a Kaby Lake CPU or Pascal graphics would have presumably delayed its release). Cost concerns or engineering obstacles could also be the culprits. Either way, the Surface Studio's internal hardware isn't quite cutting edge, which is disappointing for the price, and a (likely inevitable) refreshed version with newer components would really knock it out of the park. Storage comes in the form of a hybrid drive similar to Apple's fusion format. Our test unit includes a 2TB drive, while the base and midrange models each include 1TB. Rather than provide solid-state storage (it's not an option on any of the Studio's configurations), Microsoft includes a hybrid hard drive that utilizes an SSD cache, but data is stored on the 5,400rpm hard drive. In spite of this, and a bit to my surprise, load times were still on the level of solid-state storage. The computer boots very quickly, and programs launch with little or no delay, even if it's not the ideal SSD solution you'd hope for. This leads to the issue of expandability options, which are something you'll have to live without if you buy the Studio. Like most all-in-ones, the machine is ready-to-go as ordered and will stay exactly that way, since you can't open it up to add more RAM or storage. That might be enough to ward off some potential buyers, since it's an expensive product you won't be able to upgrade down the road, but that's not anything new for the category, or for anyone who's worked on an iMac for years. External and cloud storage will be your friends (as they likely already are for artists), even with the roomy drive. Performance Just how fast is the Surface Studio? It's plenty zippy, especially since the gap between the Skylake and Kaby Lake processors is not nearly as pronounced as some generations past. The 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-6820HQ CPU and 32GB of memory powered it to a strong score on the PCMark 8 Work Conventional productivity test, even at its demanding native resolution. Multimedia test scores were also solid. It completed the Handbrake test in 1 minute and 3 seconds, Photoshop in 3:03, and scored 702 points on CineBench. These results were all faster than the 2015 5K iMac (1:15, 3:19, and 510 points), but not by the margin you'd hope for a newer, pricey desktop. That extends to the last-gen graphics hardware as well, though it matters a bit less since this isn't a gaming system. A 980M was among the best graphics hardware for laptops last generation, so it's a capable 3D card and a lot better than integrated graphics. Gaming isn't the Studio's purpose, but 3D performance for model rendering and manipulation (say, for CAD, architectural, and medical use) is aided by the GPU, so high-powered discrete graphics fits the bill. See How We Test Desktops It is still a mobile card, though, so it can't go toe-to-toe with gaming desktops like the Corsair One Pro or even the Digital Storm Aura, which is also an all-in-one. That said, the Studio is a capable performer at 1080p, averaging 55 frames per second (fps) on the Heaven and Valley gaming tests on Ultra-quality settings in HD. Don't expect it to run much in native resolution, though few computers could do so smoothly, really, but you can definitely manage some high-setting HD gaming on the side. It's not VR-ready, however, since the Pascal GTX 1060 graphics card is the recommended entry point for virtual reality gaming, and the 980M does not reach that mark. Bold Concept, Excellent Execution The Surface Studio delivers on Microsoft's vision of creating a digital drafting board and an efficient desktop in a single package. On top of that unique proposition, it's a beautiful and cleverly designed piece of hardware with a stunning display. I have some misgivings about the component decisions, but it doesn't mean the system is slow or not up to the task. Growing pains are to be expected as a new product type is introduced, yet the core concept is well executed. It's a successful proof of concept in Microsoft's bid for reinventing both the digital artist's workspace and the perception and function of Windows as a creator's platform. You might want to wait for version 2.0 with newer parts if you're concerned about performance. But I can assure you that in its current form, the Microsoft Surface Studio is a joy to use and work on. It's a beautiful, innovative marriage of form and function, and an easy Editors' Choice. Back to top PCMag may earn affiliate commissions from the shopping links included on this page.

Better blues and greens, with improved color consistency, brightness, and longevity over previous bulbs. More intuitive app experience. Lots of fun third-party integrations. Cons Expensive. Setting Routines could be easier. Bottom Line The third-generation Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance A19 Starter Kit is costly, but remains the ultimate way to get started with smart lighting in your home. By Victoria Song Philips set the bar high for smart lighting with its original Hue Connected Bulb. Now in its third generation, the White and Color Ambiance A19 Starter Kit ($199.95) raises it even higher, thanks to Apple Homekit compatibility, enhanced brightness and color consistency, and a retooled app experience. It still costs a pretty penny, but you get better bang for your buck as Philips has improved the longevity of each bulb. With class-leading features and a robust third-party ecosystem, the White and Color Ambiance package is a great way to get started with smart lighting, and our Editors' Choice. //Compare Similar Products Compare Philips Hue Connected Bulb   %displayPrice%%seller% Philips Hue White   %displayPrice%%seller% Philips Hue White Ambiance   %displayPrice%%seller% C by GE Starter Pack   %displayPrice%%seller% Cree Connected LED Bulb   %displayPrice%%seller% GE Link Connected LED   %displayPrice%%seller% LIFX Color 1000   %displayPrice%%seller% Philips Hue Wireless Dimming Kit   %displayPrice%%seller% TikTeck Smart LED Light Bulb   %displayPrice%%seller% MiPow Playbulb Rainbow   %displayPrice%%seller% Stack Downlight Starter Kit   %displayPrice%%seller% New and Improved The latest Hue bulbs aren't so much about innovation as refinement. Design-wise, there isn't anything different from the original Hue lights—they're still the same shape and size. Aside from the words "Hue White and Color" at the base of the bulb, you'd be hard pressed to tell these apart from first-gen models. So what's different? For starters, the included Hue Bridge features an upgraded processor with more than 500 times the memory and is now square. This lets it run multiple applications like the Hue system and Apple HomeKit at the same time, whereas the original (round) bridge was really only designed with the lights in mind. The bulbs themselves are also brighter. Philips has increased lumen output from 600 to 800 lumens, which is equivalent to a jump from 40W to about 60W. Each bulb is also estimated to last 25,000 hours or 22 years, up from the 15-year estimate for the original. And in terms of color, the new bulbs have a richer gamut, with special attention paid to the blues and greens. I plugged two bulbs into my living room and one in my bedside lamp for testing. At night, I was pleased that I didn't have to strain my eyes to read a book or write in a journal thanks to the adjustable brightness levels. As for colors, the range is truly impressive. You can choose anything from light pastels to intensely vivid (bordering on garish) hues. True to Philips' claims, the blues and greens are both rich and bright. I tried out the preset Artic Aurora Scene, which is full of shades like mint, teal, sea foam, and sky blue. Even with a red accent wall, my living room was thoroughly transformed into what felt like an undersea paradise. Likewise, the bulbs were able to produce a darker, murkier shade of green that mimicked deep space (or at least what I imagine deep space to look like) quite well. Cost-wise, individual bulbs are now slightly less expensive at $50 apiece, instead of $60. That's still asking a lot if you're looking to outfit your entire home, or even an apartment. Thankfully, Philips now offers a more diverse lighting portfolio so you don't have to empty your entire bank account. The Hue White Ambiance bulbs, which offer the full spectrum of white light, are $30 per bulb, or $129.99 for a starter kit. Alternatively, if you don't care about having multiple shades of white and just want the bare basics, you can get the Hue White bulbs at a relatively affordable $14.99 per bulb, or $69.99 for a starter kit. The setup process is simple. First, you screw in your bulbs into the fixtures you want and switch them on. Then you connect the bridge to your router via Ethernet, download the Philips Hue app to your Android or iOS device, and follow the on-screen instructions to identify the individual bulbs and group them into rooms. Because the Hue bulbs connect to the bridge via Wi-Fi, you can control them even when you're not at home—something you can't do with Bluetooth-only bulbs like the TikTeck Smart LED. Streamlined Experience The ability to personalize not only the color and intensity, but also to recreate lighting scenes from your photos, was a major draw for the original Hue bulbs. The only caveat was that the original Philips Hue app wasn't the most intuitive to use. So it's a good thing Philips has created a new Hue app that addresses many of the problems we had with the original. First off is a more streamlined design. You no longer have to rotate your smartphone to access the full color gradient for individual bulbs. The layout has also been tweaked so there's a bit less sifting through menus to access the features you want. For instance, you can now find the gradient for colors, whites (cool or warm), and preset lighting recipes all on the same page. Grouping lights by room is also more intuitive. Previously, you had to drag individual bulbs together to create a room. But they'd still be listed individually under the Lights tab, which is confusing when you have a lot of bulbs. The new app does away with that approach. Instead of focusing on bulbs, it centers on rooms. Once you've created groups, you can easily adjust brightness and color for an entire room from the main menu. You can still customize each bulb individually—you just have to tap on the room name. The Scenes feature is easier to use as well. You can find the Scenes tab once you tap on the name of an individual room. There are a number of presets and lighting recipes, including the aforementioned Arctic Aurora, Energize, Read, Relax, and Spring Blossom, among others. Scenes like Spring Blossom are based on actual pictures, while Energize and Read are optimized white lighting for specific moods or tasks. Energize is a cooler, blue-tone white light, while Relax utilizes a warmer, yellow tone. To select a Scene, tap on the bubble with the Scene photo and your lights will automatically match that color scheme. If you want to edit it, hit the pencil icon. That will take you to a larger version of the same image, where you can select a specific area you want to recreate. The app will then assign the colors to each bulb, and you can adjust brightness using the slider at the bottom of the screen. You can easily upload your own photos as well. For example, I uploaded a photo of my vacation to Cozumel, Mexico, and the app automatically adjusted my living room lights to soft shades of teal and sand to recreate the lighting on the beach. Even with these improvements, the Hue app isn't perfect. Setting Routines is a little more roundabout than it needs to be. There are presets for waking up, going to bed, and you can enable location services so that lights turn on and off based on where you are. These are simple enough, but it's less intuitive to create a custom schedule. Setting a start time, brightness, color, and days of the week is straightforward, but it's frustrating that you can only program an on or off time in a single routine, so you essentially need to create the same Routine twice (once to turn lights on, and once to turn them off). Lastly, the Settings menu is where you can add extra lights, accessories, and even widgets for the Apple Watch. The latter are basically shortcuts on the watch to your favorite settings, so you don't have to pull out your phone. I was surprised by how much fun I had with these—especially since I could quickly change the living room lights to my favorite color whenever I won a dispute with my roommate. (Immature, yes, but an entertaining use of technology.) Throw a Party With Third-Party Apps Philips also has a big leg up on the competition with 400 unique third-party apps in its Hue ecosystem. Some are fairly practical, but most center around syncing your lights to music, movies, or television shows. Others, like Lightbow, offer you more options for presets and color palettes. None of these are necessary, but they enable you to do more than the official app alone. Keep in mind that many of these third-party apps cost a few extra dollars. I tried the free SyFy Sync app, which uses your phone's microphone while you're watching certain SyFy shows to match your lights to what's happening on screen. Initially I was skeptical, but it worked pretty well for season one of The Expanse—even if I ended up focusing more on how well the lighting fit each scene than the actual plot. You can find these apps in either the Apple App Store or Google Play, but I'd recommend rifling through the Explore tab in the Hue app. There's a handy, curated list of third-party apps and all compatible platforms, including Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Bosch, Google Home, IFTTT, Logitech, Nest, and SmartThings. I tested the Hue lights with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit. With Alexa, you just download the Philips Hue skill in the (Alexa) app itself. You can then create groups and control your lights through voice commands such as, "Alexa, dim living room lights to 50 percent" on your Amazon Echo. You can do the same with Siri and Apple HomeKit, right from your iPhone. There's a simple "HomeKit & Siri" menu in the Hue app, and you don't actually have to do anything extra to set things up. The only caveat is that you can't edit HomeKit settings unless you're on the same Wi-Fi network. The Best Smart Bulbs Money Can Buy Hue's only real limitation is the depth of your pockets. At $200 for the White and Color Ambiance A19 Starter Kit and $50 per additional bulb, it's still quite expensive for the average consumer. This is especially true if you want smart lighting in every room of your home. But as mentioned, you can spend far less by adding a mix of Hue White bulbs, which are less expensive and offer similar functionality, minus the color. (And let's be honest, most rooms don't need to light up like a club.) If you want to go the more economical route, the C by GE Starter Pack is about a quarter of the price, doesn't require a hub, and comes with four bulbs—one more than you get here. You can't set routines and there's no Wi-Fi support, so you can only control your bulbs when you're home, but you can't really beat the price. If price isn't an issue, however, the Hue White and Color Ambiance are the smart bulbs we recommend. They're easy to install, customize, control remotely, and they integrate with many other devices and services you probably already use. Despite the intimidating start-up cost, they are shining examples of what smart bulbs should be, and our Editors' Choice.

As car factories fell silent, as homes fell dark, as rubbish piled up in the streets, people would ask in frustration: ‘Who governs? The government? Or the unions?’ The answer was a long time coming. It was only after the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979, with a mandate to tame the union leaders’ power, end the culture of industrial militancy and reassert the sovereignty of the British government, that the question was finally consigned to the history books. Four decades on, I believe it has returned to the heart of British politics.  For, as in the Seventies, the Government finds itself heading for confrontation with a group of remote, unaccountable and increasingly militant opponents, who treat our nation’s elected leaders with contempt and set their own interests above those of the British people. Tech giants' defiance of social responsibility and contempt for national security is becoming one of the defining issues of our age, writes Dominic Sandbrook (file photo) I am talking, of course, about the gigantic multinational technology companies — Google, Facebook, Apple, Uber and the like — whose defiance of social responsibility and contempt for national security is becoming one of the defining issues of our age. Two days ago, the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, summoned representatives of the major tech firms to Whitehall, to express her frustration at their failure to stop terrorists using their services to communicate among themselves and to distribute extremist material. I doubt Ms Rudd offered her guests beer and sandwiches, the symbol of successive Prime Ministers’ futile attempts to rein in the militant union leaders in the Seventies. But I suspect Thursday’s meeting will produce exactly what all those meetings with the union bosses produced 40 years ago: very little. The firms may have promised to crack down on terrorist videos online. Yet that pledge came on the same day the BBC reported that Britain is losing the battle to eradicate extremist websites from the internet. A pledge to track down on terrorist videos online came on the same day the BBC reported that Britain is losing the battle to eradicate extremist websites from the internet (file photo) Yesterday, it revealed that there has been a rise in worldwide searches for extremist key words, reaching half a million last year, including 54,000 searches in Britain alone. What lies behind this latest confrontation between the Government and the big technology firms is the fallout from the dreadful attack in Westminster ten days ago. We now know that the killer, Khalid Masood, sent a message on WhatsApp — the online messaging system owned by Facebook — just moments before his car ploughed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. But we don’t know what it said or to whom he sent it, because the company’s encryption software means the security services cannot access it. So when, last weekend, Ms Rudd said that the Government would like to have the powers to read encrypted messages on social media platforms like WhatsApp, I struggled to see the problem. There has been a rise in worldwide searches for extremist key words, reaching half a million last year, including 54,000 searches in Britain alone (file photo) That doesn’t mean, by the way, that I care nothing for civil liberties. After all, we in Britain are famous for valuing our freedom and bridling at government interference. Yet, as most of us recognise, we want to enjoy that freedom without a madman blowing us up or running us down. When terrorists strike, we don’t simply shrug our shoulders and say: ‘That’s life.’ We wonder why our security services failed to stop them; we try to learn the appropriate lessons, and to make sure it doesn’t happen again. This doesn’t strike me as knee-jerk authoritarianism, just common sense. But, of course, the tech companies and their ultra-libertarian cheerleaders see things rather differently. Cue the hysterical shrieks that the East German Stasi had bugs in everybody’s bedrooms, and that this is the slippery slope to George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, with its Big Brother surveillance. This is, of course, the world view promoted by the Guardian newspaper’s pin-up Edward Snowden, now a grateful guest of Vladimir Putin in Moscow, who leaked tens of thousands of British and American intelligence files to the media in an attempt to discredit the U.S. government’s electronic spying programmes. Ministers have long been campaigning against the easy availability online not just of hardcore pornography, but of images of child abuse and violent jihadist propaganda (file photo) Yet what really baffles me about Mr Snowden and his supporters is that they elevate one principle — liberty — while ignoring all others. I like liberty as much as anybody, but I like security that protects me from being killed, too. Of course, I would prefer not to have my phone and email conversations tapped — but which of us would genuinely elevate our privacy above the lives of innocent men, women and children? I can already hear the howls of protest from the libertarian fringe. But do they really think that the men and women who drive into GCHQ every morning from their suburban Cheltenham homes are itching to become a British Stasi? RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Latest WikiLeaks release shows how the CIA uses computer... Tech giants bow to Amber Rudd's demands to get tough in... Male nurse, 44, who laughed as he showed colleagues a video... Share this article Share Behind all this is a deeper and more serious issue. We will be debating the tension between liberty and security for as long as we are debating anything at all. The bigger question, though, is the looming conflict between national governments and the vast technology giants that think themselves above the nation state. This is not the first time, after all, that the British government has come up against their intransigence: ministers have long been campaigning against the easy availability online not just of hardcore pornography, but of images of child abuse and violent jihadist propaganda. The technology companies, of course, claim that these are nothing to do with them. But they provide a platform for them: surely they cannot duck their responsibility for ever. Thus far, the Government’s early efforts have achieved nothing. What firms such as Uber, Google, Facebook and Apple have in common is that they avoid paying their fair share of taxes (file photo) Two years ago, for instance, David Cameron demanded so-called ‘back doors’ to be built into message encryption software so that the security services would be able to monitor conversations between suspected terrorists. Under pressure from the American-owned technology companies, however, Mr Cameron backed down. And we now know that this was part of a pattern. Last week, the Mail revealed the extraordinary story of how Mr Cameron and his chancellor, George Osborne, put pressure on London’s then mayor, Boris Johnson, to halt plans to curtail the business model of the American minicab app company, Uber, which has mercilessly eaten away at the livelihoods of black cab drivers in London, and threatens the survival of taxi services in other British cities. What makes this so shocking is not just the fact that Mr Cameron appears to have been influenced by his friendship with Uber’s senior vice-president, Rachel Whetstone. It’s that like so many multinational technology firms, Uber pays tax at a rate so low — effectively just 1 per cent — that it might as well not be paying at all. It is a familiar story. Google, for example, employs almost 2,500 people in this country, but pays a tax rate of just 3 per cent. Indeed, what firms such as Uber, Google, Facebook and Apple have in common is that they avoid paying their fair share of taxes, yet track their customers’ behaviour and hoard their data. In other words, they cynically profit by leeching off every detail of our lives. But the tech firms track their customers’ behaviour and hoard their data. In other words, they cynically profit by leeching off every detail of our lives (file photo) And yet they have the brass neck, the flagrant hypocrisy, to invoke the principles of privacy and freedom when the security services come to call! You can see why Government ministers have become convinced that these over-mighty subjects simply do not care about the wider national interest. Take WhatsApp, the secure online messaging service used by Khalid Masood before the Westminster attack. Its chief executive is a fortysomething U.S. computer programmer named Jan Koum, who is estimated to be worth $9.1 billion. In Koum’s own words: ‘We want to know as little about our users as possible. We don’t know your name, your gender . . . we have not, we do not and we will not ever sell your personal information to anyone. Period. End of story.’ Alas, such pious assurances proved worthless when WhatsApp started sharing more than a billion users’ phone numbers with Facebook, so the latter could target its adverts at individual consumers. Yet this is the same company that has flatly refused to help the Government look at Masood’s phone messages! Little wonder that earlier this week the Defence Secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, accused the technology barons of ‘earning huge revenues but not [being] willing to play their part defending the open society from which they make their money’. If that sounds harsh, just remember that after the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in London four years ago, a Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee blasted one internet company for its failure to inform MI5 that Michael Adebowale, one of the killers, had posted messages which should have sent shivers down our spines. But because the system was automated — in other words, operated by algorithms — no human being had even bothered to find out what was going on. The truth is that companies like these are simply not interested in what national governments want. They see themselves as above the ordinary responsibilities (file photo) The firm was not named by the Parliamentary Committee. But we now know that it was — surprise, surprise — Facebook, which is based in the United States. Bear in mind that these are not just companies: they are global behemoths with unparalleled reach and power. They wield immense influence over millions of ordinary Britons’ lives. Most of us use their products on a daily, even hourly basis: even Amber Rudd, ironically, uses WhatsApp. Yet you would have to go far, I suspect, to find more flagrant examples of corporate irresponsibility. Remember how Apple reacted when the FBI asked them to unlock the iPhone of an Islamist terrorist who took part in an attack that killed 14 people in California in 2015. Did they co-operate? Well, I imagine you can guess the answer. In the end, the FBI, desperate to find out whether the man had associates plotting more attacks, paid a hacker over $1 million to access his mobile phone. In the meantime, Apple smugly sat on what the technology barons and their allies laughably regard as the moral high ground. Perhaps the best example of Silicon Valley’s smug self-righteousness is Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook, who wastes no opportunity to pose as a champion of privacy against the police and intelligence services. When the FBI asked for help unlocking the terrorist’s phone in California, he noisily refused. In a blistering open letter to all Apple customers, Cook warned of the ‘chilling’ privacy breach posed by the agency’s request. If they had to comply over terrorism, he claimed, they might have to do the same for investigators in a tax or divorce case. The truth is that companies like these are simply not interested in what national governments want. They see themselves as above the ordinary responsibilities — such as paying their tax dues — that apply to the rest of us. ‘We will not help any government, including our own, hack or attack any customer anywhere,’ the president of Microsoft declared this week. That, I think, says it all. Not even if there were another 9/11-style atrocity? Not if there were a war? The truth, I think, is that these companies are run by people who see themselves not as members of a national community, but as members of a secretive, super-national digital elite, floating above the common herd on clouds of their own hot air. They are, in fact, precisely the kind of people of whom Theresa May famously said last autumn: ‘If you believe you’re a citizen of the world, then you’re a citizen of nowhere.’ Her words might have been written specifically to describe the tech giants. Indeed, a moment later Mrs May said: ‘If you’re a household name that refuses to work with the authorities even to fight terrorism… I’m putting you on warning. This can’t go on any more.’ Yet the tech giants have not changed their ways. As the past few days have shown beyond doubt, they have no stake in British society and little commitment to the greater good. There is a nice irony in the fact that this issue has come to the fore in the very week that Mrs May sent her letter to Brussels triggering Britain’s exit from the European Union. After all, we have heard much in the last year about ‘taking back control’. But firms like Google and Facebook have much more influence over our daily lives, and far more power for good or ill, than entire legions of EU bureaucrats. Isn’t it time our Government took back control from them, too? Mrs May has shown herself admirably keen to stand up for national identity and the nation state, and I suspect that taking on the technology bosses would prove a very popular battle. Above all, though, it is a battle she must win. It is no exaggeration to say that our national security may well depend upon it.

Bixby — introduced at Samsung’s unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones — aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. “It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness,” said Bob O’Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. “It adds some new twists we haven’t seen before,” he said, noting Bixby’s ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress — the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung’s recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple’s Siri. “It’s not talking yet,” O’Donnell said. “They have room to expand and grow.” Bixby will face competition from established players — even from Samsung’s own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the “best-in-class Google Assistant” will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a “fearsome competitor” on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. “Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all,” Windsor said. Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. “You can’t build these things overnight,” Kay said. “It would take years to create something as developed as Siri.” Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. “These are table stakes,” Kay said. “You can’t not deal with voice. It’s hands-free and can summarize a lot of things quickly.” Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. “Alexa is the top dog,” Kay said. “Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do.” AFP Publish date: April 2, 2017 10:25 am| Modified date: April 2, 2017 10:25 am Tags: Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Bixby virtual assistant, Bixby.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ hands-on: Samsung finally out-designed Apple’s iPhone Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Zach Epstein @zacharye March 29th, 2017 at 11:00 AM Share Tweet After months of countless leaks and rumors, it was starting to feel like this day might never actually come. Believe it or not, however, it’s finally here: Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are finally official. No more specs leaks, no more renders, no more spy shots on Weibo, no more dummy models being compared to rival smartphones, and no more guessing. Samsung on Wednesday finally took the wraps off of its next-generation Galaxy S flagship phones. We spent some time with the new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ earlier this week, and there’s really only one thing you have to know: You don’t know anything about these phones. You’ve seen all the leaks and you’ve read all the rumors, but nothing you’ll ever see on a computer screen or a smartphone display can properly convey just how stunning Samsung’s new flagship phones truly are. Don't Miss: Trump’s Android phone has been repealed and replaced Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR We’ve obviously got plenty of Galaxy S8 coverage lined up for you today, but in this post I’m going to focus on one thing in particular: Samsung’s design. First, let’s quickly run through the specs. Aside from the displays (5.8-inch QHD+ Super AMOLED vs. 6.2-inch QHD+ Super AMOLED), the batteries (3,000 mAh vs. 3,500 mAh), and the overall size, the new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are identical. Both phones are powered by the new 10nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset in the US, while the global models pack Samsung’s own Exynos 8895 SoC. Both phones also pack 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, microSDXC support, a 12-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, IP68 water- and dust-resistance, and Android Nougat. Both phones also share what is unquestionably the most stunning smartphone design of all time. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are an evolution of the design we’ve seen on other recent Samsung phones like the Galaxy S7 edge and the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. The similarities are obvious, but the S8 and S8+ look and feel brand new in the hand. Samsung removed the oblong home button on the face of the phones and reworked the phone’s guts, which allowed the company to design two smartphones with displays that occupy a staggering 83% of the phones’ faces. The look is incredible. While it will still be quite some time before any company launches the all-screen smartphone we’ve all been waiting for, Samsung’s Galaxy S8 is as close as any mass-market device has come. Because the narrow bezels that remain are a deep, glossy black that matches the display itself, distractions seem to fade away and content takes center stage more so than on any other phone. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Like the S7 edge and Note 7, the sides of the phone are curved on both the front of the phone and on the back. As a result, the Galaxy S8 feels impossibly thin. I was really looking forward to using a phone with a nice big 5.8-inch screen crammed into a handset that is barely bigger than the iPhone 7, but I might actually prefer the larger Galaxy S8+ to the smaller model. It’s unbelievably comfortable in your hand thanks to the curved edges. Even though the phone is about the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus, it feels much smaller. Of note, there is a new virtual home button that appears on the bottom of the display where the old physical home button used to be, and Samsung has included its own take on Apple’s 3D Touch haptic feedback that offers localized vibration feedback when you press the button. For those wondering, it’s not even in the same league as Apple’s solution. It does the trick in that you feel some feedback when you tap the home button, but it’s nothing like Apple’s Taptic engine. When you press the virtual home button on the iPhone 7, it feels like you’re clicking a real button. When you press the virtual home button on the Galaxy S8, it feels like the phone is vibrating. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR From left to right, the photo above shows the Galaxy S8, LG G6, iPhone 7 Plus and Galaxy S8+. Here’s another shot without the iPhone in the image: Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR As you can see, the Galaxy S8 and LG G6 are about the same size, though the Samsung phone is far more comfortable in the hand thanks to LG’s peculiar design snafu that I wrote about recently. Both phones feel like the future, though. Smartphone design had become stagnant in the past few years, but this new leap toward all-screen phones brings some much-needed freshness to the market. There’s plenty more to cover, of course, and we have much more Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ coverage lined up for you today. We’ll dive into the phones’ software and performance much more in that coverage, but there are a few things I wanted to touch on briefly in this post. First, Samsung’s new Desktop Experience is flat-out awesome. Either phone can be connected to Samsung’s new DeX dock to instantly power an Android desktop experience alongside a connected monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Several of Samsung’s apps like the browser and email app have been optimized for the new Desktop Experience, though every first- and third-party app on the phone can be used in desktop mode. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR I haven’t spent time diving in yet, of course, but so far I’m very impressed. The experience is lightning-fast (apps open so much faster than they do on my MacBook that it’s a little depressing, to be honest) and it’s great for multitasking. I could easily see Samsung’s Desktop Experience replacing the need for a PC or Chromebook for many users, especially if some big-name third-party developers get on board and optimize their apps. Microsoft has already done so with its Office suite, in fact, and more announcements should come soon. In fact, Samsung even partnered with VMWare, Citrix, and Amazon to enable all three popular Windows 10 virtual desktop experiences on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. In other words, if you want, you can use your new Android phone as a Windows 10 desktop. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Bixby seems like it will be another highlight, though I haven’t yet spent much time testing it. Samsung’s answer to Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant can be called upon with a voice command or by holding down the dedicated Bixby button on the left edge of the phone, and it will support a very wide set of features at launch. In terms of core functionality, Samsung said anything that can be done with a touch in any app can also be done with your voice using Bixby. The new virtual assistant is also context-aware, and a nifty feature called Bixby Vision brings the camera into play. Bixby Vision can recognize objects or points of interest and give the user info, and it can also recognize text and translate more than 50 languages in real-time. If Bixby isn’t your speed though, don’t worry — Samsung also included Google Assistant in the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Simply press and hold the home button to pull up Assistant, just like you would on any other Android Nougat device that ships with Google Assistant. Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be released on April 21st, and preorders open tomorrow, March 30th, at 12:01AM from all major US carriers. The phone will be available in black, gray and silver in the US, and preorders will include a free next-generation Gear VR headset with Samsung’s new wireless remote and a free Oculus game pack.

It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung's recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple's Siri. "It's not talking yet," O'Donnell said. "They have room to expand and grow." - Tough competitors - Bixby will face competition from established players -- even from Samsung's own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the "best-in-class Google Assistant" will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a "fearsome competitor" on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. "Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all," Windsor said.

"Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do." - Beyond the phone - Samsung has also promoted Bixby as a remote hub for connected devices, which is another challenge as it takes the software beyond the smartphone. Patrick Moorhead, analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said Bixby's success in the connected home may depend on how much data it can collect. "Machine learning gets better the more training it gets and the more data it gets," Moorhead said. While Bixby cannot benefit from the large databases of competitors Apple and Windows, it could potentially sync with Samsung electronics and smart home appliances through Samsung's SmartThings platform. "Samsung ships so many devices from phones to Chromebooks to washing machines, it is picking up a different set of information, so it might end up being smarter than Siri," he said. "Siri doesn't know what's in your refrigerator, Samsung does." The app faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market where competing platforms don't always work together. Moorhead said tech companies are jockeying for a position in order to "get access to data -- by using this interface they can build detailed profiles on you."

Home » Falcon 9: SpaceX makes history with relaunch of a rocket Falcon 9: SpaceX makes history with relaunch of a rocket Sun, 2017-04-02 09:14  editor United Kingdom Hemantha Abeywardena writes from London… The launch of Samsung Galaxy S8 somewhat disappointed those who recently became Samsung converts, in search of a credible alternative to Apple’s iPhone, while watching the event live online: the changes were just evolutionary; it is neither revolutionary nor a game changer. It goes without saying that the absence of a revolutionary leap in the smartphone industry is directly related to the absence of visionaries at the helm of biggest players in the sector. In short, we can only dream that a man of late Steve Jobs calibre would appear out of the blue, in the form of a digital messiah, in order to change the stagnating technological sector beyond recognition. Against this backdrop, the bold step taken by a great visionary of our time, in an equally significant realm, is both commendable and a breath of fresh air. Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX , could hardly hide his excitement during a press conference after the successful relaunch of Falcon-9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Centre – KSC – on Thursday. Not only did his team successfully relaunch the rocket, but also managed to put a commercial satellite into orbit and bring the rocket back to the Earth, while erecting yet another milestone in space travel. Falcon 9 has been in space before: it carried cargo for the astronauts stationed in the ISS – International Space Station – in April, last year. Once the mission was accomplished, it managed to land on a robotic ship in the Atlantic Ocean, maintained by SpaceX, the private space exploration company owned by Mr Musk, a co-founder of PayPal. Rockets, once sent into space, are usually substantially damaged; the only alternative in these circumstances is to invest millions of dollars to make a new rocket – a serious challenge to a private company, when the return of investment hinges on a series of factors beyond the control of the technical team that include being at the mercy of gravity. Mr Musk has been contemplating on the reuse of rockets for some time; his optimism sees no bounds: “The cost of space travel could be reduced by a factor of a hundred,” he once said in his own blog. History has always been awash with doubters, when bold, risk-taking men with come-what-may attitude tried to make a breakthrough. The ridicules and mild insults aimed at Mr Musk were no exception. With the remarkable achievement, Elon Musk proved how the magical combination of vision, determination and assembling the right technical team is much more worthwhile than wasting time and energy on silencing or taking on the critics on PR front. The cost of launch of Falcon 9, according to SpaceX website, is $62 million. Of course, a part of the cost may have paid by the company that owns the satellite that was put into orbit. SpaceX has been trying to bring its rockets back to the Earth for a few years with the probability of success standing at 8 out of 13; so, odds are fairly in his Mr Musk’s favour. Elon Musk is not the only man who is trying to conquer space with daring innovating steps. Jeff Bezos, the founder of online giant, Amazon, is also in space race with endless experiments with new form of rockets. It’s not clear whether the two men see eye to eye on the relaunch of rockets. They, however, have one thing in common; both defied critics when the latter thought their innovative ideas would never move beyond their respective imaginations. If the relaunch of the rockets are as successful as Mr Musk anticipates, they will in turn certainly bring the cost of putting satellites into orbits down substantially, which could potentially bring in countless benefits to mankind. - Asian Tribune- Tweet Login or register to post comments News Headlines Time to rethink our nuclear arsenal policy Falcon 9: SpaceX makes history with relaunch of a rocket Lyca, send legal notice to regional party head for defamatory comments India’s linguistic imperialism: Tamil Nadu resents central imposition of Hindi on them!

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > New version of Google Calendar makes the most of… New version of Google Calendar makes the most of the iPad's larger screen By Kyle Wiggers — March 29, 2017 1:06 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you've been holding out for an iPad-optimized version of Google Calendar, we've got some good news: It's finally here. Better late than never. On Wednesday, Google launched a new version of Google Calendar, its popular web-based planner, for Apple’s iPad. It’s basically like the Google Calendar app for iPhone, but optimized for the iPad’s larger screen. Bigger icons make dragging and dropping calendar appointments a little easier, and enlarged text simplifies the process of adding new appointments. More: Your fitness goals from Google Fit and Apple Health now show up in Google Calendar It’s a little more intuitive, too, than the built-in Calendar app for iOS — especially when it comes to syncing Google Calendars. Normally, syncing multiple Google Calendars requires supplying your Google Credentials to Apple’s Calendar settings, signing into your Google account, and checking the individual boxes beside the calendars you want to sync with your device. With the new Google Calendar for iOS, you only have to sign in once. Otherwise, the new Google Calendar for iPad boasts all of Calendar’s existing features. One of those is Smart Scheduling, which suggests meeting times and available rooms based on participant’s availability and room preferences. Goals, meanwhile, intelligently schedules goals that you want to achieve in the upcoming weeks and months — if you set a goal to go running at 6:30 a.m. every other morning but don’t actually start running until 7:15 a.m., Google will reschedule future events automatically. More: Learn to keep your calendar organized with our best Google-Fu The new Calendar app is built into iOS Spotlight search — you can search for appointments and meetings from the iPad’s home screen. And it ships with a new Today View Widget that shows upcoming events in Notification Center (and in the future, on the lock screen). The release of Calendar for iPad comes on the heels of fitness app integration. In January, Google linked Apple’s Health app and Google’s own Fit to Google Calendar. Fitness goals you’ve scheduled in either show up in Google Calendar, and once you accomplish them, marks the events as done. More: How to sync multiple Google Calendars with your iOS device In April, Google Calendar gained support for reminders on desktop. When you set a reminder with apps like Inbox by Gmail, Google Keep, Google Now, and through the Google Calendar app, it will sync with the web client. Unlike calendar entries, reminders are present until they’re complete, and appear at the top of your calendar each day.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google's updated Search app comes with… Google's updated Search app comes with Gboard, Google's third-party keyboard By Kyle Wiggers — March 29, 2017 2:04 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you The new Google Search app with Gboard makes it easier to find emoji, GIFs, and more. Android may be Google’s operating system, but that doesn’t mean the search giant’s ignoring its second-largest market: Apple’s iOS. This week, Google rolled out a string of updates to one of its most popular iPhone products: Search. Starting this week, the Google Search app for iOS now includes Google’s third-party Gboard as part of its download — you will see the option to enable Gboard in the Google app’s settings. More: Google updates iPhone Search app with a smarter Google Now and customized alerts Gboard, Google’s third-party keyboard for iOS, already boasts an impressive number of features. The headlining feature is a built-in Google Search bar that lets you send weather forecasts, videos, images, news, restaurant recommendations, emojis, GIFs, and anything else Google’s servers manage to find. Gboard’s support for glide typing lets you compose replies by swiping a finger across the keyboard (a faster alternative to tapping out the letters individually). And voice transcription’s on board, too. The new Search app for iOS also boasts “Trending on Google,” a widget that features breaking news and other topics based on trending searches across Google. Tapping on an item launches the Google app, so you can read more. Apple’s 3D Touch features heavily in the new update. A 3D Touch on the Search app’s icon surfaces up options to start a voice, image, or incognito search, and a tap on the ‘G’ icon at the bottom of the screen quickly starts a new search. A 3D Touch on the search results themselves, meanwhile, shows a preview of the content in question. More: The new and improved Google app makes it easier to keep track of recommendations, reminders, and interests The new widget’s easy to add. Tapping on the Edit button from the button of the Notification Center brings it up, as does a 3D Touch. Increasingly, Google’s Search app is becoming a one-stop shop for the search giant’s services. Two years ago, Google rolled out an update that added conversational voice. Basically, it put voice questions in context — asking, “What’s the weather like?” and immediately following up with, “How about this weekend?” will show results tailored to the second query. Last year, Google rolled out a streamlined Search app that broke results into two categories: Current Topics and Upcoming Events. News, sports, weather, and other topics populated the former and info about calendar appointments and important emails took up the latter.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Android apps could rake in more cash than iOS this… Android apps could rake in more cash than iOS this year — but there’s a catch By Adam Ismail — March 29, 2017 2:22 PM Subscribe Share bloomua/123RF Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you With higher revenue numbers, Android could attract even more developer support, potentially leading to higher quality apps and more innovation on the platform. This year is slated to be a pivotal one for app sales, according to a report from App Annie. The analytics firm projects Android app revenue to overtake that of iOS for the first time ever by the end of 2017 — but there’s a catch. Apple’s App Store should pull in $40 billion, by App Annie’s estimation. This would make for an increase of $6 billion over last year’s numbers. Google Play, on its own, is expected to deliver a little more than half that in 2017 — $21 billion. So where’s the other $20 billion coming from? More: Google Play celebrates anniversary with lists of its most popular apps App Annie If you combine Google Play’s revenue with that of other Android app stores, like Amazon’s, Samsung’s, and SlideMe, app spend on the platform could overtake iOS by roughly $1 billion, the report claims. While Google on its own may narrow the gap to Apple over the next five years — App Annie says by 2021, Google could be earning somewhere around $42 billion a year, compared to Apple’s $60 billion — the company will likely continue to lose significant sales to third-party marketplaces for the foreseeable future. What makes Apple’s performance especially impressive is that the company managed less than half the app downloads Google achieved last year — 29 billion to 63 billion, respectively — and still raked in double the sales. App Annie attributes this to Apple’s relatively more affluent customers, but Android could somewhat compensate for this with its more dominant market share worldwide and rapidly growing install base in emerging markets like India, Brazil, and Indonesia. Such markets are expected to play a major role in the growth of the app economy — particularly China, which is beginning to mature. The country far and away leads the rest of the world in terms of downloads, but App Annie sees this trend slowing in the next few years. At the same time, revenue from Chinese users may actually increase. The report predicts China could eventually account for as much as 41 percent of worldwide app spending by 2021.

Bixby — introduced at Samsung’s unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones — aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. “It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness,” said Bob O’Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. “It adds some new twists we haven’t seen before,” he said, noting Bixby’s ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress — the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung’s recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple’s Siri. “It’s not talking yet,” O’Donnell said. “They have room to expand and grow.” Tough competitors Bixby will face competition from established players — even from Samsung’s own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the “best-in-class Google Assistant” will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a “fearsome competitor” on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. “Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all,” Windsor said. Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. “You can’t build these things overnight,” Kay said. “It would take years to create something as developed as Siri.” Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. “These are table stakes,” Kay said. “You can’t not deal with voice. It’s hands-free and can summarise a lot of things quickly.” Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. “Alexa is the top dog,” Kay said. “Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do.” Beyond the phone Samsung has also promoted Bixby as a remote hub for connected devices, which is another challenge as it takes the software beyond the smartphone. Patrick Moorhead, analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said Bixby’s success in the connected home may depend on how much data it can collect. “Machine learning gets better the more training it gets and the more data it gets,” Moorhead said. While Bixby cannot benefit from the large databases of competitors Apple and Windows, it could potentially sync with Samsung electronics and smart home appliances through Samsung’s SmartThings platform. “Samsung ships so many devices from phones to Chromebooks to washing machines, it is picking up a different set of information, so it might end up being smarter than Siri,” he said. “Siri doesn’t know what’s in your refrigerator, Samsung does.” The app faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market where competing platforms don’t always work together.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple repairs iOS 10.3 vulnerability that caused iOS devices to repeatedly dial 911 Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, March 31st, 2017, 05:28 Category: iOS, iPad, iPhone, News, security, Software Following the release of iOS 10.3 earlier this week, a number of users reported that their iOS devices were repeatedly attempting to call 911. The flaw was discovered by an 18-year old who found a way to use Javascript to remotely cause iOS devices to open popup alerts, open apps, and make phone calls. In an effort to show the severity of the problem, he created a code that caused iPhones to dial 911 repeatedly. All in all, he ended up being arrested and charged with four counts of computer tampering after causing thousands of accidental 911 calls. It appears that Apple has worked with app developers to examine the issue and close the loophole. The code only triggered 911 calls from iPhones, which exploited a feature in the underlying software that allows users to tap on a phone number and immediately initiate a call. Apple says the update supersedes that capability and now requires users to always press a second confirmation before initiating a call. The issue follows a report issued earlier this month in which cybersecurity experts pointed out a vulnerability in which a 911 call center could be in “immediate danger” of losing service due to an overwhelming volume of calls. iOS 10.3 was released earlier this week and includes a host of new features, both user-facing ones as well as a variety of security fixes. Apple had originally said that it was working to fix this 911 exploit, but now that it’s officially available as part of iOS 10.3, that’s all the more reason to update. Apple also started beta testing iOS 10.3.2 this week, leading credence to speculation that iOS 10.3.1 is right around the corner. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Candidates vow to break record: 'Man About Town' nominees are raising funds for Phoenix Foundation Saturday Apr 1, 2017 at 6:47 PM Apr 1, 2017 at 6:49 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — The High Desert Phoenix Foundation kicked off its annual Man About Town fundraiser with a special ‘50s theme celebration. Dressed in leather jackets, white T-shirts and sunglasses, a group of nominees who are competing for the honorable title of Man About Town gathered for the fifth annual kick off event at Los Domingos Mexican restaurant on Friday. Julie Norton, the nonprofit’s co-founder, told the Daily Press nine men will try to beat last year’s “record setting amount of $30,162” for the foundation that helps families in the High Desert who have lost loved ones as a result of an accident or a crime. This year’s Man About Town candidates will attempt to win the crown by trying to win $1 votes during the voting period that ends April 20. This year’s candidates include High Tech Lending Mortgage loan originator Brad Smith, C.A.R.S. body shop owner Carlos Sarmiento, Little Caesars franchise owner Pat Orr, Apple Valley Communications president Gabe Lovato, Kona Ice co-owner Tony Colver, Arch Angel Financial CEO Chris Martin, co-owner Thompson Family Plumbing and Rooter John Thompson, Q Marketing owner Sergio Quesada, and Realtor/sales representative Dave McConnell. Kick off master of ceremonies Chris Ackerman announced to supporters gathered at the restaurant that the group has vowed to raise $40,000 for the foundation this year. “I’m voting for all of them because they’re all my friends,” said business owner Dana Hernandez, as the group enjoyed food and conversation at the eatery. Wearing his gold crown, former Man About Town winner Thurston “Smitty” Smith said winning crown is about “bragging rights,” but the money raised goes toward a worthy cause. Some of the candidates have already scheduled fundraisers such as a “Gabe Roast” for Lovato, a “Cadillac Ranch BBQ/Carwash” and “Carlos’ Family Feud Night” for Sarmiento, a “Taco Tuesday Fundraiser” for Thompson and a Little Caesars’ pizza special. These events can be found by searching Facebook. Business leader Jeff Patterson took home the crown last year, with Victorville City Manager Doug Robertson finishing second and Hesperia Mayor Pro Temp Russ Blewett rounded out the top three. “I feel honored that I was the one who raised the most amount of money,” Patterson told the Daily Press, last year. “I definitely believe in this organization and I’m grateful to be involved in such a worthy cause in helping the High Desert.” Votes can be cast through noon on April 20. A grand finale and coronation of the Man About Town winner will be held at 6 p.m. on April 22 at Sunset Hills Memorial Park located at 24000 Waalew Rd. in Apple Valley. The event will include refreshments, prizes and music by the Alley Cats. Online voting, candidate bios and general information can be found online at www.hdphoenixfoundation.com. Votes can also be sent by mailing a check or money order in the foundation’s name to P.O Box 803 Apple Valley, CA 92307. Please include the candidate’s name on the check’s memo line. Checks must be received by April 20. For more information, call 760-247-2290. Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at 760-951-6227, RDeLa Cruz@VVDailyPress.com or on Twitter @DP_ReneDeLaCruz.

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

Use Opera. iOS 10.3 Introduces a New File System, Adds In-App Reviews, and Find My AirPods Apple’s released iOS 10.3 today, which isn’t a particularly interesting update, but it does have a few minor improvements, including a new file system, that are worth mentioning.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS Guest How your voice will help you understand data analytics Hira Saeed@heerasaeed April 1, 2017 4:41 PM Tags: ai, bots, chatbots, data analytics, machine learning, voicebots Above: Amazon Echo Image Credit: Carlos Delgado By Christmas 2016, Amazon’s Alexa was in 4 percent of American homes. Apple’s Siri handles more than 2 billion voice queries each week. And approximately 20 percent of Google search queries on Android devices are executed by voice. Increasing adoption of voice interfaces like these point to a fundamental shift in how we interact with our devices. In the span of just a few years, we’ve gone from the tyranny of the wired desktop mouse to mobile’s portable touchscreens. In workplaces, we have shifted from manual record-keeping to voice-enabled automated time and attendance management. Not only this, we have also shifted customer relationship officers to the conversational command prompts of chatbots. Now it seems that we’re transitioning again, this time to conversational interfaces synced to the services and data we use. With the growth of productivity platforms such as Slack, chatbots are especially well-positioned to become common voice interfaces, particularly in the enterprise space. This is great news for people who rely on complex data to do their jobs. Easier access to the services that enable business has led to an explosion in the amount of data flowing from these interactions.This, in turn, fuels a growing demand for more efficient ways to collate, process, analyze and access that data. The answer, increasingly, is not to be found in apps at all, but rather in emerging voice interfaces and chatbots that are fast becoming strong business intelligence allies. Apps as redundant intermediaries “The product is no longer just an ‘app’ or a ‘website’,” wrote Betaworks’ Matthew Hartman in a recent column. “It’s the brain behind many different instantiations.” Thanks to the rise of APIs and embeddable components, a new generation of technology companies are developing solutions that provide functionality and information access and are platform-agnostic. Instead of being required to operate in one siloed environment, today’s users have access to a variety of data sources and back-end services that, in many cases, we’re not even aware of. Speech recognition and machine learning interpret plain language queries and deliver results in a variety of formats. In the past, if you wanted to access complex data analytics in order to make informed decisions, you had to use a variety of services and collate disparate datasets. This process was simplified somewhat with a range of dashboard products that imported this data and delivered a consolidated, visual perspective on your data. Moving into a post-app world The next evolutionary step is to leverage machine learning and natural language processing to enable professionals to query these data analytics services by voice or conversations with chatbots. Services such as Sisense Everywhere, meanwhile, have integrated their complex data analytics engines with Amazon’s Alexa and Slack, using Sisense’ BI bot framework. The benefits of this approach include being able to request specific data points using a variety of interface options without needing to scroll through various screens and reports. Demand for platform-agnostic BI is high, with 51 percent of respondents to a recent Sisense study indicating that they’re interested in accessing analytics via voice-activated virtual assistants. In addition, 47 percent were interested in accessing data via productivity tools, and 12 percent via augmented reality. There is, of course, a big difference between using voice commands to query data and relying on a completely non-visual environment. “Via voice you’re going to get a very thin interaction,” Steve Wilson, Citrix’s VP of core infrastructure, recently told MIT Technology Review. “If you want to go in-depth you’ll have to look at a screen.” Users have a tremendous amount of choice when it comes to apps. Each of the major app stores offer literally millions of products. And yet, according to ComScore’s 2016 US Mobile App Report, nearly half of all users download zero apps in any given month. To make matters worse, app market share is dominated by Facebook and Google, which, between them, account for almost 70% of app usage. This leaves a minuscule market share for all other developers to compete over. The apps that will thrive are those that deliver the most convenient interfaces to the data services that users already favor. “Hello, data” As voice interfaces and chatbots deliver access to a growing array of data-rich services, apps and even screens will become less dominant. These trends will become commonplace in the business environment too. The proliferation of data that businesses increasingly rely on to make decisions will necessitate more efficient and smarter interfaces to distill useful data points to inform these decisions. You could be talking to your data sooner than you thought. Hira Saeed writes about AI, chatbots and Big Data. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

Supply-chain sources from Asia seem to corroborate the rumor, revealing more details about the iPhone 8’s advanced camera system. Don't Miss: Amazon’s best-selling smart thermostat works with Alexa and costs half as much as a Nest According to Digitimes’ sources, Himax Technologies will indeed be among the component suppliers delivering parts for the OLED iPhone 8. Himax will provide the glass component design, featuring chip-on-glass (COG) technology, which will fit into Lumentum’s 3D-sensing module for the iPhone 8. The front-facing camera will have a VCSEL (vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser)-based DOE (diffractive optical elements) that will support both 3D-sensing and 3D-modeling capabilities. Thus, the iPhone 8’s cameras might beat the Galaxy S8 when it comes to 3D capabilities that can enable augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR) features in apps, while also offering better security. One of the obvious uses for 3D cameras in a phone is AR and VR, with recent reports claiming that Apple is more interested in the former. Furthermore, a front-facing camera with 3D-sensing powers would also be able to offer secure unlocks based on face recognition. By scanning the depth of field, such a system would be less prone to photo hacks, such as is the case with the Galaxy S8. Samsung’s new flagship phone also supports face unlocking, but the facial recognition software can be hacked with just an image. Samsung knows this, and that’s why it won’t let users use this security feature for Samsung Pay payments.

SPECIAL It looks like Avalon has landed its Apple store. The webpage for Apple’s North Point Mall store includes a tease about “an inspired move,” and invites customers to “Come see us at Avalon on April 13, at 10 a.m.” Developers of the Alpharetta city-within-a-city plan to show off the community’s second phase this week for media and special guests. It’s been expected developer North American Properties might have a few surprises in store before the official April 13 launch of Phase II. An Apple showroom would appear to be one of them. Mark Toro, a top executive for NAP, tweeted on Saturday an image of the Apple logo on a solid black background covering a storefront on the property. In the text, he wrote: “Look who’s coming to @avaloninsider’s Boulevard East party,” a reference to a charity gala to be held April 12 to benefit City of Refuge in Atlanta. Two people familiar with the project contacted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Saturday say it’s no April Fool’s joke. The people familiar with the matter declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak. A representative of NAP had no comment, and a message left with an Apple spokeswoman was not immediately returned. NAP’s pursuit of Apple at Avalon has been no secret in real estate circles. An Apple store was reportedly discussed during the project’s first phase. An Apple store will only burnish Avalon’s reputation as a top metro shopping hub. Pottery Barn, Williams Sonoma, Brooks Brothers and a number of other luxury retailers, restaurants and a new office tower are slated to open on April 13. The first phase has 250 apartments, 100 single-family homes, a Whole Foods market, retailers such as Anthropologie, Arhaus and Tesla showroom, and in-town Atlanta eateries such Antico Pizza and El Felix. The 19-acre second phase will be denser than the first phase and won’t include single-family houses. The second phase will have 276 apartments, a brick and glass office tower with the new regional offices of tech giant Microsoft and more retail and chef-driven restaurants. In 2018, North American and partners Stormont Hospitality and HEI Hotels & Resorts will open a 330-room luxury hotel and conference center in a joint-venture with the city of Alpharetta. A second office tower is planned.

Qualcomm Snapdragon 835: The first benchmark results - comparisons to Pixel, OnePlus 3T, Galaxy S7, and more David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/03/22 7:09am PDTMar 22, 2017 45 Plus 1 on G+ 283 Share on Facebook 95 Share on Twitter Total Shares423 Development News Article Contents 1 Introduction 2 Device testing notes 3 Results 3.1 Geekbench 3.2 GFXBench GL Benchmark 3.3 AnTuTu 3.4 3DMark 3.5 PCMark (v1.0) 3.6 Web benchmarks: Octane, Kraken, SunSpider 4 Conclusion Last week, I had the privilege of visiting Qualcomm's San Diego campus to check out the new Snapdragon 835 chip and run some benchmarks using Qualcomm's reference platform for the SoC. You'll never guess what happened next (you will: benchmarks). Full disclosure: Qualcomm paid for me to ride the train to San Diego, which was very pretty, put me up in a great hotel next to Qualcomm HQ for two nights, and took me out to a very nice dinner... with an open bar. There was a taco station with really, really good Mahi-Mahi. The guacamole was also totally solid. We played cornhole. I lost. Repeatedly. Introduction The Snapdragon 835 is the next major evolution of Qualcomm's system-on-a-chip platform, and it's a one you'll be seeing in a lot of smartphones this and probably next year. You can read about the big changes in our initial announcement post right here, but I'll provide a flyover for those of you wanting the short version. Basically every major chip on the 835 is a new part, from the X16 LTE modem, to the octa-core Kryo 280 CPU based partly on ARM reference cores, the Adreno 540 GPU, the Hexagon DSP, and more. The new 10nm fabrication process also brings inherent improvements across the board (literally), especially in efficiency, allowing Qualcomm to fit more transistors onto a smaller die than ever before. The Snapdragon 835 is, in fact, the first commercially-available 10nm SoC on earth. Initially, Qualcomm claimed the 835 would be around 20% faster than the 820, while also capable of being around 25% more power-efficient on the same workload. While the reference hardware we tested on is obviously quite... robust, the results from synthetic benchmarks indicate Qualcomm may have undersold the 835 a bit in some areas, perhaps in case things didn't go as well as they hoped. It's possible that real-world handset performance increases will be more in line with the 20% figure Qualcomm quotes, but with the GPU performance nearly increasing by 40% or more over the 820 in some tests, there's more to it than just CPU here. This is a very fast processor, even if it may not necessarily go toe-to-toe with the best from Apple in some ways (Apple's chips still unabashedly dominate in single-thread CPU performance, for example). The results from testing, and comparisons to production devices, follow. Device testing notes Qualcomm smartphone reference platform running Android 7.1.1 - Snapdragon 835 Google Pixel XL running Android 7.1.1 (release branch) - Snapdragon 821 OnePlus 3T running Android 7.0 (release branch) - Snapdragon 821 Galaxy S7 running Android 6.0.1 - Exynos 8890 Galaxy S7 edge running Android 7.0 - Snapdragon 820 Huawei P10 running Android 7.0 (preproduction) - Kirin 960 I realize the S7 Exynos and P10 I've thrown in here are not ideal because of their OS version in the case of the former and the preproduction status of the latter. Nonetheless, they are valuable points of comparison, and leaving them out would make this post much less helpful. Qualcomm's reference device, pictured here, does not contain any active cooling components (it doesn't have a fan) and, aside from being very thick because of its status as an engineering test platform, runs the same chip Qualcomm will sell to its partners. Qualcomm certainly could tune the device to know to run at peak speed when known benchmarks are detected, but they'd be far from the only company to do this. This is why benchmarks generally should be taken with a grain of salt. I'm not here to sell you these results: I'm just reporting what I observed, nothing less, nothing more. Results If you want to see the raw data for each test, I've placed them in this table (I know, it's not readable, but you can refer back to it after looking at the charts). Device GB4 (1) GB4 (multi) GFXB (Car) GFXB (Man3.1) GFXB (Man3.0) GFXB (T-Rex) Antutu 3DMark (Slingshot 3.1) 3DMark (Slingshot 3.0) 3DMark (Ice Storm) PCM 1.1 Octane Kraken SunSpider Snapdragon 835 2059 6461 1513 2668 3873 6625 181939 3803 4996 38518 8124 14301 2308 237.4 OnePlus 3T 1840 4032 1180 2058 3006 5279 157191 2619 3298 30741 FAILED 9280 2601 531 Pixel XL 1638 4089 1148 1997 2982 5131 137290 2839 3205 27376 5913 9154 2775 576 Galaxy S7 (Exynos) 1866 5358 904 1706 2485 4643 135691 2010 2362 29216 5064 10337 2565 511 Galaxy S7 edge (SD820) 1450 3800 587 1005 1584 2448 130357 2327 2916 18914 5613 4716 4038 651 Huawei P10 1926 5713 748 1403 1851 3690 119618 1910 2230 25066 7222 8947 3159 464 Geekbench First up is the well-known Geekbench suite, version 4. This test is a synthetic benchmark designed to measure raw CPU performance. The Snapdragon 835 fares better than all other devices tested, unsurprisingly, but it's in multithreaded performance where it particularly shines, obtaining a nearly 40% higher score in the multicore test versus the Snapdragon 821. While Huawei's P10 is within shouting distance, the 835 still pretty easily glides past it in this area. This is probably what happens when you double the number of CPU cores, to be fair. Single-core scores have the 835 just marginally faster than the 821, a little over 10% or so. So we're probably not going to see major single-thread performance improvements with the 835. GFXBench GL Benchmark GFXBench contains a variety of Open GL ES 3.1, 3.0, and 2.0 graphics benchmarks. The tests are listed in descending order based upon their complexity, starting with the newest benchmark which tests advanced GL ES 3.1 features. These are all "offscreen" tests, meaning all were rendered at the same resolution regardless of the device's actual, physical resolution. Here we see what is probably the single biggest across-the-board performance boost for Qualcomm's newest chipset, the Adreno 540 GPU. Results from the 835 easily bested the Snapdragon 821 in the most demanding test by around 30%, a lead that translated to pretty much every test in the GFXBench suite. That's impressive. As we can see, Samsung's Exynos and Huawei's Kirin still have a ways to go to catch up with Qualcomm on GPU performance. But Qualcomm seems quite invested in improving Adreno generationally. AnTuTu AnTuTu is a holistic benchmark that combines things like storage speed, RAM, GPU, CPU, and other performance into a single score. While it's not the most helpful in this sense (after all, who knows what kind of storage Qualcomm's reference platform utilizes), it's a very commonly-used benchmark and at least worth throwing up here. The 835 does well here, clocking in at over 181000, but AnTuTu really is the quintessential "my number is bigger than yours" benchmark, full of manipulated results and arbitrary weighting of the test factors. But hey, if you care - the 835 wins. 3DMark 3DMark is an immensely popular graphics benchmark utility on desktops, and the mobile version has picked up steam over the years as well. Our first test is the new OpenGL ES3.0/3.1 Slingshot Unlimited, which uses the same resolution to render the test across all devices at the same resolution. The results here are probably the most stark of almost any, with the Snapdragon 835 besting the 821s of the Pixel XL and OnePlus 3T by nearly 50% on the GL ES 3.0 version of the benchmark, and closer to 40% on the GL ES 3.1 variant. The Adreno 540, it seems, is no joke. We also ran the more commonly referenced Ice Storm Unlimited, which while not as pronounced in terms of the distance between first and second, still was pretty convincing. The 835 bested the next-closest phone, the OnePlus 3T, by a little under 30%. This test tends to bring CPU into the mix a fair bit more, so we also see the Exynos version of the Galaxy S7 faring pretty well, better than the Pixel XL. PCMark (v1.0) For a variety of reasons, we did not test version 2.0 of PCMark with the Qualcomm reference platform phone (it was largely unavailable during our testing, though some did manage to get results), so we're using the older version one platform. PCMark is another holistic benchmark that seeks to recreate "normal" device workloads and measure real-world performance, though it's hard to call any strictly standardized and largely synthetic test representative of "reality." Anyway, here's the chart. Unfortunately, this older version of PCMark would never successfully complete on the OnePlus 3T. The 835 comes out ahead here by a decent margin, but it's not a blowout - PCMark only awards the 835 a score around 10% higher than the Kirin 960 in the Huawei P10. Web benchmarks: Octane, Kraken, SunSpider Web benchmarks like Google Octane and SunSpider measure Javascript performance. Octane, I've found, can be a pretty reliable indicator of a given platform's browser performance, but I'd hardly call it an end-all-be-all. That said, the 835 reference platform demolished anything else. It was a full 40% faster than the next-closest Galaxy S7 Exynos variant, and over 50% faster in the test than either Snapdragon 821 phone I tested. Hopefully this means good things. Next up are SunSpider and Kraken, which measure how long it takes to complete a series of benchmark tests, so a lower score is better for these two, as opposed to higher for everything else in this post.   The 835 comes out on top (rather, bottom) in both tests, though it has a surprisingly strong advantage in the SunSpider test. I'm unsure what build of Chrome the reference phone was running (sorry, that's my bad), so I wonder if we could be seeing some kind of anomaly there. Conclusion Surprise: newer chip is faster than older chips! Sometimes a lot faster. Sometimes a little. I try not to take benchmarks too seriously, because they are definitively unreal experiences - there's very little they tell us that guarantees a particular user experience when a piece of hardware technology is implemented in a consumer product. Of course, we can draw some basic conclusions: the Snapdragon 835 probably isn't going to set the world on fire with its single-core performance, which seems just marginally better, though the switch from 4 cores last year to 8 this year will almost definitely benefit multithreaded workloads. The shrink to a 10nm process will make the chip more efficient while doing the same work when compared to a Snapdragon 821, as well. I think the Adreno 540 is also very considerably faster than the GPU in the 820-series Snapdragons, though Qualcomm was completely mum on how those gains were achieved. We don't even know if it has more core clusters - Qualcomm keeps Adreno under a pretty tight lock and key, so we'll have to wait for microscopic and x-ray analysis to really learn anything about that side of things, probably. All in all, though, I was glad to experience the benchmarking event, and I hope to have a post more about how everything went down for you later this week, as opposed to the cold, dry numbers in this article (which I know many of you want to see, regardless). We also went to Qualcomm's labs to check out things like power consumption, imaging, and virtual reality, so there are things we discussed that I haven't even brought up here. But if you're just in it for the bar graphs and tables, I hope you got something out of this post. This is my first real go at a benchmarking feature, and I realize my graph visuals aren't the best (this week has been insane [see: this little thing], otherwise I'd have given them proper attention for more consistency), so my apologies for that. But I wanted to be sure we got them out there for you. So, anyway, forgive a bit of sloppiness here and there, and thanks again to Qualcomm for having me.

A Person Soon enough these numbers will be a jump from something like 10,200 to 10,800 and the performance bump will go unnoticed. Gustavo Well, if you test on Geekbench 3(that was used back in the day), the numbers should be even higher than from these tests. With Geekbench 4 the numbers are lower. trwnh Psht, remember getting above 5 MFLOPS in Linpack? krazyfrog BenchmarkPi or GTFO Toss3 While those numbers are quite good the thing that matters most is sustained performance and latency when switching between clusters. This is why ARM's new DynamIQ is going to be quite revolutionary. freeper Looks like Exynos is better. That plus the 6 GB of RAM makes me wish that I could get the Chinese, Japanese or South Korean version of the Galaxy S8+. M3D1T8R Nice numbers. But what I'm really waiting to see is battery life info. The remarkable new 10nm process coupled with a large battery like 5 Ah could finally give us true flagship performance without sacrificing great battery life - something that currently requires going with a midrange (14nm) Snapdragon 625. Let's only hope that manufactures don't take the likely impressive efficiency improvements​ of the 835 and give it all away by including smaller batteries in the name of ever thinner devices. Give us Snapdragon 835 and 5 Ah, and we'll have my next flagship. Until then, 625 it is. 835 and a small 3Ah battery will likely perform decent for most casual users, but for great battery life I'll happily take something like a Zenfone 3 Zoom along with $400 left in my pocket. Muzaffar Having 835 SoC and yet we're using it just for WhatsApp, facebook, etc. I'm still using Note 4 exynos version, and still smooth even with 4 multiwindow at the same time. There are some noticeable lag on games (but mobile games are jokes anyway). So you are right, power optimization is much more desirable. Unless Microsoft ready to release Win10 ARM version, then it would be a different story. rafly sadly, Windows RT is a failed project because practically you got no customer software (all I know is some business related), and you can't use x86 software on it. Hopefully after SD835, we're now seeing a full Windows 10 on Tablet/Phone that can be docked crutchcorn Oh, you haven't heard the news? Microsoft got FULL Windows on Snapdragon 835 rafly I know. the reason why I typed hopefully, because I don't think that x86 software can work flawlessly on ARM CPU—not on release at least. crutchcorn https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaSmZzo3Y_c I dunno, this looks pretty smooth to me Mike Nope. Google Windows server on Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. There was a register article on it last week. tansuperman Correct. It's not full windows more like virtual. Muzaffar It's not native windows, but it's fully working. Same like when you play Mario on android phone. Jack Smith Win10? For a phone? Think Windows phone is dead. Muzaffar Have you seen full windows 10 running on SD 820? Jack Smith But without apps why does it matter? Muzaffar It's matter because you can actually run full ms office, adobe photoshop, even Steam and other x86 apps/program. I'm not talking about Win 10 mobile, i'm talking about full windows 10, the same windows 10 that run on your PC or laptop. Ezzy Photoshop on ARM. Good luck. Loved Wait.. What? 835SoC is enough for Facebook???? You're kidding me.. Right? charlie Jason That's precisely what manufacturers are gonna do. Make the phone thinner to "take advantage of" the better efficiency. marcusmarcus2 "Nice numbers. But what I'm really waiting to see is battery life info." Umm, won't that info also be numbers. /s All seriousness, I completely agree with you. john doe It's called replaceable battery ;) Nathan J It's pretty much a given that the SD835 beats other Snapdragon processors, though the Exynos comparison is a good metric, for those who can get that device. I'm curious to see how the SD835 stacks up to the Apple A10. They both smash all the previous Snapdragon processors, that's for sure, but hopefully the SD835 at least catches up to Apple, six months later. Because that was when Android was at its best. When the new iPhone would come out and smash all the Android flagships. Everyone was working so hard to compete then. Today the competition feels stale by comparison. Cakefish Nope, the Snapdragon 835 is nowhere near the power of the Apple A10. D13H4RD2L1V3 Am I the only who's kinda "meh" with the GB scores after experiencing the Kirin 960's CPU on the Mate 9? GPU is unsurprisingly beastly, though. Hoping that the new 10nm fabrication actually gives us some gains in efficiency, and not used as an excuse for a 2000mAh battery in a 5.7" device because its razor-thin.... Eumelanin Knight I'm actually more interested in what QC does with their midrange chips this year. Wouldn't mind an article like this for those. efc64 What details do you have on the test device itself David? Looks like a 5.5"-5.7" phablet, 1440p? What RAM? Any hints as to how much the device throttles? I realise that these are all subjective things but they play a part too in addition to raw benches Tech Writer It's a 5.5" phone with QHD resolution. Since it's a platform testing device, it's fairly thick to maintain cool thermals and not throttle. It has 6GB RAM. -From AnandTech. Ryan J Like others have said, I'm interested to see the affect on battery life and how quick it sucks one dry. Also, what about heat? It is definitely efficient at processing, but how often is it going to get throttled from overheating joseph carmine nero Nice article. Thanks but this emphasize on single core apple is bullshit Martins Nkem why? joseph carmine nero Because it's no longer as relevant as it used to be.Android can now use multicore in almost every app. it's like ignoring the total power of the SOC Kiko Eschobar UX performance is very much tied to single core performance.. Ever wondered why I phones don't stutter nearly as often? Proper UX compensation. Meanwhile, Android is still seeing cores thrown at the problem like dudes throw 20 dollar bills at strippers. I wouldn't be shocked if the iPhone 7 remained the performance king until 7s (8) comes out. joseph carmine nero I don't have any stutters on my Z5 so I find it completely BS.like when people said WP is totally smooth but mine had loading screens instead of lag Curt Hopefully the Pixel 2 will squeeze this in. matteventu Hopefully NO. Pixel will come at end-2017. This is a CPU of 1st/2nd quarter of 2017. I'm not saying it's a bad CPU, but just that they will do something like S820>S821. Not like they did with Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X, using CPUs available since the beginning of the year. I cross my fingers for a Snap836. Cakefish 2nd quarter. Galaxy S8 won't be out until April and it's the first phone with this SOC. charlie Jason SD821 is hardly different from SD820. SD836 will be a similar story if it does exist. What Google really needs to do is start launching their phones closer to April, when the latest SD chips become available, rather than selling flagships that have processors that will become last gen in six months. Duder12 It's better to compete next to the iPhone. You are backpedaling. Google needs to finish their own SOC. Not increase reliance on Qualcomm. Dubs816 Why would it be better to compete next to the iPhone? It would actually be better to get a head start on the iPhone than to go head-to-head with it. That is a battle the Pixel will lose every single time. charlie Jason It's unlikely that their own SoC will competed favorably against Qualcomm's SD flagship. Especially in the GPU department. Jack Smith No reason to do SOC. Instead things like the TPU makes far more sense. wicketr There was a premium for that 821 device. Personally, i wish they would have gone for the 820 and added wireless charging, waterproofing, and stereo speakers for the same price. Duder12 It was for VR and the camera DSP. Middlefinger Looks like Exynos 9 will be faster based on other data ive seen. This is pretty much always the case though in Exynos v Snapdragon hough. Gregory IMO, mobile CPUs have already gotten to the point where additional performance isn't beneficial. I mean, flagship smartphones have been running buttery-smooth for like 2 or 3 years, what else that CPU performance can be used for? An average user isn't going to do anything computationally heavy on this kind of device. Ammar "I mean, flagship smartphones have been running buttery-smooth for like 2 or 3 years" That's a joke, right? Gregory No. SGS6 is smooth, as is Nexus 6P, as is Google Pixel. Rod Nexus 5 was smooth since 2013. Marvin R. And everybody should stop to be innovative when some users feel always ok with the current status? Maybe you think everything is maxed out since years but if you look at complexity of apps (e.g. HDR photos, 4k videos) and competition (iPhone is leading most of the time with CPU power) then there is still room for improvement. And when looking at browsers a CPU cannot be too fast ;) Gregory Faster CPU allows for less optimized code, that's it with browsers basically. Current CPUs handle 4k video and HDR photos just fine. Why don't they already focus on batteries that don't suck? Good_Ole_Pinocchio They have to focus on ALL of it at the same time. Cakefish The first buttery smooth high end phone was the Pixel. Rod I disagree. The Nexus 5 was buttery since it's launch. chris pinkston I'll take all the extra they want to give but I agree. The average user doesn't need more . Look at how powerful the apple A10 is single core compared to sd820/821 yet the iPhone doesn't offer that much different of an experience compared to something like a pixel or OnePlus 3 in typical task. With more processing power though it gives software room to grow. Plus the added multi core power is nice for all we do on our devices at once sometimes. Lars Jeppesen As a mobile web application developer, I have do kindly disagree with you. Web apps/browsers need more GPU performance and raw javascript performance.. there's still some way to go before we have 100% smoothness level compared to native apps. But it's getting close with modern web techniques... Gregory As a native Android app developer, I also disagree with you. Web apps are DOA as a concept. Web technologies aren't suited to build real apps, and I doubt they will ever be. JS will always be slower compared to languages used to build native apps because of the amount of (unnecessary) freedom it gives like dynamic data types or the ability to add/remove fields in an object at runtime. Even if we would have an ideal JIT for both Java and JS, these things are going to severely limit the ways to optimize the runtime performance in JS. Lars Jeppesen Why does that matter if the cpu is fast enough? You're argumenting that Java is DOA because C is much faster, and Java will never be as fast as C. Native apps have their advantages, Web apps have other advantages over Native. They both have their place. Web technologies are perfectly suited to build real apps. I'm not sure if you're joking of just haven't followed much of the Web development for the past couple of years. Dominic81 I'm pretty sure the new Exynos will be superior, again YouNex Yes, unfortunately for us Rod Actually, the S835 just beated it on Geekbench. Dubs816 The Snapdragon 835 just beat the new Exynos on Geekbench in single and multi score? Please share. asrat_24 The new Exynos isn't out yet how could it beat it? He's confused 😕 Rod Sure. http://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Galaxy-S8-Plus-2.png Bojo Talerico Unless there is some unknown issue like overheating on the 810 Lars Jeppesen All podcasts I've been listening to lately say that it doesn't make any difference that the LG G6 comes with the 821 - that the user won't notice any difference and that the 821 is just as capable as the 835... I know most UX is single core, but still - I think we're gonna get all those bloggers to eat their words when the first 835 products hit the street... Ammar "I know most UX is single core" Which is why despite having 8 cores, Android performance is still lightyears behind iOS. Lars Jeppesen At least I get to choose which browser I want to use on Android. krazyfrog Are you not aware that you can install other browsers on iOS? Cheer Chunhao I think he meant he can set the default browser, which from what I last heard, is still not possible on iOS Lars Jeppesen Nope, I meant Apple doesn't allow 3rd party browsers on iOS. All "browsers" are essentially skins on Webkit (Safari's engine) Nuno Monteiro 2.5.6 Apps that browse the web must use the appropriate WebKit framework and WebKit Javascript. From the app store guidelines. All browsers on iOS are essentially a wrapper over the provided WebKit libs. A Safari with a different aesthetic, if you will. So, yeah, you can install browsers to your heart's content on iOS, but they will all be a repackaged Safari, I'm afraid. krazyfrog Didn't know people were so obsessed with the underlying engine of a browser to reduce everything else about it as just an aesthetic. Chrome alone feels wildly different from Safari due to its UI. And Firefox Focus is in a different league altogether. The user couldn't care less that the engine underneath are roughly identical because of their different user experiences, which is primarily what people download different browsers for. Lars Jeppesen Are you not aware that all browsers on iOS are just skins with Webkit as the engine? Apple does not allow 3rd party browsers on their platform. krazyfrog That is some hair-brained pedantry. Didn't know a browser had to have a different engine for it to qualify as a different browser. By that logic Chrome and Opera on desktop are also the same browser with different "skins". Lars Jeppesen Well I believe that there are aspects you are overlooking: 1. Yes, Chrome and Opera are using the same engine. This is a CHOICE made by Opera because they don't have the resources to develop their own. They also used Webkit before Google forked the Blink engine, because they got tired of how slow progress was made. The point being here, that Opera made a choice - and on all platforms except iOS you have CHOICES of other browsers with other browser engines. Apple, on the other hand, FORBIDS other browser engines, meaning that no browser vendor has a choice. Everybody is forced to use Apple's engine. 2. Why does Apple do this? Well, it effectively lets them control implementation of new browser features. This means there is no competition on it's platform (as Safari gets further preferential treatment on the OS level) and no new HTML standards can be implemented on the platform without Apple's approval. 3. Apple uses this to cripple and slow progress of web applications as much as possible, because better and more powerful web applications would become a threat to Apple's control via the native applications. 4. In recent years, Apple has become the "new Microsoft" in terms of being behind on new standards, trying to hold back the Web on it's platform. Revolutionary new technologies like Service Workers, offline Push, offline synchronization, and many many other new standards, cannot be implemented on the platform. 5. Apple demonstrates it's lack of commitment for the web by never ever attending conferences, gatherings, or other communities regarding web development. Something all other browser vendors do - and contribute to. They even work together to ensure new standards are implemented in a good way. Apple doesn't care (about it's customers) because it wants to keep control. I hope you can see that what I wrote was absolutely not pedantic, as it has profound consequences. TegTronix™ Certified Dealer Android performance is actually just as or better than iOS in some ways, and the same shit for iOS. But, comparing the two is like comparing a heavy weight OS like W10 and iOS would be Light running Linux. It just doesn't fare out in the end. I'd like to see a SD chip in an apple device and the A10 in an Android. It probably wouldn't score that well, the A10. chris pinkston Only it's not. Android has gotten really efficient in the past few versions. Ever used a Nexus or pixel? See how smooth and fluid pure Android is running in hardware that isn't as powerful as Apple's A10 chip.. Androids ui and animation smoothness rivaling ios.Performanve even being faster in some areas like opening system apps, light third party apps and web browsing at times. tiger Nor does iPhone kick apps out of memory...despite 2GB RAM. chris pinkston True but does it matter? There are Android phones that have great ram management as well, they have more ram usually but what does it matter when you don't pay anymore for it vs iPhone. tiger You are paying similar money for inferior engineering and design...and lack of future proofing hurts. Ammar "It will perform better in a single heavy workload app" Which is basically 99% of usage for most people. chris pinkston Average usage is light social media apps, web browsing , email and picture taking. High end androids open and execute these task just as fast as the iPhone and I some cases faster. You would have to get into something heavier like to see the single core processing power advantage of the A10. Tech Writer Most UX is not single core. Even simple apps like chrome can utilize all 8 cores rather well. And you are forgetting the background tasks, listeners and multi-window. Not to mention that multi-core processors are often much smoother due to less number of context switches. Lars Jeppesen Unless you ate using Webworkers, Javascript is single threaded Ammar Samsung will still find a way to make this lag like a bitch on their S8. Renan I don't know what you're talking about. My S5 shows no noticeable smoothness while running either TouchWiz or LineageOS. Both feels pretty solid for me. Dash Dillinger Are u running like 0 apps? Renan Nope. All my apps installed, including Facebook. Never had anything to complain about the performance. Randroid You could run Facebook on a phone with 7 of the best processor in the world, and it would still lag because the app is so terribly written. Lord Argyris Well, you're in luck, since I heard that Saygus will be coming out with just such a phone. Gustavo Yeah, but run it for like 6 months or more without wiping on TouchWiz. You will see it lags like shit TegTronix™ Certified Dealer My dad had a Galaxy S6 before switching to the Moto X, due to him disliking the TouchWiz UI, but, nonetheless he had it for about 8 months, and it ran "buttery smooth" I don't know what your phone's problem is, sir, but, you need to manage it. I'm still on a Nexus 6, and it's running like new. asrat_24 Sadly same experience my gf had her Samsung phone was initially great but after a couple months it lagged like hell. Not really sure what triggers it Jack Smith I can factory reset my s7e and still noticeably way more lag than my sons Pixel that never been reset. Touch lag. Justin Every Samsung phone I have used was very stuttery after like 2 months... Except for the s6 edge which used exynos. I am currently using the pixel and it's way smoother than any samsung. I wont buy another Samsung phone unless it's an exynos variant which they refuse to sell in the U.S. Jack Smith Same on buying Samsung. My s7e is first and last! Pixel 2 is my next phone. TegTronix™ Certified Dealer Then you, sir, don't know how to use an Android. If it's lagging, you need to delete some shit/stop some apps. And, also, it could just be the bloatware from certain carriers(I.e. T-Mobile or AT&T) The exynos variants are always much more stable because the chip was precisely made for that phone, AND why it isn't as good with SD is merely because the device was built to be used with Exynos. Atleast that's what I think. needa You don't have to close apps anymore. Haven't for quite some time. Bloatware doesn't really do a whole lot either nowadays, as background processes are much more efficient in Android, not to mention the power of the soc. And exynos most certainly is not made for the Galaxy. They are two separate divisions within Samsung. They actually bid and sell their chips to the mobile side. I run an extremely clean OnePlus One. And I still get lag from time to time. It is the nature of the beast. More so with Samsung, as they do a ton of their own stuff. Rod That mindset is exactly what kills Android. The user doesn't need to do anything. The system has to take care of itself. Ever heard of anyone having to kill apps on the iPhone? Mike Yes. Maybe many users just use iPhones for web and messaging, but I left iPhone for Android a few years back because iOS crashed just as much, but I could get a more powerful and configurable Android for less. DragoCubed It's in response to the "you dont know how to use android" part. so basically saying everyone needs to disable, delete and force stop apps, which you don't. Not Everyone tiger You do realize that iPhones maintain 60 fps in pretty much everything...from UI to high-demand gaming. Yielar1 I'll have to borrow my nieces iPhone sometime Rod It doesn't matter what the user does with his phone. iOS limits background usage, so you can rest assure your battery won't be eaten by some rogue app. TegTronix™ Certified Dealer I don't have to force stop apps since marshmallow I'm on 7.1.1 and my battery has been just swell. No lag in gaming either, such as Mobius FF, and Asphalt Xtreme But it's just that it annoys me when some are bitching about their battery and they have over 20 apps downloaded, all being social media which tend to be battery eaters. Rod The problem is not planned battery usage. It's rogue apps. I know that Whatsapp, Snapchat, Facebook, Telegram and whatnot will continously use power to ping the servers. But what I didn't count on, was Flynx eating 40% of my battery while the phone was in my pocket, because I had a website that auto-reloads loaded in it. Left me stranded for the rest of the afternoon. TegTronix™ Certified Dealer Funny, I mentioned that in a new comment. But yeah, I agree with that as well. Yielar1 Yes, coworker's are having to kill apps constantly to save battery. Rod Ridiculous. Cakefish Can you define 'lag' please? I see the same complaint posted around the internet everywhere, but I don't think I'm interpreting it the way the original posters intended. I can safely say that my Exynos Galaxy S7 does not lag much at all. The UFS storage means that apps launch quickly from a cold state and reload quickly from the multitasking view. It never seems to miss letters out in the keyboard. Loading websites is fast in the browser. So instances of genuine input lag are very few and far between. However, what it doesn't do very well is keep a consistent 60fps refresh rate when drawing UI animations, such as scrolling through menus and between screens as well as within apps etc. It skips frames a lot throughout the UI. This is what makes the Pixel and iPhones feel so smooth and fluid as they can maintain 60fps on a much more consistent basis throughout the UI. So I'd say my Galaxy S7 doesn't lag but definitely has trouble maintaining a solid 60fps refresh rate throughout the UI. chris pinkston Yes that is what most people see as "lag". I'd don't like it and that's why I left Samsung a long time ago. My Nexus 6p is so much smoother and consistent In It's ui, animations and such. Having stuttery UI, keyboards and such just makes the expensive device feel lacking even if it's fast. Cakefish I'm going to go for the Pixel 2 (or whatever Google call it) this year to replace my Galaxy S7. I'm going to skip the Galaxy S8 for that same reason, it just isn't capable of maintaining a smooth fluid UI most of the time. Again, that's not the same thing as input lag, I wish people would stop mixing the two up. Kelderic I was going to get a Pixel to replace my Galaxy S4, but first it was sold out, and then I had to pay for a car fix. And now, we're halfway to Pixel 2. Plan now is to do the same as you, wait until P2 comes out and get that. Yielar1 Pixel is mediocre at best compared to other flagships. What's with the huge bezels and lacking camera features? I'm a Google fan but they missed the mark on the og Pixel. Samsung isn't going to pull any punches this year on the S8 and Note 8. Probably why they anticipate a larger preorder than the popular S7. Going to be a great year for flagships especially if they increase battery mah..since thinner hasn't been a request for 5 years or more. tansuperman Sammy makes the very best hardware, but once again they will have horrible software and heat issues. Heat issues were not just from the note 7. Every Sammy phone has had it. bekifft Heat issues != spontaneous combustion. Kind of a different class of problem. Yielar1 No heat issues with my S7 Edge or my Note 7 I had to surrender. I did have issues with my Note 4 but things seem to be much improved with the Grace UI. bekifft Thinner hasn't been a request for a long time, yet for the last five years they always tout it like someone asked for it. At this point I feel they are all completely deaf to it. I guarantee you most phones with this processor will be thinner than anyone wanted and have smaller batteries than anyone asked for. I mean everyone loves a camera hump right?! Jack Smith Pixel camera is incredible. I am tired of Samsung lag personally and my #1 desired feature. But no heat issues with my S7e just lag, lag, lag. Impulse_Vigil Or we could accept input lag isn't the only kind of lag... You can call it frame skipping, stuttering, whatever, but it's just semantics in this context. Cakefish I suppose, but I believe that lumping any and every kind of performance issue all under the term 'lag' doesn't reflect on the true nature of the issue. I guess I just need to accept that the are differing definitions of the word. Impulse_Vigil If one wanted to be accurate, I agree, for me lag also recalls something slightly different (connection induced lag is the earliest exposure I remember to the word, much closer to input lag)... Fighting common online vernacular is like swimming upstream tho. Shoot, people didn't wanna know why/how even when absolutely all Android phones featured the same kind of graphical issues (and to a greater extent) while iOS had the most heavy handed animations to mask any slowdown. They shouldn't have to either tbh... Jack Smith Same for me. Gave my son a Pixel and i have a S7 Edge. Never again. The S7 lag drives me crazy. I know a 1st world problem. But when you use both back to back the Samsung lag is very noticeable! I am getting a Pixel 2 and would love to get on a wait list today. Justin Still trying to brag about Nexus 6P? The battery life is absolutely terrible. period. 2×4 big paragraph to say it can't maintain fluidity (60Hz refresh). yes, that's called lag it’s me tim-cock. That is not lag bra! Avieshek Rajkhowa Bra? Cakefish I was asking for their definition of 'lag' because different people have differing definitions of that word. Some people use 'lag' as a generic term to describe any kind of performance issue, but I don't. Rod https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2016/08/SmartSelectGIF_2016-08-22-07-42-41.gif skitchbeatz The spikes you're seeing are a product of a poorly written app. Still funny though. krazyfrog This is from the S7/HTC 10 comparison. Same app worked fine on the HTC 10. Cheer Chunhao Then I guess android itself is poorly written then. I have seen a lot of spikes even just scrolling the system UI (notification shade and settings, for example). skitchbeatz ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Prithvi Boinpally So then why aren't those spikes on the Pixel, OP3T, or other close to stock phones? Cheer Chunhao I guess I should have mentioned that my statement is based on my experience with a Nexus 6, which is my daily driver. They are usually smooth, but there will just be occasion that its not, my point is, its not consistent. tansuperman Android is very poorly written. Always has been. Ammar You'll hardly see that kind of lag on a Pixel phone. It's a product of a poorly written and useless OEM skin. Major Sceptic They all lag at times mate , anyone that tells you different is full of it . MicroNix "They all lag at times mate , anyone that tells you different is full of it " So true. Nexus/Pixel owners will always say their sh*t don't lag but watch when a news item comes up saying Google released a fix for jank on a Nexus and suddenly, and just for that news story only, they all crawl out of the woodwork and start talking about their horror stories of having to reboot their Nexus devices sometimes daily or they slow down to a crawl. I had my Exynos S7 Edge go 58 days without a reboot and no lag whatsoever. Major Sceptic Indeed my friend , I also have a 6p and while it's not a bad device , it certainly has its share of slow downs , certainly over the years phones have improved considerably , pixels , I phones it doesn't matter non are perfect despite some claims they are. Senrab Nala Woopy do that's not long. Ive had my note 5 since they came out and it's been shit after about 8 months now it's none stop problems. Jack Smith Actually not the Pixel. Samsung also gets worse over time. Major Sceptic I remember a fellow doing a review saying that very thing , one second later the device had a major lag , then after a cut in the film and an edit it was back to lag free pixel viewing , I so laughed my head off , anyway as for the Galaxy phones mine have actually gotten better as time went on , and they did not suffer from Bluetooth issues, wifi issues , scratchy speaker , scratchy glass back, flare problems in the camera , microphone problems . But If you're happy with yours mate , that's great , I hope it stays that way for you . For me though I just think there are better devices out there that are not over inflated prices . Cakefish I look forward to getting either a Pixel or an iPhone later this year. Preferably a Pixel if Google can deliver a worthy 2017 phone. Jack Smith That is the big question. Can Google ramp up and fill Pixel 2 demand? There is already a lot of buzz so they need to make a lot. Plus more carriers in the US. I buy unlocked phones but many is the US do not. Cakefish I don't care about what Google do with carriers as I too plan to buy unlocked. Rod So why didn't the other ones lag? Senrab Nala I got Pixel and it lags aswel. Rod Contrary to what everyone says.. Cakefish I believe what those bars are representing are dropped frames, am i right? I've just tried it myself, I'm not seeing as many bars as in the screenshot above. Is that screenshot of the Snapdragon S7 by any chance? I'm also using Gboard if that makes any difference. Still, I never claimed that the phone could consistently maintain 60fps without any dropped frames. In fact, I claimed the opposite! Rod The bars represent how long it took to draw a frame. The green horizontal bar represents 16ms. For the UI to achieve 60FPS, all the vertical bars must be equal or shorter than the horizontal line. makapav How does one enable that view? Rod Developer settings > GPU profiling Joey Sfb How does GPU profiling related to Android OS being poorly written? It just a indicator for the device GPU draw speed vs its current rendering load. The rendering load could come from the Android processes, OEM customisation, App processes etc... Till someone set a reference point its not an effective measurement to compare even between two devices. Rod Use a Pixel and a Samsung with GPU profiling enabled, and you'll see the difference. Ammar Lag means slowness in launching apps and general stuttering and hiccups in animations or scrolling. If your S7 does that, which you say it does, then it lags. Cakefish No I don't get any delay in launching apps. Just occasionally stuttery animations and a lack of consistent 60fps scrolling. Ammar You don't see a delay because you're not comparing it with anything. Put it alongside an iPhone 7 and see. Cory S My definition is when I take it out of my pocket, and the lock screen chops away slowly over 15 seconds, and then I click on an app and have to wait another 5-6 for it to load, or when the keyboard is 3-4 letters behind me when typing. Cakefish My S7 certainly doesn't suffer from that, thankfully. Jack Smith Also have a S7 Edge and until replacing the Samsung software like touchwiz with Google had lag. Was a pain. Most frustrating was it wanting me to create a Samsung account but finally ended it nagging me. Suresh Aryal This "Samsung lags" BS has to stop. Every phone lags period. By the way my Exynos S7 on Nougat is faster than anything I have ever seen including my friend's Nexus 6P and OP 3T, memory management is top-notch (in fact better than Pixels), has great battery saving features (I could put it on max power saving mode and make it run for a couple of days). The only bad thing about this phone is slow updates and average speaker. Rod BS? https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ charlie Jason These Samsung defenders need to start accepting the fact that Samsung stutters even when using fast processors. OnePlus and Pixel are simply way smoother. Bob Marley iPhone is smoother than OnePlus/Pixel too. charlie Jason That is true. Paul Hansen The Note 7 was actually usable unfortunately we couldn't actually own one Yielar1 Loved my N7 Paul Hansen Me too... Still have it in a drawer Jack Smith Did the Note lag as bad as the S7e? Or was it like the Pixel? Talking touch lag. Paul Hansen somewhere in between Yielar1 If you want an ugly phone and subpar screen and camera Rod This Jack Smith Totally agree. Use a Samsung and Pixel back to back and you will never appologize for Samsung again. dazed1 When you use the gpu rending script, it makes the lags! they do NOT exsist otherwise, i have tested this many times. Rod What script? It's a system's native tool. dazed1 The native tool itself makes the lags. Justin Galaxy S7 speaker is good enough, it's only softer by a little bit compared to Galaxy S6. I owned a Nexus 6P and the battery life is rubbish. Ammar "By the way my Exynos S7 on Nougat is faster than anything I have ever seen including my friend's Nexus 6P and OP 3T, memory management is top-notch (in fact better than Pixels)," LOL. Suresh Aryal LOL? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w-HYw-y0BI Watch this. tansuperman That's very believable. Lol Jack Smith This is NOT true. I have a s7e and gave son a Pixel. Ever since my s7e drives me crazy! Use both back to back and tell me there is no a diffrence. Btw, i have factory reset the s7e multiple times! Once you feel the diffrence it changes everything. I am talking touch lag. Jack Smith Replace the Samsung software like Touchwiz with Google and solves lag. Player Slayer Maybe the 835 will finally be able to run The Trail on something higher than low graphical settings! -Pixel XL user Marvin R. I know this is Android Police. But why not putting the latest iPhone also in the charts just for comparison (Apple is one of the best mobile CPU semiconductor)? chris pinkston They don't manufacture anything. They design now but don't manufacture. MJ Why? It would be irrelevant as the Ax series chipset doesn't run Android. Marvin R. But many of the benchmarks do run on iOS. I also don't care much of iOS but I'm interested in the technical standpoint and how far mobile CPUs have developed (I also don't like to ignore one of the biggest competitor). Apple mobile CPUs have often the highest benchmarks and Qualcomm is playing catchup game with them (this is the usual cycle in mobile CPUs for years). crutchcorn Hint: Apple murders everything else MJ I wasn't saying the benchmarks don't run on iOS. I said it's irrelevant... The Apple chip can be 50x faster but as I have no interest in the platform so it's irrelevant. chris pinkston True but when people see what's possible they want that in their device of choice. I prefer Android and would like a chip just as powerful as the A10 available for an Android phone. That said, I'm ok with the snapdragons because software for the most part doesn't exceed the capabilities of any of these flagship chips. Plus snapdragon 835 will only be inferior in single core cpu performance. Multi core cpu, GPU, wireless connectivity and features will be better on snapdragon Cheer Chunhao Yeah, it's pretty pathetic to see the difference between the single core performance of iPhone 7 vs even the 835. Winston Battery is the one I'm looking out for Rod Moto Z Play Winston Im tempted by the battery. But I've tried it and the camera AF is still utter garbage. Used a Moto X 14 and learnt how bad a camera could possibly be now. Its a shame too. The standard Z camera didnt have the same issue in my testing. Rod Yeah. I hope it's sucessor will keep it's battery life and improve on the rest. Winston If the Z2 Play gets the Pixel camera and same battery, plus a better FP sensor design, its my next phone. Rod I doubt it'll have a camera as good as Pixel's. It's a mid-range phone. The best camera will be on the Z. Cakefish In terms of CPU performance it's not a significant jump from the Exynos 8890. The focus appears to be mostly on energy efficiency rather than just raw CPU performance with this SOC. Cesar Cardoso For the use cases Qualcomm is apparently targeting the 835 (Samsung DeX, Windows 10), the SoC...er...platform looks promising, with enough firepower and a good hope of a great battery life (all hail 10nm). Let's see how it plays in the hands of the OEMs. Badelhas The most important thing at the moment is battery life. It sucks having to charge our phones during the afternoon or we wont make it through the day. Why do we only have 5000mAh batteries on cheap or mid range phones from some Chinese brands? Why cant we have a super high-end smartphone with a decent battery? I don't get it... needa Weight. Derik Taylor They could probably do that, but don't complain if the cost of the phone comes close to $1000. Max Johnson It'll also be huge with big bezels and no headphone jack. Rod Get a Moto Z Play Raj Will speak to my colleagues at HTC and see what we can do. charlie Jason My guess is that a huge battery only pleases the power users. But extra thickness and weight will turn off the average consumers. Alexis Urena I think the fact that its paired with the x16 modem is way more interesting than the fact that's its slightly faster than the already decent 821. needa TBH all I really care about are the browser benches. It is nice to see Qualcomm catching up to Apple in the aspect. 90% of my mobile usage is Chrome and Assistant. tiger Not in Google's own Octane benchmark.... Rash For argument, faster processor makes better response on phone. But often software underneath and real-life usage may not show much differentiation in user experience when comparing Snapdragon 821 vs 835 in phones. It definitely good for marketing touting benchmarks and possibly show some improvement in hardcore games. But, for most users, it ain't make any difference in daily usage and most even don't know what processor the phone is running on. So, look at your real needs and upgrade accordingly and SAVE money to spend on better things. Momchil Karabulev Huawei P10 results looks strange - on my phone I get 1932 (single) and 6364 (multi) points on Geekbench 4. kishan Love Androidpolice.

Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) what I found interesting is how different the S7e (SD) vs S7e (EX) are. I hope this new chip still outperforms the new exynos chip or at least matches it. Rod It did beat Exynos 9xxx in Geekbench. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) thanks for the info Rod You're welcome Cakefish Exynos 9 hasn't been officially benchmarked yet as far as I'm aware? There were unverified leaks but nothing substantial. Unless I've missed something?

Because if not, they can't be fairly compared to the results in this article. Rod This probably was caught during internal testing. But we'll have to wait for the release and compare the results. Lawrence Can't even match the iPhone 6S. Single core Lars Jeppesen How about multicore? It's all about priorities wcjeep What was the Nougat screen resolution set to on the S7 Edge for testing? Max Johnson That's nice, but they 'forgot' to include the results for the A10 chip. I would like higher performance for single core. mattcoz Still using Sunspider? I mean, the improvement is impressive, but come on. cryosx Anandtech has their preview out for the 835 Rod http://www.anandtech.com/show/11201/qualcomm-snapdragon-835-performance-preview reggjoo There are a lot of responses, as to what lag really is, I don't feel like fighting about the definition, but the author of this article should write a post on what people consider what lag is, and can it be measured in a scientific way. Rod It can. https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2016/08/SmartSelectGIF_2016-08-22-07-42-41.gif https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ reggjoo That's not lag, you have a hardware, or software conflict. Either something is going bad with the hardware, or some software isn't right. I had that happen to me, when I had a LG G3, it started doing that, and when I would plug it up to a pc, that was off, for some reason it would start the pc, or attempt to. In the end, it got the demigod error, and eventually would buzz very loudly, through the speaker, and freeze, then go back to the demigod error. Hope your phone's not going thru a death spiral. Rod That's lag. The UI is taking too long to render the frames. reggjoo Ok, you win, that's why the author of this article should do a article on this. Cakefish I find the problem with the term is that it's too vague. It could mean a time delay between touching the screen and seeing a response (my own personal definition of smartphone lag) or it could mean stuttery animations across the UI or it could mean a general inability to maintain 60fps update schedule when drawing elements of the UI, such as when scrolling etc. Leonardo Baez If anything... i'm impressed by the Huawei first attempt on soc performance. br_hermon "Newer chip is faster than older chips!" So then the REAL news here is just how flippin awesome of a job OnePlus did with the 3T. *Slow Clap* Roberto Virga I'm sorry, I cannot trust anyone who has tasted Qualcomm's Mahi-Mahi. From what I've been told, it's irresistible, and it causes reporters to lose all their objectivity. Why this press event? In a few weeks, Samsung will announce the S8, and we will have the chance to test the 835 performance on our own. We've witnessed in the past OEMs cheating by disabling throttling in benchmarks, so these numbers coming from Qualcomm don't mean much to me. TegTronix™ Certified Dealer I'm surprised Google hasn't bothered removing all those rogue apps that crash alot, don't work at all, or lie. They give Android a bad name. That's one of the core reasons iOS users won't move to Android, due to application stability. I don't see how someone is intrigued by Apple's design, tbh. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm holding out for the SD975 it's supposed to be 5839274 better Marcelove "Qualcomm certainly could tune the device to know to run at peak speed when known benchmarks are detected, but they'd be far from the only company to do this." What makes every company doing this untrustworthy and the whole article pointless ( aside with benchmark values "per se")... Real tests? Those where we check browsers loading webpages, many apps being launched one after other and total time wasted, fps of games, etc... meyerweb And yet the S8 with the Exynos SoC appears to still be faster than with the 835. Why is Qualcomm always a half step behind? Cakefish I'd guess that it could be because Qualcomm dedicate more resources to the GPU instead of the CPU. It's well known that Qualcomm GPUs are the fastest in the Android phone world. Every SOC has a thermal and power budget and I'd guess that these limits are very similar between Snapdragon and Exynos, as both are and have been manufactured on the same process node in the past and present. So, if the GPU takes up more of that budget, it leaves less room for the CPU to stretch its legs, so to speak. Billy William W. Phillips Cornhole? Kind of a little too much info bud...:) modeless > Single-core scores have the 835 just marginally faster than the 821, a little over 10% or so. So we're probably not going to see major single-thread performance improvements with the 835. So disappointing! Single-core performance is where Apple is absolutely spanking Qualcomm (note they didn't let you benchmark against A10) and they're not doing anything about it. Single-core performance matters a lot more than the number of cores, and the entire Android ecosystem is suffering because of it. Anzhel Bozhinov AnandTech proved that Android works perfectly with HMP: http://www.anandtech.com/show/9518/the-mobile-cpu-corecount-debate/18 Shamoy Rahman This year isn't a crazy rush, it isn't a need for speed, instead Qualcomm is focusing big time on significantly cutting power consumption and heat buildup, something consumers have been demanding more than speed. Of course performance isn't going to stay stagnant, there will be a slight boost for the clock speeds for an ~20% speed improvement over the 821 and possibly 10% more transistors but the graphics are a lot more powerful more powerful and power efficient. Games running on the same settings on both the 820 and 835 will see significant differences in power consumption, heat buildup, and ultimately performance. The flaw with the Snapdragon 820/821 was that while it doesn't overheat like the 810, it gets fairly warm and after 15-30 mins of using a phone with an 820/821, you can see some small thermal throttling and slight performance dips, though its not a major issue. After 1 hour you might experience more thermal throttling on an 820/821 but this issue has been brought to the light and Qualcomm has finally brought us something we've been asking a while for. Heat buildup will be almost 50-70% less than that of the 820 which would result in much more consistent performance from long use and standby. So Qualcomm has really made the Snapdragon 835 perform a lot better than the 820/821 not by increasing IPC (clock speed, # of transistors) but by reducing heat buildup which eliminates the need for such frequently thermal throttling and performance inconsistencies. This is also thanks to 10nm LPE (which is not true 10nm, its just Samsung's mixed version of 10nm with a 14nm/20nm BOEL, basically its like partial 10nm). Though the Kryo 280 is a semi custom core based on the A73 and may not be based the Kryo, to me the 835 is just a Snapdragon 821 with slightly improved speed but the beauty lies in huge battery life improvements and much more consistent performance. This year I'm actually a lot more excited for Snapragon chips and I think they'll be able to give Exynos a much better fight. The gap between Snapdragon and Exynos is shrinking and maybe this year or within the next 2 years, their differences in speed may become insignificant. The gap between the 820 and 8890 was smaller than that between the 810 and 7420. Phones like the Sony Xperia XZ, Google Pixel and OnePlus 3T have shown excellent performance on the 820/821 all simply from software tweaks. So software is evolving too, this year we could see phones with Snapdragon 835 giving us a solid 12 hours off a single charge on medium/heavy usage and 30-40% less time to open apps. These benchmark numbers look very promising but there's nothing to conclude from that until we see real world performance in effect but I have no doubt that things are getting a lot better this year. james fuston That sunspider score is very encouraging.

On Tuesday, Trump signed an order telling the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to rethink a series of rules and restrictions – better known as the Clean Power Plan – instated by the Obama administration to encourage government organs to consider environmental impact when mandating decisions. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE But it seems the titans of the tech industry disagree. “We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth,” the four companies said in a joint statement to Bloomberg. Apple and Google have both remained dedicated to powering their global operations solely on clean and renewable energy. Back in 2016, Apple issued $1.5 billion in bonds to further facilitate its conversion to clean energy. Google similarly said its offices and data centers will run exclusively on renewable energy from next year. Trump, on his part, has taken the opposite approach. Shortly after assuming office, the President reportedly told the EPA to scrap all climate change resources from its website, causing employees to haphazardly begin archiving materials before they’re all gone. Apple and co. are not the only big names to voice their frustration with the anti-climate order. Wal-Mart and IKEA have similarly expressed disapproval. Unlike them, however, the Independent Petroleum Association of America and the Chamber of Commerce welcomed the move with open hands. on Bloomberg Read next: Master the web's most commonly used programming language for a price you like AppleGoogleInsightsMicrosoft Share on Facebook (835) Share on Twitter (319) Mix is a reporter from Amsterdam.

While the breakneck expansion is welcome news for a long-beleaguered music industry, overall revenue is still half the level from the late 1990s before the revolution in online music. The Recording Industry Association of America said that overall revenue soared by 11.4% in 2016 from the prior year to $7.7 billion, the heftiest annual gain since 1998. The money from paid subscriptions to streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal more than doubled in the last year alone, the industry body said. With the growth, streaming accounted for 51% of the music industry’s revenue in 2016, up from just nine percent in 2011, it said. Streaming options have been rising for consumers, with Apple entering the market in 2015 and online retail giant Amazon recently launching a service. The trends in the United States, the world’s largest music market, show a sharp escalation of global trends in recent years. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, the London-based global body, similarly reported historic growth in 2015. It is set to release 2016 global figures in the coming weeks. But streaming—which allows users to select any song on-demand online—has led to casualties among other formats, which have historically been bigger money-makers for artists. U.S. revenue from digital downloads on platforms such as iTunes plummeted 22% last year and CD sales fell by a similar 21%. One exception was vinyl, which has experienced a rebirth thanks to interest among serious collectors. But vinyl was up only by 4%, still growing but at a more modest pace. Major record labels have hailed streaming as a new way to boost the industry after years of struggles starting with the craze of illegal downloading in the 1990s. But some artists complain that they earn little from the boom in streaming, with a sliver of the revenue heading back to musicians even if they now enjoy a welcome new outlet for exposure. Cary Sherman, chairman and chief executive of the US recording association, hailed the 2016 growth but cautioned about the future, noting that the expansion came after years of decline. “As excited as we are about our growth in 2016, our recovery is fragile and fraught with risk,” he wrote in a blog post. “The marketplace is still evolving, and we’ve experienced unexpected turns too many times before.” With CDs and downloads in free fall, “much rides on a streaming market that must fairly recognize the enormous value of music,” he wrote. The music business has ramped up its campaign to reform the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the 1998 U.S. law that generally exempts internet providers for content on their sites. The recording industry argues that the law, whose principles are largely applied in Europe as well, needs to be stronger to force online behemoth YouTube and its parent Google to take more aggressive action to bring down unauthorized music. © 2017 AFP Tweet Back to top Order by Time Order by Popularity 2 Comments Login to comment 1 SpeedApr. 02, 2017 - 08:58AM JST I think the digital download and streaming revolutions was a comeuppance for the recording industry. In the mid-80s when CDs were first going to be released I watched a in-depth news program which showed that CDs were much clearer in sound and much cheaper to make than vinyl. Something like 30 cents a CD and they predicted that album prices would come down in the near future. When they began selling CDs prices for albums went up from about $12.99 an album to about $20 for the same CDs. I understood that the of economy of scale called for higher prices at the beginning since supply was low but the prices NEVER came down. They stayed at about $18. I also remember that record companies were making record profits from the mid-80s to the late 90s selling overpriced CDs but the artists weren't getting any more of the proceeds due to it. I switched from vinyl to crummy sounding tape cassettes because I couldn't really afford to buy CDs and vinyl was phased out. I used to curse the money grubbing corporations under my breath for making music so expensive. I longed for the days that if I wanted a single I only had to pay about $1 and $7.99 for an album in the late 70s. The digital music revolution completely undermined the record corporations because they were static, greedy and hid behind lawyers that sued anyone and everyone. They ripped off customers and musicians for years. This is karma coming back to bite them. I just wish there was a way to get artists more of the money they deserve. 0 Aaron BrummettApr. 02, 2017 - 03:09PM JST Streaming is superior on every level... except for reliability.

Subscribe to feed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print Law enforcement agencies in New York City declined 12 detainers from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the week of Feb. 4 to Feb. 10, according to ICE’s latest Weekly Declined Detainer Outcome Report. The Big Apple was by far the jurisdiction with the most declined detainers during the period. There were four declined detainers in Orange County, California, and three in Washington, D.C., the second and third most, respectively. Overall, 47 ICE detainers were recorded as declined throughout the country from Feb. 4 to Feb. 10. ICE routinely issues detainers to state and local law enforcement agencies to notify them of its intent to assume custody of an illegal alien currently being detained in state or local custody on criminal charges. The detainer requests that the law enforcement agency notify ICE as early as possible, ideally at least 48 hours in advance, before a deportable alien is released from custody. It also asks the state or local jurisdiction to hold onto the alien for up to 48 hours so Department of Homeland Security agents have time to get there and take the alien into custody. However, many law enforcement agencies refuse to comply with ICE detainers, instead releasing deportable criminal aliens back into their communities. Some simply snub ICE, while others are bound by state or local ordinances or policies that restrict or prohibit cooperation with ICE. Such policies are only one type of “sanctuary policy” that help define a jurisdiction as a sanctuary city or sanctuary county. ICE lists 152 jurisdictions that have explicitly enacted policies limiting their cooperation with ICE detainers. ICE emphasizes the list is based on public announcements, news report statements and publicly disclosed policies, so there may be more jurisdictions that do not cooperate with ICE. New York City is among the uncooperative jurisdictions, having passed a local law in November 2014 that states the police department will not honor ICE detainers. Orange County and Washington, D.C. also have policies that limit cooperation with ICE. In addition to the many cities and counties on the list, ICE also lists the entire states of California and Connecticut as being uncooperative. ICE began issuing Weekly Declined Detainer Outcome Reports last week in pursuance of President Trump’s January executive order “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States.” The agency has issued only two reports so far; the first one covered the week from Jan. 28 to Feb. 3. It listed 206 declined detainers throughout the country, with 142 from Travis County, Texas alone. The Travis County sheriff’s office has a policy of only accepting detainers when accompanied by a court order or when the subject of the request is charged with or has been convicted of capital murder, first degree murder, aggravated sexual assault or continuous smuggling of persons. America is headed down a suicidal path – but it’s a subtle invasion, and not many Americans understand the full extent of the problem. Get all the details in Leo Hohmann’s brand new book “Stealth Invasion: Muslim Conquest Through Immigration and Resettlement Jihad,” available now in hard copy or e-book at the WND Superstore. Although all detainer requests in the ICE reports were recorded as declined during the specified weeks in January and February 2017, many were issued earlier, usually in 2015 or 2016. ICE listed one notable criminal activity, either a charge or conviction, associated with each individual whose detainer was declined. The activities included such crimes as assault, robbery, domestic violence, burglary, sexual assault, weapons possession and driving under the influence. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, welcomes the addition of these declined detainer reports to the public realm. “I think it’s really important information for the public to have so that we can have an informed debate over the public safety problems created by sanctuaries,” Vaughan told WND. “It’s clear that the main beneficiaries of sanctuary policies are criminal aliens, many of them with very serious criminal histories.” Vaughan, who has previously testified before the House Judiciary Committee on the threats sanctuary cities pose to public safety, noted politicians in sanctuary jurisdictions often say ICE wants to deport harmless people who are good for the community, but the list of crimes committed by released aliens puts that argument to bed. “I think this shows exactly who is being shielded by these policies, and they are people who should clearly be a priority for deportation,” she asserted. Vaughan believes the reports will, in some cases, pressure sanctuary cities and counties to start complying with ICE detainers. She knows this because of the reaction CIS has received from publishing ICE’s list of sanctuary jurisdictions over the last few years. “We’ve gotten tremendous feedback from agencies, some of whom didn’t realize the impact of their policy or that there was another way they could do it,” Vaughan revealed. “Sometimes it was because citizens in these areas saw it and raised a stink with their local lawmakers. There are a couple of cases I know of where new sheriffs have been elected because they promised to overturn the sanctuary policies of their predecessors.” Overall, Vaughan applauds the Trump administration for its willingness to publicly expose sanctuary jurisdictions. “In general, this kind of transparency is a big improvement over past administrations and tells me that the Trump administration is confident that its policies and its approach are going to be popular with the public and that they will withstand public scrutiny,” she said. America is headed down a suicidal path – but it’s a subtle invasion, and not many Americans understand the full extent of the problem.

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

While everyone and their grandmother follows heavyweights like Apple and Amazon , there’s a wide world of overlooked stocks that garner little attention. We asked three of our contributors to discuss stocks that don’t get the attention they deserve. Here’s why Cintas (NASDAQ: CTAS) , Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) , and Celldex Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CLDX) are three top stocks that you may be ignoring. Boring is beautiful Tyler Crowe  (Cintas):  Too many investors look to industries like technology or biotech for market-crushing growth stocks when you can find them in boring businesses. Consider Cintas. At its core, it is a uniform rental company that has also branched out into some ancillary segments such as cleaning services, first aid and safety equipment sales, and compliance services. It’s a business that hasn’t changed drastically over the past 100 years, yet Cintas’ stock has more than doubled over the past three years and has more than tripled the S&P 500 over that period on a total return basis. None of those businesses are anything to write home about, but what makes the company a fantastic investment is its focus on generating returns for investors over the long term. Cintas maintains modest revenue growth, high margins, and exceptional returns on equity. It also generates a lot of free cash flow that can be used to pay a fast-growing dividend and buy back stock. CTAS Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts . Two other elements make Cintas worth a look as a long-term investment. One is that the founding family owns a considerable stake — a little over 20% — and the company has increased its dividend payments every year for 32 years straight. Traits like that are positive signs when you want to make an investment with a multidecade time horizon. Cintas is a resilient business, and its prospects very much wax and wane with the overall health of the economy. Perhaps once robots have replaced all humans in the workplace, then the need for uniform rental and cleaning services will no longer be necessary. We’re still a long ways away from that happening, and that makes Cintas a compelling investment that you may not have considered before now. An overlooked retailer Tim Green (Best Buy): It can be easy to ignore the entire retail industry given the growth of e-commerce, but throwing out the baby with the bathwater would be a mistake. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy has managed to consistently improve its bottom line over the past few years by slashing unnecessary costs, even as it began price-matching Amazon to kill the practice of showrooming. Sales growth has been inconsistent, in part due to a lack of exciting new products, but Best Buy is in a far stronger position today than it was in a few years ago. Image source: Best Buy. This profit growth comes despite major investments in e-commerce, which have helped Best Buy drive consistent double-digit online sales growth. The company ships online orders out of its more than 1,000 stores, helping to cut down on average shipping times and better compete with Amazon. Online sales surged 20.8% in fiscal 2017. With annual adjusted earnings per share of $3.56 and $2.56 billion of excess cash on the balance sheet, Best Buy stock trades at a cash-adjusted P/E ratio of just over 11. This cash will help it fund $3 billion of share buybacks over the next two years, enough to buy back one-fifth of all outstanding shares. Further earnings growth will be more difficult going forward, with much of the low-hanging fruit already picked when it comes to cost-cutting. But Best Buy is well positioned to be competitive in a world where consumers are increasingly shifting online. A lot for a little Cory Renauer (Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.):  Long-term investors looking for a stock that could more than double over the next couple years might want to revisit or become acquainted with this clinical-stage biotech stock. Celldex Therapeutics fell out of favor a little over a year ago when its brain cancer candidate, Rintega, performed as expected but technically failed its trial because patients in the standard treatment control group did surprisingly well. Although the company has completely switched gears to focus on new drug candidates entirely unrelated to Rintega, an enterprise value of just $224 million makes this one of the most overlooked stocks in biotech right now. The company’s largest near-term catalyst is a clinical trial with glembatumumab vedotin, or glemba, for the treatment of patients with an extremely difficult to treat form of breast cancer. The patients also have tumors with glemba’s target protein on their surface. Once glemba finds its target, it’s invited inside the cell where it unleashes a super-lethal dose of chemo. In a previous study, similar patients survived more than twice as long without signs of disease progression than those receiving standard treatments. An ongoing trial should finish enrolling 300 of these patients in September, and if the results fall in line with previous observations it would probably lead to an eventual approval and a soaring stock price. While I’d say glemba’s potential as a breast cancer treatment alone makes Celldex stock a buy, there’s plenty more in the pipeline. Glemba itself is in three other mid-stage clinical trials, one sponsored by the company for skin cancer, plus two investigator-sponsored trials for rare malignancies. Beyond glemba, immune stimulator varlilumab, is in a combination study with the blockbuster drug Opdivo as a possible combination therapy for treatment of a variety of tumors types. Further down the road, it’s has a handful of drugs aimed at various targets in early-stage clinical trials. The company finished 2016 with $189.8 million in cash and liquid assets after burning through about $128.5 million last year. This should be enough to keep the lights on while waiting for glemba’s breast cancer trial results. Add it all up and this is one biotech stock worthy of far more attention than it’s been getting lately. 10 stocks we like better than Cintas When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Name: Subject: Message: We need to talk about Samsung’s Bixby Features Newsby Brian Reigh12 hours ago 35 952 23 Inside Samsung’s latest Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus lives Bixby, the company’s second attempt at AI assistant. While it may be too early to tell whether Bixby truly adds any practicality, unfortunately, my first impression tells me this could potentially be another S-Voice fiasco. See also: Samsung Galaxy S8 feature focus: Bixby 17 hours ago To the competition, welcome, young Padawan Samsung isn’t exactly new to the realm of AI assistants: after all, the company did launch the infamous S-Voice with the Galaxy S3 way back when. A poor imitation of Apple’s Siri at best, S-Voice was heavily criticized, quickly forgotten, and slowly became one of those apps that you disable right from the moment you get your phone. Well, after endless rumors and its acquisition of Viv, an AI platform developed by none other than the makers of Siri, the South Korean company finally unveiled Bixby. That’s right – the subpar S-Voice has officially been fired, and Bixby is the new assistant with a fresh voice who will be living inside your latest Galaxy smartphones. It’s true that virtual assistants are the next big thing, but in a world dominated by the likes of Alexa, Cortana, Siri, and most of all, Google Assistant, is there really a place for Bixby? It’s true that virtual assistants are the next big thing, but in a world dominated by the likes of Alexa, Cortana, Siri, and most of all, Google Assistant, is there really a place for Bixby? Alexa boasts support for an incredible range of smart devices; Siri is now more mature and lives inside popular gadgets like the Apple Watch and the MacBook; Google Assistant uses the search giant’s data to deliver seamless information to most Android phones. And Bixby? There are several differentiating factors according to Samsung. To begin with, there is a physical button that summons Bixby. Instead of answering to your voice command, you can press the button anywhere inside an app to bring up your assistant. As Samsung puts it, it’s a multi-nodal intelligence service, meaning it uses context – whether you are currently in the Gallery or Camera – to complete its actions. On top of that, features like Bixby Vision and Bixby Search integrate smart object-recognition technology right into the device’s native apps. Samsung is also expected to bring Bixby to its vast roster of home appliances, so Bixby might prove itself to be more or less useful depending on your home. Nonetheless, I can’t help but think Samsung’s offering is just far too incomplete to be competitive against what’s out there. From the demos we saw, from the way it works, and from a practical standpoint, I am not convinced that Samsung has created an AI assistant that is intelligent and useful enough. A little less conversation and a little more “touch my body” Though Ariana Grande might tell you otherwise, a little more “touch my body” is what concerns me. Samsung thinks that repeated voice activation requests are an unnecessary step for the user, and while I agree to an extent, I think having the option to summon Bixby with a voice command is essential. My personal experience tells me that virtual assistants are far more useful when they work without requiring any physical touch. Though Samsung’s focus seems to be on in-app actions – so while you are holding the phone in your hand – my personal experience tells me that virtual assistants are far more useful when they work without requiring any physical touch. For example, I use Google Assistant on my phone only when I am unable (or unwilling) to physically get my phone and unlock it: when you wake up at 7AM and want to check the weather or when your hands are covered in butter and flour and you need to a quick unit conversion. While the all-new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus have Google Assistant also on board for these situations, the sheer necessity to use Google Assistant in these situations highlights Bixby’s limitations. Perhaps voice commands will come to Bixby in the future, but for now, its dedicated button doesn’t make you all that dedicated to Bixby. Samsung widens the Android fragmentation Speaking of Google Assistant, Bixby’s existence means that Samsung is again worsening the Android fragmentation problem, making Google unhappy and leaving users confused. When I read reports claiming that Google may have tried to keep Samsung from pre-installing Bixby onto its flagship devices, I wasn’t all that surprised. Whether it’s true or not, this move makes sense not only because Bixby would become a rival to Google’s own Assistant but also because this would worsen the one problem that Android has persistently faced since its inception: fragmentation. I don’t use the f-word lightly, but unlike S-Voice, Bixby is deeply-integrated and threatens the fundamental Android experience. Of course, Samsung has always been good at making Android not Android (for better or worse), but when its software becomes obtrusive and harmful to Google Assistant inside an OS designed by Google, it becomes a problem. Your average consumer doesn’t know what the difference between the two is, but still, Bixby greets you when you press the button below the volume rocker, yet Google Assistant answers when you press and hold the home button: it’s simply a lot going on when there doesn’t need to be this much chaos. It’s simply a lot going on when there doesn’t need to be this much chaos. Third-party support or the lack thereof What Samsung demonstrated is, objectively speaking, very neat: you can go into your gallery, select a few photos, summon Bixby and ask it to create an album called “Family Photos.” Or you can take a photo with Bixby Vision right inside your camera app, and it’ll tell you what it is, provide nearby sights if it’s a place or give you shopping recommendations if it’s a product. These are some of the things that no other AI assistants can do because they don’t live inside other apps. However, the issue is that Bixby supports only 10 apps at launch, and these are all Samsung’s own native apps. So what happens if you don’t use Samsung’s gallery but Google Photos instead? What if you use Chrome instead of Samsung’s browser? Bixby will be an afterthought for many developers whose priority lies within assistants like Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri. Samsung says that third-party support is coming, but that’s going to be a big challenge even for a company of this size and power. Bixby only lives within two devices as of now and will probably be confined to few Samsung devices even in the future, so Bixby will be an afterthought for many developers whose priority lies within assistants like Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri. How many apps support Samsung’s “edge panels” after two years? Virtually none. Bixby doesn’t offer anything extraordinary to change this pattern, and without extensive third-party support, Bixby will meet the same fate as S-Voice, tucked away and never used. Launch day was barely over before some were calling for a replacement assistant for the Bixby button. Bixby will grow, but this baby needs to grow fast With all these setbacks, Bixby needs to perform well at least. Unfortunately, from what we saw from early demos, things aren’t looking too bright for this nascent assistant. In a controlled demo, when asked to set the brightness to 50 percent or display the latest photos taken with the phone, it took its sweet time, telling us to “Hold on.” To be fair, it did all of its tasks well eventually (though its performance in real life remains to be seen); however, compared to the speed and natural diction of Google Assistant, it’s still far behind. Of course, Bixby is bound to improve. Samsung said so when it first unveiled it: the company specifically said that this is only the first step, and that the company’s vision of revolutionizing AI will take time. Although I am underwhelmed by Bixby after so much hype, I am excited to see how it will grow. Just one thing though – Bixby needs to grow fast because the moment users and developers think it’s just another gimmicky bloatware by Samsung, it will be fired, just like its predecessor.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 April 2017 by Military News This Top Stock Mutual Fund Cheers Retirement Investors With Gains Shutterstock photo A tail wind has kicked up this calendar year behind $7.5 billion American Century Growth Fund ( TWCGX ). That’s nice news for investors holding the fund in retirement accounts and other portfolios. The fund’s 9.93% gain this year going into Thursday topped 73% of the fund’s large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. That’s a step up from the 67% of peers the fund outperformed over the trailing 12 months with a 16.40% return. Managers Gregory Woodhams and Justin Brown pick stocks individually and not based on sectors, but their sector weights show where they expect to find leaders. Technology was their top sector as of Jan. 31, with a 34% weighting. Consumer discretionary was next with 20%. Tech titans Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Apple ( AAPL ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) – the fund’s first, third and fifth largest holdings – illustrate that appetite. Alphabet is up 7% so far this year. Apple is up 24%. Microsoft is up 5%. Together they account for about 14% of the fund’s assets. Several top new buys as of Dec. 31 also belonged to the tech sector. Among those was chipmaker Broadcom ( AVGO ), which is up 25% so far this year. The stock has a highest-possible Comp Rating of 99. IBD’S TAKE: Broadcom is ranked No. 1 in the No. 37-rated Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It has four quarters in a row of accelerating earnings per share growth. See how its additional easy-to-understanding fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals’ at IBD’s Stock Checkup . Another top new buy was Activision Blizzard (ATVI), which is up 39% this year. The video game stock is ranked No. 2 in IBD’s Computer Software-Gaming group, thanks in part to traits like its very strong 97 Comp Rating. In addition, the stock is on the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals. Tuesday was the stock’s ex-dividend date, meaning that you had to own shares before that to be eligible for its dividend. Its dividend yield Monday was 0.6%. A negative: EPS growth has decelerated for two quarters, from 315% to 152% and 11%. Analysts see EPS falling 9% in the current quarter and 11% this year, and then rising 21% in 2018, in line with its three-year growth rate. Financials were just the fund’s sixth-largest sector, with a modest 4% weighting. One of those was Citizens Financial (CFG), a top new buy whose EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters in a row. Still, the stock is down 3% this year after tumbling 13% off its March 1 high. That pullback along with the broad market reflects investors’ concerns that Congress’ failure to revise or kill ObamaCare is a sign that additional Trump initiatives, such as corporate and individual tax cuts and lighter regulatory burdens for banks, may not be as likely as investors had hoped. Shares of Citrix Systems (CTXS), yet another newcomer to the portfolio, surged March 13 on rumors of a company sale. The company’s business software creates work spaces that provide access to desktops, apps, data and communications on any device, over networks and in the cloud. As IBD recently reported, Citrix has been pressured by activist investor Elliott Management to make changes . On Feb. 1, Citrix completed its spinoff of its GoToMeeting business, which then merged with LogMeIn ( LOGM ) . GoToMeeting is a conferencing application that allows remote access to personal computers. Citrix shares are up 20% this year. The cloud computing company’s most recent EPS report was for Q4, in January. It earned $1.61 a share on sales of $908 million. That topped consensus for EPS of $1.50 and revenue of $900.8 million. But the $1.61 was a decline of 3%. The company forecast 2017 EPS of $4.60-$4.65 and revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.84 billion. Both are well below consensus for $5.60 EPS and sales of $3.55 billion, but Citrix’s guidance excludes GoToMeeting. VMware (VMW) is another new buy for the fund. The server virtualization leader is up 17% this year. EPS grew 0%, 4%, 12% and 13% the past four quarters. VMware paid $1.3 billion to buy Niciria, a software-defined networking company, three years ago. VMware said recently it expects $1 billion in sales of NSX, made possible by that acquisition. NSX lets companies update networks through software changes rather than the more costly path of replacing routers and switching hardware. NSX is a challenge to Cisco Systems’ (CSCO) flagship networking software product, called Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI). In the consumer discretionary sector, bellwether Amazon (AMZN) and auto-parts chain O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) were the fund’s second- and seventh-largest holdings as of Jan. 31. Amazon has been trending mostly sideways since mid-February, hanging on to a 17% gain so far this year. O’Reilly is down 1% this year.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 April 2017 by Military News Friday Apple Rumors: 2017 iPhones May Feature True Tone Display Tech Shutterstock photo InvestorPlace – Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Leading the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) rumor mill today is news of the next iPhone generation using True Tone display tech. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Friday. True Tone iPhone : A new rumor claims that Apple will be using True Tone display technology in its 2017 iPhone devices , reports 9to5Mac . According to the rumor, the tech company will use the True Tone display technology in all of its 2017 smartphones coming out later this year. That includes the rumored iPhone 7s, 7s Plus and iPhone 8. AAPL was previously expected to introduce True Tone display tech in the iPhone 7 line, but didn’t. It first started using the technology with the introduction of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro last year. Retail Positions : Apple is planning to cut several retail positions from its physical stores , MacRumors notes. The company is reportedly planning to remove the „Business Manager, Business Events Lead, Events Coordinator, and Events Lead” positions. Employees in these positions started being told about the change earlier this week. They have been given the option to take a lower level job with less pay, or two months worth of severance pay. 911 Fix : Apple’s most recent update for iOS fixes an issue that could cause problems for 911 workers , reports  BGR . The problem in the older version of iOS allowed a string of code to be executed that would tell an iPhone to repeatedly call 911. The problem was discovered by a teenage developer that posted the code online. He was later arrested after a flood of 911 calls hit emergency workers. The new update makes it so that users are now prompted twice before calling a number sent in a text message, which is how the exploit was executed.

INNOVATE Don't Look for a Great Idea, Look for a Good Problem We shouldn't confuse a great idea with where it came from By Greg Satell Greg Satell is a popular writer, speaker and innovation advisor. Previously, he served as Senior Vice President – Strategy & Innovation at Moxie Interactive, a division of Publicis Groupe, one of the world’s leading marketing services organizations as well as Co-CEO of KP Media, a leading publisher of magazines and websites in Ukraine, including the news magazine Korrespondent and the web portal, Bigmir. You can find Greg's blog at DigitalTonto.com. His first book, Mapping Innovation, will be published by McGraw-Hill in May. @Digitaltonto Author, Mapping Innovation@Digitaltonto WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement At the center of every significant innovation is always an idea. Clarence Birdseye's idea about freezing fish revolutionized the food industry and American diets. Charles Schwab's idea about flat commissions changed investing forever. Steve Jobs idea about creating a device that could hold 1000 songs in his pocket turned around Apple's fortunes. Yet we shouldn't confuse a great idea with where it came from. Truly useful ideas don't arise from out of the ether or through fancy techniques like brainstorming or divergent thinking. The best ideas come in response response to an important problem and thrive under constraints. In researching my book, Mapping Innovation, I found that the most innovative firms aren't necessarily any more creative or even that they are better at solving problems. Rather, it was how they aggressively sought out new problems to solve that made all the difference. The truth is that if you want to create a truly innovative culture you shouldn't glorify ideas, but problems. A Young Boy's Dream As a boy, Albert Einstein liked to imagine what it would be like to ride on a bolt of lightning. In many ways, it was a typical childhood fantasy. If he were born in another time, you could imagine him learning to speak Klingon or becoming immersed in the lore of the Jedi. Yet Einstein took the idea so seriously that it became the first of his famous thought experiments. As he grew older and began to study physics, he learned that according to Maxwell's equations the speed of light was was supposed to be constant, but according to Newton's laws if a boy riding at the speed of light shined a light forward, then the beam would travel at twice the speed of light. Clearly, both couldn't be true. Either the speed of light was relative to absolute time and space or the other way around. As we now know, Einstein proved that the speed of light was absolute and that time and space were relative quantities. In other words, an inch is an inch and a minute is a minute only in relation to a specific context. This seems incredible because it's so alien to our everyday experience, but today it's easily proven. Simply get in your car, turn on the navigation system and follow its directions. GPS satellites are calibrated according to Einstein's equations, so if you get to where you want to go you have, in a certain sense, proved the theory of relativity. What's interesting about Einstein's theory is that he didn't discover it in the same sense that Columbus discovered America. In fact, he didn't uncover a single fact that wasn't known to every working physicist at the time. His genius was to see a problem where nobody else realized that one existed. A New Era, New Challenges Every age comes with its own unique problems. For the past 20 or 30 years, we've mostly been occupied with finding new applications for technologies built in the 50s and 60s, like microchips, relational databases and the Internet. That effort spawned entirely new industries, such as personal computers, enterprise software and e-commerce. Yet today, many of those old paradigms are running out of steam. Moore's Law is slowing down and will soon grind to a halt. Open software has created the need for updated database structures and the Internet has proven to be dangerously insecure. Solving each of these problems will create fantastic new opportunities. Consider the case of quantum computing, which has the potential to be millions of times more powerful than current technology. A full-scale commercial version is probably still five to ten years away, but is already being tested in areas as diverse as medicine, financial services and artificial intelligence. It will also create enormous problems to be solved. For example, it will render current encryption technologies obsolete, so business will have to invest in quantum safe encryption. Because quantum computers work in a fundamentally different way than classical one, new computer languages and software protocols will need to be devised. And that's just one example. Take a look at the Gartner Hype Cycle and you will find dozens of emerging technologies that will have an impact over the next decade. Each one comes with its own problems to solve and each of those problems represent new business opportunities. In some cases, entirely new industries will be created. Identifying New Problems Anyone who takes even a casual look at the future can't help but be bewildered. These days, even teenagers can build websites and smartphone apps, but highly trained specialists struggle to understand the implications emerging technologies like genomics, nanotechnology and robotics. That presents a dilemma for business leaders: How can you plan for a future you can't predict? The simple answer is you can't and you shouldn't even try. Technology today moves so fast -- and in so many directions -- that anyone who thinks that they can truly see the future is just fooling themselves. But what you can do is uncover problems related to your business, your customers and in new emerging markets. That's one thing that truly great innovators do differently. They constantly seek out new problems. IBM routinely sets up grand challenges, like beating humans at Jeopardy. Experian set up its Datalabs unit to identify problems its customers are having that they can turn into new businesses. Google's 20% time acts as a human powered search engine for valuable problems. The truth is that it's more important to explore than predict. To create anything that is truly pathbreaking, you need to look for it in new places. Moving From Strategic Planning To Innovation Planning Management in the 20th century was, in large part, the art of strategic planning. You gathered information about markets, competitors and other trends and then planned accordingly. Strategy was like a game of chess. You planned each move in response to a changing board and in anticipation of competitors moves. Yet today, technology cycles move faster than planning cycles ever could, so we need to take a more Bayesian approach to strategy. Instead of trying to get every move right -- which is impossible in today's environment -- we need to try to become less wrong over time. Essentially, we need to treat strategy like a role playing game, taking quests that earn us experience and artifacts along the way. That means that we will need to plan differently. In addition to strategic planning, or planning based on things we know or think we know, we need to start innovation planning, or planning based on things we need to learn to solve new and important problems. That's how you quest. You don't plan the journey as much as you prepare for it. And that's what makes ideas like those of Birdseye, Schwab and Jobs so great. They solved important problems that people cared about. So if you want to innovate, don't look for a great idea, look for a good problem.

Waxman Apr 01, 2017 Apple anticipated that iPhone users may try to mess with Siri, its voice-command feature for the mobile device, on April Fools' Day. So when users ask Siri "What are you doing today?", they will likely get a variety of responses including "Just bein' a fool. A fool for your requests." In the past, pranksters have re-programmed Siri to prank friends and family. As the technology site Apple World Today reported in 2015: "Change Siri's language options so she (or he) will speak in a different language by going to Settings > General > Siri > Language. Change the language to something unique and wait for the look of confusion the next time they ask Siri to 'Read me my texts.'" Apple has been known to program Siri to be attuned to the zeitgeist. For instance, it has a cheeky answer to the question "Is Jon Snow Dead?" posed by fans of HBO's Emmy award-winning show Game of Thrones.

Timothy Green, Tyler Crowe, and Cory Renauer (TMFBargainBin) Apr 1, 2017 at 12:02PM The best place to find great investments is often where no one else is looking. While everyone and their grandmother follows heavyweights like Apple and Amazon, there's a wide world of overlooked stocks that garner little attention. We asked three of our contributors to discuss stocks that don't get the attention they deserve. Here's why Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), and Celldex Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CLDX) are three top stocks that you may be ignoring.  Boring is beautiful Tyler Crowe (Cintas): Too many investors look to industries like technology or biotech for market-crushing growth stocks when you can find them in boring businesses. Consider Cintas. At its core, it is a uniform rental company that has also branched out into some ancillary segments such as cleaning services, first aid and safety equipment sales, and compliance services. It's a business that hasn't changed drastically over the past 100 years, yet Cintas' stock has more than doubled over the past three years and has more than tripled the S&P 500 over that period on a total return basis.  None of those businesses are anything to write home about, but what makes the company a fantastic investment is its focus on generating returns for investors over the long term. Cintas maintains modest revenue growth, high margins, and exceptional returns on equity. It also generates a lot of free cash flow that can be used to pay a fast-growing dividend and buy back stock.  CTAS Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts. Two other elements make Cintas worth a look as a long-term investment. One is that the founding family owns a considerable stake -- a little over 20% -- and the company has increased its dividend payments every year for 32 years straight. Traits like that are positive signs when you want to make an investment with a multidecade time horizon.  Cintas is a resilient business, and its prospects very much wax and wane with the overall health of the economy. Perhaps once robots have replaced all humans in the workplace, then the need for uniform rental and cleaning services will no longer be necessary. We're still a long ways away from that happening, and that makes Cintas a compelling investment that you may not have considered before now.  An overlooked retailer Tim Green (Best Buy): It can be easy to ignore the entire retail industry given the growth of e-commerce, but throwing out the baby with the bathwater would be a mistake. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy has managed to consistently improve its bottom line over the past few years by slashing unnecessary costs, even as it began price-matching Amazon to kill the practice of showrooming. Sales growth has been inconsistent, in part due to a lack of exciting new products, but Best Buy is in a far stronger position today than it was in a few years ago. Image source: Best Buy. This profit growth comes despite major investments in e-commerce, which have helped Best Buy drive consistent double-digit online sales growth. The company ships online orders out of its more than 1,000 stores, helping to cut down on average shipping times and better compete with Amazon. Online sales surged 20.8% in fiscal 2017. With annual adjusted earnings per share of $3.56 and $2.56 billion of excess cash on the balance sheet, Best Buy stock trades at a cash-adjusted P/E ratio of just over 11. This cash will help it fund $3 billion of share buybacks over the next two years, enough to buy back one-fifth of all outstanding shares. Further earnings growth will be more difficult going forward, with much of the low-hanging fruit already picked when it comes to cost-cutting. But Best Buy is well positioned to be competitive in a world where consumers are increasingly shifting online. A lot for a little Cory Renauer (Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.): Long-term investors looking for a stock that could more than double over the next couple years might want to revisit or become acquainted with this clinical-stage biotech stock. Celldex Therapeutics fell out of favor a little over a year ago when its brain cancer candidate, Rintega, performed as expected but technically failed its trial because patients in the standard treatment control group did surprisingly well. Although the company has completely switched gears to focus on new drug candidates entirely unrelated to Rintega, an enterprise value of just $224 million makes this one of the most overlooked stocks in biotech right now. The company's largest near-term catalyst is a clinical trial with glembatumumab vedotin, or glemba, for the treatment of patients with an extremely difficult to treat form of breast cancer. The patients also have tumors with glemba's target protein on their surface. Once glemba finds its target, it's invited inside the cell where it unleashes a super-lethal dose of chemo. In a previous study, similar patients survived more than twice as long without signs of disease progression than those receiving standard treatments. An ongoing trial should finish enrolling 300 of these patients in September, and if the results fall in line with previous observations it would probably lead to an eventual approval and a soaring stock price. While I'd say glemba's potential as a breast cancer treatment alone makes Celldex stock a buy, there's plenty more in the pipeline. Glemba itself is in three other mid-stage clinical trials, one sponsored by the company for skin cancer, plus two investigator-sponsored trials for rare malignancies. Beyond glemba, immune stimulator varlilumab, is in a combination study with the blockbuster drug Opdivo as a possible combination therapy for treatment of a variety of tumors types. Further down the road, it's has a handful of drugs aimed at various targets in early-stage clinical trials. The company finished 2016 with $189.8 million in cash and liquid assets after burning through about $128.5 million last year. This should be enough to keep the lights on while waiting for glemba's breast cancer trial results. Add it all up and this is one biotech stock worthy of far more attention than it's been getting lately. Cory Renauer has no position in any stocks mentioned. Timothy Green owns shares of Best Buy.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | April 1, 2017 -- 16:55 GMT (09:55 PDT) | Topic: Mobility A teardown shows the new iPad looks a lot like the original iPad Air. iFixit With its tablet sales on a sustained decline, Apple made a surprise move last month by introducing a new 9.7-inch iPad with a lower price point of $329. This new model replaces the iPad Air 2 in the company's tablet lineup, but its specs suggested that newer doesn't necessarily equal better. It uses the same A9 processor as the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, but it otherwise closely resembles the iPad line it supplants: the familiar 9.7-inch Retina display, 32GB and 128GB storage options, and so forth. see also ​Apple defends iPad, tablet turf with price cut The core 9.7-inch iPad will now start at $329. Apple isn't shy about trying to convince tech buyers to upgrade. Read More Thanks to the teardown specialists at iFixit, we now know just how closely what Apple is now just calling the iPad is to its predecessors. In its tear-apart of what it calls the iPad 5, iFixit finds that it is indeed similar to the original iPad Air inside as well as outside -- extremely similar. For instance, the LCD and digitizer are not fused together, just like with the first-generation Air -- and unlike the second-generation one -- which can make it easier to repair if the screen cracks. They also use the same battery, which is actually bigger than the one in the Air 2 and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. According to iFixit, the tape is even the same holding components together. There are a few differences, however. The new iPad includes support for Touch ID, which the original iPad Air do not include. It also lacks a lock switch, which was excluded from the iPad Air 2. Beyond those and the new processor, the distinctions are minimal, such as a smaller Wi-Fi module, a different configuration of speaker holes, and the like. Of course, in terms of iFixit's perspective, the biggest similarity the new iPad shares with the iPad Air -- and almost all Apple devices -- is its inability to be repaired easily. It earned a 2 out of 10 on the company's Repairability Score, dinged for the difficulty of battery removal and the possibility the LCD could be cracked when the front panel is removed for any repairs.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS US Edition Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 LG G6 Nintendo Switch Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus VPN News The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus has a big problem: the Samsung Galaxy S8 The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus has a big problem: the Samsung Galaxy S8 By John McCann Mobile phones   Too big, too similar, too expensive Shares The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is a lovely phone. I’ve been lucky enough get hands on with it before it goes on sale, but it has a big, big problem. It’s packed full of power, has a dazzling display, strong camera and eye-catching design – but so does its smaller, cheaper sibling, the Samsung Galaxy S8. In fact, the only differences between the two handsets are 1) screen size, 2) battery size and 3) price.  You may want a large screen, but unlike last year where we got a 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 and 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 Edge, the standard Galaxy S8 packs a huge 5.8-inch display.  At 6.2 inches the Galaxy S8 Plus screen is monstrous, yet it feels unnecessary alongside its already-large non-plus namesake.  The bigger 3,500mAh battery (vs 3,000mAh in the S8) is a nice addition, but Samsung’s S7 duo had one of the better battery performances of 2016’s flagships and the Galaxy S8 should continue that trend - plus with fast and wireless charging, if you do run low it’s easy and quick to top up. All this dampens the appeal of the larger power pack in the S8 Plus. Then comes the price. Samsung has upped the cost of its new flagship duo, with the Galaxy S8 featuring an already wallet-troubling $720 (£689, AU$1,199) price tag.  The S8 Plus meanwhile, demands $825 (£779, AU$1,349) for the privilege of a bigger screen and battery - which doesn’t sound like great value for money to me. Whatever you can do… The reason Samsung has got the Galaxy S8 Plus is simple. Apple.  Back in 2014 Apple launched the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, six months after Samsung launched the singular Galaxy S5. Five months after the iPhone 6 launch, Samsung introduced the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge.  The South Korean firm already had a big screen handset in its Galaxy Note series, but it seems like it was desperate to keep up appearances versus Apple so rolled out two new handsets regardless.  At least it still made some sense, with one flat-screened phone and a larger, curved screen device. It repeated the trick with S7, and again I gave Samsung a pass because there was a bigger difference between the two phones.  There's no free pass this time round though. With news that Samsung is going to start selling refurbished, non-exploding Galaxy Note 7 handsets soon, and rumors of a Galaxy Note 8 launch later in the year the Galaxy S8 Plus feels even more unnecessary.  Check out our Galaxy S8 vs Galaxy S8 Plus video below to see the difference between the two phones for yourself The Galaxy S8 has a bigger screen than the LG G6, Huawei P10 Plus, HTC U Ultra, Sony Xperia XZ Premium and iPhone 7 Plus - it comfortably meets the “I want a bigger screen on my flagship phone” requirement without the need for the Galaxy S8 Plus. The simple answer would be, “don’t buy the S8 Plus then”, but I can’t help but wonder what could have been. Samsung could have saved itself time and money by bringing us the Galaxy S8 only, which in turn may have seen it come with a more appealing price tag, and letting its Note series offer the super-supersized screen experience.  But here we are, with two ridiculously good looking phones, but really all we need is the one.

As many Android users may know, the Google Assistant is a neat piece of software. It’s very similar to Siri from Apple or Amazon’s Alexa. Only much more capable. This artificial intelligence learns from us, and is one of the most advanced things our smartphones can do. Read: Google Pixel XL Review The Assistant first debuted on the new Google Pixel and Pixel XL. Then with Google Home, a smart connected speaker that can control your home. It has a lot to offer, like always-listening modes ready to take commands, built-in games, and can answer questions or turn on your lights. The options are almost endless, and more are being added every day. The video below confirms the Google Assistant release date. After the initial announcement last week, Google is right on time with the release date. Stating it would be available “soon” and now confirming the broad rollout. Expect updates on the Google Play Store starting March 2nd for all Android devices running Android 6.0 Marshmallow and above. The fact that it can understand context, and answer questions in a string of voice commands without forgetting the original question, sets it apart from the competition. This is one of many key features that users can be excited about starting March 2nd. Ask Apple’s Siri about a movie, then ask another question and it forgets about the movie and starts over. With the Google Assistant, it stays in touch with the original topic. Not to mention a slew of other controls, features, jokes, and more. It’s like a virtual friend you can talk to, ask questions, get directions, or control your entire home and all smart connected accessories. Amazon’s Alexa is starting to be released in a slew of different products. The company is pushing it extremely hard. So much in fact, that this is likely a reactionary move by Google, making Assistant available for all devices. Competition is a good thing, and consumers will soon benefit from it. Google Assistant For All Androids The search giant knows that everyone needs a little helping hand sometimes, and what better way to do this than on our smartphones. The Assistant is currently limited to the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, but almost every new or updated Android will have it within the next week. Starting March 2nd, any smartphone running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow or Android 7.0 Nougat can use the Google Assistant. That means the Galaxy S7, HTC 10, Nexus 6P, or even older devices like the Galaxy Note 5 or LG G5. Specifically, Google stated the Assistant would arrive, “this week to English users in the U.S., followed by English in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, as well as German speakers in Germany.” So while it won’t be available for literally every Android smartphone, not yet, it’s starting to rollout to millions of users. Above we see it on the Galaxy S7, LG V20 and an HTC phone, and more will get it soon enough. This first week of availability will be limited to the US, with other rollouts being announced in the near future. According to Google users will receive an update to the Google Search application on the Play Store, not to mention behind the scenes with the Google Play Services application and framework. We’d recommend heading to the Google Play Store today, and checking for updates. Then simply press and hold the virtual or physical “home button” down, and the Assistant will spring to life. Agree to the terms, and enjoy all of its features. Try asking the Assistant “I’m Feeling Lucky” and enjoy the game-show built in. It’s one of my household’s favorite features, and now everyone will be able to enjoy it. Again, we can expect more languages and regions to get this feature in the coming weeks or months. For now though, it’s only in the US for English users. Stay tuned for more details, and be on the lookout for the update on your phone. 3 Responses 02/26/2017 John Reply My LG smartphone running Android 5.0.2 is running Allo, which contains Google Assistant. I guess the fact the phone will run Assistant via Allo means my smartphone can run Google Assistant. So, why isn’t Google making Google Assistant available for my phone? 03/03/2017 Crhsitain Weehlan Reply Hi john, this is Crhsitain Weehlan. Try turning it off and on again, it works on mine #4moreyears lol 04/01/2017 Jake @ Google Assitant Reply Google assistant is amazing compared to siri i love this virtual app thank you Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone are willing to pay a premium for the device. And even though smartphones that use Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Android operating system represent nearly 90% of smartphones currently in use, iPhone owners historically spend more on apps than do Android users. That situation is about to change. According to a new report from App Annie cited at Axios.com, the combined total spend on apps from the Google Play and third-party Android app stores will total $41 billion in 2017, slightly higher than the $40 billion iPhone users will spend at the Apple App Store. Spending at Google Play is forecast to rise to $21 billion and third-party sales are estimated to rise to $20 billion. By 2021, according to App Annie estimates, the App Store will generate $60 billion in sales, compared with $42 billion for Google Play and $36 billion for third-party Android stores. The primary driver of the change is — wait for it — China, which is expected to account for some $56 billion of the 2021 total spending of $136 billion on iOS and Android apps. Low-priced, Android-based phones will continue to sell in large numbers to Chinese consumers and those consumers will spend more on apps. The most popular apps at both the App Store and Google Play are games. Last year 39% of all app downloads and 11% of time spent in Android apps were for games. However, games also accounted for 81% of revenues for the app stores.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Samsung Galaxy S8+ vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus: Which is Better? Haamiz Ahmed 3 days ago Lets face it, Samsung’s upcoming flagships, the S8 and S8+ look gorgeous (from the front at least) compared to most other phones in the market. The only direct competition in terms of specifications, price and sales is offered by Apple’s own iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The bigger phones from both companies offer the best in specifications so a comparison between the two is warranted. Here’s how the Samsung Galaxy S8+ and the Apple iPhone 7 Plus compare: Design Design wise the winner is obvious, as the Galaxy S8 Plus’ looks are far better than the iPhone 7 Plus. It features an edge to edge infinity display that melds with the glass back which looks stunning to say the least. Couple this with the tiny top and bottom bezels on the front and the result is a much more appealing design. Apple rarely tinkers with a winning formula and it hasn’t changed the iPhone 7 Plus’ looks since the original iPhone 6 Plus which was announced more than two years ago. The overall design is very similar with minor changes like the antenna bands moving towards the frame of the phone instead of covering the top and bottom of the iPhone’s back. One interesting point to note is that the Galaxy S8+ is 4.5mm smaller in terms of width, compared to the iPhone 7 Plus, despite sporting a 0.7-inch larger display. The rest of the dimensions are nearly the same despite such a huge difference in screen size. You also get an iris scanner alongside water and dust resistance in the S8+ (the latter is available in the iPhone 7 Plus). Galaxy S8+ gets an IP68 rating while the iPhone 7 Plus has an IP67 rating. The digital assistant could be a mixed bag for the S8+ as Apple’s Siri is old and well worn compared to the new and untested Bixby. Another major difference between the two is the inclusion of a headphone jack in the S8 Plus. Display With the S8+, you get a 6.2 inch Quad HD+ (1440 x 2960) Super AMOLED screen with 529 ppi pixel density. iPhone 7 Plus on the other hand features a 5.5 inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS LCD Retina display with 401 ppi pixel density. For those who don’t know a “retina” display has just enough pixel density so that the individual pixels are indistinguishable with the naked eye over a certain distance. Samsung has the advantage on the display side due to a Super AMOLED screen which features deeper blacks and more vibrant colors. It comes down to personal preference for AMOLED and IPS LCD screens, however, it doesn’t end here. The S8 and S8+ also feature 10-bit HDR support allowing Samsung to have a leg up in terms of colors and shadow definition on screen. Internals and Storage For the iPhone 7 Plus you get a Quad-core 2.34 GHz (2x Hurricane + 2x Zephyr) Apple A10 Fusion chip with 3 GB of RAM. On the storage side of things you have the option of 32/128/256 GB sans expandable storage. The Galaxy S8+ will have two different SoC options: Octa-core (4x 2.35 GHz Kryo & 4x 1.9 GHz Kryo) Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 (US model) Octa-core (4x 2.3 GHz & 4x 1.7 GHz) Exynos 8895 Octa (international model) It will have 4 GB RAM with 64 GB of UFS 2.1 internal storage as well as expandable storage of up to 256 GB via a microSD card or a faster UFS memory card. Some markets will also get 6 GB RAM variants with 128 GB of storage. Raw performance-wise you can count on Samsung’s phone to deliver better results compared with the iPhone 7 Plus. Day to day performance on the other hand will not be very different thanks to optimizations for the iOS in the Apple phone. Detailed comparison will be available after the Galaxy S8+ is released. Camera Samsung skipped on a newer/better image sensor for the S8 and S8 Plus’ cameras. They feature the same image sensor used in last year’s S7 and S7 Edge – a 12 MP, f/1.7 unit with optical image stabilization and dual-pixel phase detection auto focus. The improvements were made to the camera software and post processing of images. The iPhone 7 Plus has a dual camera setup offering 2x optical zoom and bokeh effect in portrait mode. Overall the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus’ cameras don’t have any major differences except for the zoom offered in the latter. Samsung has the lead here as well because last year’s S7 Edge offered better camera quality/performance compared to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Add the minor improvements made to the camera software for the S8 and S8+ this year, and we have ourselves a winner in the camera department. Battery and Release Price The iPhone 7 Plus has a 2,900 mAh battery which is pretty good for a phone with a 5.5 inch 1080p screen. Samsung Galaxy S8+ on the other hand has a 3,500 mAh battery which seems kind of small for a 6.2 inch QHD+ screen. Comparing it the Galaxy S7 Edge which featured a 3,600 mAh unit with a 5.5 inch QHD display, it could be mean a smaller overall battery life for the S8+, however, the new phone uses newer processor chips built using a 10 nm process, which should consume less power. The competition here, between the S8+and the iPhone 7 Plus, could be close as the Apple phone does feature a good battery for its screen size and resolution. At release the iPhone 7 Plus cost: $769 for the 32 GB model $869 for 128 GB $969 for 256 GB The S8+ will cost $850 and will come in a 64 GB variant only (128GB in certain markets). Comparing the price of the 128 GB iPhone 7 Plus is fair as you get expandable storage on the S8 Plus. The S8 Plus wins here by a hair’s breadth. Apple iPhone 7 Plus vs Samsung Galaxy S8+ For Galaxy S8+ Better design (edge to edge display with tiny bezels) Better display (QHD+ with Mobile HDR Premium vs FHD Retina) More RAM (4 GB vs 3 GB) Better in raw performance Better camera Better storage option (expandable vs no memory card slot) IP 68 water and dust resistance (IP 67 in iPhone 7 Plus) For iPhone 7 Plus Better optimizations for iOS compared with Android Siri better than Bixby Cheaper variant available compared to S8+ Smooth day to day performance Primary Sidebar Viral Stories How Much Data Do YouTube Videos Use?

The Good The iDevices Wall Outlet works well with both Siri and Alexa, letting you turn whatever's plugged into each outlet on and off using your voice. Installation is straightforward, and you don't need to connect it with a hub. The Bad $100 per outlet is a lot to ask for integrated, plug-in smarts. The Bottom Line This is the best smart outlet on the market right now, but unless you're committed to splurging on a seamless smart home, you're better off just going with a plug-in smart switch.

Chris Monroe/CNET For $100, you can swap out one of your home's outlets with the Wi-Fi-enabled iDevices Wall Outlet. Make that upgrade, and you'll be able to turn each of its two outlets on and off independently, or program them to turn on and off automatically using the iDevices app on your Android or iOS device. You can also sync the Wall Outlet up with Apple HomeKit or with Amazon's Alexa to turn each outlet on and off using voice commands. Enlarge Image With just three wires to connect (neutral, line, and ground), the Wall Outlet is pretty easy to install. Ry Crist/CNET In other words, each outlet functions the same as one of iDevices' plug-in smart switches, right down to the fact that they'll track the energy usage of whatever you've got plugged in. The only difference, obviously, it that this is a hard-wired product -- it isn't anywhere near as flexible as the switch, which you can plug in anywhere. On the other hand, smartening up your outlets makes for a connected living space that's a lot more seamless than one that's littered with blocky plugs all over the place. And, to the Wall Outlet's credit, it performed flawlessly in my tests at the CNET Smart Home. With just three wires to connect (line, neutral and ground), installing it was a relative cinch, and the integrations with Siri and Alexa both worked as advertised (there's even a little fold-down flap on the front of the outlet with the Apple HomeKit pairing code printed on it -- a nice, thoughtful touch). Add in the energy-tracking feature, and there's really not much else that I wish this thing was capable of. In fact, I'll take it further: this is the best smart outlet you can buy right now. It works well, it's got a good slate of third-party integrations, it's easy to install, it doesn't need a hub and it's from an established name with a clear vision for the connected home. Still, this thing is something of a niche product, and an expensive one at that. I can see the appeal for anyone who's ready to go all-in with smart home tech, but if you're a curious connected home beginner, then you're much better off just getting a plug-in smart switch to experiment with. The Belkin WeMo Mini, the iHome Smart Plug, and iDevices' own smart switch all cost less than half as much as the Wall Outlet -- I say start there and wait for prices to come down before worrying about your outlets.

The complete story behind Apple's futuristic new campus, 'Apple Park' Kif Leswing Apr. 1, 2017, 10:00 AM 148,298 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple employees will begin moving into a new campus in Cupertino, California this month.  The new Apple headquarters, named Apple Park, is a single ring, about a mile in circumference, set in a large campus that will be covered in plants and trees. Getty Late Apple CEO Steve Jobs once said that the new campus was "a shot at building the best office building in the world." It will house 13,000 employees on over 2.8 million square feet of office space. Apple employees will enjoy fruit trees, a massive fitness center, and a workspace that's been carefully overseen by Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer.  The Apple HQ has been compared to a UFO and the Pentagon — and after about $5 billion in costs, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook, it's ready to open.  Here's a look at Apple Park over the past five years, and what still needs to be done:  View As: One Page Slides Here's the entire campus, as of March 2017, in one shot. Apple This is an architect's rendering from the beginning of the process that was made public in 2013. City of Cupertino Steve Jobs originally announced the plans for Apple Park at a Cupertino city council meeting in 2011. It ended up being his last public appearance. At the time, Steve Jobs introduced this idea to the city council as "Apple Campus 2."YouTube/Cupertino "It's a little like a spaceship landed," Jobs said. Watch the entire video — it's a little bit like an iPhone launch:   Apple Park is right down the street from Apple's current campus, Infinite Loop, and is significantly larger. Apple/Cupertino City Council Apple's architect is Foster + Partners. Foster + Partners / Cupertino This is the most detailed depiction of where everything is located. Note the fairly large fitness center in the northwest corner of the lot, the ample parking near the freeway, and the corporate auditorium with direct access from the road.  "One of the most memorable, and perhaps vital to the project, was Steve saying, 'Don't think of me as the client, think of me as part of your team,'" lead architect Norman Foster said in an video presented to the Cupertino City Council. Cupertino Watch the full video here.  The design was partly inspired by the main quad on Stanford University's campus, Foster said. Stanford University/Facebook The land under Apple Park was HP's advanced products campus before Apple tore the building down in 2013. HP Video of the demolition here.  The land was finally fully cleared in 2014. Here's a photo from May of that year. YouTube/Dana Diederich Then it was time to start building. This is a snapshot of the building process in February 2016. Youtube/Duncan Sinfield One of the building's defining features is that it features huge panes of curved glass. According to Seele, Apple's glass supplier, Apple Park uses "something like six kilometers of glass." Youtube / Duncan Sinfeld A leaked photo from January provides a sneak peek into the interior: Apple More photos are available at Mac Generation. The campus was designed to be light and airy — here's a rendering. Apple/Cupertino Even the tables inside the building have been obsessed over. Apple commissioned custom tables from Arco, a Dutch furniture maker. Apple's table is identical to this one, only twice as long.Arco Apple's table of choice is an 18-foot-long and 4-foot-wide solid white oak slab that weighs 660 pounds. It's basically a version of Arco's $2,500 Essenza table, only twice as long. But the outside is as important as the inside. 80% of the site will be green space, and Apple is planning to plant 7,000 trees on campus. Apple Many of those trees, especially inside the ring, are going to be fruit trees. In this diagram, the purple dots are plum trees, the orange dots are apricot tree, the brown dots are olive trees, the red dots are persimmon trees. And of course, the yellow dots are apple trees. YouTube/The Daily Conversation Right now, those trees are still being planted. Landscaping is expected to extend through the end of the second quarter 2017. Matthew Roberts/YouTube Here's how Apple plants a tree:   Apple decided to plant mature trees to make the campus green quicker. Apple One fun fact about Apple Park: No dirt was removed from the site. For a while, there was a giant dirt pyramid on the site made out of all the earth that had been removed. Youtube/Duncan Sinfield "Hard to know which is more beautiful, the building or that pile of dirt," Apple CEO Tim Cook told Vogue last year. YouTube/Duncan Sinfield Story here.  The building will be uncommonly environmentally-friendly. Apple says it will be the largest naturally ventilated building in the world — meaning that it won't need air conditioning or heating for most of the year. Apple About 4,300 concrete slabs help make up the natural ventilation system, according to Popular Science. Apple The slabs help the building stay cool, reports Popular Science.  Apple's campus is also positively covered with solar panels. Matthew Roberts/YouTube Apple Here's a plus for fitness fanatics at Apple: There will be miles of jogging and cycling trails across the campus, and bikes on site to help employees get around. There's also a gym and fitness center that cost over $70 million to build, according to public permits. Apple Permits here.  And there's a 1,000-person auditorium for launch events and public presentations, named "Steve Jobs Theatre." YouTube/Matthew Roberts Employees start moving in next month. "The main building, parking structure, theatre, and fitness center are under construction," said a progress report delivered to the Cupertino City Council on March 7. "Occupancy for main building will begin in April and phased to end of 2017. Phase 2 and ancillary building expected to be completed by 2018."

Courtesy of Microsoft   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     The idea for Microsoft's latest upgrade to Windows 10 is to make some intimidating things, such as 3-D modeling, easy enough that any person could find a use for it. The company on Wednesday announced that the new "Creators Update" for Windows 10 -- its third major upgrade since the system launched in 2015 -- adds a function that lets users turn their smartphones into 3-D scanners, then import those 3-D images into their computers. It also adds support for virtual reality and mixed reality headsets. While both features seem pretty far out of the mainstream, it's all part of an attempt to cement Windows 10 as a platform for creation as it looks to introduce technology that it believes will one day be on everyone's devices. Creative users are often more closely associated with Apple's Macs, while the PC has traditionally been thought of as a productivity machine. (Those "I'm a Mac, I'm a PC" commercials may be from Apple's perspective, but they had some truth to them.) But Microsoft has recently been courting artists, architects, musicians, gamers and designers with its latest software and hardware -- including its 28-inch touch screen Surface Studio PC, which the company said Wednesday it will sell in three additional markets this April, including China. The new Windows update underscores this push. "The Creators Update is borne out of the idea that we want to empower the ability to create in all of us," said Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's corporate vice president for window and devices. For example, Medhi said, parents today might take a photo to remember of a sand castle they build with their kids on vacation. Now, they could walk around the sand castle with their phones to create a 3-D replica model, which they could then print out and give to their child as a memento of that vacation. Scanning a couch in a store, he said, could help you figure out the best placement for it in your home. Or users could take a 360-degree video of some memorable spot on their vacations, and use a virtual or mixed reality headset (such as Microsoft's own HoloLens) to share that with others. While Mehdi admits that not every Windows user may currently be dying to create their own 3-D models or virtual reality videos quite yet, he believes that adding these features helps Microsoft pave the way for the day when we all will. Looking ahead, Mehdi said that creativity will continue to be a focus for future Windows upgrades, which Microsoft is now doing with smaller and more regular updates rather than large releases every couple of years. The Creators Update will be released as a free Windows 10 upgrade on April 11. All Windows 10 users will get a notification about the update over the coming weeks. Those interested in getting the update as soon as possible can download it directly from Microsoft's website once it is released. Microsoft is using the update to embrace other emerging trends as well, such as the growth of live-streaming for video games. A new feature will allow Windows 10 users to easily live-stream games from their PCs, and chat with their viewers. It is also updating its Edge browser, which, despite being included with Windows 10, still lags behind Google's Chrome in popularity among Windows 10 users. Mehdi said new features, such as security improvements, the ability to group tabs and some behind-the-scenes power improvements to make Edge easier on battery life could help convince Windows users to switch.

The company said Tuesday that new iPad still has a 9.7-inch screen, but the display is brighter and its price starts at $329, down from $399. Apple still controls about a quarter of the tablet market, but the market as a whole has been in decline after several years of rapid growth. According to IDC, tablet shipments fell 20 percent in the final three months of 2016, compared with the same period last year. The $329 model has 32 GB of storage and operates via WiFi. A $459 version that includes a cellular connection is also available. Apple's iPad mini 4 is still available with 128 GB of storage starting at $399.

Richard Lawler, @Rjcc 19h ago in Gadgetry Comments 312 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Cowboy Bebop Letter from the Editor Apple may have scrapped its rumored March press event, but fortunately, we were able to count on Samsung for some good old-fashioned spectacle. Actually, by the company's standards, Wednesday's Galaxy S8 launch in New York was fairly tame: There was no orchestra onstage, and attendees looking for VR headsets underneath their seats were left empty-handed. Instead, we got the heavily leaked Galaxy S8 (and S8+), along with a healthy dose of humility -- yes, Samsung is still very sorry about those exploding Note 7s. All told, the phones themselves look promising, with nearly bezel-less displays that make the devices easier to hold than their 5.8- and 6.2-inch screen sizes would have you believe. Samsung's face-recognizing personal assistant Bixby looks interesting too, though we're gonna call BS on the company's pitch that these devices represent a fresh form factor for phones -- they're still just boxes, guys. Oh, and can Samsung succeed where other companies have failed, and make phone-powered desktops a thing? Only time will tell, but suffice to say, we have some questions. There was so much happening at Samsung's one-hour press event that you may have missed, well, lots of other things going on this week. Just a few hours before the Samsung event, the first reviews of Microsoft's upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update hit the internet. We're especially excited about built-in game streaming and some new Edge browser features, but you might end up downloading it just for Paint 3D. Meanwhile, in more sobering news, Democrats pushed the issue of cybersecurity, and the Trump administration claimed coal can be a form of clean energy.

The Polar M600, Nixon Mission, Fossil Q Wander, Fossil Q Marshal and Michael Kors Access join the Fossil Q Founder, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F10 and TAG Heuer Connected on the update list that so many other older devices will never join.

That's one way to fix the problemTwitter is changing its default profile pic Twitter had the idea that new users would "hatch" into birds -- like its logo -- before sending tweets, so it made the default profile image an egg. Unfortunately, over the years, anonymous trolls have associated the egg with every kind of hate and filth you can imagine, and probably some you can't.

By: Samden Sherpa Published: Saturday, April 1, 2017, 16:15 [IST] While Apple is set to bring its flagships later this year, there have been numerous rumors pouring in about the company's next iPhones. And the leaks are likely to continue till the official launch. Having said that, a new rumor has just popped up on the internet and it suggests that the upcoming iPhones will feature True Tone displays. The information comes from a note published by Barclays. According to the Macrumors, the banking firm has stated that the alleged iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone 8 along with an OLED display will each feature a "full spectral sensing" ambient light sensor for the purpose of a "True Color" screen. SEE ALSO: Apple will start assembling iPhones in India in less than a month: Report Further, the report reveals that sensors will most probably be supplied by Austrian semiconductor manufacturer AMS. However, it will interesting to see this feature in the upcoming iPhones. Currently, Apple's True Tone display is available only on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. While the smartphone market has become very competitive smartphone manufacturers need to be on top of their game to deliver a product that is unique. Apple offering such tech with its smartphone will be a distinguishing factor. SEE ALSO: iPhone 8 to feature vertical dual-camera, leaked images reveal In any case, talking about the functionality of True Tone displays, it can effectively alter the appearance of the iPhone screen based on the lighting conditions. For example, if you are in a room with yellow bulbs or outside in sunlight, your display will basically look different. The display would either appear either yellower or bluer depending on the lighting conditions.

Toshiba has reportedly completed the first round of bidding for its prized memory chip business, seen as key for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around. About 10 foreign companies and funds tendered bids, the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said, quoting unnamed sources. Suitors include Western Digital Corp (WDC.O), which operates a chip plant with Toshiba in Japan, Micron Technology Inc (MU.O), South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) and financial investors. Toshiba shareholders on Thursday agreed to split off its NAND flash memory business, paving the way for a sale to raise at least $9 billion to cover US nuclear unit charges that threaten the conglomerate’s future. The Yomiuri newspaper said bidding prices from Apple, Amazon or Google, owned by Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), were not known. The Nikkei business daily reported on Friday that US private equity firm Silver Lake Partners SILAK.UL and US chipmaker Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) have offered Toshiba about 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) for the unit. Toshiba is expected to negotiate with individual candidates this month. Any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba’s memory chips, according to local media. Toshiba is the world’s number two supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea’s Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67 trillion yen in revenue last fiscal year.

Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron Corp will help Apple in doing so,” he said. Kharge said making iPhones in India would help Apple lower prices, which will help it gain a foothold in the fast growing Indian market. “Assembling and making of iPhones in Bengaluru will boost Apple’s chances of gaining a foothold in the fast growing Indian market because it will allow the company to lower prices,” he said. Karnataka government has been in talks with the Centre for strengthening the ecosystem even as Apple is negotiating with it for its next level of production in India, he said. Apple wants to bring its component manufacturers to India to make parts and export finished phones and is seeking tax concessions on import of key components. However the Indian government has rejected most of the demands of the US company. Kharge said if the Centre was keen on taking on China, it should not give special treatment to Apple alone, but to other players, including Samsung and Lenova, if they are desirous of opening a manufacturing units in India, especially Karnataka. “My position with the central government has been don’t give special treatment to Apple alone, but treat other players equally. Open the entire eco-system for high-end manufacturing of electronics if you really want to compete with China and Taiwan,” he said. Also Read| Apple’s challenge in India Kharge said government should also give companies, including Apple, certain timelines, subsidies and incentives to create a level-playing field for them. “The government should give companies a timeline, say in 10 years they should be able to manufacture 100 per cent of phones and its components by procuring them from the local market. Such a timeline should be given because we don’t have that environment now,” he said. “The government should also give companies subsidies and incentives to create a level-playing field for them to strengthen the Indian eco-system,” Kharge said. Asked about the Stayzilla case, whose co-founder Yogendra Vasupal was arrested for alleged non-payment of dues filed by a Chennai based advertisement agency, Kharge said it should be a learning curve for startups to work under the parameters of the Indian legal system. Vasupal was arrested on 15 March.

January 9 marks the tenth anniversary of Apple's iPhone. In the 10 years since, iPhone has enriched the lives of people around the world with over one billion units sold.  It quickly grew into a revolutionary platform for hardware, software and services integration and inspired new products, including iPad and Apple Watch, along with millions of apps that have become essential to people's daily lives. "iPhone is an essential part of our customers' lives and today more than ever it is redefining the way we communicate, entertain, work and live," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. Last year, the company introduced iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus that came with A10 Fusion chip, most powerful chip ever in a smartphone, with processing performance 120 times faster and the graphics performance 240 times faster in iPhone 7 than the original iPhone. The smartphone sports a 12MP lens, optical image stabilisation, an f/1.8 aperture that captures 50 per cent more light as well as wide colour capture, all allowing for more vibrant colours with more detail even in low light, while iPhone 7 Plus also offers a dual-lens.  iOS 10 was the biggest iOS release ever, with innovations including -- bringing the power of the App Store to Messages, a Memories feature in Photos, SiriKit for developers so apps can talk to Siri, an improved Maps app that is even simpler and more intuitive to use, support for breaking news notifications and paid subscriptions in the News app.  "iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. The best is yet to come," Cook added.  TAGS Steve Jobs iPhone Apple iPhone O P E N Professional Courses Sponsored link Technology Courses Sponsored link Jobs Wisdom Jobs Sarkari Result Freejobalert Latest Bob Dylan receives his Nobel Literature prize 400 CRPF jawans hospitalised in Kerala JCO killed in IED blast along LoC in Poonch Drunk Britons arrested for harassing AI air hostess 29 stranded Keralites to be brought back to Kerala by next week Soviet era Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko dies at 84 40 cows carcases recovered from UP farmhouse Gallery Movie stars who hid their actual identity behind their pseudo names FBI releases never seen before pictures of  9/11 Pentagon attack arrow Videos Dangal girl Sanya Malhotra plans to climb Mt.

Macs & Mac OS X | 27 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (21) Apple Releases macOS 10.12.4, watchOS 3.2, and tvOS 10.2 by Adam C. Engst For Apple’s four operating systems, updates have become a one for all, and all for one proposition. As is often the case, iOS received the most attention with the iOS 10.3 release (see “iOS 10.3 Adds New File System, Find My AirPods, and More,” 27 March 2017), but Apple also pushed out macOS 10.12.4, watchOS 3.2, and tvOS 10.2. macOS 10.12.4 -- macOS 10.12.4 Sierra is available via Software Update, where it’s a roughly 2 GB download. Alternatively, you can instead download a delta updater (for 10.12.3, 1.79 GB) or combo updater (from any version of 10.12, 2.04 GB). The most significant change in 10.12.4 is the addition of Night Shift, a feature previously available only in iOS that automatically shifts the colors of the screen to the warmer end of the spectrum after dark. Night Shift, much like the independent f.lux utility, is designed to help you sleep better by reducing the amount of blue light that tricks your body into thinking it’s earlier than it is. Look for it in System Preferences > Displays and Notification Center. Beyond the addition of Night Shift, macOS 10.12.4 brings with it a few international improvements. For those who follow cricket, Siri can now provide scores, schedules, and player rosters from the Indian Premier League and the International Cricket Council. Apple added dictation support for Shanghainese. And the update improves right-to-left language support (such as for Arabic and Hebrew) for the Touch Bar, toolbar, and visual tab picker in Safari. Although we don’t know the full extent of the changes, Apple promises that 10.12.4 resolves several PDF rendering and annotation issues in Preview. Those fixes are likely in the troubled rewrite to PDFKit that debuted in Sierra; we can hope the improvements will make life easier for developers who work with PDF (see “Sierra PDF Problems Get Worse in 10.12.2,” 2 January 2017, and “Apple Releases macOS Sierra 10.12.3, iOS 10.2.1, tvOS 10.1.1, and watchOS 3.1.1,” 23 January 2017). Another fix claims to resolve a bug that prevented content from appearing in Mail messages. Finally, Apple added support for more digital camera raw formats and a whopping 65 security fixes. On the enterprise side, 10.12.4 provides a handful of improvements and fixes. Apple says that the update: Adds the tethered-caching command, which optimizes certain downloads for iOS devices tethered via USB. For details, enter man tethered-caching in Terminal. Updates the security command to include the delete-identity option, which deletes both a certificate and its private key from a keychain. For details, enter man security in Terminal. Updates the profiles command to include the -N flag, which displays a device-enrollment notification that prompts the user to complete Mobile Device Management (MDM) enrollment. For details, enter man profiles in Terminal. Fixes an issue that causes notebook computers connected to certain docking stations to display a blank screen instead of the macOS login window on the built-in display. Fixes an issue that causes a newly changed user-account password to be rejected at the macOS login window, if FileVault is turned on. Adds the ability to automatically renew certain certificates delivered via a configuration profile. Includes numerous Xsan fixes. watchOS 3.2 -- Less exciting is watchOS 3.2, which is a 225 MB update that you install via the Watch app on your iPhone (in Watch > Settings > General > Software Update). Remember that the Apple Watch must be on its charger, charged to at least 50 percent, and within range of your iPhone, which itself must be on Wi-Fi. Don’t start installing if you’ll want to use the watch again within an hour or so — watchOS updates take surprisingly long to load. The main addition in watchOS 3.2 is Theater Mode, which you toggle via a new button in Control Center (swipe up from the bottom of the screen). When enabled, Theater Mode turns on silent mode and disables the standard Raise to Wake behavior, leaving the screen off until you tap it. That prevents the Apple Watch from lighting up in a dark theater if you raise your wrist for any reason. Apple also expanded the Apple Watch’s support for Siri to include independent apps, so you can now theoretically use Siri to start workouts, send messages, make payments, book rides, and more. Siri support in non-Apple apps extends only to a few categories of apps, and developers have to support it, so don’t expect that you’ll be able to talk to every app. On the international side of things, Scribble is now available in French, Spanish, and Italian. And, for those who have been frustrated by the lack of feedback when syncing music to the Apple Watch (which seems to take forever!), music playlist sync progress now appears in the Watch app on the iPhone. As with every operating system update these days, there are a slew — 31 all told — of security fixes worked into watchOS 3.2. tvOS 10.2 and Apple TV Remote app -- Finally, Apple released tvOS 10.2, which mostly provides things of interest to developers (and 39 security fixes), but does offer one nice refinement for users. You can get the tvOS 10.2 update on your fourth-generation Apple TV via Settings > System > Software Updates > Update Software. tvOS 10.2 now provides what Apple calls “Accelerated Scrolling support” for apps. In practice, this means that you can swipe up or down on the far-right side of the Siri Remote’s touchpad to navigate quickly through long lists. In the screenshot below, the jump points appear as dots, each one representing a page in the list. Most of the user-facing improvements to the Apple TV are found in the Apple TV Remote app, which Apple updated to version 1.1. It has now been optimized for iPad support, though don’t get too excited: it seems to be essentially the same as the iPhone version, just larger (that’s a whole lot of black in the screenshot below). When I downloaded the app on my iPad, I still had to filter the App Store search results for “iPhone only” apps to be able to see it. Another improvement in the Remote app is an enhanced Now Playing screen. While playing media, you can tap Details in the upper right to view the currently playing media, along with direct media controls, such as pause and rewind. If you swipe up on that screen now, you can see additional detail. For instance, doing so when playing music shows your Up Next queue. And swiping up on Now Playing while watching a movie shows additional movie information and a chapter list. The Update Question -- As always, the question we’re asked after one of these mega-release days is if users should jump on the updates or not. We’ve installed them all and haven’t noticed any serious problems in initial use, but that’s relatively meaningless. Our take is that there’s no real reason to install any of these updates immediately unless you’re suffering from a problem expressly addressed by them. However, given the number of security fixes involved in each one, we do strongly recommend that you update within a few weeks.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment jweil  2017-03-27 21:48 It seems like Apple purposely excluded 'tower' Mac Pro's from Night Watch, which I believe validates my impression that Apple has a policy of force obsoleting older machines in order to coerce users to buy new ones in order to maintain security and keep current with software releases including 3rd party updates. In my opinion the only conceivable reason they are doing this is due to greed. In my case I cannot fathom a hardware reason while my MacPro 2010, with a 3.5 Mhz processor, an Apple Cinema display, and 16 Gig of RAM should not be able to run an app that is essentially a copy of f.lux. But in fact, this is the case as Night Watch does not appear in my Display Prefs and is excluded in the Spec List for 10.12.4. My answer to Apple's seeming policy of forced obsolesce: I am now seriously considering that my next machine may be a Linix or Windows machine as Apple no longer makes a user hardware configurable machine other than to add RAM. Reply barefootguru   2017-03-27 23:32 Yeah couldn't possibly be a technical issue. Good luck getting regular OS updates and 100% feature support on 7 year old hardware when you switch to Windows or Unix. Reply jweil  2017-03-28 23:15 Tower non-Macs don't cost $4K-7K either Reply Saraswati  2017-03-27 21:59 Here is the link to the Combo Update for Sierra 10.12.4: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1910?locale=en_US Reply hjtromp  2017-03-28 07:49 Same as with jweil: No Night Shift available in my Macbook Pro (Mid 2010) running 10.12.4, same for my iMac 27" (Mid 2011) Reply Tonya Engst   2017-03-28 14:39 Apple has posted a support article that clarifies the tech specs for using Night Shift in Sierra, listing both the set of supported Macs and the set of supported displays. Nothing on that list of Macs is older than 2012, so various desktop and laptop models are excluded. http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207513 (the specs are near the bottom of the article) Reply Paul Ellis  2017-03-28 15:09 Good job Flux exists, eh? And it's more flexible and configurable. https://justgetflux.com Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-03-29 00:18 And f.lux is freeware. The current version is compatible with OS X back to OS X 10.7 Lion. And there are older versions available that go back as far as OS X 10.4 Tiger. As well, there are versions for iOS and Android devices, and for Windows and Linux. A true gem. So don't fret if NightShift doesn't work on your Mac. It's certainly no reason to abandon you expensive Mac Pro. I used f.lux on my old Mac Pro tower in Lion. Reply Robyn Weisman  2017-03-28 13:38 Any word whether this update fixes problem with Time Machine? Time Machine hasn't worked for me since I updated to 10.12.3... Reply Josh Centers   2017-03-28 13:46 I'm not aware of any widespread Time Machine issues. What problems are you experiencing? Reply Robyn Weisman  2017-03-28 18:54 It just no longer works unless it's in safe mode. I realize a third-party app is probably causing it, but I hadn't added anything since before the update, so it's a problem for me... Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-03-30 11:10 If Time Machine is not working, you should probably erase the drive and start over. Time Machine is very complex. It's rather fragile and subject to corruption from time to time. That's not a function of the operating system but rather the vagaries of the hardware and software involved. Reply MJS  2017-03-28 15:32 10.12.4 broke the pdf's my CPA sends for taxes. They are password protected, and entering the password leaves then blank. The wrong password gives an error. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-28 19:11 Interesting (and depressing) that there are new bugs too. Encrypted PDFs are relatively uncommon, so it's possible that Apple isn't paying close attention there. :-( Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-03-29 00:22 I hope you backed up your 10.12.3 system before you updated. Blind faith in Apple updates is the hight of foolishness. You should always leave yourself a path to restore your system when an update doesn't work for you, for whatever reason. Reply Andrew Malis  2017-03-29 11:22 Have you tried using Acrobat Reader DC to display the encrypted PDFs? Reply Steve Nicholson  2017-03-29 23:22 I've been holding off on upgrading to Sierra mostly because of the PDF issues. Since the TidBITS crew uses them so extensively I'm waiting until I hear you say that the PDF implementation is working well enough before making the switch. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-30 10:41 We've been using Sierra since day one with no trouble, but a lot of our PDF production process relies on Acrobat and PDFpen, neither of which use Sierra's PDFKit. Nor have the problems (which are real, don't get me wrong!) caused a lot of customer support problems for us. And finally, developers tell me that they have mostly worked around all the problems in their apps. I'll have more on that shortly. So I wouldn't avoid Sierra because of the PDF problems. It may not give you enough benefit otherwise, but that's a different issue. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-03-30 11:21 It might be advisable to stick with El Capitan until the PDFkit issues have been resolved if that's important to you. There are a lot of features in Sierra, like Siri, that most people don't even use. I'd be interested to know, Adam, what new features in macOS 10.12 you actually use. Of course Sierra is more secure than any previous Mac OS and depending on the circumstances, that alone might be a reason to upgrade. Personally I've found Sierra to be quite stable but I don't do a lot with PDFs beyond reading them. Except that Siri doesn't work; I haven't been able to figure out why. But I don't need her anyway. It seems to me that Siri may be more useful on an iPhone where using the keyboard is more challenging than on a computer. My Apple Bluetooth keyboard is the best keyboard I've ever used. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-30 12:00 I don't think I rely on much that's specific in the operating system. I upgrade mostly because of the dependencies, such as for the latest version of Photos. My take is largely that the operating system exists to support the apps I use to get my work done. Reply Nicholas Croft  2017-04-01 01:04 I've found the ONLY way to GUARANTEE a problem-free Sierra is to do a clean build. (I support nearly 1000 Macs, across several companies of varying size and complexity). By all means, do a CCC backup of your current system (to an external drive). The main 'consequence' of a CLEAN build (non migration assistant) is not having access to any previous keychain items, so you'll have to do a pre-flight check of your important passwords. (Or boot into the clone to retrieve). And, have all your app installer(s) to hand. Doing a drag and drop of your "big" folders - music, pics, desktop, documents is easy. I *suspect* the culprit of 'bad' Sierra installs is previous migration assistant(s), you may have gone from 10.5 to 10.6x, to another (several?) mac(s), all the way through to 10.10.11 . Somewhere along the way you've 'inherited' some pre-haswell code - like, say, Perian - which does not 'understand' how to get along with aggressive c/p-states - deep sleep and so on. But that's speculation. Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

The company’s potential suitors included many companies, which make computer peripherals such as Western Digital, Micron Technology, South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix, Broadcom and even U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake Partners. Now, tech giants Apple, Amazon and Google have also joined the bidding race for the unit, Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported Saturday, according to Reuters.  Read: Japan’s Pension Fund Sues Toshiba Toshiba shareholders had agreed after a highly contested vote to split the company’s NAND flash memory business. The company aimed to raise at least 1 trillion yen ($9 billion) but has been reportedly offered 2 trillion yen already. The valuation of Apple and Google's offers couldn't be ascertained but, according to reports, at least 10 bidders are interested in buying the microchip operation. "We are not sure if a deal will happen and note the Nikkei reported there are 10 bidders. But if it were to, we believe the key positives for Broadcom could include: 1) successful track record integrating acquisitions, 2) delivers on (earnings per share) accretion targets, and 3) big expansion of their total addressable market," UBS analyst Stephen Chin told the Investors’ Business Daily on Friday.  Read: Canon Buys Toshiba Medical Imaging Unit According to Fortune, Toshiba is asking potential bidders whether they intend to resell their stakes in the plant and will take a final decision on the sale in the shareholders' meeting in June. Toshiba bought Westinghouse in 2006 for $5.4 billion but it is facing problems over its U.S. nuclear business. The U.S. government has guaranteed $8.3 billion in loans to the company to finance the construction of four reactors.

Users who’ve been granted early access have seen a small spaceship icon appear on their Facebook app. WhatsApp tricks – 10 amazing things you didn't know you could do Friday, 10th June 2016 LOVE WhatsApp? Here's 8 top tricks that to make to a master of messaging. 1 / 11 The spaceship icon has popped up beneath the search bar, lining up alongside the traditional notifications tab. Clicking it takes users away from their traditional timeline of friends’ messages and image uploads, to a new Explore feed. The Explore section, as its name suggests, offers a feed of content from sources you don’t actively follow. Instead, Facebook generates the list of content based on things it believes you’ll be interested in. GETTY Using extensive algorithms, it does this by looking at your personal preferences and content that both you and your friends have previously deemed worthy of a thumbs up ‘Like’. The more you use and engage with the Explore feed, the more the service will refine the sort of content you’re presented with, learning your likes and dislikes. Facebook hopes the move will open users to new content and prevent them being endlessly exposed to the same sources. So far, the icon has only been seen on select iOS devices. Facebook has yet to confirm when the new Explore feature will be rolled out to the masses. The new Facebook feature has appeared just days after a clever new Facebook hack emerged. The sneaky feature lets users read direct Facebook messages without the sender ever knowing. By dodging those pesky read receipts, users can avoid awkward conversations by claiming they’ve not see the message. To make use of the feature you’ll need to download the Unseen Google Chrome plug-in.

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

Previous Story FBI releases 9/11 Pentagon photos Next Story Google, Amazon eye Toshiba's chip unit: report By AFP Added 1st April 2017 09:49 AM Print A A A Fill in your Name and Email Address to receive a Free Newsletter Toshiba shares jumped more than five percent on Friday after local media reported that bidders included Apple, US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom. Google and Amazon joined a list of potential buyers eyeing Toshiba's lucrative memory chip business as the Japanese conglomerate seeks bidders to cover huge losses, a newspaper said Saturday. Toshiba has reportedly completed the first round of bidding for its prized memory chip business, seen as key for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around. Some 10 foreign companies and funds, including Google and Amazon, tendered bids, the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said, quoting unnamed sources. The two US tech giants are expected to use Toshiba's memory chips for their cloud services, the daily said. Taiwan's Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, has apparently bid more than 2 trillion yen ($18 billion), the daily said. Immediate confirmation of the report was not available. Toshiba shares jumped more than five percent on Friday after local media reported that bidders included Apple, US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom. Toshiba is expected to negotiate with individual candidates this month. Local media said any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba's memory chips. Toshiba is the world's number two supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea's Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67 trillion yen in revenue last fiscal year. The news report came after angry investors lambasted Toshiba executives at a shareholders meeting over its warning that annual losses could balloon to more than $9.0 billion. The red ink is largely tied to huge cost overruns and construction delays at its US nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection late March.

Toshiba shareholders on Thursday agreed to split off its NAND flash memory business, paving the way for a sale to raise at least $9 billion to cover U.S. nuclear unit charges that threaten the conglomerate’s future. The Yomiuri newspaper said bidding prices from Apple, Amazon or Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, were not known. The Nikkei business daily reported on Friday that U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake Partners and U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd have offered Toshiba about 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) for the unit. About 10 potential bidders are interested in buying a stake in the microchip operation, a source with knowledge of the planned sale told Reuters earlier. Suitors include Western Digital Corp, which operates a chip plant with Toshiba in Japan, Micron Technology Inc, South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc and financial investors. Toshiba officials were not immediately available for comment.

First and foremost, I absolutely love the taste of morel mushrooms. I don’t care if you fry them, bake them, sauté them or whatever; they taste incredible. Secondly, mushroom hunting is something the whole family can participate in together. My girls aren’t to good at sitting still and keeping quiet. Luckily, mushrooms won’t spook at the screech of a little kid like a deer or turkey will. Walking through the woods is my favorite type of exercise, and after months of winter inactivity, it feels great to get out and stretch your legs in early spring looking for mushrooms. You never know what else you might find — deer antlers, turtle shells or even Native American artifacts. Good areas to look for morel mushrooms include south-facing slopes, around fallen logs and certain types of trees. South facing slopes are prime spots early in the season because they warm up first. Decomposing logs are generally worth a second look. If you have any elm and/or ash trees on your hunting grounds, be sure to finely comb those areas. Apple trees, especially in apple orchards, are always worth a look and are often hot spots. A few tools of the trade include a walking stick, a knife and a mesh bag. Walking sticks are important because they allow you to scoot leaves and brush around without having to bend down. I don’t know the science behind it, but experts say to use a knife to cut the morels off at the stem instead of pulling them completely out of the ground. Supposedly this helps them regenerate. A mesh bag sort of works the same way. The theory is a mesh bag allows spores to fall from the mushrooms as you walk through the woods, thus spreading the bounty for future years. A good Google Earth map of the area you’re walking is a good idea, too, so you can mark finds and return for years to come. One of the best meals I have ever eaten is a combination of grilled wild turkey breasts covered in sautéed wild morels with a side of pan-fried crappie fillets. Thankfully, these seasons overlap. Turkey season is right around the corner, and fishermen are already busy filling live wells with crappie. These fine-tasting panfish are heading into shallow water to spawn. Any of the major reservoirs and most farm ponds in Indiana are primed to give up good messes of crappie right now. Floating a minnow under a bobber near shore or pitching jigs will work. If you keep working a bank, especially one comprised of pea gravel, you should find a school of fish. Once you do, it shouldn’t take too long to land a limit. Soak morels in a pan of salt water. This drives out any insects that might have been calling the mushrooms home. Once your fillets are crackling in oil, drop your mushrooms in hot pan of butter. In just a few minutes, two of nature’s finest treats will be ready for you to enjoy. See you down the trail … Brandon Butler writes a weekly outdoors column for the Daily Journal.

Insider Access Stallion Sphere Advertise Video Forum Contact Menu Home USA Canada Australia New Zealand UK / IRE Europe Third round of the Blue Chip Matchmaker 07:59 PM 01 Apr 2017 NZDT Comment (...) Tweet Share Email Print Back to Home page Shesjustadelight N Mike Lizzi Photo Bedroomsconfessions Mike Lizzi Photo YONKERS, NY, Friday, March 31, 2017-- Yonkers Raceway's Blue Chip Matchmaker offered up Round 3 Friday night (March 31th), with another trio of $40,000 divisions for quite superior--and quite soggy--- harness racing pacing mares fighting a persistent, wind-driven rain. The third round's first division saw Bedroomconfessions (Scott Zeron, $3.80) repeat as an odds-on winner. Leaving from post position No. 5, Bedroomconfessions eschewed an early three-hole to take the lead from Krispy Apple (Brett Miller). The fave held sway (:29.1, :58.2, 1:26.4, 1:55.1), helped out in no small measure when second choice Mach it a Par (Jason Bartlett) violated the 'shortest distance between two points' theory and drifted drastically through the lane. Bedroomconfesssions took advantage of that detour to win by a nose, with Krispy Apple, Tessa Seelster (George Brennan) and For the Ladies N (Tim Tetrick) rounded out the payees. Throw in an outrun Quick Draft A (Mark MacDonald) and the six-pack finished in ascending parimutuel order. For Bedroomconfessions, a 5-year-old statebred daughter of American Ideal co-owned (as Alagna Racing) by (trainer) Tony Alagna and Riverview Racing, it was her fourth win in seven seasonal starts. The exacta paid $4.80, with the triple returning $8.10. The second event saw Regil Elektra (Bartlett, $.40) negate her outside post No. 6 and last on the lead (:28, :58.2, 1:27.2, 1:56.2). She took over from pole-sitting, 3-2 choice Empress Deo (Matt Kakaley), then found the wire in time, beating a first-over Betabcool N (MacDonald) by a half-length and a from-last Mackenzie A (Jordan Stratton) by a length Empress Deo and Change the Rulz N (Brennan) settled for the remainder, while a second-over Sandbetweenurtoes (Miller) was last among the six-pack. For third choice Regil Elektra, a 7-year-old daughter of Mach Three owned by Fred Monteleone Stable and trained by Keith Armer, it was her fourth win in eight seasonal starts. The exacta paid $41.60, with the triple returning $135. Friday night's final Matchmaker grouping had Shesjustadelight N (Ron Cushing, $4.70) join Bedroomconfessions and Regil Elektra as two-leg series winners. Away from third post No. 2, Shesjustadelight N watched as 4-5 fave Medusa (Kakaley) hop over Diva's Image (Joe Bongiorno) and lead the way (:29, :59.4, 1:27.4). Shesjustadelight N moved to challenge just as Diva's Image was ending her evening, the former maintaining the momentum to win by a length in 1:56.4. Sell a Bit N (Stratton) couldn't match strides with her tow but did get into second at 25-1, with Medusa fading to third. Small checkers Lispatty (MacDonald) and Diva's Image, then a trailing Al Raza N (Bartlett) rounded out the order. For second choice Shesjustadelight N, a 7-year-old Down Under daughter of Bettor's Delight co-owned by her driver & Kevin Sywyk and trained by Heidi Gibbs, it was her second win in five '17 tries. The exacta paid $68, with the triple returning $107.50. Round 3 of the George Morton Levy Memorial Pacing Series goes Saturday night (Apr. 1), with four, $50,000 divisions. YONKERS’ SATURDAY PICK 5 FEATURES $3,900 CARRYOVER A friendly reminder from Yonkers Raceway that Saturday evening’s (Apr.1st) Pick 5 wager starts with a carryover of $3,906.44.   The Pick 5 is a 50-cent base wager comprising races 7 through 11 (for programs with at least 11 races…if not, then it goes as races 6 through 10).  It has no consolation payoff, meaning if no one selects all five winners (as was the case Friday night), the entire pool (minus takeout) moves to the next racing program.

My wife and I decided about six weeks ahead of time to head up to New York City for the Islanders game with a couple of our friends. This was my first trip travelling with the Preds, and my fifth or sixth trip up to NYC. We went up Friday afternoon, so we had approximately three full days to sightsee. It worked well, as my wife had never been to NYC, so we did a lot of the major tourist things you would do on your first trip. As promised, here's my Fanpost version of the OTF Travel Diary: Big Apple Style! The City We stayed in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, about ten minutes from the Barclays Center. It's very reminiscent of East Nashville: a lot of independent little coffee shops, bakeries, and eateries, with some older established places throughout. The neighborhoods are made up primarily of little brownstone-type apartments; this is a picture of the apartment we booked through VRBO: It's a nice little area, and pretty safe too; we arrived back in the neighborhood around 11pm more than once, and never had an issue with walking the two blocks back to our apartment. Having said that, there is a stretch of Atlantic Avenue (one of the main thoroughfares that runs through Brooklyn and where the Barclays Center is located) that I would definitely not walk through after dark. We were thinking about walking the mile or so to the BC on Monday evening, but decided against it after we saw what we would be walking through as we Uber'd to downtown Brooklyn on Sunday morning. I won't give you a blow by blow of what we did, but here are some highlights: Grand Central Station - it can be very confusing if you're actually trying to board one of MTA's subway lines, but go see the terminal proper. A great people watching place, it's one of the great architectural spaces in the city. Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island - a must if it's your first time; one of the great symbols of America combined with a wonderfully fascinating history tour at Ellis Island, these two alone will take up half a day, if not more. We took the first ferry at 9am, didn't get back to Battery Park until 4pm, and we STILL had exhibits on Ellis Island that we didn't get to explore. Pro tip: if you want to go up to Lady Liberty's crown, you'll need to get tickets like 6 months in advance. If you can't get those, however, get the Pedestal tickets. The view of Lower Manhattan from the Pedestal is definitely worth it. 9/11 Memorial, Museum, and One World Observatory - I can't say enough about this. Do it. It's an emotionally wringing experience, but it's a beautiful museum that pays poignant tribute to those who died that day. I'll offer this advice: do these three in the order listed above. The memorial outside the museum is powerful, and it adds a little extra umph later on as you walk through the museum. One World Observatory is great to do last, as it will provide good respite from the gravity of the museum and stands as a tribute to how the city and the country moved forward. Empire State Building - if the Statue of Liberty is the first thing people think of when they think of NYC, then the Empire State Building is probably #2. The art deco style of the building is really incredibly to see, and while One World Observatory is higher in terms of sheer elevation, the view of Midtown from the Empire State Building is really great. However, if you want a truly incredible view go to the Top of the Rock at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. You get the same view of Midtown, plus a view of the Empire State Building, plus a great view of Central Park. Still, go just so you can say you've been there. Rockefeller Plaza & St. Patrick's Cathedral - really cool if you're a TV fan like myself. We didn't get to do the NBC tour this time around, but I've done it on a past trip and it's really a lot of fun. St. Patrick's is probably one of the most well-known cathedrals in all of the U.S., and it's worth it to carve out 30-45 minutes to walk around the interior. The Food Worth the trip across town solely for these restaurants: John's on Bleeker Street - this place has been around since 1929. Unlike a lot of pizza joints in NYC, it doesn't serve slices, only whole pies cooked in a coal-fired brick oven; come ready to eat. The booths are cramped, (spoiler alert, space to stretch out in NYC is not common), but the pizza is amazing. This is the one restaurant I visited on this trip that I have visited in the past. It's that good. That right there above is a pie with sliced homemade meatballs, ricotta, basil, and chopped garlic. Just typing that makes me do this: Bamonte's is a little different; don't get me wrong, the food is still really good, although not great. It's primarily a red sauce establishment, and trends more along the lines of what you might get if your friend's Italian grandmother was cooking for you. Having said that, you don't go for the food so much as you go for the experience. This place has been open literally since 1900. It's old school. We're talking waiters in tuxedos, towels draped over their arm, not letting you poor your own wine or San Pellegrino, and shouting at each other in the kitchen in Italian. And the dining room: Oh, baby, the dining room. It's like stepping back into the 1950's; in fact, it looks like one of the restaurants straight out of Goodfellas. The Sopranos actually filmed scenes here for a handful of episodes. Speaking of Goodfellas and Tony Soprano, this place has legit mob ties. Anthony Rabito, a consigliere for the Bonanno family, was banned from visiting Bamonte's (among other establishments) when he was released in 2009 because of its reputation for being such a hot spot for the mob. It's a place you should visit for the atmosphere and the people, and the food is pretty good to boot. The pic above is not from our visit, but is a great view of the dining room and the glass walled kitchen at the back. Plus, each table has a button that you push to summon the waiter. Guess who has two thumbs and was totally oblivious to that while he was there? Shake Shack (easy to find since there are so many around the NYC area) Locals refer to this as one of the best burgers in town. I was skeptical, but it is very, very solid. I don't know if it beats a place like The Pharmacy or Burger Republic, for example, but it comes close. If you go, get the SmokeShack; the roasted cherry peppers elevate this one to another level). If you can, go to the original location in Madison Park. It's an outdoor only seating area, and it's beautiful, especially at night. Great if you're in the area, but don't trek 45min for here: Brooklyn eateries: Lula Bagel, Bagel Pub, and Domo Taco all are great small local joints in Brooklyn (specifically the Crown Heights neighborhood); if you're in the area, definitely check them out, but I wouldn't put them in the same category as the three above prior mentions. Try the spearmint lemonade at Lula Bagel along with one of their fresh grilled sandwiches, the mango blueberry salsa at Domo Taco on a lemongrass chicken quesadilla, and a hand rolled bagel along with your favorite flavored cream cheese from their plethora of choices at Bagel Pub. The Arena If you take the subway to Barclays, you'll come up the stairs and be greeted with this: Needless to say, this was pretty cool. It's very evident the place wasn't built with hockey in mind; if you pay any kind of attention to the league in general, you're probably aware of this. Just for poops and giggles, though, here's proof: Yep, that jumbotron is over one of the blue lines. Yeesh. Some random observations: Stats boards are awesome. They have stats above the jumbotron that shows who's on the ice, how many shots, goals, and assists they have, and their current time on ice counter. Which leads me to this: WE NEED TOI STATS AT BRIDGESTONE. It was so nice having that info readily available, but as my friend who works in sports TV production pointed out, it's likely a result of it being a basketball arena first and they are just using what they already have available. That may be the case, but how about these separate smaller boards with additional stats on them? Surely they could add a couple of smaller ones like this to the Bridge's rafters: Either way, I'd say the Preds fanbase is on the whole a somewhat casual (but maturing) one, and TOI might not be of interest to everyone like it would be me (or most of you reading this). The fans for the most part were nonchalant; we had a couple sitting in front of us who were friends of Tony Bitetto's family and we were talking with them back and forth through the night. A couple dropped some "F*** NASHVILLE" in our direction after the game, but it came across more as frustration at the Isles than any animosity towards us. Concessions are much better than at Bridgestone, just for the simple fact that THEY HAVE COKE PRODUCTS. That likely doesn't matter much to you, but I can't stand Pepsi. Immediate points for that. Besides that, Barclays has, in my opinion, better quality, if not more diverse, options than does Bridgestone. Their concourse is a little more claustrophobic; Bridgestone's openness is one thing I didn't realize I take for granted: Merch: I always love to get a shot glass from every place I visit, so I was disappointed when the pro shop didn't even have those. There's a lot of clothing and hats, but I found it to be a little lacking in things that didn't fit into those two categories. I suspect part of it has to do with the fact that they have to share the shop with the Nets. I think they shuffle everything around for each team, as everything Nets related was kind of haphazardly stowed in the back third of the store. Attendance was sparse in some of the upper sections, but I'm pretty sure those were the limited view seats. In case you're not aware, because it was constructed first and foremost as a basketball arena, there are seats in Barclays that don't have a clear sightline to the ice. Most of the empty sections were on this end of the arena; however, a Monday night game against a lesser known Western conference opponent might have also contributed to this. This made it even more impressive to me that the Blue and Orange Army had their seats in the upper sections on this side (that's them holding the flags between sections 228 & 229 at the top of the above pic). They're basically the equivalent of Section 303, but my experience that night was that they weren't quite as organized. They tried to get chants going, but it was not a raucous crowd until like the last 3 minutes of the game when they were trying to tie things up. I'd be interested to see how crazy that place gets against a divisional rival. Goal celebrations: I don't care what anyone says, the "YES!" chant after an Islanders goal is one of my favorite goal celebrations in the NHL, maybe even more so than Preds fans alerting the opposing goalie to his recent shortcomings. Between periods: It's interesting to see what other teams do during intermission; Islanders fans reeeaaallllly love their t-shirt cannons. However, one thing they did in addition to said cannons was host a mobile game called Hockey Flick: People could log in on their phones and play on the Jumbotron against three other players in front of the whole arena. I kind of missed the live music and on-ice happenings at Bridgestone, but I really liked the mobile game on the tron. They also played quick scoring recaps of other games going on that night, which is something I really like, especially this time of year. Again, I understand why they don't do it at Bridgestone with the band playing, but I feel like there's always a few extra minutes after the band is finished where they could squeeze in relevant highlights, say from the division or other playoff teams in the conference. Here's a short video: In the video above: the obligatory "I hate Chicago" that must go with every Preds article. Post game: there's a Shake Shack right across the street from the BC; go grab a shake after a game to let the foot and subway traffic die down. Overall, Barclays was a very interesting experience. It was cool to see the team on the road, and to experience another fan base's "home game." Barclays is clearly not a hockey arena, and I kind of feel for the fan base as they're between a rock and a hard place right now, especially since the rumors are that the arena isn't going to renew their agreement with the team after the 2019-2020 season. However, a trip to NYC is ALWAYS time well spent (even if your feet do end up sore more days than not) and seeing a revitalized Brooklyn was a great time (so different from my other NYC trips!) If you have a chance over the next couple of years to see a hockey game at this unique arena, I would highly recommend it. If you do, though, here's one last tip that I learned the hard way: never fly through LaGuardia. LaGuardia sucks a big fat puck.

(It’s) good for the business, our shareholders and customers; if ultimately we are able to positively impact the environment in the process, that’s a win too.” Bloomberg News Apr 1, 2017 (…) Many of America’s biggest corporations, including Apple and Walmart Stores, are sticking by their pledges to fight climate change even as President Donald Trump guts his predecessor’s environmental policies. Companies say their pledges, coordinated by the Obama administration, reflect their push to cut energy costs, head off activist pressure and address a risk to their bottom line in the decades to come. “This work is embedded in our business,” Walmart spokesman Kevin Gardner said in an email. It’s “good for the business, our shareholders and customers; if ultimately we are able to positively impact the environment in the process, that’s a win too.” Walmart was one of 81 companies that promised to reduce emissions in the run up to the 2015 Paris global climate negotiations. The company upped its targets last November, saying it would get half its power from renewable sources by 2025. Trump signed an order Tuesday that tells the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider former President Barack Obama’s climate rules, and rescinds a series of orders Obama issued to embed consideration of climate change in government actions — from where to lease buildings to whether to allow oil pipelines to be built. “Most big companies in the U.S. recognize that climate change is real,” Geoffrey M. Heal, a professor at Columbia Business School, said in a telephone interview. “They need to move ahead on the climate change front no matter what Trump’s government does.” Business’ biggest lobbying force supports Trump on this issue. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce welcomed Trump’s order, calling that shift “vital to stimulating economic growth.” The group argues that Obama’s regulations held back economic growth, preventing business owners from constructing needed pipelines, roads and other infrastructure. It also warned that the climate push would lead to a jump in energy prices. But many of the group’s members and other corporate titans supported Obama’s Clean Power Plan, or have set their own goals. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest beer-maker, also announced Tuesday that it would get 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Nearly 90 companies have made similar pledges, according to the Sierra Club. “We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted,” General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt wrote in an internal blog post shared by the company. “We hope that the United States continues to play a constructive role in furthering solutions to these challenges, and at GE, we will continue to lead with our technology and actions.” Mars, the maker of M&M’s, committed to eliminating its emissions entirely by 2040. Andy Pharoah, vice president of corporate affairs, said that Mars is “disappointed the administration has decided to roll back climate regulations.” Technology companies including Apple, Amazon.com, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft also expressed their support for Obama’s policies. “We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation and job growth,” the companies said in a joint statement after Trump’s order was signed. Other companies, while stopping short of criticizing the Trump administration, said they would keep pursuing lower emissions in their own operations. Procter & Gamble, Nestle Inc., Ikea, Levi Strauss & Co. and Best Buy Co., which all signed the 2015 pledge organized by the Obama administration, said they still intended to honor their commitments. “We will continue to integrate sustainability into our business practices, operations, innovation, brand building and culture,” said Damon Jones, a spokesman for Procter & Gamble. Many energy businesses welcomed Trump’s rollback. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents oil and natural gas producers, joined the Chamber of Commerce in praising his move. So did the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the Clean Power Plan in court. “People are going to freeze in the dark because of the destruction of the reliable electric power grid under Obama and the Democrats,” Robert Murray, the president and CEO of coal-mining company Murray Energy Corp., said in an interview. “Mr. Trump is doing the right things.” Some environmental groups cautioned that action from the private sector wasn’t enough to make up for the pullback in federal policy. “Policy is going to be required to get us where we need to be,” said Karen Palmer, research director at Resources for the Future.
