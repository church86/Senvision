Are Intel's modems to blame for poor iPhone 7 Plus network reception? by Joe Roberts 21 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments New York-based research firm Cellular Insights, has blamed Intel modems for poor data connections on the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple used Intel's modems in iPhone 7 Plus models sold outside of China, Japan and the US, while phones sold in those countries come with modems made by Qualcomm. Cellular Insights conducted tests using networking equipment which showed iPhone 7 Plus models with both Qualcomm and Intel modems provided similar network performance under ideal conditions. Related: iPhone 7 But, as network conditions deteriorated, iPhone 7 models with Intel modems performed poorer than their Qualcomm-powered counterparts. As the research states: "In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem." This is the first time in five years that Apple has used a supplier other than Qualcomm for its handsets' modems, with Intel gaining a big client for its cellular modem business at a crucial time. The report continues: "We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone. "Considering that the iPhone with the Qualcomm modem is being sold in China, Japan and in the US only, we cannot imagine that modem performance was a deciding factor." In the tests, the Intel-based iPhone 7 Plus models yielded results that were at least 30% worse than the Qualcomm models, and in some cases there was a gap as large as 75%. The upshot is that the Intel phones will have poorer 4G reception than the Qualcomm versions, as well as slower download and upload speeds. For those interested in the technical details, here's Cellular Insight's wording: "At -96dBm the Intel variant needed to have Transport Block Size adjusted as BLER well exceeded the 2% threshold. At -105dBm the gap widened to 20%, and at -108dBm to a whopping 75%. "As a result of such a huge performance delta between the Intel and Qualcomm powered devices, we purchased another A1784 (AT&T) iPhone 7 Plus, in order to eliminate any possibility of a faulty device. The end result was virtually identical." If nothing else, the research is a reminder that, as the report puts it "OEM's implementation of baseband, RF front-end and the antenna design could play its role" in poor network reception, and network providers aren't always to blame.

October 22 AAPL: 116.60 -0.46 Research team develops portable iPhone-powered lab that can detect cancer with 99% accuracy Chance Miller - 3 weeks ago @ChanceHMiller iPhone Health View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit It’s no secret that Apple has ambitious plans for iPhone and Apple Watch in the health industry, but it’s not the only company looking for ways to integrate smartphones in the medical field. Recently, a research team from Washington State University, under the leadership of assistant professor Lei Li, developed a portable laboratory that’s powered by a smartphone and capable of detecting cancer nearly instantly… Announced on Washington State University’s website, the laboratory is able analyze up to eight different samples at once, giving it unprecedented accuracy. Li says that the portable laboratory is able to detect human interleukin-6 (IL-6), a known biomarker for lung, prostate, liver, breast and epithelial cancers. It works with a spectrometer analyzing the amount and type of chemicals in a sample by measuring the light spectrum. Li’s spectrometer could have a huge impact on cancer detection and research around the world. In addition to being useful at hospitals and clinics in the United States, the lab is portable enough that it can be used around the world in areas where accurate cancer detection is hard to come by. “With our eight channel spectrometer, we can put eight different samples to do the same test, or one sample in eight different wells to do eight different tests. This increases our device’s efficiency,” said Li, who has filed a provisional patent for the work. “The spectrometer would be especially useful in clinics and hospitals that have a large number of samples without on-site labs, or for doctors who practice abroad or in remote areas,” he said. “They can’t carry a whole lab with them. They need a portable and efficient device.” While other smartphone spectrometers exist, the ability to measure up to eight samples at once is what sets Li’s apart. This capability gives it a 99 percent accuracy rate. At first, the device was used primarily with standard lab-controlled samples, but now it is being applied in real world situations. Li has tested his design with an iPhone 5, but is working on an adjustable version that will work with any smartphone. The diagram above offers a more detailed look at how the machine works and how the smartphone’s camera is integrated: More information regarding Li’s research can be read in the journal Biosensors and Bioelectronics.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     KGI: new MacBook Pros and 13″ MacBook next week, iMacs & 5K Cinema Display in 2017 By Christian Zibreg, Oct 22, 2016 Tweet 22 Comments According to revered Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, Apple’s media event next Thursday will serve as a launchpad for a long-awaited update to the aging MacBook Pro notebook lineup, which will see “many” noteworthy upgrades. Apple will also announce a brand new model of the new MacBook with a screen measuring thirteen inches diagonally, Kuo wrote in a note to clients. Some observers think this machine is actually a thirteen-inch MacBook Air with new USB-C ports. As you know, the current Retina MacBook has a 12-inch Retina display. Next-generation iMacs, as well as a rumored 5K resolution display won’t be unveiled at the event because they’re apparently not ready yet. According to the report, the upcoming MacBook Pro refresh will include two models: one with a thirteen-inch screen and the other with a fifteen-inch one. The new machines should have an OLED touch bar replacing the function key row with programmable shortcuts that change from one app to another, Touch ID sensor (likely integrated into the power button), USB-C, Thunderbolt 3 and the same low-profile keyboard with butterfly mechanism like the new MacBook, among other features. The OLED touch bar would be controlled by a new dedicated chip which Kuo claims bears resemblance to the processor that powers the Apple Watch. From the report: Our new predictions also include: (1) Intel’s (US) Skylake processor; (2) the same panel resolution but better display quality and energy efficiency thanks to an oxide panel; (3) a new option of 2TB SSD storage capacity; (4) adoption of a similar processor as Apple Watch to control the OLED touch bar more energy-efficiently in the new MacBook Pro models; and (5) a Type-C & MagSafe-like adapter rolled out by Apple or a third-party supplier, given positive reviews for the MagSafe charging design. The iMac, Apple’s popular all-in-one desktop, as well as its rumored external display with a 27-inch screen featuring 5K resolution (likely matching the resolution of the 5K iMac) should be expected in the first half of 2017, according to the analyst. We also expect Apple to launch new iMacs (21.5-inch and 27-inch) and Cinema Display (27-inch) in mid-1H17. We cannot say for certain whether Apple will announce the new iMacs and Cinema Display on October 27 as the shipping schedule is not imminent. Although the next iMac and 5K display won’t ship this year, Apple could choose to announce and preview them at Thursday’s event. A few years back, the company previewed the radically redesigned Mac Pro even though the powerful desktop computer wouldn’t start shipping until six months later. Speaking of which, Kuo makes absolutely no mention of any Mac Pro-focused refresh. I hope Apple won’t disappoint its loyal fan base of creative pros who need a powerful desktop, Unfortunately, it’s been increasingly difficult to justify dropping more than three-thousand dollars on the Mac Pro’s three-year-old hardware. The Mac-focused “Hello again” media event is scheduled for October 27 and we will be providing remote coverage of the announcements as they happen.

CAIO MARIZ® Quad Core Kaby Lake doesn’t exist yet 5723alex . Kaby Lake is a crappy CPU. Hope Apple won’t use it. Rolf Bause Yeah, but they are coming in the beginning of 2017. We are waiting for 2 years now with the new MacBooks, without any update, not even a processor update… Might as well wait a few months longer now and at least catch the Intel release cycle. All the other big manufacturers already have Skylake… howcome they are able to do this, and Apple isn’t? CAIO MARIZ® Kaby lake will not support Intel Iris Pro Graphics, so worse battery, they will jump Kaby lake Rolf Bause from what I’ve read they will have an Intel HD Graphics 620… CAIO MARIZ® Less powerful than current Haswell Iris Pro, Broadwell Iris Pro and Skylake Iris Pro Rolf Bause Ok, in this particular case Skylake is probably really the better choice then (what r they thinking at Intel)… But when did this ever happen, that the next gen was worse than the previous? My main point was: Why the hell aren’t they able to synchronize their release cycles better for christ sake? Apple is (as far as I know) Intels biggest buyer of chips… you could really expect better imo. CAIO MARIZ® I don’t know why they can’t synchronize their release cycles with the intel’s ones Jack Wong Other than i5 and 2013 mid MacBook Air, I don’t even remember what is the name of my processors?! Does it really matter? Rolf Bause Yes it does. Jack Wong Would you mind to list one to two benefit of that? Rolf Bause The benefit is that you know if you got the latest technology or not and if you got screwed or not 😉 And you probably have a Haswell btw Jack Wong I don’t really concern about the CPU anymore, how powerful it could be on a laptop. I would rather have 16GB ram, longer battery life and more cheap SSD storage on the Air since the task I am doing the most are just browsing, remote into other computers and word/excel file. I don’t convert video that often. But it seems like Apple doesn’t want to give that 16GB RAM to the MacBook and MacBook Air line… Rolf Bause You don’t need 16GB of RAM for any of this 😉 But in general I’m with you there. The RAM and SSD upgrade option are just ridiculous… it’s pure greed. If Xiaomi develop their Mi notebooks some more (idk, v2-3 or so :D)… I’ll maybe give it a shot and make a hackintosh :D. They give you all these things: removeable ssd, 2nd ssd slot – for half the price. Jack Wong Yes/No, I am trying so hard to utilize the ram usage on the Virtual Box, plugins and browsers… Just like do we need 1TB SSD storage on laptop?! Yes/No, I would be more lazy to organize if I have 1TB storage but like you said… the upgrade price for SSD is ridiculous… I have 8GB ram and 512GB SSD, 256GB originally, but I got really lucky to get a 512GB SSD(pulled from MacBook Pro) from eBay for $375 last year then sold the 256GB for $200. If I want any Mac laptop with 512GB… it would cost me 1.5k+… I guess… I can only have 1 wish for my next laptop, either USB-C chargeable or 16GB ram. Rolf Bause Transcend has some decent SSD upgrades (Transcend JetDrive). 500gb cost a little less than 300 bucks… 1tb around 500. Jack Wong Those are not as fast, no thank you. If there is no new laptop that I can afford/like on this Thurs, then I would get a new battery for the current Air, I will also go for OEM instead of third party. Rolf Bause The PCI-e based ones aren’t as fast… the SATA drives are supposed to be fine. askep3 “The OLED touch bar would be controlled by a new dedicated chip which Kuo claims bears resemblance to the processor that powers the Apple Watch.” This way the main processsor doesn’t have to handle the touch bar! Alan Aurmont So, the lineup: Air is dead Mini will be dead soon It all leads to the following naming: iPad – iPad Pro iPhone – iPhone Pro (next year with iPhone 8) Mac – Mac Pro MacBook – MacBook Pro Now, the size is where I’m not quite sure what’s gonna happen. 13″ MacBook makes it all confusing. Will they revive 11″ and kill 12″? If they do, we may have 11″/13″ MacBook and 13″/15″ MacBook Pro. 12″ alongside 13″ just wouldn’t make any sense.

October 22 AAPL: 116.60 -0.46 Apple continues its focus on fashion, will again sponsor the annual Met Gala Chance Miller - 3 weeks ago @ChanceHMiller Jony Ive Gala Jony Ive at 2016 Met Gala View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The Metropolitan Museum of Art has announced its annual Costume Institute exhibition and gala and Apple again will be one of the sponsors for the event, according to Vogue. The 2017 Met Gala theme will be “Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons.” For those unfamiliar, Res Kawakubo is a prominent fashion design, while Comme des Garçons is her label. Apple sponsored its first Met Gala earlier this year, with Jony Ive serving as a co-chair alongside Taylor Swift. Last year’s theme was a bit more in Apple’s wheelhouse being “Manus X Machina” and focusing on the convergence of fashion and technology. Nevertheless, it doesn’t appear that Apple was pushed away by this year’s more fashion-centric theme. In addition to Apple, Condé Nast, Farfetch, H&M, and Maison Valentino will also sponsor the event, while Katy Perry, Pharrell Williams, and Anna Wintour will serve as this year’s co-chairs. The 2017 Met Gala will take place on May 1st and feature a variety of different clothing pieces from Kawakubo, according to Vogue: The exhibit will feature about 120 Comme des Garçons womenswear designs by Kawakubo, dating back to the label’s first runway collection in 1981, all the way to her most recent shows. The pieces will be arranged by contrasting themes (East/West, male/female, past/present), which touch upon Kawakubo’s fascination with “in-betweenness.” The mannequins featuring Kawakubo’s designs will also be more accessible than ever, as they will be placed at eye-level without any glass or other physical barriers between them and the viewer. Since the introduction of the Apple Watch, Apple has expressed a heightened interest in fashion, working with boutiques around the world to sell its wrist wearable, as well as large department stores like Macy’s. Additionally, the Apple Watch itself was showcased by Vogue two separate times. It’s unclear if Apple executives will again attend the Met Gala as it doesn’t have anyone representing as a co-chair. Last year, however, Jony Ive, Tim Cook, and Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs, were all in attendance. Jony Ive also opened the event with a speech last year.

The report says Apple will be releasing three Mac laptops at the event, a new 13-inch MacBook, 13-inch MacBook Pro and 15-inch MacBook Pro. It goes on to say that Apple will not be releasing a new iMac or Apple External Display this year, and should be expected in the first half of 2017. However, KGI does not know if Apple will be announcing new iMacs or new Cinema Display early at the event, but is confident that they aren’t ready for prime time. If you’re looking for a new Mac mini or Mac Pro, don’t hold your breath as Ming-Chi Kuo does not know or mention the products at all. While KGI says that the new MacBook Pro will pack “many” upgrades, it does not go into detail. It’s not guaranteed that all features will be available across all 13-inch or 15-inch models. If history is any indication, we should expect Apple to pack more features into the larger 15-inch model. Another product that KGI mentions is the new “13 inch MacBook”, a successor to the existing 12-inch Retina MacBook, released back in 2015. It does not specifically mention any updates to the MacBook Air line. Personally, I was looking forward to a 14-inch MacBook as the successor to the 12-inch MacBook. Having two variants of a 13-inch notebook, let alone having the screen size so close to the 12-inch seems peculiar.

Fall Drinks Pumpkin Spice Latte The PSL is by far one of Starbucks’ most popular seasonal beverages. This year marks the PSL’s 13th year; handcrafted with espresso and steamed milk, topped off with whipped cream and a dash of pumpkin pie topping, it’s easy to see why the PSL remains a crowd-pleaser. Salted Caramel Mocha The Salted Caramel Mocha is once again listed on Starbucks’ fall menu, made from a blend of toffee nut syrup and mocha sauce combined with coffee and milk, then topped with sweetened whipped cream, caramel drizzle, and a blend of turbinado sugar and sea salt. Chile Mocha The Chile Mocha joined the PSL this fall to bring a little heat to the spice party. Made with espresso and steamed milk infused with a cocoa and cinnamon powder, topped with a dollop of whipped cream and finished with a sprinkle of Chile Mocha topping, consisting of ancho and cayenne chile pepper, cinnamon, paprika, sugar, and a touch of sea salt. The Chile Mocha is also available as a Frappuccino, or as a coffee-free hot chocolate. A sip for every shade of the season.

Starting Sept. 6, more than 4,600 stores will offer Almond milk as a non-dairy alternative. Nature’s Sweet Nature’s Sweet is Starbucks’ first Stevia-based, zero calorie sweetener. Need Something More? PSL season may be back, but I guarantee you’ve never heard of these drool-worthy fall concoctions. “At the beginning of the season, we saw a lot of excitement around fall flavors, especially after we introduced Starbucks Almond milk,” Sarah Spencer, Starbucks marketing manager said in a press release. “We wanted to tap into our baristas’ beverage artistry by giving them the opportunity to create new fall-inspired drink recipes to share with customers in their stores.” Feast your eyes upon Starbucks’ “unofficial” fall menu created by the baristas themselves.

El CEO Randall Stephenson está transformado a la empresa telefónica de Dallas en un gigante de medios y entretenimiento, y ahora tiene en la mira a uno de los principales estudios cinematográficos de Hollywood y productores de TV. Compartir Twittear Compartir Compartir Imprimir Enviar por mail Rectificar AT&T Inc. está presionando para alcanzar un acuerdo de compra de Time Warner Inc. el lunes, con miras a cerrar la puerta a otros posibles postores, según una persona familiarizada con la situación. Las negociaciones entre las compañías se han acelerado desde que Bloomberg informara el jueves por primera vez que ejecutivos se habían reunido en las últimas semanas para analizar potenciales combinaciones comerciales, indicó la fuente, quien solicitó que su nombre se mantuviera en el anonimato porque las conversaciones son privadas. Parte de la preocupación de AT&T es que otros postores como Google de Alphabet Inc. o Apple Inc. podrían involucrarse, dijo la fuente. La oferta sería por US$ 110 la acción, lo que equivale a US$ 86 mil millones. Comprar Time Warner daría a AT&T – que ya es uno de los principales proveedores de televisión de paga, telefonía móvil e internet de Estados Unidos – programación prémium para ofrecer a sus millones de suscriptores, desde HBO hasta la NBA y Cartoon Network. El CEO Randall Stephenson está transformado a la empresa telefónica de Dallas en un gigante de medios y entretenimiento, y ahora tiene en la mira a uno de los principales estudios cinematográficos de Hollywood y productores de TV. “El mercado está cambiando rápidamente y AT&T quiere ser líder”, dijo Roger Entner, analista de Recon Analytics LLC. Las acciones de Time Warner, el dueño de CNN, HBO y los estudios Warner Bros., subían en la cotización del viernes, avanzando hasta 14 por ciento a US$94,44. Eso da a la compañía una valuación de mercado superior a los US$70.000 millones e impulsa a la acción por encima de los US$85 por acción que en 2014 ofreció sin éxito 21st Century Fox Inc. de Rupert Murdoch. AT&T, la mayor compañía estadounidense de televisión pagada gracias a que posee DirecTV, cayó hasta 4,4 por ciento a US$37,38. Es improbable que Apple presente una oferta por Time Warner, según una fuente con conocimiento de la materia. El jefe de contenido y servicios de Apple, Eddy Cue, analizó la idea de un posible acuerdo con el jefe de estrategia corporativa de Time Warner, Olaf Olafsson, a fines del año pasado y comentó en una discusión en un podio el jueves que era un gran fanático de Home Box Office, propiedad de la compañía. Google no respondió de manera inmediata a la solicitud de comentarios. AT&T y Time Warner declinaron hacer comentarios. “Siempre hemos creído que la combinación de contenido y distribución tiene sentido”, dijo un analista de la industria. Time Warner “ha sido el mayor productor de contenido de películas y televisión. Dada la rápida evolución del universo de distribución, creemos que el poseer contenido podría ser beneficioso”. El máximo ejecutivo de Time Warner, Jeff Bewkes, está dispuesto a vender si recibe una oferta que considere justa, señaló una de estas fuentes. AT&T se ha centrado en objetivos de medios de comunicación y entretenimiento que valgan entre US$2.000 millones y US$50.000 millones, indicaron a comienzos de este mes fuentes familiarizadas con los planes.

In line with long-standing rumors, Kuo believes the highlight of the event will be a redesigned MacBook Pro in both 13-inch and 15-inch sizes, adopting an OLED touch bar and Touch ID sensor, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, and the same butterfly keyboard design introduced on the MacBook in 2015. Kuo also adds several new tidbits to the rumor mix: Our new predictions also include: (1) Intel’s (US) Skylake processor; (2) the same panel resolution but better display quality and energy efficiency thanks to an oxide panel; (3) a new option of 2TB SSD storage capacity; (4) adoption of a similar processor as Apple Watch to control the OLED touch bar more energy-efficiently in the new MacBook Pro models; and (5) a Type-C & MagSafe-like adapter rolled out by Apple or a third-party supplier, given positive reviews for the MagSafe charging design.Beyond the MacBook Pro, Kuo says Apple will also be introducing a "13-inch MacBook," a claim he has shared previously. Rather than being a slightly larger version of the current 12-inch MacBook, however, this is likely to be a MacBook Air, which would align with other rumors claiming that only the 13-inch MacBook Air will be seeing an update with new USB-C ports. On the desktop side, rumors have indicated that Apple is working on updated iMac models with discrete AMD graphics options, as well as a new standalone external 5K display, but Kuo says those products will not be ready until the first half of next year. It is still possible, however, that Apple could announce them at next week's event. We also expect Apple to launch new iMacs (21.5-inch and 27-inch) and Cinema Display (27-inch) in mid- 1H17. We cannot say for certain whether Apple will announce the new iMacs and Cinema Display on October 27 as the shipping schedule is not imminent.Apple's event is being held at the company's Cupertino campus and kicks off at 10:00 AM Pacific Time on Thursday. MacRumors will have full coverage both here on the site and on our @MacRumorsLive Twitter account, and Apple will be offering a live video stream of the event.

Thankfully, we won’t have to endure Apple’s stale and stagnant Mac lineup for much longer. Earlier this week, Apple sent out invitations for a special media event set to take place on October 27. Apple, in typical fashion, hasn’t told us what’s on the agenda but it’s no secret that the event will focus primarily on new Macs. It’s also no secret that the star of the show will be a completely retooled MacBook Pro with a number of snazzy new bells and whistles. DON’T MISS: Google’s new Pixel XL is no match for iPhone 7 Plus in one key area If you’ve been in the market for a new Mac, you certainly won’t want to miss next week’s event. And to get you primed for what will hopefully be some compelling new products, we’ve put together a list highlighting everything we know about Apple’s upcoming MacBook Pro. First things first, the killer feature on Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro will reportedly be the addition of an OLED display panel located towards the top of the keyboard. Rather than expanding the existing keyboard, it’s believed that the OLED panel will be located where the function keys typically reside. This past May, photos purporting to be from Apple’s new MacBook Pro leaked online and, surprise surprise, note the empty space where the function row keys usually are. As to the inherent advantages of such a design, an OLED display on the keyboard would allow the keys to dynamically change to more appropriately fit whatever app you happen to be using. As an illustrative example, designer Martin Hajek earlier this year produced a number of tantalizing concept images which showcase how the feature might operate. The images below, for example, show what the OLED display might look like with Spotify running. These are just concepts, remember, but the possibilities of an OLED display offering up app-specific shortcuts is certainly compelling. All the more intriguing are reports that users will have the ability to customize app-specific shortcuts to their liking. Late this August, the French site Consomac unearthed code from Apple’s Pages app which strongly hints that the shortcuts on the OLED display — which Apple internally calls the Dynamic Function Row — can be tweaked by users. Imagine, for example, selecting a block of text and with the tap of a button instantly formatting it to your liking without having to go sifting through a maze of menus. We would imagine that Apple will have more appealing examples to show us come next Thursday. Another intriguing detail about Apple’s forthcoming MacBook Pro models is that they will have Touch ID integrated into the keyboard itself. This should be particularly useful given that users running Mac OS Sierra can now take advantage of Apple Pay on the web. As for other details, Apple’s new MacBook Pro will reportedly be a little bit thinner than its predecessor, will feature a larger trackpad, and will include a keyboard based on the butterfly mechanism Apple first introduced us to with the 12-inch MacBook. If this particular rumor pans out, expect the keys on the new MacBook Pro to have a slightly larger surface area. Apple touts the benefits of its butterfly mechanism thusly: Traditional keyboards use a scissor mechanism, which tends to wobble around the edges. This creates a lack of precision when you strike anywhere except the center of the key. We needed to reduce key wobbling for a keyboard this thin; otherwise, striking a key off-center could result in the keycap hitting bottom before a keystroke registers. So we designed a unique butterfly mechanism, which is wider than the scissor mechanism and has a single assembly made from a stiffer material — allowing for a more stable, responsive key that takes up less vertical space. This innovative design improves stability, uniformity, and control — no matter where you press on the key. Additionally, don’t be surprised if the trackpad on the new MacBook Pro is completely stationary a’la Apple’s current 12-inch MacBook. As far as ports are concerned, consumers can likely kiss the beloved MagSafe adapter and traditional USB ports goodbye and instead say hello to new USB-C and Thuderbolt 3 ports. While Apple may very well just include one USB-C port, one would imagine that Apple would outfit its Pro notebook with more than just USB-C port. With respect to internals, we can naturally expect to see some great speed and graphics improvements. Specifically, the new MacBook Pros will reportedly house Intel Skylake processors which should make the machines much more power efficient, a welcome perk on a Pro device that will likely be used as a workhorse by many. On the graphics front, don’t be surprised to see a GPU which takes advantage of AMD’s Polaris architecture. Size wise, Apple will reportedly release two MacBook Pro models, one in a 13-inch form factor and another in a 15-inch form factor. While there was some concern that Apple might do away with the headphone jack on its new MacBook Pros, the leaked chasis below should help alleviate any concerns in that regard.   Last and not least, expect to see Apple’s revamped MacBook Pro hit store shelves in 2016, presumably before the busy holiday shopping season kicks off.

Time Warner, una de la mayores fábricas de producción de películas y programas televisivos, decide ponerse así en manos del operador de móviles AT&T, una de las principales empresas que controla el acceso a Internet y a los canales de televisión de pago. La operación está valorada en 108.700 millones de dólares cuando se incluye la deuda. MÁS INFORMACIÓN AT&T pacta la compra de DirectTV AT&T ultima la compra de Time Warner Apple planteó a Time Warner la idea de una fusión Rupert Murdoch hace una oferta por el conglomerado Time Warner Jeff Bewkes, consejero delegado del conglomerado de entretenimiento, llevaba tiempo abierto a negociar siempre que la oferta fuese justa. AT&T valora con su propuesta a Time Warner en unos 85.400 millones de dólares (78.000 millones de euros). En concreto, paga 107,5 dólares por título, a partes iguales en efectivo y acciones. Además asume 24.000 millones de deuda. Así Bewkes procede a forjar la operación empresarial más importante del año, que supera los 66.000 millones que desembolsó Bayer por el control de Monsanto. AT&T, por su parte, mueve ficha para evitar que tecnológicas como Apple o Alphabet le tomen la delantera en un momento crucial y en su mayor compra desde Bell South en 2006. La firma electrónica de Cupertino ya se aproximó a Time Warner hace unos meses. Como hizo Comcast con la compra de NBC Universal, la compañía de telecomunicaciones de Dallas tendrá acceso a cadenas como la CNN, TNT o la HBO. También contará con sus propios estudios de producción de películas y series, con Warner Brothers. Las informaciones que circulan desde el jueves sobre la maniobra de AT&T hizo que el valor de las acciones de Time Warner superara los 85 dólares que puso sobre la mesa Rupert Murdoch hace dos años para fusionarla con 21st Century Fox tras separarla de News Corporation. No se espera que Apple, Alphabet o Fox vayan a mover ficha en esta ocasión. Entre otros motivos, porque AT&T lleva casi tres décadas forjando acuerdos y es por lo tanto con la que mejor encaje tiene. La fusión convertirá la segunda mayor compañía de telefonía móvil de EE UU en un conglomerado de medios y entretenimiento que ofrecerá a la vez servicios de conexión a Internet en los hogares y programas de televisión. El camino lo abrió Randall Stephenson hace un año, con la compra del proveedor de televisión de pago vía satélite DirectTV. Time Warner era el mejor activo que tenía ante sí para cumplir su plan de transformar AT&T. Respuesta a los cambios Las dos compañías llevan un siglo respondiendo a los cambios que viven sus respectivas industrias. AT&T, fundada en 1885, fue partida hace tres décadas para repartir el monopolio de las telecomunicaciones. Pero desde hace unos años, los operadores tradicionales están sumidos en un proceso contrario de consolidación. Cada vez más consumidores consumen entretenimiento a través de sus móviles y de dispositivos en sus televisiones conectados a Internet. La misma combinación se observa en los proveedores de televisión de pago, que lidera AT&T con cerca de 25 millones de abonados. Le sigue Comcast y Charter Communications, que acaba de adquirir Time Warner Cable por 56.000 millones, antigua filial de Time Warner hasta que se separó en 2009. Cablevisión se fusionó también este año con la europea Altice, mientras que Viacom está en conversaciones con CBS para integrar sus respectivas plataformas. Todas estas maniobras entrecruzadas entre operadores de telecomunicaciones y distribuidores de contenido buscan prevenir que los abonados se descuelguen de sus servicios por alternativas más baratas que encuentran en la red como Netflix o Amazon. AT&T, como Comcast y Verizon, será así propietaria del contenido que podrá emitir tanto por la conexión del cable o en los teléfonos móviles. La amenaza de Trump La operación tendrá que ser aprobada por los reguladores. AT&T ya se vio forzada hace unos años a abandonar la compra de su rival T-Mobile USA. Ese bloqueo la obligó a buscar alternativas para poder crecer, integrando otros negocios como el de la televisión y medios digitales. Verizon optó en paralelo por hacerse con AOL y Yahoo. Las nuevas normas para garantizar el acceso neutral a la red dan sentido, además, a la combinación de contenido y distribución. El candidato republicano a las presidenciales, Donald Trump, amenazó este sábado en un mitin de campaña en Pensilvania con bloquear la operación si el 8 de noviembre llega a la Casa Blanca. Considera que este tipo de transacciones “destruyen la democracia”, al concentrar “tanto poder en unas pocas manos”. En este sentido, hizo referencia a la fusión de Comcast con la NBC Universal, que “nunca debió ser autorizada”. AT&T tenía el viernes una valoración de mercado próxima a los 230.000 millones. La operación, sin embargo, provocará que se endeude todavía más un año después de desembolsar 48.500 millones por DirectTV. Su apalancamiento asciende a los 120.000 millones, a los que se suman los 24.000 millones de Time Warner. La compañía tiene ya la tercera nota crediticia más baja. Para esquivar la categoría de bono basura y conservar liquidez, podría rebajar el dividendo a los accionistas.

October 22 AAPL: 116.60 -0.46 KGI: Apple to release new 13-inch MacBook plus two MacBook Pros at next week’s event, new iMac & 5K Display coming next year Benjamin Mayo - 3 weeks ago @bzamayo Feature MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Reliable Apple analyst KGI has published a report on Saturday outlining their predictions for Apple’s Mac roadmap ahead of the media event on October 27th. The report says that Apple will launch three new MacBooks at the event, a new 13 inch MacBook, a new 13 inch MacBook Pro and a new 15 inch MacBook Pro. It goes on to say that new iMacs and the Apple external display will not be shipping this year; those should be expected in the first half of 2017. KGI does not know if Apple will announce early the new iMacs or new Cinema Display (detailed as having a 27 inch panel) at the event, but Ming-Chi Kuo seems confident that they are not ready to release. If you are waiting on a new Mac Pro, then the outlook is still murky: Kuo simply does not mention the product at all. 9to5Mac has previously reported that Apple is developing a new external 5K display with an integrated GPU. The news on what KGI does expect Apple to announce and ship is interesting, three new Mac laptops in total across two product lines. The new Retina MacBook Pro, expected to include Touch ID, an OLED function row above the keyboard and new internals, will be debuting in both 13 inch and 15 inch screen sizes. The new OLED screen panel is mocked up in our hero image above; rumor mill suggests the screen will show contextual commands and shortcuts depending on the currently-used app. A Macotakara report says the new laptops will feature only USB-C ports (backed by Thunderbolt 3) and will not use a MagSafe power connector for charging. The KGI report says the new MacBook Pro will have “many” major upgrades, but does not go into specifics. It is not guaranteed that all the features will be necessarily available across both the 13 inch and 15 inch sizes. If Apple follows tradition, the highest-spec options will be reserved for the 15 inch form factor only. New MacBook Pros are long overdue; the currently-sold models use generations-old Broadwell chips. The other product KGI says is coming is a new “13 inch MacBook”, as a successor to the 12 inch single-port Retina MacBook first released in 2015. By the way, this is not the first time that KGI has said that Apple is developing a 13 inch version of the Retina MacBook. KGI makes no mention of any changes to the MacBook Air line. It would be somewhat strange to have both a 12 inch and a 13 inch Retina MacBook in Apple’s lineup simultaneously as they are so similar. Unfortunately, KGI does not elaborate about what the 13 inch MacBook might bring to the table that the 12 inch does not. Maybe the 13 inch version is more powerful, boasting better internal specs in a slightly larger total chassis. I guess we’ll have to wait and see for Apple to announce these things for real at a media event on its campus this Thursday. If you believe KGI, we’ll see at least three new Mac products shipping by the end of the month including the long-awaited update to the MacBook Pros … which are likely to be the stars of the show. 9to5Mac will have full coverage of all the announcements as they happen.

Time Warner, una de la mayores fábricas de producción de películas y programas televisivos, decide ponerse así en manos del operador de móviles AT&T, una de las principales empresas que controla el acceso a Internet y a los canales de televisión de pago. La operación está valorada en 108.700 millones de dólares cuando se incluye la deuda. MÁS INFORMACIÓN AT&T pacta la compra de DirectTV AT&T ultima la compra de Time Warner Apple planteó a Time Warner la idea de una fusión Rupert Murdoch hace una oferta por el conglomerado Time Warner Jeff Bewkes, consejero delegado del conglomerado de entretenimiento, llevaba tiempo abierto a negociar siempre que la oferta fuese justa. AT&T valora con su propuesta a Time Warner en unos 85.400 millones de dólares (78.000 millones de euros). En concreto, paga 107,5 dólares por título, a partes iguales en efectivo y acciones. Además asume 24.000 millones de deuda. Así Bewkes procede a forjar la operación empresarial más importante del año, que supera los 66.000 millones que desembolsó Bayer por el control de Monsanto. AT&T, por su parte, mueve ficha para evitar que tecnológicas como Apple o Alphabet le tomen la delantera en un momento crucial y en su mayor compra desde Bell South en 2006. La firma electrónica de Cupertino ya se aproximó a Time Warner hace unos meses. Como hizo Comcast con la compra de NBC Universal, la compañía de telecomunicaciones de Dallas tendrá acceso a cadenas como la CNN, TNT o la HBO. También contará con sus propios estudios de producción de películas y series, con Warner Brothers. Las informaciones que circulan desde el jueves sobre la maniobra de AT&T hizo que el valor de las acciones de Time Warner superara los 85 dólares que puso sobre la mesa Rupert Murdoch hace dos años para fusionarla con 21st Century Fox tras separarla de News Corporation. No se espera que Apple, Alphabet o Fox vayan a mover ficha en esta ocasión. Entre otros motivos, porque AT&T lleva casi tres décadas forjando acuerdos y es por lo tanto con la que mejor encaje tiene. La fusión convertirá la segunda mayor compañía de telefonía móvil de EE UU en un conglomerado de medios y entretenimiento que ofrecerá a la vez servicios de conexión a Internet en los hogares y programas de televisión. El camino lo abrió Randall Stephenson hace un año, con la compra del proveedor de televisión de pago vía satélite DirectTV. Time Warner era el mejor activo que tenía ante sí para cumplir su plan de transformar AT&T. Respuesta a los cambios Las dos compañías llevan un siglo respondiendo a los cambios que viven sus respectivas industrias. AT&T, fundada en 1885, fue partida hace tres décadas para repartir el monopolio de las telecomunicaciones. Pero desde hace unos años, los operadores tradicionales están sumidos en un proceso contrario de consolidación. Cada vez más consumidores consumen entretenimiento a través de sus móviles y de dispositivos en sus televisiones conectados a Internet. La misma combinación se observa en los proveedores de televisión de pago, que lidera AT&T con cerca de 25 millones de abonados. Le sigue Comcast y Charter Communications, que acaba de adquirir Time Warner Cable por 56.000 millones, antigua filial de Time Warner hasta que se separó en 2009. Cablevisión se fusionó también este año con la europea Altice, mientras que Viacom está en conversaciones con CBS para integrar sus respectivas plataformas. Todas estas maniobras entrecruzadas entre operadores de telecomunicaciones y distribuidores de contenido buscan prevenir que los abonados se descuelguen de sus servicios por alternativas más baratas que encuentran en la red como Netflix o Amazon. AT&T, como Comcast y Verizon, será así propietaria del contenido que podrá emitir tanto por la conexión del cable o en los teléfonos móviles. La amenaza de Trump La operación tendrá que ser aprobada por los reguladores. AT&T ya se vio forzada hace unos años a abandonar la compra de su rival T-Mobile USA. Ese bloqueo la obligó a buscar alternativas para poder crecer, integrando otros negocios como el de la televisión y medios digitales. Verizon optó en paralelo por hacerse con AOL y Yahoo. Las nuevas normas para garantizar el acceso neutral a la red dan sentido, además, a la combinación de contenido y distribución. El candidato republicano a las presidenciales, Donald Trump, amenazó este sábado en un mitin de campaña en Pensilvania con bloquear la operación si el 8 de noviembre llega a la Casa Blanca. Considera que este tipo de transacciones “destruyen la democracia”, al concentrar “tanto poder en unas pocas manos”. En este sentido, hizo referencia a la fusión de Comcast con la NBC Universal, que “nunca debió ser autorizada”. AT&T tenía el viernes una valoración de mercado próxima a los 230.000 millones. La operación, sin embargo, provocará que se endeude todavía más un año después de desembolsar 48.500 millones por DirectTV. Su apalancamiento asciende a los 120.000 millones, a los que se suman los 24.000 millones de Time Warner. La compañía tiene ya la tercera nota crediticia más baja. Para esquivar la categoría de bono basura y conservar liquidez, podría rebajar el dividendo a los accionistas.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion MacBook Pro 2016 Release Date, Latest Rumors: MacBook Pro on Event, OLED Display Panel, Butterfly Keyboard By Neal A. Lasta Oct 22, 2016 | 12:50 PM Apple fans are eagerly anticipating the latest version of the MacBook Pro. Many are in agreement that the MacBook Pro needs a high order revamp and that a 2016 version is much needed. Because of this, there have been rumors about the MacBook Pro 2016 its specs, features and release date over the past couple of months. Fortunately, there have been news from the Cupertino-based company itself that may indicate the MacBook Pro 2016 will be introduced very soon. Apple has officially sent invitations to its October 27 event. Although many people already know that the event will most likely occur, this time it's truly official. New MacBook Pro on Event Apple, like always, didn't reveal what the agenda for the event is, but the invitations offered clues that point to a MacBook Pro 2016. For example, the title of the event is "hello again," which, theoretically, could mean we're going to see the MacBook Pro again, which hasn't received any key update for the longest time. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit New Features: OLED Display Panel If rumors and reports are true, then one of the most anticipated features of the MacBook Pro 2016 is the OLED display panel which can be found above the keyboard. This doesn't mean that the keyboard size will be expanded due to another panel; rather, the OLED panel will replace where the function keys used to be. There have been leaked photos, such as the ones found here, that show this OLED display panel may be more than just a rumor. In a couple of these photos, one can see that there is an empty space where the function keys are located in a standard keyboard. The OLED display panel is said to offer various types of functions depending on what app is running. For example, if your MacBook Pro 2016 is running Spotify, then the play, back and forward symbols along with the volume bar may appear on the panel. Another leak shows code that indicates the shortcuts that appear in the OLED display panel can be customized by the users. Specs: Butterfly Mechanism Keyboard Other reports indicate that the new MacBook Pro will be much thinner than the previous version. It will also have a bigger trackpad. It will also have a butterfly mechanism-based keyboard. This butterfly mechanism isn't new to Apple keyboards; in fact, it was introduced in the 12-inch version of the MacBook. The MacBook Pro 2016 is also rumored to have USB-C ports, Thunderbolt 3 ports, and much improved performance and speed. The speed and performance upgrades are due to the addition of Intel Skylake processors, AMD Polaris and many more. Previous rumors indicate that the MacBook Pro 2016 will no longer have the headphone jack. But there are leaked images that show that this is not the case; perhaps this is good news to many Apple MacBook users. These are just some of the rumored specs and features of the MacBook Pro 2016 which may be introduced on October 27.

Tuesday, November 15, 2016 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Other Columns  Such is human nature October 23, 2016, Sunday Barry Kee APPLE polishing – currying favour through flattery or obsequiousness – is an old practice. Ever since the first animals set foot on the planet and evolved a hierarchical system, the practice had taken hold. During the Age of Chivalry, court jesters were an integral part of the royal setting. Their specific duty was to provide amusement but, more precisely, to butter their neurotic despots. Monarchs who ruled by divine right expected nothing less not only from fools or jesters such as Wamba in Sir Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe but also the entire retinue of titled hangers-on. The inner sanctum of absolute monarchs adhered to the strictest code of dinduct, decorum and speech. Anyone within this kingly circle who so much as appeared to step on a royal toe, could lose his or her head. “Boss, don’t you think SIX is enough?” During the reign of the Tudors, questioning King Henry VIII’s intention to take wife No. 7 in such brazen manner was a surefire way to commit suicide. Those foolish enough to do it would certainly have ended up suffering the same fate as Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII’s second wife, said to be still haunting the Bloody Tower of London today – with her head tugged underneath her arm. Egotistical medieval dukes, earls and barons demanded just as much adulation from their henchmen, serves and slaves. Even among the gentry, the harsh exploits of the wicked stepmother are legendarily infamous. Apple polishing is especially prevalent in high places and corridors of power. And in the hands of shrewd manipulators, it can work with deadly effect. Human nature being such, people need to feel important and loved. These two great human needs provide fertile breeding grounds for apple-polishing which feeds the human ego in fulfilment of the human need to feel important and loved. The accomplished apple-polishers will invariably get the attention and business of those they suck up to. And the suckers are usually conceited people who never hear anything but praise! According to one account, a student discovered that poor performance might be ignored in proportion to the favour presented to the teacher. As the story goes, in Sumer, an ancient region of Babylonia, the daily life of the Sumerians was well recorded on clay tablets. One day, while smoothening his tablet and copying his lessons for the day, the student appeared to have done something wrong and was repeatedly flogged. In desperation, he asked his father to invite the teacher over for an evening meal. The father agreed – and the teacher was dined and wined and even given a new garment. The scheme worked. As he was leaving, the teacher, beaming from ear to ear, said the boy was already “becoming a man of learning.” Scientists, translating the tablet, refer to this account as the earliest case of apple-polishing – at least 4,000 years ago. Apple-polishing has been variously defined as beggarly, bootlicking, grovelling, slavish and synophantic. A couple of local definitions are tripod and three-legged horse. Another one, coined by an ang tau chendol seller at the old Open Air Market at Power Street, Kuching, consists of three Teochew words. They are impolite to divulge. I will give you a hint – the initials are LPK. The polishers will ingratiate themselves to get what they want such as job promotions, business deals and benefits in some other forms while the polished will purr at each shower of praises, even if delivered in snivelling manner, as it fulfills their need to feel important and loved. The mode of conveyance matters little. Apple-polishing can also be said to be paradoxical – some just love doing it and are so good at it that they move up fast in life while others puke at the mere mention of it and are such a disaster at it that in the boss’s books, they will not get to pass Go nor get out of jail free. On the scale of 10 – by the boss’s reckoning – the opportunity for the latter to attain their full potential will at best hover around one or two. Any further movement up or down the scale will depend on whether or not they choose to continue playing hard ball. In the corporate world, some call it managing up but kissing up is better known. As one of the most intractable problems of corporate culture, kissing up can move the goalposts and alter the playing field. Some of the polished get so intoxicated with the praises showered on them that they hardly notice they are being rolled while the polishers climb the corporate ladder and saw off the rungs behind them. One behaviour analyst sees corporate scandals like harassments, bullying or wrongful dismissals as associated fundamentally with the kissing up culture. The victimised are usually those who know the emperor has no clothes but refuse to cover it up. “Even the biggest CEOs need to be loved. But expecting praises as of right from your subordinates can be like a virus. If carried too far, it will poison your judgement and debase your character,” the analyst said. In Bhutanese society, apple-polishers are categorised into three groups – the shakam (supplier), the omnipresent (yes boss) and the sneaky informer. According Norbu Wangchuk, a Bhutanese writer, the shakam (supplier) will not miss any opportunity to make gifts to the boss. He will know the sixth birthday of the boss’ fourth son. He will also make sure he buys a present for his boss on his return from a visit in Kuala Lumpur. The omnipresent (yes boss) will stick like a leech to his boss. He will be the first to pull the chair for the boss and will wish the boss “good day” a dozen times a day. Wangchuk says: “Shoving aside the personal secretary and the security, he will rush to open car door and straighthen his boss’s kabney (a silk scarp worn as part of the gho, the traditional costume of Bhutan) and patang (a type of Asian sword traditionally produced in Bhutan).” There is nothing he will disagree with the boss over. Black is white and white is black – yes boss, if you say so. Everything the boss does or says is perfect. The omnipresent (yes boss) will gladly exchange his soul  with a place in the boss’s good books. As for the sneaky informer, he is like a serpent which occasionally finds a hole to squeeze himself into the boss’s chamber. “He wields classified information on the conduct and performance of other workers. He thrills the boss with what others in the organisation think of the boss and what they would do and not do. “He will even have access to the thoughts and expectations of his boss’s boss – which comes as a vital weapon for his boss,” Wangchuk adds. The sneaky informer is ably portrayed in movies by thespians such as Hong Kong actor Paul Wei Ping-ao who is adept at playing the typical kan syn (hyprocrite, brown noser, sycophant) on the silver screen. Fortunately, as Wangchuk points out, boss-employee relationships, driven by ulterior motives and hidden agendas, are superficial and soon exposed and weakened because they are based on flimsy foundations which are antithetical to the long-term organisational goals. But if there is a clear understanding of the boss and the employee as being two imperfect and fallible human beings with their own personal and organisational goals, then there is a better chance of approproate relationships being established that will enhance productivity and effectiveness. Wangchuk’s characterisation of the apple polishers fits snugly into the psychological niches of most western and Asian societies, especially in the political arena and from both sides of the political divide, including ours. Running after the higher-ups for favours will only entrench the culture of apple-polishing. This, in turn, will render business communities spineless and retard economies over the long term. A man of lofty principles will not stoop to underhand methods. But not all men – regardless of their positions in society – are endowed with the mettle of staintly righteousness to take the moral high ground and such inadequacy of character gives apple-polishing a strangehold on mankind’s destructive character flaws such as vanity, ego, self-centredness and greed, and allows the practice to perpetuate. For after all, what employee would not relish being the apple of the boss’s eye or what second in command would not love being the blue-eyed boy of the commander in chief – even if it takes apple-polishing to get there. Both genders do it and though the practice is, generally,  looked upon with contempt, even by those being polished, if it’s overdone, it’s still the most favoured weapon used to manipulate and titilate the ego. There are few exceptions, if any. The underlings polish the higher-ups with sugar-coated embellishments, never taking the eye off the pie, while the latter enjoy the polishing, ready to share the pie if it has a generous spread of butter.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Why is the Google Pixel graded on a curve when the iPhone isn’t? Yoni Heisler BGR NewsOctober 22, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share During the original iPhone introduction, Steve Jobs referenced a favorite quote of his from legendary computer scientist Alan Kay: "People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware." This philosophy has formed the bedrock of Apple's business strategy for decades now, save for that brief dark period during the mid-90s when Apple sanctioned an ill-fated Mac clone initiative. Apple's devotion to both software and hardware is part of the reason why the iPhone often outclasses every other smartphones on the market. Undeniably, the ability to fine tune software and hardware to work together seamlessly and efficiently is a huge competitive advantage. That being the case, I've been especially intrigued with the Google Pixel as it marks Google's most serious effort to date to exert strict control over the entirety of the Android experience, from both a software and hardware perspective. We've seen Android flagships before, no doubt, but the Google Pixel was designed by Google from the ground up. DON'T MISS: iPhone 7 Plus vs Google Pixel speed tests: Closer, but Android was still crushed in the end As Google's Rick Osterloh explained to Bloomberg not too long ago, the Google Pixel has Google "managing inventory, building relationships with carriers, sourcing components, making supply chain deals and managing distribution." When reviews of the Google Pixel first started appearing online, I was excited to see if the hype behind the Pixel was real. Because competition is often a necessary component and driver of innovation, I was eager to see if the Google Pixel was a device that could potentially force Apple to step up its game. Most of the Google Pixel reviews I came across where overwhelmingly positive, but I couldn't help but notice that Google's smartphone, in many respects, was being afforded a pass that Apple's iPhone rarely, if ever, receives. Whereas the iPhone is seemingly criticized for minute and arguably petty reasons, some of the Google Pixel's shortcomings were curiously and conveniently glossed over with gusto. Touching on this very point, Rene Ritchie has a great piece up on iMore where he explains how the Pixel was graded by tech reviewers on curiously favorable curve. Remember: Google is a serious player in the smartphone business and the Pixel is priced as a premium handset. Consequently, one would imagine that the Pixel would be held up to the same level of scrutiny as the iPhone. Alas, this was hardly the case. The design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s was lambasted mercilessly, and rightfully so given those unsightly antenna lines. In fact, many even brought up said design as evidence that Apple had lost its innovative edge along with its eye for industrial design. Meanwhile, the Google Pixel borrows many design elements from Apple's 2014 iPhone design and nobody bats an eye. It strikes me as odd that in 2016, an iPhone and an Android phone can look extremely similar and evoke completely opposite sentiments from reviewers. The Google Pixel by and large looks like an iPhone but some reviews viewed this as a positive because it was "familiar."  Meanwhile, if Apple doesn't introduce a groundbreaking new iPhone design every year, it's a sign that there's trouble in Cupertino. So, everyone who'd been criticizing Apple and iPhone design immediately called Google out for aping it? Not so much. Well, at least they called Google and Pixel out for the same things they called Apple and iPhone out for? Again, not so much. Bizarrely, some of the subtle improvements Apple incorporated into the iPhone 7 that were immediately categorized as minor or insignificant are completely missing from the Google Pixel. Ritchie writes: Surely they drew the line at Google's 2016 flagship missing optical image stabilization — not just in the regular-size, but in the Plus XL model as well — stereo speakers, and water resistance — things that were pointed to last year as indicators Apple was falling behind? I'm not saying that Apple should be immune from criticism, but it'd be nice if other companies, especially big players like Google, were held to the same set of expectations and standards that Apple has to live up to. Taking a look at any number of Pixel reviews, Google is given a pass for items that the press would absolutely obliterate Apple for. Read More Take Walt Mossberg's review, for example. Calling the Google Pixel "first rate" and the best Android phone he's ever tested, Mossberg quickly mentions that that the device's battery life was disappointing relative to Google's advertised specs. "It also isn’t water resistant, and is exclusive to only a single carrier, Verizon," Mossberg mentions before quickly moving on. And then there are the Google Pixel headphones. Oh wait, the Pixel doesn't come with any headphones. Speaking of earbuds, there’s good and bad news. The good: Google retained the industry-standard 3.5mm headphone jack. The bad: it doesn’t supply any earbuds for a $649 phone. The company says it assumes everyone has many pairs of buds lying around. I wound up using an old Samsung pair. Can you imagine the vitriolic outrage that would have resulted if Apple shipped an iPhone of any model with no headphones? It's also interesting that Google's new AI feature -- Google Assistant -- is being heaped with praise mostly because of its underlying potential. Google Assistant does seem to be a step up from Siri since it can handle contextual queries much more ably, but is it really that compelling of a feature in its current form? Mossberg writes: Here’s a series of questions I asked about the state where I live, without ever saying the state’s name except in the first question. The Assistant answered every question but one with a vocal reply, and answered all quickly and accurately: — What’s the population of Maryland? — Who’s the governor? — What’s the average household income? — What’s the land area? — Show me the state flag. — What’s the biggest county? I’m pretty sure I could have gone on. When I tried this with Siri, it handled the first one nicely, vocally and with a Wikipedia page. It answered the second by displaying an article defining the term governor. That's a nice perk for the Pixel, but is this really a huge selling point? As far as I can tell, the AI that Viv Software showed off is far more impressive. Besides, there are things that Siri can do that Google Assistant can't do quite yet, like reserving an Uber or Lyft. Still, not everyone was a fan of Google Assistant, as evidenced by this review from Michael Nunez of Gizmodo. I was particularly disappointed with Google Assistant because it’s such a promising concept. Google is moving attention away from the search bar more than ever. Instead, the company wants you to “Google” by using the messaging app Allo or voice search in Google Assistant. Ultimately, the Pixel and Pixel XL are gateways for feeding the Google brain more information about yourself. As Google’s AI gets smarter, the Assistant will become more helpful. While some people might find this creepy, I think the idea is exciting, and it’s a letdown that the tech isn’t there yet. In fairness nobody has it, and Google’s is better than what’s offered by competitors like Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana. The point is that as a whole, smartphone assistants aren’t smart enough to be defining features. They’re gimmicks, and Google unwisely decided to build a phone around one. Meanwhile, another Pixel review on The Verge was quick to call Google's smartphone a "home run." Almost comically, one of the first few paragraphs reads: The Pixel is not waterproof, which is dumb and annoying. I should also note that a very short fall managed to crack the screen on the smaller Pixel during our review. A sample size of one is obviously too small to say that these devices are less durable than they ought to be, but it's not a great sign. All that said, I think it's great that Google released the Pixel. It's nice to see some solid competition in the premium smartphone space from a company not named Samsung. The Pixel seems like a compelling device, but let's be honest, the grading curve for Android is still a whole lot more lenient than it is for the iPhone.

Our Paper Paper Archive Our Apps Daily Horoscope Home News Sport Showbiz & TV Life & Style Travel Tech Pics Casino Gaming Reviews Tech News Home Tech Tech News Apple includes THIS hidden feature in EVERY iPhone - but good luck trying to use it Apple includes THIS hidden feature in EVERY iPhone - but good luck trying to use it APPLE has included an awesome one-handed keyboard in every iPhone – but doesn’t let you access it, according to a report by prominent iOS developer Steve Troughton-Smith. By Aaron Brown / Published 22nd October 2016 GETTY SECRET: Apple has included the redesigned keyboard in your iPhone software since 2014 Apple has bundled a useful one-handed keyboard in every iPhone since the introduction of iOS 8 back in September 2014, according to iOS developer Steve Troughton-Smith. The hidden Apple keyboard is designed to make typing easier for those with small hands and large-screen iPhones. It shifts across the keys in the on-screen QWERTY keyboard to make one-handed typing much easier. The little-known Apple keyboard appears to make reaching across the 5.5inch display a cinch. Unfortunately, there is a major problem with this keyboard – you’ll never be able to use it. APPLE • TWITTER • STEVE TROUGHTON-SMITH ONE-HANDED: The hidden keyboard shifts all of the QWERTY keys to one-side of the screen According to iOS developer Steve Troughton-Smith, Apple has included the helpful one-handed keyboard in the iPhone operating system since 2014, but has never allowed customers to access it. Apple billed iOS 8 as the “biggest change to iOS since the introduction of the App Store” when it launched in September 2014. iOS 8 launched alongside the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus – the first Apple smartphone with a 5.5inch display, so it would make sense for the US technology company to design a keyboard to help those with smaller hands. What makes less sense, is why Apple never decided to make the keyboard available to iPhone owners. Today's fun hack (been there since at least iOS 8); the iOS keyboard has an unused left/right one-handed mode. Activated by edge-swipe pic.twitter.com/zIk7x7CVmu— Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) October 19, 2016 Steve Troughton-Smith claims the only way to access the secret Apple keyboard is to jailbreak your iPhone. However this will void your Apple warranty – so we really wouldn’t recommend attempting it. According to Apple’s website, “iOS is designed to be reliable and secure from the moment you turn on your device. Built-in security features protect against malware and viruses and help to secure access to personal information and corporate data. “Unauthorised modifications to iOS (also known as "jailbreaking") bypass security features and can cause numerous issues to the hacked iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. “Apple strongly cautions against installing any software that hacks iOS. “It is also important to note that unauthorised modification of iOS is a violation of the iOS end-user software license agreement and because of this, Apple may deny service for an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch that has installed any unauthorised software.” EXCLUSIVE: New Apple Store opens in London take a peek inside Thursday, 13th October 2016 APPLE is opening its new flagship store in London and Daily Star Online has had an exclusive tour. 1 / 23 The news comes as a new iPhone prank has been doing the rounds that allows any of your friends to access your phone without ever needing a passcode. The joke works by simply pressing on the home button and activating Apple's personal assistant. Anyone can then ask Siri to send a message directly from the device with the victim left totally unaware anything has happened. As long as you have Siri enabled on the lock screen, and know the names in the iPhone's contact book, the prank works. Worse still, the joke can even be used on Facebook. All any sneaky pal has to do is hit the home button and and ask Siri to update your Facebook status. Then they simply dictate a new post and it will be added to the social media page without ever unlocking the iPhone.

We merely had a cameo of Pepe,’ Treadstone continued. ‘We get banned because it’s a pro-Trump app, but you can have an app only about Pepe and that’s not offensive,'” Nash reports. “In July, Apple’s App Store also rejected a satirical game based on the Hillary Clinton email servers scandal. Apple branded the game as ‘offensive’ and ‘objectionable’ before reversing their decision following a report at Breitbart.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Poor Pepe.

You cannot use the argument that other apps currently in the app store more flagrantly abuse the same copyright. The official response I received was, it doesn’t matter if 1000 similar apps in the app store break , YOUR app appears to use similar imagery to “” and so is rejected. The decision was upheld upon multiple appeals.

They just went along with whoever was pushing whatever agenda. If Donald Trump wants to make America White Again, then Apple should sit on the sidelines and even maybe help kick out anyone that is not a white male citizen unless they belong to a union or the wrong religion. yojimbo007 Friday, October 21, 2016 - 5:41 pm · Reply My view is that its not Apple who should do that… its not their place as a company. every individual though can voice their opinion and place their vote.

FurryOne Friday, October 21, 2016 - 9:04 pm · Reply You forget that the dumbass Conservatives on the Supreme Court ruled that Corporations are People – and people can have opinions – so Apple can have an opinion.

Talk about clueless. Grifterus Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 8:39 pm · Reply I’m aswering sarcasm with sarcasm. Nobody needs permission from anybody. Everybody has the right to comment as anybody wants. And everybody have every right to comment on whatever I or anyone posts. And no, I don’t like Botty because he’s been a rude idiot to me and many people in this forum. He often acts like a troll and he’s never been able to provide a smart answer to anything. And sure, the feeling must be mutual. But regardless, I would defend to death his right to keep posting his opinion, as much as I dislike and disagree with him. Me2Sense Monday, October 24, 2016 - 5:48 pm · Reply “He often acts like a troll and he’s never been able to provide a smart answer to anything.” I guess you flunked grammar class by using absolutes. Wow, are you clueless. And your sarcasm excuse was just that — an excuse no believes. Grifterus Monday, October 24, 2016 - 7:05 pm · Reply Well, allow me to retort. First, let’s correct the absolutes (where I will grant you are correct, and will correct myself): He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM. Better now? It’s not absolute anymore. It’s constrained to the current forum. Speaking of absolutes: “an excuse no believes”…. makes you too a grammar champion. Shouldn’t that be “and excuse no one believes”? Oh, also, wouldn’t that also be an absolute? Because, if no one believes it, that sounds like there are no exceptions, or no cases where someone would believe it. That looks like an absolute to me. Man, who’s more clueless? The clueless guy, or the clueless guy who calls another guy that he’s clueless? Let’s leave it there. This is not worth my time. And I’n sure it’s not worth yours. Let’s call it a stalemate. Would you agree? Me2Sense Monday, October 24, 2016 - 7:25 pm · Reply “He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM.” Provide. You just can’t rid yourself of absolute statements. Botty is much more intelligent, witty and smarter than you. Your partisan HATE blinds you. So sorry. Grifterus Monday, October 24, 2016 - 8:07 pm · Where in my post I mention anything about political parties???? And yes, I had a typo…. And you mention nothing about your own absolutes…. It’s like talking to a rock. Do you want to believe I’m dumb? Please do. I don’t know Botty in person. I think everything he writes… oh, excuse me, I will allow absolutes… everything Ihe wrote that I’ve read is nothing but pure garbage. I see no intelligence there. Now, one man’s opinion doesn’t make the man smarter. Maybe I’m the stupid one and you are the smart one. Because you see it that way, and I see it another way. So… since only one of us can be right, and we will never agree, let’s leave it there. Me2Sense Monday, October 24, 2016 - 8:32 pm · Hey clueless, give it up.

I’d like to stay, but I don’t like what Apple’s doing with the hardware. I know Apple has always been proprietary, but they were never this proprietary.

First 2014, Then 2016 Friday, October 21, 2016 - 5:24 pm · Reply Only one candidate is not beholden to Wall Street, multinationals, and the special interests: Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for and has been for decades. The Trump Plan will retain the existing capital gains rate structure (maximum rate of 20 percent) with tax brackets shown above. Carried interest will be taxed as ordinary income. That is why the Wall Street-, multinational-, and Soros-owned Hillary Clinton is getting massive assistance from the mainstream media (also owned by the establishment) – they want their carried interest deductions to continue.

Dave H Friday, October 21, 2016 - 6:06 pm · Reply I read it before commenting. It’s pie in the sky wishful thinking at best, complete denial of reality at worst. Outside of your little Right-Wing Echo Chamber and the most rural of rural areas Trump just isn’t seen as credible. BTW, where does this “Trump has at least an 87% chance of winning” BS come from? Not that article. Nick Saturday, October 22, 2016 - 2:29 am · Reply It’s funny to hear a leftist talking about an echo chamber. Our culture is soaked and consumed with progressive leftism, it’s not possible for a “right wing echo chamber” to exist. Those on the right are exposed to both sides of the spectrum. Those on the left are living in the mass-media-wide echo chamber, unless they take the effort to see things from another perspective. Most don’t and prefer to condescendingly spit on everyone else while furthering their lies. Whether or not Trump wins, you won’t be safe from the crowds with torches and pitchforks. Dave H Saturday, October 22, 2016 - 4:12 am · Reply That’s your perception, but one I disagree with. You only have to spend a few minutes reading comment boards on the Internet to see there are millions of people out there that living in a Right-Wing bubble. They repeat misconceptions and outright distortions at each other, over and over again until they utterly believe it. “Obama’s a Kenyan”, “The Government forces your kids to become gay”, “They’re going to take our guns”, “Muslims are ALL evil terrorists” etc. That’s your Right-Wing Echo Chamber. It’s another perspective, but one built mostly on ignorance. Me2Sense Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 3:03 pm · Reply You got it backwards. The left-wing echo chamber robots are dumb as a box of rocks. Nick Monday, October 24, 2016 - 3:44 am · Reply Obama’s own publisher called him Kenyan to promote himself as a speaker. The government does propagandize for homosexuality. Islam is an evil religion that promotes anti-semitism, slavery and violence. People may say extreme-sounding things, but they’re based on facts. Don’t compare message boards to all of the major broadcast networks, newspapers, magazines and social media sites, which are ALL globalist-progressive. Yes even FOX News is on the same team as CNN and the New York Times. DavGreg Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:27 pm · Reply You should take your meds. Drumpf is likely to get his ass whipped and the GOP is likely to lose the Senate. Thanks to Republican Gerrymandering they are likely to retain the House, but with a narrower margin. If voter turnout is high it will be better for Democrats and if it is lower it will be better for the Republicans. Dave H Friday, October 21, 2016 - 5:46 pm · Reply It’s about time you changed your name again. Next time go for years when the Republicans might put forward someone electable.

It’s about time you realised that your candidate is that bad. The GOP only needed to put someone electable up and this election was theirs for the taking. Instead the Tea Party types who have infested (yes, infested) the Republicans have put Hillary into the Oval Office. Well done them eh?

And we all know the media, Hollywood, teachers and unions are working overtime in the Dems corner. So if they sadly win, it’s not because they are pure as the driven snow.

DavGreg Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:01 pm · Reply Pepe the Frog is well known to have been adopted as a symbol by the alt-right. The alt-right organized around precepts and values that are against the broad multi-cultural view that is widely accepted and in the mainstream through most of the US and developed world. The inclusion of that symbol in a thinly dusguised game to promote the Drumpf Campaign. Apple was right in rejecting it. If you do not like Apple’s decision, do the free market thing and go buy an Android or Windows phone. Apple is a private sector company and nobody is making you buy their stuff. Derek Currie Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:15 pm · Reply I Guess We Need To Talk About Pepe The Frog …Later, observers began noticing an increase in white supremacist themes in Pepe images — or a rise in Pepe usage by white supremacist accounts. Either way, an association was building. This May, an “anonymous white nationalist” told The Daily Beast that the shift was intentional: a dedicated campaign to “reclaim Pepe from normies,” or members of the mainstream, by making Pepe so culturally unacceptable that only the fringe Internet would dare to use him. Donald Trump had earlier tweeted an image of Pepe-as-Trump, and then his son posted an image on Instagram that included Pepe. Homeandmantel Friday, October 21, 2016 - 11:30 pm · Reply Can’t wait until the election is over and the landslide Hillary captured that the GOP will finally cut ties with the ignorant and racist constituency it has built up over the past decade and a half. Trump will singlehandly turn red states blue after this. The party of stupid has to make a wide turn or die off with all the party senile elderly it clings to as it’s base.

It all started when the young man left the device under some clothes inside, while he was out surfing. Upon his return, he noticed that something was wrong when he saw all the windows black and smoke coming out. Jones recorded the aftermath of the incident that shows a molten iPhone 7 and the car's interior ruined, blaming Apple's gadget for leaving him without a phone and a car at the same time. The young man said that he bought the device just a week before and hasn’t used a foreign charger or dropped it during this time. Apple has yet to make an official statement, but the tech giant is aware of the complaint, which is currently under investigation.

Here's are some tips on how to avoid being caught out. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | October 22, 2016 -- 11:37 GMT (04:37 PDT) | Topic: Apple Apple says its investigation found that 90 percent of Apple-branded goods sold on Amazon are counterfeit. This is in line with my findings a few years ago when I purchased a dozen chargers from Amazon and eBay, all of which were listed as "genuine," and found them all to be poor quality, unsafe fakes. What's Hot on ZDNet Microsoft to replace security bulletin index with database-driven portal High performance computing (HPC): A look at what's next with TACC's Dan Stanzione If you want a MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar, you have to wait until Christmas Researchers claim quantum computing breakthrough, explain it using beer So how do you protect yourself from fake Apple accessories? See also: Every day carry pocket tools and gadgets When it comes to cables and dongles, Apple has a support page with information on what markings to look for and the differences in quality between a genuine product and a fake product. This is useful, but when buying online it doesn't help because you don't get to see the product until it's been delivered, and getting a fake product means having to claim refunds and send products back to the seller, which is a hassle. When it comes to chargers, it's even harder to spot a fake, and Apple doesn't offer any guidance on the matter. The London Fire Brigade has a fun online quiz where you can test your skill at spotting fake Apple chargers (these are UK chargers so they look very different from the US style), but as you'll see if you take the test, it's not easy. So, it's a jungle out there, one where scammers and ne'er-do-wells are happy to make a quick buck from selling you a charger that could burn your house down. Not cool. So what can you do? Here's my advice on staying safe: Only buy Apple-branded accessories from Apple or a trusted authorized Apple dealer. While Amazon is an authorized Apple reseller, it's all too easy to be viewing products that are listed by third-party sellers. Forget eBay. Use of the word "genuine" is usually a dead giveaway for a fake product. If you don't want the hassle of finding a genuine Apple product, then an alternative is to find a decent third-party product. So, for cables you could buy something like an Amazon Basics or Monoprice. For chargers, there are plenty of good third-party options available from companies such as Griffin, Kensington, or Anker. Amazon's own 9W PowerFast charger for the Kindle tablets also makes a great charger for iPhones and regular iPads. When it comes to MacBook chargers, it's best to stick with genuine Apple hardware. If you're using some cheap counterfeit charger, consider replacing it with at least a decent third-party alternative. Must-have iPhone accessories (September...

Reuters With the iPhone 7 only just arriving in users' hands, rumours have already begun to swirl about Apple's 2017 flagship, with many expecting an all-new glass look and impressive processing power. We take a look at what else the new handset could be in line to flaunt. Traditionally, Apple releases an S model a year after the release of an iPhone. However, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone it is rumoured the company is planning to jump straight to the iPhone 8. IBTimes UK takes a look at the design and specs analysts are expecting to see from the 2017 iPhone. Design and Build Apple is said to have reserved some of its best technology developed for the mobile platform in the last few years for the 2017 model, which it has hinted will be a game changer. Popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI securities says the company deliberately did not introduce ground breaking changes in the iPhone 7 range as it will do so in the 2017 iPhone. For the design, Kuo expects that this iPhone will feature either glass or ceramic backs with metal frames, as phones with all-glass chassis aren't currently feasible "given technological bottlenecks." He says one of the key reasons Apple wants to move to glass is that producing the glossy finish that's currently used in the popular jet-black variants of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is difficult to manufacture. Another change that could feature on the 2017 iPhone design is the removal of top bezel of the phone, which houses the ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, the front speaker, and the front-facing camera. The assumption for this design alteration came from an Apple patent that suggests the company is looking to move the front-facing sensors including the speakers underneath the display. Since the iPhone 7 range is already waterproof it is expected the future iPhones will also posses the same technology. Screen and Display For the iPhone in 2017, it's likely Apple will stick to its sizing of 4.7in and a larger 5.5in offering, however it's expected to sport an edge-to-edge display. Reports in January had stated that Apple struck a deal with Samsung Display for a new flexible OLED for the iPhone 7. However, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus did not showcase a flexible display as reported. Could it be that Apple is eyeing this flexible display akin to the Galaxy Edge's curved display for an iPhone in 2017? Other rumours have however pointed towards the company using AMOLED screens for the 2017 model of the iPhone. A recent rumour had hinted that Apple supply chain partner TPK is working on a project to produce a glasses-free 3D display - but even this one is a bit wild to believe. While the exact specs for display are still at contention one feature largely expected to be missing from the next iPhone is the physical home button. Just recently Apple asked iPhone 7 and 7 Plus users to not panic if their home buttons were not working as they had an on screen home button back up. This indicates the company already has the technology but is saving it to introduce it at a later stage. It is expected that the TouchID fingerprint scanner will also be housed within the screen. Processor and storage Apple and chip manufacturer TSMC signed an agreement to work together on a 10-nanometer "A11" processor design, expected to go into production later in 2017. This processor will be made exclusively for the next iPhone. There is no solid report on what the RAM capacity of the next iPhone would be but given that iPhone 7Plus has a 3GB RAM, the next model could sport either a 4GB or 5GB RAM. For internal storage, the company already has made a significant step by abolishing the 16GB model altogether and is likely to stick to the same strategy for the iPhone in 2017 as well. Release date and pricing The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were released in September, which has become Apple's common launch month for its phones every year, so expect to see rumours heating up towards this date. The current iPhone 7 costs £599 in UK for the base model however it is far too early to tell if prices will remain the same or increase.

Oktober 2016 Bild vergrößern AT&T will laut Insidern Time Warner kaufen. Bild:  dpa Für etwa 85 Milliarden Dollar will der US-Telekom-Anbieter AT&T Time Warner laut Insidern kaufen. Die Übernahme könnte schon Sonntag bekannt gegeben werden. Auch Apple hat offenbar Interesse an dem Medienkonzern. Die US-Medienbranche steht offenbar vor einer Megafusion mit weitreichenden Folgen für die Zukunft des Sektors. Für rund 85 Milliarden Dollar will der Telekomriese AT&T Insiderinformationen zufolge den Konzern Time Warner kaufen, zu dem die Sender HBO und CNN sowie das Filmstudio Warner Bros gehören. Beide Seiten hätten dazu eine Grundsatzvereinbarung erzielt. Die Übernahme könnte an diesem Sonntag öffentlich gemacht werden, sagten mit dem Vorgang vertraute Personen. Er wäre bereits die zweite Großübernahme von AT&T im Mediengeschäft binnen kurzer Zeit. Erst vergangenes Jahr hatte sich das Unternehmen für 48,5 Milliarden Dollar den Satellitenfernsehen-Anbieter DirecTV einverleibt. Anzeige Ebenfalls 2015 hatte Time-Warner-Chef Jeff Bewkes eine Offerte von Rupert Murdochs Mediengruppe Twenty-First Century Fox über 80 Milliarden Dollar zurückgewiesen. Die Insider sagten nun, der damalige Bieter wolle nicht erneut aktiv werden. Laut „Wall Street Journal“ hatte vor einigen Monaten aber Apple Kontakt mit Time Warner aufgenommen, um einen Zusammenschluss zu diskutieren. AT&T-Rivale Verizon verabredete zuletzt den Kauf des Internetgeschäfts von Yahoo für 4,8 Milliarden Dollar, nachdem er bereits 2015 den Online-Veteranen AOL unter seine Fittiche genommen hatte. Im Jahr 2000 war Time Warner mit AOL zusammengegangen, was mittlerweile als einer der größten Fehlschläge bei Firmenzusammenschlüssen überhaupt gilt. Übernahmegerüchte um Time Warner:  Kommt Apple doch noch ins Fernsehen? Die Apple-Aktie ist in Schwierigkeiten. Kann Konzernchef Tim Cook die Probleme jetzt mit einem Schlag lösen? Eine Übernahme von Time Warner könnte das Wunder vollbringen – im Fernsehmarkt. Aber Zweifel bleiben. Die jüngsten Initiativen spiegeln massive Umwälzungen in den beteiligten Branchen wider. Zuschauer schauen sich Filme oder Sendungen zunehmend übers Internet an. Davon profitieren Online-Videotheken wie Netflix auf Kosten traditioneller TV-Sender. Zugleich decken sich Telekom-Unternehmen verstärkt mit Medieninhalten ein, um mehr Kunden zu gewinnen. „Das funktioniert niemals“ AT&T verkauft von Hause aus Mobilfunk- und Breitbanddienste, hat aber bereits mehrere Standbeine im Mediengeschäft. Außer DirecTV unterhält der Konzern eine Gemeinschaftsfirma, die in der Branche investiert und einen Videostreaming-Dienst aus der Taufe gehoben hat. Time Warner beherbergt neben HBO und CNN auch die Sendergruppen TBS und TNT. Zudem hält das Unternehmen eine zehnprozentige Beteiligung am Netflix-Konkurrenten Hulu. Das Warner-Filmstudio hat die Rechte an Kassenschlagern wie „Batman“ und „Harry Potter“. Mobilfunkunternehmen setzen große Hoffnungen auf die nächste Generation der Übertragungstechnik (5G), die auch neue Medienangebote ermöglichen soll. „Wir glauben, dass 5G ein ganz wichtiger Impulsgeber ist“, betonte Analyst Rich Tullo vom Wall-Street-Haus Albert Fried & Company. Damit könnten die Telekomanbieter den Bezahlfernsehsendern gehörig in die Quere kommen. Andere Experten kritisierten allerdings, dass AT&T viel Geld für den Kauf der Inhalte-Produktion ausgibt statt zu deutlich günstigeren Preisen lediglich Verwertungsrechte zu erwerben. Es sei unklar, welche Einsparungen die Zusammenlegung von Vertriebsinfrastruktur und Inhalten bringen könnte, sagte Doug Creutz von der Investmentbank Cowen and Co. „Das wurde schon probiert und funktioniert niemals.“ Die Kartellbehörden dürften der Fusion nach Einschätzung von Fachleuten nicht im Wege stehen. Die Partner müssten voraussichtlich nur bestimmte Auflagen erfüllen. Den Insidern zufolge will AT&T 110 Dollar je Time-Warner-Aktie zahlen. Der Preis läge damit deutlich über dem jüngsten Kurs, der im außerbörslichen Handel auf 92,50 Dollar nach oben schoss. Damit erreichte Time Warner eine Marktkapitalisierung von rund 73 Milliarden Dollar. rtr Schlagworte: Mergers & Acquisitions M & A Fernsehen Rundfunk Time Warner AT&T Netflix DirecTV Cable News Network AOL Hulu Yahoo Verizon Apple © Sie wollen unsere Inhalte verwenden?

(REUTERS/Dado Ruvic) These days, a new car is basically a computer with wheels. Trunks open automatically. The car parks itself. Rear cameras show you what you can’t see. If you lock your keys inside, you can open the doors by satellite. The flashiest new gadget: a touch screen in the middle of your dashboard. There’s a lot to love about these infotainment systems. Depending on the brand, you can organize your music, program the GPS and dictate text messages. Console screens are as wide as small tablets and they’re easy to read, even when you’re behind the wheel. But there’s a cost: Many of these services require subscriptions for services like in-vehicle Wi-Fi hotspots, Sirius XM satellite radio and live traffic data. You may start with a free trial, grow accustomed to the conveniences and then find yourself paying fees later on. These costs can add up over time, and the final tally might surprise you — especially when you set up automatic payment. You might not realize how much you’re shelling out for car-based infotainment until you look over your credit card statement. How do you avoid getting caught unaware? Here are some preventive measures. Grill the auto dealer Buying a car is an ordeal. Even when we’ve picked our dream car, we tend to drive away from the dealership exhausted. (Tip in a Tip: If you’re hunting for a new car, there’s an app that makes it easy. Click here to find your perfect car. ) The last thing you want to think about is whether the console uses Apple Maps or Google Maps. But this is a critical time, because the dealer may want you to subscribe to as many services as possible. Don’t let salespeople confuse you. There’s no reason to sign up for anything on the first day. All enrollments are voluntary, and these apps will be available whenever you want them. Infotainment systems are still new, and every car company has its own technology and services. Each system has distinct benefits and drawbacks: Volvo’s Sensus Connect has a touch screen you can use while wearing gloves. Ford’s Sync 3 uses a Blackberry-based system, and it’s a vast improvement on earlier versions. Android Auto will appeal to Google and Microsoft users, while Apple CarPlay is designed for Apple fans. Your preference for Apple or Android devices will likely influence your next car’s make and model. On my site, I have information about both systems. Most importantly, click here to see which system is preloaded into different car makes and models. A responsible auto rep will tell you all about these consoles and infotainment services. Ask how long the free trial lasts and how much the subscription will eventually cost. Grill them about cancellation policies, especially for features you’re not sold on. If any of these explanations sound fishy, just decline. Better to learn about your new car and drive it for a few hundred miles before adding features you may never even use. Remember your smartphone When it comes to vehicle infotainment, I don’t use any paid subscriptions. I use my phone instead. The truth is, most upmarket cars come with USB or audio ports that let you plug your smartphone directly into your vehicle’s system. For years, tech-savvy drivers have listened to music on their phones and held hands-free conversations through their car’s radio and speakers. An infotainment system is just a more sophisticated version of these radios and speakers. You can usually connect your phone directly to your infotainment console, which accesses all the music, podcasts, GPS, and streaming services you already have, and you don’t have to pay an extra penny. There is one downside: Using your phone for navigation and streaming services while driving may devour your data plan. The same goes for “tethering” a device to your phone, a technique some passengers use to access the internet during commutes. To avoid a data famine, you can download podcasts or audiobooks ahead of time, especially for long trips. It’s also a good idea to track your data use so you won’t go over the limit.

October 17 AAPL: 117.55 -0.08 Interview: Tim Cook says Apple’s aim is a cashless society; working to boost the role of AI Ben Lovejoy - 4 weeks ago @benlovejoy AAPL Apple Pay AI View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Tim Cook has told the Nikkei Asian Review that the company hopes that Apple Pay will help to bring about a cashless society. The statement was made a month before the iPhone 7 becomes the first iPhone to support FeliCa, the contactless payment standard used in Japan. We would like to be a catalyst for taking cash out of the system. We don’t think the consumer particularly likes cash. Cook also spoke rather mysteriously about the work that will be performed by the R&D center the company is building in Yokohama, expected to open in March … The facility — the first of its kind outside the U.S. — will develop new component technologies. Cook described it as a center for “deep engineering” and said it will be “very different” from the R&D base Apple plans to build in China. “I cannot tell you the specifics,” he said. “The specific work is very different.”  It does, though, seem that broadening the role played by AI across all Apple products may be the primary focus. Cook said that most people only think of the more explicit examples of machine learning, like Siri, where the reality is that AI runs across all products in all kinds of ways. “We want the AI to increase your battery life” and recommend music to Apple Music subscribers, he continued. As another example, he said AI could “help you remember where you parked your car.” iOS currently relies on the rather crude method of noting a disconnection from CarPlay or an in-car Bluetooth audio unit to detect when you’ve parked your car. Cook is currently touring Japan – surprisingly, his first visit since becoming CEO. He has so far met with Nintendo execs and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. [Update: Nikkei originally reported that the new facility would develop ‘AI and other technologies’ before updating the report to say ‘new component technologies.] Guides AAPL Get the latest AAPL stock and company news View THe Guide Apple Pay Apple Pay is Apple's mobile payments solution first introduced in 2014.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Reviews iPhone 7/ iPhone 7 Plus review Back in black. By Damien McFerran Published 22/10/2016 It apparently took "courage" to remove the 3.5mm audio jack from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, according to Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller. The company's less kind critics have voiced the opinion that it has more to do with bolstering sales of the new £160 AirPods and the wireless headphones produced by Apple subsidiary Beats Electronics, but whatever side of the fence you happen to sit on, this is a decision that has dominated the headlines and has been in very real danger of completely overshadowing this year's iPhone refresh. Apple's reasoning for ditching a socket which has been commonplace on practically every smartphone for the past decade may be flimsy at best, but where the Cupertino company leads, rivals invariably follow and we could well see an industry-wide shift towards wireless audio in the next year or so. It's almost a shame that this decision has generated such a sizeable reaction online as the products it impacts have a lot going for them. For the first time in iPhone history we finally have a device that can cope with getting wet, while the improved camera on both models and unique "taptic" home button are welcome improvements. However, Apple has chosen to cram all of these elements into a chassis which looks disarmingly similar to the design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S - the first time in the history of the line that the same aesthetic look has been retained for a third consecutive year (the iPhone SE doesn't count as that came over a year after the iPhone 5S ceased being Apple's flagship). iPhone 7/7 Plus specs Akin to 2014 and 2015, Apple has two flagship options this year. Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus benefit from the increased power afforded by Apple's A10 Fusion chipset, but the latter has 3GB of RAM compared to the standard model's 2GB. This year the 16GB storage option has been retired, with 32GB being the entry level point. The other big difference between the two phones is the addition of a second telephoto lens on the 7 Plus, which gives x2 optical zoom. First up, the iPhone 7 specs: Dimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm Weight: 138g Chipset: Apple A10 Fusion Processor: Quad-core 2.23 GHz Graphics Core: Six-core graphics RAM: 2GB Screen: 4.7-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD, 750 x 1334 pixels (326 ppi) Storage: 32GB / 64GB / 128GB Camera: 12 MP, f/1.8, phase detection autofocus, OIS, quad-LED flash Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth v4.2, NFC (Apple Pay only) Other Features: IP67 certified, 1960 mAh battery And here's how the iPhone 7 Plus compares: Dimensions: 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm Weight: 188g Chipset: Apple A10 Fusion Processor: Quad-core 2.23 GHz Graphics Core: Six-core graphics RAM: 3GB Screen: 5.5-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD, 1080 x 1920 pixels (401 ppi) Storage: 32GB / 64GB / 128GB Camera: Dual 12 MP (28mm, f/1.8, OIS & 56mm, f/2.8), phase detection autofocus, OIS (4-axis), dual-LED flash Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth v4.2, NFC Other Features: IP67 certified, 2900 mAh battery Black is the new "hero" colour of the range this year, with matte and glossy finishes available. This new colour scheme hides one of the big changes to the design, which is the repositioning of the plastic antenna bands to the top and bottom edges of the rear of the device. These bands are now practically invisible, with Apple's design guru Jony Ive claiming that this has resulted in the most "refined" take on this particular design. It's hard to disagree; while it may not be revolutionary when set alongside its 2014 and 2015 predecessors, the iPhone 7 is certainly an appealing slab of technology. There are many aspects to the phone's design that are instantly familiar to iPhone owners. The power button resides on the right-hand side, with the volume controls and silent switch found on the opposite edge. On the bottom there's the lightning port, but the 3.5mm headphone jack you'd expect to see to the left is gone, with the resultant void being filled by a speaker (the phone has two) and the phone's larger "Taptic Engine" force feedback unit. Around the back, the camera bump has become bigger compared to last year's model, but it looks a lot nicer - the metallic lens housing has been replaced by a more gradual raised section that appears to be more like part of the design than something that was hastily tacked on at the last moment. Gallery: Available in matte and glossy black, this year's iPhones will make many nostalgic for the iPhone 3G. The removal of the 3.5mm headphone socket has allowed Apple to fit two powerful stereo speakers, while inside the phone the expanded Taptic Engine allows for system-wide force feedback. Apart from size, the big difference between the two models is the dual camera setup on the 7 Plus. Flipping the phone over reveals the final big change - there's no physical home button this time around. The circular pad remains, but a push with your thumb yields no movement; instead, the iPhone 7's Taptic Engine delivers a pulse that gives the impression of pushing a button. Apple has used the same tech on the Force Touch screen, and it's a pretty convincing system - even if it does take some getting used to initially. By eliminating this moving part, Apple will hopefully have solved one of the biggest problems the iPhone line has faced along the years - a broken home button. While the 3.5mm headphone socket is, in Apple's eyes at least, now a relic of the past, there's thankfully still a way of using your old wired cans. Included in the box is a small connection cable that plugs into the lightning port and features - you've guessed it - a 3.5mm port on the other end. It's hardly an elegant solution and means you can't charge the phone while listening to music, but it should help you endure the transition to wireless audio - just make sure you don't misplace the adapter. The other big news this year is that Apple has finally made its flagship phones water and dust proof. Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus boast IP67 certification, meaning they're able to withstand a 30 minute dip in the wet stuff to a depth of one meter. Again, there's a game of catch-up being played here - we've had waterproof Android phones for years - but it's a welcome upgrade over last year's offering and should ensure that an unscheduled fall in the sink or (even worse) the toilet no longer means a tragic end for your £600 smartphone. Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus benefit from backlit LED screens which are brighter and more colourful than before, but they retain the resolution we've seen in the previous two years. The iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch 1334x750 screen while its larger sibling has a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 offering. Compared to what companies like Sony, Samsung and LG are shipping with their flagship devices it's clear that Apple is losing the pixels-per-inch war, but while it's annoying that iPhone fans have not had a resolution bump in the past three years, it matters little in day-to-day use. GFXBench's Manhattan test is a hard workout for the GPU, but the reality is that few games actually test cutting-edge graphics power these days. iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Plus iPhone SE iPhone 6S iPhone 6 iPhone 5S iPhone 5/5C Galaxy S7 Galaxy S6 Geekbench Single-Core 3000 3306 2496 2552 1605 1294 701 2171 1233 Geekbench Multi-Core 5330 5345 4343 4464 2901 2463 1267 6465 3964 3DMark Graphics 63668 62595 44059 41968 22824 19488 5232 32404 22954 3DMark Physics 15267 15231 12871 12998 9385 8042 8099 17730 17795 3DMark IceStorm Unlimited 37352 37015 28638 28067 17304 14797 5669 27370 21565 GFXBench T-Rex 120.1 122.4 79.9 79.7 42.8 28.9 6.9 87.0 58.0 GFXBench Manhattan 62.3 63.2 39.3 40.3 18.1 13.5 - 29.0 25.9 It's already almost impossible to discern individual pixels on this screen and we've long argued that 1080p is the absolute maximum you really need on a smartphone. Anything above that is simply adding strain on the processor (not to mention impacting battery life) for little visible reward - the only genuine use we can foresee for a resolution increase is for phones which are used to power virtual reality headsets, such as the Galaxy S7 and the newly-launched Google Pixel, where the user's eyes are close-up to the display. As the iPhone 7 has no VR application at present, it can't really be included in that argument. While the iPhone is eclipsed by its Android rivals when it comes to screen size, it continues to lead the pack in terms of raw processing power. The fact that the A10 Fusion chip is the first quad-core proposition from Apple might lead you to assume it is comfortably outclassed by competing handsets, but the benchmark results suggest otherwise. As ever, the merits of creating your own chipset speak for themselves; this is an industry-leading handset in terms of grunt. Another remarkable aspect worth noting is that the iPhone 7 has only 2GB of RAM (the 7 Plus has 3GB) yet it is capable of delivering performance levels which shame some of its RAM-obsessed Android challengers. It almost goes without saying that with such formidable specs the iPhone 7 is a solid platform for gaming. There are few titles which really exploit the additional power found within the handset at present but existing releases - such as the lush Zelda Wind Waker homage Oceanhorn and the ever-enjoyable Real Racing 3 - run as smooth as silk with none of the judders and frame-rate headaches seen in their Android equivalents. Mobile gaming doesn't really get any more polished than it does on an iPhone, and the iOS App Store continues to be the go-to platform for developers thanks to the relative lack of piracy when compared to Google's own digital store. Perhaps this is why Nintendo has chosen to bring Super Mario Run to iOS first, a move which will surely make Apple's devices even more attractive to dedicated gamers. Gallery: Incremental hardware upgrades means there's few games which fully exploit the power of the A10 Fusion chipset, but rest assured everything runs like clockwork on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with not stutter or frame rate hiccups. 3D Touch is supported by some games too, but not as many as we'd like. In terms of software, Apple has launched iOS 10 alongside its 2016 flagship phones. This update brings with it some visual changes - such as bubble-like notifications and the Google Now-style "Today" screen, which sits on the left-hand side of your main Home screen and gives you calendar updates and news stories - but perhaps the most significant difference is how 3D Touch has been embraced more enthusiastically this time around. Introduced in the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, 3D Touch is based around pressure, allowing you to press down on the screen to "peek" at images and access more commands. In iOS 10 it's also used in a new "rich notifications" system, where pressing down an alert bubble allows you to expand it and - in some cases - respond without having to actually open the app in question. As was the case last year, you could argue that a simple long-press would work just as well but 3D Touch appears to be here to stay, at least as far as the iPhone is concerned. Another welcome introduction for iOS 10 is the ability to wake the phone's screen as soon as you pick it up, and lock screen widgets - recently expunged from Android - have been added so you can check vital information without unlocking your device. However, there are times when it feels like Apple's attempts to enrich iOS have been fumbled. The notification system is the main culprit, and remains unwieldy for those who have a lot of apps firing off messages at once. In Android, notifications from the same app are often grouped together so you can see at a glance which one you need to open first, but in iOS each message has its own entry and you often have to swipe through an entire stream of alerts before finding one of any real interest. Worse still, important alerts get buried amid eBay messages, emails and other less urgent notifications, which means they often get overlooked altogether. Granular access is given to this system so you can disable audio alerts for a particular app or prevent it from firing off a message on your lock screen, but it's still a poor second to the way notifications work in Android - an OS which has led the way in this area almost since day one. Another advantage Google has is better overall customisation and flexibility - bonuses which come hand-in-hand with weaker security and an app store which struggles to attract talent due to the fact that any Android user can side-load pirated apps and games without having to pay a penny. Swift to focus and capable of capturing life-like shots, the iPhone 7's camera is perhaps the best on any smartphone right now. Low-light photography is much improved thanks to the inclusion of OIS and a f/1.8 aperture. One area where Apple's phones have enjoyed a particular notable advantage over pretty much every other manufacturer on the market is photography. While the megapixel count of 12 remains unchanged when compared to the iPhone 6S, both of this year's phones has a six-optical lens, optical image stabilisation (reserved for the "Plus" models previously) and a wider f/1.8 aperture. This means shots are less prone to camera shake and low-light shooting is much improved. Apple claims that the camera on the iPhone 7 is 60 per cent faster than its direct predecessor, which is an impressive claim as the iPhone 6S could capture an image in double-quick time. Suffice to say, the camera is insanely swift to focus and snap, and produces images which have excellent contrast and colour replication. Some of the shots look somewhat dull when compared to the vibrant images obtained on Samsung's latest handsets, but they're notably free from oversaturation and unrealistic colours. In terms of video, you can expect 4K capture at 30fps, or if you prefer a smoother frame-rate you can drop down to 1080p60. Slow-motion and time-lapse modes are also included, and the 7-megapixel selfie-camera on the front is now aided by a flash - in reality, the screen simply fires up to illuminate your face. On the 7 Plus, Apple has opted for the dual camera approach seen on Android phones like the LG G5, Huawei P9 and HTC One M8. The phone comes with a 12-megapixel telephoto lens in addition to the standard 12-megapixel snapper seen on the standard iPhone 7 model. This telephoto lens effectively grants the end user x2 optical zoom, allowing you to zoom in on your subject without experiencing the image quality degradation that normally comes with digital zoom. It doesn't end there, though - the iPhone 7 Plus uses its dual-camera setup to create a "depth map", picking out close-up and distant objects. This information is then used to add an artificial bokeh effect to create the kind of depth-of-field you'd normally only get from a DSLR with wide aperture. It's an interesting use of the two cameras and allows for some really effective shots - expect to witness bokeh-overload on your Instagram feed as more people pick up the phone. The 7 Plus has the same 12 megapixel, f/1.8 aperture lens as the standard iPhone 7 but includes a second telephoto lens which allows for x2 optical zoom and realistic depth-of-field shots. The iPhone 7 has a larger battery than the iPhone 6S, and when teamed with the A10 Fusion's two "low power" cores, this should mean improved stamina. However, that isn't the case; the iPhone 7 doesn't seem to offer much of an advantage when compared to last year's model. The iPhone 7 Plus is a different story as the larger frame allows for a bigger capacity battery, but on the whole this feels like another area where Apple has lost ground to competitors. Phones like the Galaxy S7 and Xiaomi Mi5 are similar in size to the standard iPhone 7, yet they have larger power cells and consequently last much longer when away from a power socket. While we rarely got to the end of the day with a dead phone, there were a few times when overzealous usage caused the juice to drop to alarming low levels before bedtime - Pokémon Go usually being the main culprit. The iPhone 7's middling stamina is exacerbated by the fact that it lacks quick-charging and takes around 90 minutes to reach 100 per cent. Again, this is another area where Google has the upper hand; most leading Android handsets have some kind of fast charging capability which can fully boost the battery in less than an hour, while others also offer convenient wireless charging. Expect to see these features come to Apple's devices soon, when they will no doubt be acclaimed as totally ground-breaking. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: the Digital Foundry verdict While the design might not have altered a great deal, it's clear that some big strides are made with this year's iPhones. Waterproofing is a huge plus point, and the traditional increase in processing power once again puts Apple at the front of the pack. Improvements with the camera and screen give further incentive for existing iPhone users to upgrade, and while the removal of the 3.5mm headphone socket is a pain, the expanded taptic engine does much to make up for it, allowing system-wide vibration feedback which can be felt in everything from scrolling menus to games. The lasting influence of Modern Warfare How Infinity Ward changed a genre. Ditching the socket has also allowed Apple to include two powerful stereos speakers that sound leagues ahead of any other device on the market. The dual-camera setup on the 7 Plus is also worthy of note, with the secondary telephoto lens allowing for some neat tricks when it comes to composing the perfect image. It's also worth noting that this is the first year that Apple has made 32GB the base storage option - something that has been a long time coming. In terms of the basics, call audio quality is excellent, as is network and wireless connectivity. However, there's no denying that in some key areas, Apple's phones continue to lag behind the competition. Battery life is only a slight improvement over last year's offerings but remains disappointing when compared to rival handsets, and the lack of any kind of fast charging capability is almost unforgivable in 2016, especially on a phone which costs this much. While Samsung and Sony's flagships are in a similar price bracket, the Android sector is awash with much cheaper devices from companies like Xiaomi, Lenovo and Ulefone, many of which offer mod cons that are frustratingly absent on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The trade-off is getting one of the most powerful phones on the market with a well-stocked app store, tightly integrated software features and impeccable build quality. It's a sacrifice millions of users have been making for years, and the iPhone 7 is enough of an incremental update to maintain that pattern - and perhaps pick up a few new customers in the wake of Samsung's regrettable Galaxy Note 7 meltdown. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus review units kindly provided by Mobile Fun.

 Apple might not be able to build its €850 million Irish data centre after all Sam Shead Oct. 22, 2016, 3:43 AM 5,458 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.Screenshot A small town in Ireland is continuing to give Apple a huge headache. The Californian tech giant wants to build an €850 million (£757 million) data centre just outside Athenry, in County Galway, on the west coast of Ireland. The vast majority of residents support Apple's plans but the company has faced stiff opposition from a small number of local residents and businesses who don't want it "in their back garden." After a lot of toing and froing, Apple finally got the green light from local planning body An Bord Pleanála in August. Apple seemed to be home and dry. However, local residents Allan Daly and Sinéad Fitzpatrick have now launched a High Court bid that threatens to derail Apple's plans once more, The Irish Times reports. They are questioning the means by which planning permission was granted.  Apple is concerned that the project will be delayed by a further 18 months if the High Court permits a full review of An Bord Pleanála's decision to give scheme the go-ahead, according to The Irish Times. The High Court is yet to decide whether to proceed to a full judicial review, but The Irish Times writes that there will be a lengthy delay if Daly and Fitzpatrick are successful with their application. The newspaper also writes that Apple is concerned about the project's future if the judicial review is granted. It has reportedly made its fears known to Irish government officials. Apple wants to use the data centre to store European user data and to help power online services including the iTunes Store, the App Store, iMessage, Maps, and Siri for customers across Europe, according to a press release announcing the development in February 2015. In the press release, Apple also announced a similar data centre in Denmark, which is in the process of being built, according to The Irish Times. A computer-generated image of Apple's Irish data centre.Unknown The Cupertino company was hoping to have the facility up and running by early 2017 but Apple is yet to start any building work. Some 5,500 of Apple's 18,300 European staff are based in Ireland, which is also home to its European headquarters. The company has pledged to hire an additional 1,000 staff in Ireland before 2017. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have also built data centres in Ireland, and Facebook also has one planned. Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

X Intel case could change flavour of €13bn Apple ruling European Court of Justice says Intel decision that led to €1.06bn fine should be re-examined Sat, Oct 22, 2016, 07:30 EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager: has she bitten off more than she can chew? Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty Images         Even as EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager was was putting a shot across the bows of a Government still reeling from the scale of the Apple tax ruling, a little heralded legal opinion in another part of the EU apparatus threatened this week to change things. In an interview with Irish Times European Correspondent Suzanne Lynch, Vestager insisted the ruling that Apple must repay up to €13 billion (plus possible interest) to the Irish Revenue – which might then face competing claims from other EU states for portions of this money – was fact-based. It has also emerged that the Irish authorities have submitted a list of 300 tax rulings to the commission as part of a broader enquiry in Brussels into tax rulings. Criticism Down the road in Luxembourg, European Court of Justice advocate general Nils Wahl was throwing a spanner into the works. He said a 2009 case against Intel, after an eight-year investigation – which led to a record €1.06 billion fine – should be re-examined in its entirety because a court erred in ruling against the company’s system of rebates for PC makers using its chips. The ECJ judges are not obliged to follow an advocate’s opinion but more often than not they do. Of particular interest to Apple and the Irish Government, which is planning ECJ appeals against Vestager’s record €13 billion ruling, is the advocate general’s criticism of the EU’s handling of evidence it gathered against Intel, saying the lower court was wrong to rule that regulators could add details of a meeting with a Dell executive long after the fact. Failure to communicate a shift in the focus of the Apple probe and keeping both the company and the Government in the dark unfairly during the investigation are central to the likely appeal against the Vestager ruling on Apple. ADVERTISEMENT In the wake of the AG’s opinion, lawyers in Brussels were suggesting, a confirmatory ruling by the full court could be among the most important decisions by an EU court in 25 years. It remains to be seen if the commissioner has bitten off more than she can chew.       Topics: Cantillon Margrethe Vestager Nils Wahl European Court of Justice Apple Intel AboutCantillon A man with a profound understanding of how money is made and lost, Kerry-born economist Richard Cantillon (1680s-1734) is a fitting namesake for this long-running column.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Prep Football: Serrano takes advantage of Apple Valley's errors Friday Oct 21, 2016 at 12:01 AM Oct 21, 2016 at 11:15 PM Jacob Sundstrom Staff Writer @DPSundstrom APPLE VALLEY — Apple Valley scored first Friday night at Newton T. Bass Stadium. Then Serrano scored the next 25 points on the way to a 25-6 win in a key Mojave River League matchup. The Diamondbacks (7-1, 3-0 MRL) are still very much contenders for the MRL title as they head to Burroughs next Friday. Serrano didn’t play its sharpest game of the season, but the Diamondbacks took advantage of Apple Valley’s (6-2, 1-2 MRL) miscues and turned on the jets late in the game. Brandon Murcio starred both offensively and defensively for Serrano. He picked off Apple Valley quarterback Mossy Bell in the fourth quarter and ran in two touchdowns while racking up 137 yards on 22 carries. “I feel pretty beat up,” he said. “It’s a really physical game and they hit hard, man. We know they play that power ball too so we were prepared for that.” Serrano head coach Ray Maholchic liked what he saw from his team in terms of its tenacity and resilience. “I think they hung in there and held them to 6 points which was fantastic for the defense,” he said. “We made some mistakes and gave them some things but at the end we were able to hang in there and take advantage of some of their mistakes and stretch our lead a little.” Jonathan Ybarra sacked Mossy Bell in the end zone for a safety which gave Serrano a 12-6 lead. That’s when Murcio took over. He scored his first touchdown of the night on the ensuing drive and then picked off Bell on Apple Valley’s next series. The Diamondbacks didn’t score on their next drive but a fumble got Serrano the ball back and Murcio capped the drive with a 6-yard dash into the end zone for his second score. “He was a busy kid,” said Maholchic. “I don’t know if we’ll ever put any weight on him, not when he burns 8,000 calories a game. He’s a great kid, really has a heart of a warrior.” Apple Valley moves past the toughest part of its MRL schedule but very likely needs to beat both Hesperia and Sultana to get a shot at a playoff spot in Division 10. Head coach Matt Rohrbaugh likes his team’s chances. “When you turn the ball over that many times in the second half against a great team like Serrano, they’ll make you pay,” said Rohrbaugh. “I’m so proud of my kids, how hard they played. Lots of big hits tonight.” The sound of plastic on plastic crackled through the stadium all night as both teams delivered the smash-mouth football they’ve long been known for. While big hits were expected, Maholchic was particularly impressed with Apple Valley’s pass defense. “I think that’s the best their pass defense has looked in a very long time,” said Maholchic. That led to Serrano doing most of its attacking on the ground. That suits the Diamondbacks just fine, of course. They finished with 222 rushing yards and 107 through the air while Apple Valley managed 53 rushing yards and 120 passing yards. Apple Valley plays its last home game of the regular season against Sultana on Friday.

The variants are expected to sport a much slimmer design compared to its predecessors. Rumours suggest that the MacBook Pro 2016 will have a larger Trackpad and a butterfly keyboard design. Apple is holding a press event on Oct. 27 at its Cupertino campus. The invites have been sent though it does not reveal anything about the MacBook Pro 2016. Fans expect the MacBook Pro line-up to be the centre of discussion when the event begins. Apple has reportedly made massive upgrades to the line-up in terms of both specs and design. A fully-customizable OLED touchscreen toolbar is rumoured to feature in the MacBook Pro 2016 that has replaced the F keys. The keyboard will reportedly change the keys displayed as per the app running on the computer and even change into a download progress bar. Touch ID feature is set to provide added security to the MacBook Pro 2016. This feature is already present in the iPhone models. The Touch ID is set to be incorporated into the “Power” button so that when a user presses the button it will result in automatic user verification via fingerprint scan, writes Tech Times. As per BGR, the Apple MacBook Pro 2016 is most-likely to boast Intel’s Skylake chipset and AMD Polaris graphics processor. The device may run on the MacOS Sierra that itself is a powerhouse of incredible features. The standard USB ports could be replaced by the much-talked-about USB-C ports and Thunderbolt 3. The Apple MacBook Pro has not received any major overhaul since 2012. It will also bring with it Apple's Siri voice-activated assistant and loads of other exciting features. Recently, a Reddit post appeared showing a prototype of the Apple e-ink keyboard being developed by Sonder. The post has been taken down. Apple has a reputation of taking big leaps that are first criticised but later become the new standard. A similar thing happened with the 3.5mm headphone jack that was dropped from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Apple MacBook Pro 2016.

We merely had a cameo of Pepe,’ Treadstone continued. ‘We get banned because it’s a pro-Trump app, but you can have an app only about Pepe and that’s not offensive,'” Nash reports. “In July, Apple’s App Store also rejected a satirical game based on the Hillary Clinton email servers scandal. Apple branded the game as ‘offensive’ and ‘objectionable’ before reversing their decision following a report at Breitbart.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Poor Pepe.

Loading... Comment Feed 57 Comments killerz Friday, October 21, 2016 - 4:18 pm · Reply Apple’s rejection criteria are wildly inconsistent and appear to be highly subjective. You cannot use the argument that other apps currently in the app store more flagrantly abuse the same copyright. The official response I received was, it doesn’t matter if 1000 similar apps in the app store break , YOUR app appears to use similar imagery to “” and so is rejected. The decision was upheld upon multiple appeals.

They just went along with whoever was pushing whatever agenda. If Donald Trump wants to make America White Again, then Apple should sit on the sidelines and even maybe help kick out anyone that is not a white male citizen unless they belong to a union or the wrong religion. yojimbo007 Friday, October 21, 2016 - 5:41 pm · Reply My view is that its not Apple who should do that… its not their place as a company. every individual though can voice their opinion and place their vote.

Talk about clueless. Grifterus Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 8:39 pm · Reply I’m aswering sarcasm with sarcasm. Nobody needs permission from anybody. Everybody has the right to comment as anybody wants. And everybody have every right to comment on whatever I or anyone posts. And no, I don’t like Botty because he’s been a rude idiot to me and many people in this forum. He often acts like a troll and he’s never been able to provide a smart answer to anything. And sure, the feeling must be mutual. But regardless, I would defend to death his right to keep posting his opinion, as much as I dislike and disagree with him. Me2Sense Monday, October 24, 2016 - 5:48 pm · Reply “He often acts like a troll and he’s never been able to provide a smart answer to anything.” I guess you flunked grammar class by using absolutes. Wow, are you clueless. And your sarcasm excuse was just that — an excuse no believes. Grifterus Monday, October 24, 2016 - 7:05 pm · Reply Well, allow me to retort. First, let’s correct the absolutes (where I will grant you are correct, and will correct myself): He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM. Better now? It’s not absolute anymore. It’s constrained to the current forum. Speaking of absolutes: “an excuse no believes”…. makes you too a grammar champion. Shouldn’t that be “and excuse no one believes”? Oh, also, wouldn’t that also be an absolute? Because, if no one believes it, that sounds like there are no exceptions, or no cases where someone would believe it. That looks like an absolute to me. Man, who’s more clueless? The clueless guy, or the clueless guy who calls another guy that he’s clueless? Let’s leave it there. This is not worth my time. And I’n sure it’s not worth yours. Let’s call it a stalemate. Would you agree? Me2Sense Monday, October 24, 2016 - 7:25 pm · Reply “He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM.” Provide. You just can’t rid yourself of absolute statements. Botty is much more intelligent, witty and smarter than you. Your partisan HATE blinds you. So sorry. Grifterus Monday, October 24, 2016 - 8:07 pm · Where in my post I mention anything about political parties???? And yes, I had a typo…. And you mention nothing about your own absolutes…. It’s like talking to a rock. Do you want to believe I’m dumb? Please do. I don’t know Botty in person. I think everything he writes… oh, excuse me, I will allow absolutes… everything Ihe wrote that I’ve read is nothing but pure garbage. I see no intelligence there. Now, one man’s opinion doesn’t make the man smarter. Maybe I’m the stupid one and you are the smart one. Because you see it that way, and I see it another way. So… since only one of us can be right, and we will never agree, let’s leave it there. Me2Sense Monday, October 24, 2016 - 8:32 pm · Hey clueless, give it up.

I’d like to stay, but I don’t like what Apple’s doing with the hardware. I know Apple has always been proprietary, but they were never this proprietary.

First 2014, Then 2016 Friday, October 21, 2016 - 5:24 pm · Reply Only one candidate is not beholden to Wall Street, multinationals, and the special interests: Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for and has been for decades. The Trump Plan will retain the existing capital gains rate structure (maximum rate of 20 percent) with tax brackets shown above. Carried interest will be taxed as ordinary income. That is why the Wall Street-, multinational-, and Soros-owned Hillary Clinton is getting massive assistance from the mainstream media (also owned by the establishment) – they want their carried interest deductions to continue. Thoughtful Voters Friday, October 21, 2016 - 5:29 pm · Reply You’re not convincing anyone here.

Outside of your little Right-Wing Echo Chamber and the most rural of rural areas Trump just isn’t seen as credible. BTW, where does this “Trump has at least an 87% chance of winning” BS come from? Not that article. Nick Saturday, October 22, 2016 - 2:29 am · Reply It’s funny to hear a leftist talking about an echo chamber. Our culture is soaked and consumed with progressive leftism, it’s not possible for a “right wing echo chamber” to exist. Those on the right are exposed to both sides of the spectrum. Those on the left are living in the mass-media-wide echo chamber, unless they take the effort to see things from another perspective. Most don’t and prefer to condescendingly spit on everyone else while furthering their lies. Whether or not Trump wins, you won’t be safe from the crowds with torches and pitchforks. Dave H Saturday, October 22, 2016 - 4:12 am · Reply That’s your perception, but one I disagree with. You only have to spend a few minutes reading comment boards on the Internet to see there are millions of people out there that living in a Right-Wing bubble. They repeat misconceptions and outright distortions at each other, over and over again until they utterly believe it. “Obama’s a Kenyan”, “The Government forces your kids to become gay”, “They’re going to take our guns”, “Muslims are ALL evil terrorists” etc. That’s your Right-Wing Echo Chamber. It’s another perspective, but one built mostly on ignorance. Me2Sense Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 3:03 pm · Reply You got it backwards. The left-wing echo chamber robots are dumb as a box of rocks. Nick Monday, October 24, 2016 - 3:44 am · Reply Obama’s own publisher called him Kenyan to promote himself as a speaker. The government does propagandize for homosexuality. Islam is an evil religion that promotes anti-semitism, slavery and violence. People may say extreme-sounding things, but they’re based on facts. Don’t compare message boards to all of the major broadcast networks, newspapers, magazines and social media sites, which are ALL globalist-progressive. Yes even FOX News is on the same team as CNN and the New York Times. DavGreg Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:27 pm · Reply You should take your meds. Drumpf is likely to get his ass whipped and the GOP is likely to lose the Senate. Thanks to Republican Gerrymandering they are likely to retain the House, but with a narrower margin. If voter turnout is high it will be better for Democrats and if it is lower it will be better for the Republicans.

If you can count that high. YOU GOT THAT RIGHT! Friday, October 21, 2016 - 10:04 pm · Reply Aww… What’s a matter Fisty? Feeling low? Downtrodden? Beleaguered? GOOD. You, and your kind will never win.

We are in trouble. Dave H Saturday, October 22, 2016 - 6:53 am · Reply Of course he is. Because Hillary is the better of the two options on offer despite her many many faults. It’s about time you realised that your candidate is that bad. The GOP only needed to put someone electable up and this election was theirs for the taking. Instead the Tea Party types who have infested (yes, infested) the Republicans have put Hillary into the Oval Office. Well done them eh?

Dave H Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 4:20 pm · Reply It looks like those “dumb and corrupt Dems” only need to sit back now and watch the GOP suffer a major self-inflicted electoral kicking. You might want to think about the reasons for that. Me2Sense Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 5:26 pm · Reply Well, if the corrupt Dems win they have gamed the system. And we all know the media, Hollywood, teachers and unions are working overtime in the Dems corner. So if they sadly win, it’s not because they are pure as the driven snow. Right now, the party of people at one time is the party of the CORRUPT and CONNECTED (Clinton Foundation). Make American Great Again — DT! Look at My Hands Saturday, October 22, 2016 - 11:00 am · Reply What’s going to happen to your moniker after the election? First bullshit, then more bullshit. Your side might go down in historic flames because even the deplorables think you’re wrong. DavGreg Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:01 pm · Reply Pepe the Frog is well known to have been adopted as a symbol by the alt-right. The alt-right organized around precepts and values that are against the broad multi-cultural view that is widely accepted and in the mainstream through most of the US and developed world. The inclusion of that symbol in a thinly dusguised game to promote the Drumpf Campaign. Apple was right in rejecting it. If you do not like Apple’s decision, do the free market thing and go buy an Android or Windows phone. Apple is a private sector company and nobody is making you buy their stuff. Derek Currie Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:15 pm · Reply I Guess We Need To Talk About Pepe The Frog …Later, observers began noticing an increase in white supremacist themes in Pepe images — or a rise in Pepe usage by white supremacist accounts. Either way, an association was building. This May, an “anonymous white nationalist” told The Daily Beast that the shift was intentional: a dedicated campaign to “reclaim Pepe from normies,” or members of the mainstream, by making Pepe so culturally unacceptable that only the fringe Internet would dare to use him. Donald Trump had earlier tweeted an image of Pepe-as-Trump, and then his son posted an image on Instagram that included Pepe. Homeandmantel Friday, October 21, 2016 - 11:30 pm · Reply Can’t wait until the election is over and the landslide Hillary captured that the GOP will finally cut ties with the ignorant and racist constituency it has built up over the past decade and a half. Trump will singlehandly turn red states blue after this. The party of stupid has to make a wide turn or die off with all the party senile elderly it clings to as it’s base.

The action continues with Macs finding great favor within IBM. Also, education initiatives via iPads continue. Finally, IBM’s Watson has to be giving Apple some big ideas. This has the signs of becoming one of the most productive partnerships ever, amongst former rivals, in the tech industry. Watson Avatar. A smarter planet. Apple & IBM Synergy This week, I saw three notable articles that punctuate the ongoing partnership between these two companies. 1. “IBM says it is 3X more expensive to manage PCs than Macs.” This is from Jonny Evans at Computerworld. I remember, back in the 1990s, those of us in the workplace who proselytized Macs pointed out that Macs were easier and less expensive to operate. That counsel usually fell on deaf ears because IT mangers were invested in PCs and Windows for reasons that outweighed long term cost savings. To get their way, they argued that Macs were too expensive initially. That was a cost that was in the face of signature authority and hard to brush under the rug. In contrast, ongoing maintenance costs were a bigger, more muddled pie and easier to justify. Today, things have changed a little. IBM is very conscious at a high level, about those cost savings. Author Evans writes: IBM today told the record-setting seventh Jamf Nation User Conference that it is saving even more money by deploying Macs across the company than it thought: each Mac deployment saves the company up to US$535 over four years, in contrast to the $270 per Mac it claimed last year. Fletcher Previn, IBM VP of Workplace as a Service, told the conference: IBM began replacing PCs with Macs in early 2015, when it began giving employees the choice to upgrade to a Mac when their company kit needed upgrading. The data speaks for itself, at IBM an astonishing 73 percent of employees will choose a Mac when they get the chance to choose for themself. Not only has the company been saving between $264-$535 for each Mac deployment over four years, but just 3.5 percent of employees using a Mac will call the company help desk. Give employees the devices they want, manage those devices in a modern way, and drive self sufficiency in the environment.” It’s a remarkable thing to have happen. And when Apple Macs start to ignite IBM employees with infectious enthusiasm, Apple no doubt has taken note. The Mac is hardly dead. Perhaps we’ll see if this IBM effect has influenced Apple’s thinking about the Mac on October 27. IBM ‘s Watson partners with Apple in education. Image credit: IBM Watson Goes to School 2. “First IBM Watson Education App for iPad Delivers Personalized Learning for K-12 Teachers and Students.” This is an IBM newsroom release. From the release: 19 Oct 2016: IBM … today announced the first IBM MobileFirst for iOS education app. The app, IBM Watson Element for Educators, enables a new level of engagement for teachers by providing a holistic view of each student at their fingertips, including data on interests, accomplishments, academic performance, attendance, behaviors and learning activities. As a result, teachers are empowered with data-driven insights to help them address individual needs that can potentially lead to better outcomes throughout student’s K-12 learning experiences. The key here is the heuristics in use by IBM’s Watson to support what’s called “IBM Watson Element.” The operation of this tool is remarkable. IBM Watson Element provides teachers with a holistic view of each student through a fun, easy-to-use and intuitive mobile experience that is a natural extension of their work. Teachers can get to know their students beyond their academic performance, including information about personal interests and important milestones students choose to share. For example, teachers can input notes when a student’s highly anticipated soccer match is scheduled, when another has just been named president for the school’s World Affairs club, and when another has recently excelled following a science project that sparked a renewed interest in chemistry. IBM’s Watson has already been pressed into service to partner with oncologists. No doubt, Apple’s influence on IBM engineers with Macs is being reciprocated with a keen understanding by Apple executives on the payoff derived from IBM’s supercomputer and Watson expertise. I can only imagine IBM’s briefings to Apple on the opportunities. Finally…. IBM’s Watson. Image credit: IBM Medical Research Meets Health & FItness 3. “IBM Is Counting on Its Bet on Watson, and Paying Big Money for It.” This is from the New York Times. IBM is betting big in Watson to fuel IBM’s resurgence, according to the NYT. IBM has invested billions of dollars in its Watson business unit, created at the start of 2014, which now employs an estimated 10,000 workers. Its big-ticket marketing push includes clever television ads that feature Watson trading quips with famous people like Serena Williams and Bob Dylan. And Watson, after a slow start, has shown its mettle by assisting in daunting tasks like diagnosing cancer. … The technology, IBM executives say, has the potential to make precision medicine and tailored therapies available to millions of cancer patients instead of the small number now treated at elite medical centers with genomics expertise. With IBM’s focus on research in medicine and Apple’s enthusiasm for health and fitness monitoring, it may not be too long before Watson is interacting with our iPhones and Apple Watches via HealthKit and Siri in further partnership. The Challenge For Apple Clearly IBM has learned a lot about how to increase productivity and cut costs by giving employees Macs, the best tool for the job. Synergies with iPads in education and the enterprise have now been well documented. The question in my mind is how fast can Apple learn its way around IBM’s supercomputer and AI culture, and what new challenges will Apple take up with that new expertise. The good news? It’ll all be guided by Tim Cook’s character and values. With two tech giants like Apple and IBM working on medicine and education, all kinds of good things will happen next. Most importantly, the concrete work already done greatly outweighs the speculative doomsday scenarios of AI agents run amok. And consider: these companies used to be arch enemies in the long gone PC wars of the 1980s and 1990s. I give credit to Tim Cook’s vision. And we’re just in the relatively early stages of this partnership.

Think of what A-series plus Rosetta could do if Apple decided to do it. October 21, 2016 at 8:37 EST PM OneTokenRingToRuleThemAll October 21, 2016 I’m not sure you can classify IBM as a bitter enemy of Apple in the 1990’s. They did form the AIM alliance together with Motorola to develop, manufacture and implement the PowerPC chip starting in 1991. While it’s great to see them working closely again it isn’t the first time or like they’ve just finally mended fences. October 21, 2016 at 11:01 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

British car auctioneer Coys of Kensington just sold a 1964 Aston Martin DB5 for £825,000, which is a little over US$1 million. That’s the single largest Apple Pay transaction to date. Aston Martin DB5 sold for $1M with Apple Pay Coys said the transaction is the largest in-app purchase ever, and that it was done via the Vero social media platform. According to Coys, The car is one of the highly sought-after right hand drive silver birch models with red leather trim. It has undergone a full restoration—including engine rebuild, suspension and gearbox overhaul following 20 years in dry storage, during which time it was not used. For those who aren’t in the know, unlike the proud owner of this Aston Martin, Apple Pay is Apple’s mobile payment platform that makes credit card transactions more secure. Your card number and personally identifying information aren’t linked to specific purchases. Instead, single use digital tokens act as the go-between for sellers and credit card accounts. Apple Pay launched in October 2014 with the release of iOS 8.1. The iPhone 6 and newer, along with Apple Watch, support using the payment system at credit card terminals through NFC wireless communication. You authenticate purchases with your fingerprint by pressing the Touch ID-enabled Home button. It’s a handy payment system and faster than chip-and-pin credit card readers. Apple Pay adoption is growing around the world, but isn’t yet a defacto standard. It is, however, up to the task of handling a million dollar car sale. Unfortunately, the buyer of this DB5 wants to stay anonymous, so you’re out of luck if you were planning on calling up your long lost cousin for a joy ride.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple How to stop specific contacts from knowing when you’ve read their iMessages Zach Epstein BGR NewsOctober 22, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Apple's iOS 10 software has been available for a while now. In fact, the latest version of Apple's popular mobile platform is already installed on more than two-thirds of all active iOS devices in the world, and we're likely less than a week away from seeing the next major build, iOS 10.1, released to the public. Tens of millions of people use iOS 10 each day, and yet Apple added so many new features to the platform that many people miss things they would actually benefit from a great deal. Among the new features that often go unnoticed by many is the option to control iMessage read receipts on a per-contact basis. That's right, you can stop specific contacts from knowing when or even if you read their messages. In this post, we'll tell you exactly how to do it. DON'T MISS: iPhone 7 Plus vs Google Pixel speed tests: Closer, but Android was still crushed in the end Everyone knows that you can enable or disable read receipts across the board by opening the Settings app and toggling read receipts on or off from within the Messages menu. Most people want to leave them on, but there are always a few contacts who send you messages and you don't want them to know if and when you've read them. This is one of those iPhone and iPad features where, once you find out how easy it is, you want to kick yourself for not having noticed it before. Here's all you need to do: From within the Messages app, open a conversation with the contact in question Tap the "i" in the top-right corner On that screen, you'll see a setting for "Send Read Receipts" — toggle it to off That's it. This setting will override your global setting and this specific contact will no longer know when you open his or her messages.

Busiest day for earnings, GDP and more coming in the next week CNBC 10/21/2016 Evelyn Cheng A flood of earnings, U.S. economic growth and some Fed speakers are set to hit markets in the coming week, and could help add confidence to a picture of moderate growth and an end to the earnings recession.  Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 719.07 -19.94 -2.70% Alphabet Inc GOOGL ▼ 753.22 -18.53 -2.40% About a third of S&P 500 (.SPX) companies are scheduled to report next week, including Apple (AAPL) on Tuesday. Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google's parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are set to post quarterly results on Thursday, the busiest day of the earnings season. "If nothing changes … we would say we came out of the earnings recession this quarter and that the second quarter was the final quarter of this earnings recession," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Financials, materials and technology are expected to show the most earnings per share growth this quarter, Stovall said, while energy industrials and telecom are forecast to be the laggards.  In the past week, financials were among the top performers after the major bank earnings topped expectations. The S&P 500 gained about 8 points for the week to end at 2,141 Friday. Next week, "I think really the big focus is going to be on earnings," said Casey Clark, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede. "I think we're in a situation where investors are focusing on earnings and traditional drivers of equity markets. Part of that is there's more comfort on global central bank policy." A UBS study in October showed that over the last five years, the S&P 500 moves more in sync with earnings per share than the level of interest rates. The correlation between stocks and earnings was very high, almost 90 percent, vs. less than 40 percent correlation between stocks and interest rates. The average year-end S&P 500 target is 2,198, according to CNBC's Market Strategist Survey conducted in October. But strategists are watching whether earnings growth will sustain further gains in the market.  "Next year's earnings look too high, and that might mean the market is a tad more expensive than it looks, but it's helpful that the third-quarter earnings [are beating so far]," said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at TIAA Global Asset Management, which has about $915 billion in assets under management. "We're still making our way out of this period where energy earnings look weak compared to where they were one year ago," Nick said. Most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates at its December meeting, but will watch data ahead of the central bank's meeting on Nov. 1 and 2. The Markit manufacturing and services PMI are scheduled for release next Monday and Wednesday, respectively. Three Fed speakers are set to speak Monday ahead of the blackout period heading into the Fed's meeting Nov. 1 and 2. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard speaks on the U.S. economy and monetary policy Monday morning, while Chicago Fed President Charles Evans is set to speak on current economic conditions and monetary policy in the afternoon. Fed Governor Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later in the day on the future of Treasury market settlement. The first read on U.S. gross domestic product is due next Friday, and the consensus estimate from Reuters is 2.5 percent. The final read on second-quarter GDP showed an annual rate of 1.4 percent growth. A print between 1.5 percent and 3 percent is "probably a number consistent with the Fed passing in November but hiking in December," said John Canally, chief economic strategist at LPL Financial. Other data scheduled for release next week include the Markit manufacturing and services PMI, the employment cost index, consumer sentiment and pending home sales. Overseas, the preliminary estimate on third-quarter U.K. GDP is due for release Thursday, the first full-quarter GDP data since the surprise U.K. vote to leave the European Union. "Brexit negotiations [are] always on slow boil every week and next week is no different," Canally said. "A very weak number on the U.K.[GDP] may weaken Prime Minister May's hand temporarily." European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is scheduled to speak Tuesday in Berlin on "Stability, Equity and Monetary Policy."

According to Eric Smith, Strategy Analytics’ senior tablet and touchscreen strategies analyst, the first PowerBook’s impact “is still shaking the industry today.” Just as the telephone led to people’s demanding TV’s invention, the desktop PC had business users in particular asking when a genuinely portable counterpart would land. As the ‘80s became the ‘90s, Toshiba and Compaq had started on the right track and had taken an early lead in the very nascent laptop market. But Apple loves nothing more than a benchmark to beat. “Apple has done a very good job of letting the market test new technologies for a bit before they refine it and send it through the reality distortion field to make the tech new again,” said Smith. And the PowerBook was the perfect example. It was the lightest and best-looking laptop on the market thanks to some industrial design and miniaturisation input from Sony. But the single feature that made it revolutionary was an integrated trackpad and somewhere for the user to rest his or her wrists while typing so that it was actually comfortable to use. “Apple’s focus on industrial design and mobility paved the way for even slimmer PC designs to the point that tablets and 2-in-1 devices are now powerful enough to handle most day-to-day activities,” Smith said. The computer was an instant hit. For a brief period, the PowerBook owned 40 per cent of the portable computing market. But within a year it was gone because once they’d got the recipe, it didn’t take long for other companies to catch up. And while Apple continued to innovate in the portable computing sphere, it wasn’t until Steve Jobs returned that those ideas — integrated Wi-Fi, titanium shell, USB ports, a widescreen display — would translate into sales and a return to the top of the market for premium products, at least. Since 1991 the notebook has gone from a business device to the de facto computer form. According to Strategy Analytics data, the global computer sales split is currently 65 per cent notebook versus 35 per cent desktop. When the original PowerBook launched, all laptop sales accounted for just 5 per cent of the entire PC market. “What’s particularly interesting is how Microsoft finally turned the tables on Apple with its Surface Pro 2-in-1 device precisely at a time — 2014-to-2015 — when Apple laptops were taking serious market share from PC competitors,” points out Smith. In just three years, the Surface Pro has potentially had as much impact on the world of computing — ushering in the two-in-one form factor — as that first PowerBook. “We estimate 25 per cent of all tablets sold will be two-in-ones in 2020, totalling around 60 million units,” explains Smith. But of course there is also still a big demand for innovative notebook computers and it’s no coincidence Apple is currently gearing up for the launch of its latest-generation MacBook Pro. But will it usher in another revolution? — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Sony seeks to patent method for measuring journalists' accuracy The best action cams for winter sports Consumer drone business stumbles, but commercial markets beckon Apple now sells refurbished iPhones Robotic dinosaur replicas stomp in Tokyo hotel (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Malaysian gaming content exports soar 75pc to RM80m Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Models with Down Syndrome team up with celebrities Reuters Video: Reflection ‘healthy’ for Democratic party, says Obama 'Beauty and the Beast' first full-length trailer Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Related Articles Samsung seeks redemption with AI-infused Galaxy S8 phone Huawei wants to beat Apple in smartphones in two years Five luxury laptops for stylish and powerful portable computing TAG Heuer invades Apple’s home turf with Silicon Valley office Apple’s new laptop gets more touchy, but not on its screen Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were launched in Thailand yesterday. - + Sales of the highly anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in Thailand, buoyed by record-high discounts and promotions offered by mobile operators, have exceeded the expectations of local handset distributors. The iPhone 7 Plus has seen much higher demand than expected and is difficult to find in stores, thanks to the appeal of dual cameras, the popularity of the Jet Black colour and the problems endured by Samsung's Galaxy Note 7. Instead of massive lines outside Bangkok's flagship Apple stores as seen in previous handset debuts, only a few people were waiting to buy the new iPhones. Companies operating in Thailand have temporary suspended their marketing and advertising activities to express sympathy after the death of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus feature the same 4.7 and 5.5-inch screen sizes, and will be available in three storage configurations: 32 gigabytes, 128GB and 256GB. Prices of the new iPhone duo with 32GB capacity start at 26,500 and 31,500 baht, respectively. Total Access Communication (DTAC), the country's second-largest mobile operator, is offering the most attractive discount of 6,000 baht on purchase of one of the new iPhones when customers register a 12-month postpaid mobile service for 899 baht a month. Customers, who sign up for a 12-month postpaid service for 999 baht a month or over and make a 3,000-baht payment in advance, will get the next iPhone released if they stay in DTAC's network after one year. Customers migrating from other networks will receive an extra 1,500 baht discount on top of the 6,000-baht discount offering when they register a 599-baht service contract. True Move is offering a discount of 3,000 baht for customers who sign up for a 699-baht mobile service plan for one year and make a 1,500 baht payment in advance. Those who sign up for 899 and 1,099 baht tariff plans will get discounts of 6,000 and 8,000 baht for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, respectively. They are required to make a payment of 3,000 and 4,000 baht in advance, respectively. Mobile leader Advanced Info Service is discounting 2,000 baht for a purchase of an iPhone 7 for registering its prepaid service at 399 baht package for one year. Nutchanon Boonsorn, associate market analyst of IDC Thailand, said the three major mobile operators are making aggressive moves quietly at this time, and not keeping with tradition where fans queued to be among first in the country to get their hands on the latest iPhone.

Apple sees two-thirds of its revenues from the iPhone, but the fastest growing division within Apple is the Services category, which includes iTunes and Apple Music. Wireless provider AT&T looks to be Time Warner's major suitor. Shares of the company rose more than 8% Friday after reports from Bloomberg and the Journal said AT&T is in advanced talks to be acquired by telecom giant AT&T. Beyond wireless plans, AT&T is now also a major player in both broadband distribution, via its U-Verse network, and owns satellite provider DirecTV. There were reports in 2015 that Apple was looking to get into original programming, a la Netflix and Amazon, to feed iTunes, which offers movies, TV shows and music from the major studios and labels. Instead, a production company announced a TV show, Planet of the Apps, produced in association with Apple, that will be an American Idol of sorts for the app world. Actresses and digital mavens Jessica Alba and Gwyneth Paltrow have signed as "mentors." Apple had no comment. Time Warner had $28 billion in revenue in 2015,  vs. $234 billion for Apple's fiscal 2015.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Apple's First iOS Developer Academy Opens October 6 at University of Naples Apple's First iOS Developer Academy Opens October 6 at University of Naples Wednesday, 5 October 2016 Apple's first iOS Developer Academy is set to open this week at the University of Naples Federico II's new San Giovanni a Teduccio campus, located in a coastal suburb east of Naples, Italy. The campus will see Apple teaching 200 Italian students how to write code to create apps that will run on Apple's iOS devices during the nine month course. Students will be provided with a current-generation MacBook, iPhone, and iPad, along with tuition, all for free. More than 4,000 students applied for 200 spots during an open enrollment program. Next year, more spots will be available, as the university plans to accept 400 students. Leopoldo Angrisani, a professor who has helped get the program up and running, spoke with The Guardian and shared some details on the campus ahead of its opening on October 6. Apple had a hand in the design of the academy, which is housed in one of three modern-looking buildings with glass facades. The layout of the large, open-plan classroom was designed by Apple. "The didactic model is very new [for us]," Angrisani said. Small groups of students will sit at round tables equipped with special acoustic systems so the teacher can communicate with each table individually about their work. All courses will be taught in English, since it is meant to be open to students from around the world. "Competition will be a fundamental part of the class," Angrisani said. Couches and a lounge area are included in the classroom, giving students a chance to rest, and Apple expects collaboration between students will be a key part of the classroom experience. "Apple thinks that all of these activities, learning and rest and so on, have to stay very close to each other, because this is the best way to ensure that the concepts are absorbed and understood very well," Angrisani told The Guardian. During its visit to the campus, The Guardian was shown the classroom where classes will be held, but was not allowed to sit in on a meeting where an Apple official was instructing academy teachers. University officials also said Apple had been "very, very" involved in the work at the academy, down to details like the lighting in the classroom and the color on the walls. In the past, Apple has said the iOS Developer Academy will be expanded to other countries around the world in the future.Tags: Italy, iOS Developer Academy Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: MultiVu - on October 4, 2016< > Embed OKSTATE & NYPhil Reveal Partnership 01:30 Oklahoma State University (OSU) and the New York Philharmonic announced a residency partnership marking the opening of the new McKnight Center for the Performing Arts at OSU in October, 2019.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Hide Your Kids, Hide Your Car – The iPhone 7 Explodes And Sets Car On Fire As Well By Ramish Zafar Posted 3 weeks ago 279Shares Share Tweet Submit As we exit 2016, we’ll have witnessed a lot of controversy. It’s been a slow year for mobile all around, as manufacturers wait for major hardware upgrades next year. For devices, we’ve seen a couple of great flagships and designs. Of the latter, it’s been the LG G5’s year, as the Korean manufacturer becomes the first to present a modular flagship smartphone. For new features, it’s another Korean manufacturer Samsung who brought Iris scanning on top tier devices. Apple took a much subtle approach, with the iPhone’s major changes being less visible. However, when it comes to explosions, both Apple and Samsung aren’t safe from infamy. An iPhone 7 has recently exploded causing significant damage in its wake. Take a look below to find out more. Newly Bought Apple iPhone 7 Catches Fire In Australia Severely Damaging Car In Process As the year ends, a lot of users will be vary of their smartphones. Samsung’s aforementioned Galaxy Note 7 will be the primary reason behind this. The device’s faulty design/batteries have forced the Korean tech giant to suspend production and issue a complete recall. This has affected its brand reputation significantly and has resulted in the device being banned on airlines completely. Now, it’s looking like the Note 7 isn’t the only device that is susceptible to combustion. We’ve been seeing a lot of similar reports surface for the iPhone 7 as well. While the majority of these just might be inauthentic, a couple do look to be the real deal. One of these, which has surfaced today claims considerable damage. It’s from Australia and shows a malfunctioning iPhone 7 that has left a lot of damage in its wake. Advertisement Surfer Matt Jones had purchased Apple’s iPhone 7 only a week back. On one of his trips to the beach, Jones left the smartphone under his clothes in his car. When he returned, he was surprised on two accounts. Both his car and iPhone 7 were on fire, in an unfortunate display of the age old proverb ‘two birds, one stone’. Jones was quick to record the remains of his phone, clothes and car. You can take a look at them in the images above. He believes that the iPhone is the source of the fire, and we’re inclined to concur. Jones also further claims that he hasn’t used any third party charging accessories with the iPhone in question. While this is likely to be an isolated incident, the recent misfortune surrounding Samsung does breed some uncanny correlation. Apple’s taken note of these events and is investigating the matter. It’s been an interesting year folks, with some rather unusual patters. Let us know what you think in the comments section below and stay tuned for the latest.

Home Fe columnist Still forbidden fruit Still forbidden fruit India wants Apple, but bureaucracy won’t let it happen By: The Financial Express | Published: October 22, 2016 6:19 AM In the case of phone manufacturers like Apple, there is very little the company can source since there are no suppliers for parts that it requires and shifting designing, if at all, takes time. (Source: Reuters) Given how desperately the government wanted to woo high-profile US companies like Apple, it is truly amazing how it has allowed itself to be thwarted by the bureaucracy every step of the way. What makes it all the more nonplussing is that the Narendra Modi government was elected on the premise it would change many of the growth-restricting policies brought in by the UPA—the single-brand retail policy was a classic example. The UPA’s 30% local-sourcing norm never made sense since, given a choice, every firm wants to do more local sourcing to cut on both logistics costs as well as import duties which, after the NDA came in, are as high as 11% for phones that are not made in India—what keeps firms from doing more local sourcing is the fact that the local market is simply not developed enough, and developing quality suppliers can take years, if not decades. In the case of phone manufacturers like Apple, there is very little the company can source since there are no suppliers for parts that it requires and shifting designing, if at all, takes time. That is also the reason why, despite all the talk by firms like Foxconn, no real phone manufacturing plant has been set up in the country so far. It took the NDA a year-and-a-half to study what was needed to change the policy. Yet, when it came out in November last year, the policy was vague—it said the government ‘may’ ‘relax’ sourcing norms for products that had ‘state-of-art’ and ‘cutting-edge’ technology and where ‘local sourcing (was) not possible’. The policy offered no clarity on whether the local sourcing would be relaxed or not, what relaxation meant, what cutting-edge and state-of-art were and who would decide whether local sourcing was not possible. But government officials privately said the policy was meant to ensure Apple came in—presumably, Apple was told the same thing since it then applied to set up its own shops here. Yet, the application was rejected by the very government that was wooing Apple. The government went back to the drawing board and, seven months later, it unveiled a policy it chose to describe as full of ‘radical changes’. Yet, the bureaucracy ensured the language was even vaguer. This time around, the local sourcing norms were to be ‘relax(ed)’ for ‘up to three years’, after which there would be ‘a relaxed sourcing regime for another five years’ for firms which had ‘state-of-art’ and ‘cutting-edge’ technologies. Apart from the vagueness of the earlier norms, new ones were introduced—how much was the initial relaxation going to be for, how much relaxation would there be? Naturally enough, though the same officials said Apple would now come in, Apple has not applied under even the NDA’s second iteration of the law. While the government had said that Apple has been told of the changes, the US Trade Representative brought up restrictive single-brand retail norms with the commerce minister on Thursday. If the government doesn’t really want Apple to set up shop here, it should give up the pretence of changing the law to woo it—but if it really wants Apple but is being stymied by the bureaucracy, that’s an even bigger shame.

So much so that they announced that the Apple Watch would be available in high-end departmental stores like the Galeries Lafayette in Paris. However it seems that Apple’s luxury plans could be coming to an end because according to a report from French website Mac4Ever (via 9to5Mac), the Apple Watch booth/store-within-a-store inside the Galeries Lafayette could be closing down soon. The report claims that they are 99% certain that these booths will be closed come January 2017. It also seems that Apple has been reducing the number of staff working in the store, and ultimately it is expected that the remaining staff be redeployed to other Apple Stores in the city of Paris. Apparently this is due to the poor sales of the Apple Watch, although to date Apple has yet to provide exact figures of how many devices they have sold. Third-party analytical reports have suggested that as far as smartwatches are concerned, the Apple Watch is dominating. It also seems that Apple might have figured out that not many people are buying its $10,000 Apple Watch Edition, which is why with the Apple Watch Series 2, Apple has opted for a more affordable ceramic version in place of it.

Not to mention companies would have to partner up with banks and retailers to ensure compatibility. The good news is that if you are living in Germany, it seems that there is a good chance that Apple Pay could be making its way to your country in the near future. This is according to Apple’s website in which Germany was highlighted as one of the markets that Apple Pay is available. However it should be noted that Apple’s website has since been updated and Apple Pay’s availability in Germany has been removed. However we can only assume that based on this, Apple Pay could be eventually announced for the market, and that the image went up ahead of an official announcement. We have no idea when the announcement will take place, but hopefully it will be soon. Apple is hosting an event on the 27th of October to announce their new Macs, but it is possible that Apple Pay’s expansion into other markets could also be announced then, so do check back with us next week for the details.

AP Friday, October 21, 2016 SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- Apple says it has been buying Apple chargers and cables labeled as genuine on Amazon.com and has found nearly 90 percent of them to be counterfeit. The revelation comes in a federal lawsuit filed by Apple against a New Jersey company on Monday over what Apple says are counterfeit products that were sold on Amazon. In the lawsuit, Apple says Mobile Star imprinted Apple logos on cables and chargers that "pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock." It says the chargers and cables were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products. Apple says it purchased the products on Amazon and later told the online retailer that they were fake. Amazon then identified Mobile Star as the source. Amazon isn't named in the suit, but said in a statement that it has "zero tolerance" for counterfeiters on its site and that it pursues "wrongdoers" aggressively. Mobile Star didn't return a voicemail seeking comment. Some warnings to look for in phony products include misspellings in product description and the charging cord should plug in perfectly with the charger.

A deal, which could happen as early as this weekend, would unite AT&T’s wireless, broadband and satellite TV brands with Time Warner’s entertainment empire, which includes cable networks such as TNT, TBS, CNN, the prized HBO channel, and the Warner Bros. film and TV studio. Talks toward a cash-and-stock purchase have come together quickly and could stall or fall through, said people familiar with the matter. Time Warner is seeking a deal that values it north of $100 a share, or about $80 billion, one of the people said.

Apple Inc. approached Time Warner about a merger a few months ago and while those talks are no longer active, Apple continues to monitor the situation, a person familiar with the situation said. If a Time Warner sale occurs that could encourage other telecom and media companies to pursue their own combinations. Time Warner shares rose 8 percentto $89.48 after The Wall Street Journal reported a deal could be imminent, while AT&T fell 3 percent to $37.49, both at 4 p.m. on Friday. An AT&T-Time Warner merger would be the most ambitious marriage of content and distribution since Comcast Corp.’s 2011 purchase of NBCUniversal and would create a behemoth that rivals that cable giant. Its value potentially would stand as the biggest media deal in recent years: Time Warner has a market capitalization of $72 billion and AT&T’s is $226 billion. A deal of its size would get intense regulatory scrutiny. U.S. regulatory officials have showed misgivings about conditions on the Comcast-NBCU deal—in particular, whether merger obligations on Comcast were enforceable—so it is unclear if they will be willing to bless another such merger. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes struck up talks in recent weeks, with support from internal teams, the people familiar with the matter said. Veteran entertainment executive Peter Chernin, who has an online video joint venture with AT&T, has informally advised AT&T on its bid, one of the people said. A sale of Time Warner to AT&T would have echoes of the blockbuster 2000 AOL-Time Warner merger — then the largest deal of all time. That was a different bet on a converged media future, one in which AOL’s internet service would have complemented and boosted Time Warner’s content. But the merger ultimately proved a failure, hurt by the unraveling of the dot-com boom, a clash of cultures and poor assumptions about the way each business could help the other. Dallas-based AT&T has been reshaping its strategy in recent years, as the U.S. cellular business became saturated and years of consolidation in that sector left no room for major deals. AT&T’s attempt to buy T-Mobile was killed by regulators in 2011. AT&T has turned to video, with the nearly $50 billion acquisition of DirecTV last year, instantly making it the biggest player in pay television. That pay TV business faces headwinds as more consumers cut the cord or look to trim their monthly bills, with streaming services providing new competition in the marketplace. Owning Time Warner’s content — including HBO’s “Game of Thrones” and professional sports games—could bring AT&T new growth and assets that would help its streaming media ambitions. With AT&T’s $117.3 billion in long-term debt at the end of June, a Time Warner deal could give the telecom company a balance sheet with debt hitting almost $200 billion, according to analysts at New Street Research. Bloomberg reported on Thursday that senior executives of AT&T and Time Warner had met in recent weeks to hold preliminary discussions on various business strategies, including a possible merger. Since the AOL-Time Warner deal, much has changed, and the mashup of mobile, broadband and TV that has long been anticipated has been taking shape quickly. Consumers are streaming shows on phones and tablets, signing up for TV services without a connection from a traditional cable or satellite provider, and doing much of their media consumption on social media platforms such as Facebook. Time Warner’s Bewkes has positioned his company as a pure content player in recent years, spinning off AOL as well as the Time Warner Cable pay-TV unit and the Time Inc. magazine-publishing division. In 2014, Bewkes fought off an unsolicited takeover bid from 21st Century Fox, indicating Time Warner wanted a far higher price than the initial roughly $80 billion offer that was on the table. (21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal-owner News Corp share common ownership.) Bewkes since has sought to persuade Wall Street he can run Time Warner effectively as a stand-alone outfit in a media world where a few distribution giants are achieving enormous scale. To answer the concern that Netflix and other streaming services are appealing to cord-cutters and people who never sign up for cable in the first place, he launched the HBO Now streaming service, which had nearly a million subscribers as of March. Time Warner also carried out cost cuts and layoffs and continued big content investments. Among media players, Time Warner is attractive because it doesn’t have a big shareholder with effective control and because it is relatively well-positioned for a media world where cable TV distributors want to carry skinnier bundles of channels. Time Warner has only a few major networks — some of which, like TNT and TBS, carry high-value sports content — compared with companies that have a host of channels with small audiences. Acquiring Time Warner also would get AT&T further into the streaming business with Hulu. Time Warner bought a 10 percent stake in Hulu in August, joining Walt Disney Co., 21st Century Fox and NBCUniversal as an owner in the $5.8 billion video service. AT&T also is launching a DirecTV online service aimed at selling a robust package of TV channels.

(Randi Lynn Beach/Bloomberg News) By Matt Schudel October 21 David Bunnell, who founded a series of innovative magazines in the 1980s chronicling the emerging world of computers, including PC Magazine, PC World and Macworld, and who played a large role in making computers accessible to the general public, died Oct. 18 at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 69. The cause was pancreatic cancer, his wife, Jacqueline Poitier, told the San Francisco Chronicle. Mr. Bunnell, a onetime student radical and teacher on a Native American reservation, became a magazine publisher almost by accident. He was working in Albuquerque in the 1970s as a technical writer for a start-up electronics company named Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, or MITS. In 1975, the company introduced the first commercially succesful microcomputer, the Altair 8800, which launched the beginning of the personal computer revolution. Mr. Bunnell began to edit a company newsletter about the computer and helped coordinate a convention for enthusiasts of the Altair. Two young programmers he knew at MITS, Bill Gates and Paul Allen, went on to found Microsoft. Mr. Bunnell stayed in Albuquerque and developed his first general-interest magazine for computer users, Personal Computing, in the late 1970s. “The idea I had when I created Personal Computing,” he said in 1984, “was that the personal computer market needed a consumer magazine that was for nontechnical people who wanted to get something out of the computer without knowing how to program it.” When the magazine’s publisher refused to give Mr. Bunnell an ownership stake, he quit and moved to San Francisco. He found a job as a word processor while conceiving the idea for another magazine built around the newly launched IBM personal computer. Working from a spare bedroom in his house, Mr. Bunnell and a small staff put together the first issue of PC Magazine, which debuted in January 1982. He was publisher and editor in chief. It was an immediate success, combining technical articles with cheeky, opinionated writing, glossy photography, colorful graphics and profiles of rising stars in the world of technology. “He produced his magazines in the language of the man on the street,” Samir Husni, director of the Magazine Innovation Center at the University of Mississippi, said in an interview. “He was an artist in terms of humanizing the machine. He destroyed the wall between the computer and the consumer.” Mr. Bunnell had an agreement in place in late 1982 to sell PC Magazine to International Data Group, a publisher of other high-tech publications. Before the deal was completed, the principal investor in PC Magazine sold it to a different company without informing Mr. Bunnell. Furious at what he considered a betrayal, Mr. Bunnell obtained financial backing from IDG to launch a competing magazine and took 48 of his 52 staff members with him. When the new publication, PC World, appeared in January 1983, it set industry records for advertising. Mr. Bunnell was sued for copyright infringement and other issues, but he prevailed in court, winning a settlement of $9 million. Flush with the success of PC World, Mr. Bunnell premiered yet another magazine, Macworld, which was designed to appeal to users of the new Apple Macintosh computer. The first issue came out on Jan. 24, 1984, the same day Apple’s Steve Jobs publicly introduced the Mac. In 1985, Mr. Bunnell was a principal force behind Macworld Expo, one of the first high-tech conferences aimed at consumers instead of people within the computer industry. The Macworld Expo became the prototype for countless other consumer electronics gatherings and, for years, was Jobs’s preferred showcase for launching Apple products. Even as he became a publishing wunderkind and high-tech millionaire, Mr. Bunnell ­remained an activist at heart. In a PC World editorial in 1986, he lambasted Georgia’s anti-sodomy laws as a form of discrimination that would undermine the state’s goal of becoming the Silicon Valley of the South. “The PC promise is to preserve and enhance the power of the individual,” he wrote. The Georgia law “conflicts with the vision of personal freedom that compelled the growth of personal computers.” David Hugh Bunnell was born July 25, 1947, in Alliance, Neb., where his father was editor of the local newspaper. Mr. Bunnell joined his father at work at an early age and became the paper’s sports editor at 16. At the University of Nebraska, from which he graduated in 1969, Mr. Bunnell was president of the campus chapter of the activist group Students for a Democratic Society. He organized antiwar protests and led a march of 4,000 people to protest housing discrimination in Lincoln, Neb. After college, Mr. Bunnell taught school in Chicago and later on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. During a 1973 armed standoff between Native Americans and federal officials at Wounded Knee, S.D., Mr. Bunnell smuggled food to members of the American Indian Movement. In addition to his computer magazines, Mr. Bunnell launched other publications and online ventures that had limited success, including New Media, BioWorld, Upside Today, ­Content.com and ELDR, aimed at aging baby boomers. In 2000, Mr. Bunnell’s 26-year-old son, Aaron, who worked for his father as chief of content at Upside Today, a fledgling Internet news site, died from what medical examiners determined to be an overdose of alcohol, Valium and heroin. His death was considered a cautionary tale that exemplified the hard-charging, hard-partying life of young high-tech workers. “I believe my son was a victim of the dot-com boom,” Mr. Bunnell said. He struggled with drug and alcohol himself, overcoming his addictions through therapy and treatment. In later years, Mr. Bunnell became an advocate of healthy foods and dietary supplements. He was the co-author of “Count Down Your Age: Look, Feel, and Live Better Than You Ever Have Before” (2007). His first marriage, to the former Linda Essay, ended in divorce. Survivors include Poitier, his wife of 35 years and an original staff member of PC World; a daughter from his first marriage; two stepdaughters; and a brother. Shortly before his death, Mr. Bunnell completed a memoir, “Good Friday on the Rez: A Pine Ridge Odyssey,” about his experiences on the South Dakota Indian reservation and at Wounded Knee. It is expected to be published next year. Even as he was hailed as a visionary who recognized the early promise of the computer age, Mr. Bunnell harbored doubts about the benefits of the online revolution. “The overwhelming thrust of the personal computer is that it can liberate and empower people,” he told the Los Angeles Times in 1987. “Unfortunately, so far it has largely been a white males’ revolution. Rather than decentralizing society, it has perpetuated the powers that be.” Read more Washington Post obituaries Thom Jones, onetime janitor who shone as a literary star in the 1990s, dies at 71 Jack Fuller, Chicago Tribune editor, publisher and president, dies at 69 Michael Elliott, who held top positions at three newsweeklies, dies at 65  Share on FacebookShare   Share on TwitterTweet Share via Email Most Read 1 Trump just laid out a pretty radical student debt plan 2 Yale professor: My students aren’t snowflakes, and they don’t melt 3 In libel suit, Melania Trump says Maryland blogger held ‘reckless disregard for the truth’ 4 Spider crickets: The bugs you don’t want in your house this fall 5 No, Finland isn’t ditching traditional school subjects.

Time Warner owns the Warner Bros. studio, CNN, HBO and the Cartoon Network, is home to Harry Potter and Batman films, TV powerhouses The Big Bang Theory and Gotham and DC Comics. Apple sees two-thirds of its revenues from the iPhone, but the fastest growing division within Apple is the Services category, which includes iTunes and Apple Music. USA TODAY Time Warner shares soar on AT&T's interest Wireless provider AT&T looks to be Time Warner's major suitor. Shares of the company rose more than 8% Friday after reports from Bloomberg and the Journal said AT&T is in advanced talks to be acquired by telecom giant AT&T. Beyond wireless plans, AT&T is now also a major player in both broadband distribution, via its U-Verse network, and owns satellite provider DirecTV. There were reports in 2015 that Apple was looking to get into original programming, a la Netflix and Amazon, to feed iTunes, which offers movies, TV shows and music from the major studios and labels. Instead, a production company announced a TV show, Planet of the Apps, produced in association with Apple, that will be an American Idol of sorts for the app world. Actresses and digital mavens Jessica Alba and Gwyneth Paltrow have signed as "mentors." Apple had no comment. Time Warner had $28 billion in revenue in 2015,  vs. $234 billion for Apple's fiscal 2015. 6616 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2f0rNjR

The idea is that you tap your phone against the terminal, it registers the transaction, and you’re done, all without having to take out your wallet. However let’s not forget that Apple Pay can also be used to make in-app purchases, and more recently it seems that the most expensive Apple Pay in-app purchase has been registered at a whopping $1 million. So what on earth could be worth that much that can be bought within an app? Try a a 1964 Aston Martin DB5 (also known as the James Bond car). Yup, it seems that someone (the buyer has chosen to remain anonymous) decided to purchase a 1964 Aston Martin DB5 using Apple Pay via British automobile auction house Coys of Kensington through the Vero social networking app. According to Chris Routledge, the CEO of COYS, “This is an exciting achievement for COYS digital presence, which signals a new era for classic car sales.” He adds, “The ‘Buy Now’ feature on Vero will give informed and savvy collectors a crucial head start in a highly competitive market place. Collectors worldwide fight fiercely amongst themselves to obtain the best machines and we certainly feel that Coys presence on Vero will give our clients that essential edge.” It looks like if Apple ever needed a way to show the legitimacy of Apple Pay as a payment platform, this could be it.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Qualcomm could buy NXP, which supplies iPhones with NFC and motion-tracking chips By Christian Zibreg, Oct 21, 2016 Tweet 3 Comments Bloomberg’s Alex Sherman and Ian King reported yesterday that fabless chip designer and Apple supplier Qualcomm could be buying NXP Semiconductors, a global semiconductor and analog circuitry manufacturer headquartered in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. NXP employs approximately 45,000 people in more than 35 countries and provides chips that give Apple devices features like power-efficient motion tracking and NFC for Apple Pay. Qualcomm’s market valuation sits at around $100 billion versus a market cap of approximately $36 billion for NXP. The two chipmakers may announce an all-cash deal for $110 to $120 per share as early as next week, Bloomberg learned. The news gathering organization says the potential deal would represent the largest acquisition in the history of the semiconductor industry. The deal could be announced at NXP’s October 26 earnings or at Qualcomm’s earnings, due on November 2, according to Bloomberg. In May 2015, NXP announced that its NFC and embedded secure element technology was going to be used across Qualcomm’s Snapdragon-based chips. Why should you care? For starters, NXP is an important Apple supplier, just like Qualcomm. Every iPhone since the iPhone 5s has used at least two components from NXP. The iPhone 5s was the first major design win for the Dutch chip maker. That phone marked both Apple’s first 64-bit mobile chip with the A7 and a dedicated motion coprocessor in the form of the M7. The M7 is basically a customized NXP part. The chip calibrates and captures data from the onboard sensors like the gyroscope, accelerometer and compass—without needing to constantly engage the main A-series chip and while managing to consume only a tiny fraction of the power that the A7 chip requires. The M7 is outstandingly power efficient: it barely takes up any battery power even though it’s constantly running in the background and even continues tracking movement after the phone’s battery is long dead. The M7 in the iPhone 5s and the M8 in the iPhone 6 were discreet chips that NXP had manufactured itself. The iPhone 6s’s M9 and the M10 in the iPhone 7 are embedded into the mail Apple-designed processor for additional power savings. The M10 also monitors other sensors, such as the barometer, microphone, proximity sensor and ambient light sensor. That’s why you need an iPhone with an embedded M-series chip for features like always-listening “Hey Siri” and Raise to Wake, neither of which could be realized through the main A-series processor as that would draw too much power. Capabilities of the M-series chips are available to apps through the Core Motion API, which was introduced in iOS 7. Starting with the iPhone 6, NXP also became a supplier of near field communication (NFC) chips that make Apple Pay possible. By the way, NXP is the co-inventor of NFC technology along with Sony. IHS Technology analyst Don Tait pegged NXP’s share of the market for NFC chips at fifty percent in 2013. Its current market share is likely even higher, especially after design wins such as the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone 7. Here are some of the NXP devices found in iPhones: iPhone 5s/5c—Buried beneath a neoprene-looking cover of the Apple-branded M7 motion coprocessor is a label that identifies the chip as an NXP-made LPC18A1 device. The LPC18A1 integrates a Cortex-M3 CPU core from ARM and sports a customized packaging and naming scheme, indicating an Apple customized part. Another NXP chip, the 1610A1, is used as an interface integrated circuit for the display. iPhone 6—The M8 motion coprocessor is NXP’s LPC18B1UK ARM Cortex-M3 Microcontroller and the NFC module is an NXP-made 65V10 NFC chip with an NXP PN548 NFC controller inside, which is a previously unannounced variant of the PN544 and PN547 devices from NXP. The accompanying Secure Element (not to be confused with the Secure Enclave embedded in A-series chips) is on a second die packaged with the PN548 and labeled as “008”. iPhone 6s/SE—NFC is handled by an NXP PN66V10 NFC controller. It contains two die, the Secure Element labeled “008” and the NXP PN549. The handset also uses NXP’s 1610A3 chip (likely an iteration of the 1610A1 found in the iPhone 5s/5c) as an interface integrated circuit for the display, plus an NXP-branded M9 motion co-processor embedded in the main Apple-designed A9 chip. iPhone 7—An NFC controller in the iPhone 7 with package markings 67V04 confirms this is another NXP-supplied chip, likely the PN67V. The same NFC controller is also in the Apple Watch Series 2. Another NXP part labeled “610A38” can be seen on the back of the iPhone 7’s logic board. The M10 motion coprocessor, also an NXP part, is embedded in the main A10 Fusion chip. For the most part, Apple rebranded and customized NXP’s chips that provide iPhones with NFC features and power-efficient motion tracking capability. But good luck finding some of the LPC rage of semiconductors used in iPhones and iPads listed on the NXP website. Some off-the-shelf NXP parts used in iPhones and iPads are detailed on the company’s website, but many are not because they were likely built specifically for Apple. Many other Apple products use discreet chips from NXP. Apple’s Lightning cable, for instance, packs in NXP’s NX20P3 chip on the connector board with one huge transistor occupying over 75 percent of the die area. Apple Watches also contain Secure Elements as well as NFC controllers and radios from NXP. Apple, of course, is not the only company to source parts from NXP. Google’s latest Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, for example, incorporate an NXP-built NFC controller. It is labeled as “55102 1807 S0622” and highlighted in purple on iFixit’s photo seen below. The Pixel XL also uses a smart audio amplifier from NXP: the off-the-shelf TFA9891 part framed in green on the image included below. Samsung’s ill-fated Note 7 used NXP’s 67T05 NFC controller which provides NFC functions in the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge series, too. Founded in 1953, NXP was originally known as Philips Semiconductors. After selling itself to a consortium of private equity investors in 2006, Philips Semiconductors established a new name for itself: NXP. In December 2015, NXP merged with chip designer and manufacturer Freescale Semiconductor in a $40 billion dollar deal. The company trades on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol NXPI and currently owns more than 9,000 issued or pending patents. It has manufacturing and development facilities in Nijmegen, Netherland. Even if Qualcomm does acquire NXP, both companies are official Apple suppliers, meaning the Cupertino firm is probably going to continue licensing NXP technology directly from Qualcomm. The deal is probably a matter of “when”, not “if”. 2015 was the highest-volume year for semiconductor mergers and acquisitions: Avago bought Broadcom in a record-setting $37 billion deal and Intel coughed up $16.7 billion to snap up Altera.

The combination of a premium build, unmatched system performance, and tightly integrated software and services delivers what’s considered to be the gold standard in smartphone user experience. Over the past five years, Apple’s modem supplier was Qualcomm, but this year, Apple has taken a different approach with the decision to source two instead of one baseband chipset suppliers: Qualcomm and Intel. This created two distinct RF SKUs, one limited to GSM/WCDMA/LTE support (A1778, A1784), powered by Intel’s modem, and one with GSM/CDMA/WCDMA/TD-SCDMA/LTE support (A1660, A1661) powered by Qualcomm’s modem.  On the one hand, most high-end flagship devices launched this year are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820, with X12 Category 12 integrated modem (MDM9645M discrete part). The X12 modem is capable of up to 600Mbps peak downlink speeds, 3-Way Carrier Aggregation with 256 QAM, and also 4×4 MIMO on a single component carrier. Note that it is up to the smartphone manufacturers to decide which of these powerful capabilities will be integrated into their final product. The Verizon, Sprint and SIM Unlocked iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus variants are powered by Qualcomm’s MDM9645M modem, accompanied by two transceivers: WTR3925 and WTR4905. Out of all supported features by Qualcomm’s solution, Apple has chosen to implement 3-Way Carrier Aggregation on the downlink and 2-Way Carrier Aggregation on the uplink for contiguous Band 7 or Band 41. Higher Order Modulation (DL-256QAM, UL-64QAM), and Higher Order MIMO (4×4 MIMO) have not been implemented. Therefore, the peak theoretical downlink speeds are limited to 450Mbps when aggregating three 20MHz wide LTE component carriers. We have achieved the maximum 450Mbps by aggregating 20MHz wide Band 20, Band 1, and Band 7. EVS (Enhanced Voice Services), also known as Ultra HD Voice, offers significantly improved audio quality, numerous efficiencies at the physical and IP layer, and is fully supported by Qualcomm’s modem. However, Apple has made a decision to disable this feature likely to level the playing field between the Qualcomm, and Intel varaints. On the other hand, the iPhone 7 represents Intel’s first major design win in a long time. In many ways this iPhone appears to be Intel’s make or break it in the cellular modem business. Similar to Samsung’s in house Shannon LTE modem found in Exynos based devices, Intel has decided to license CEVA DSP cores for the XMM7360 modem coupled with in-house SMARTi 5 RF Transceivers and X-PMU 736 RF Power Management. The Intel XMM7360 modem also supports 3-Way Carrier Aggregation on the downlink and 2-Way Carrier Aggregation on the uplink, but lacks support for EVS, DL-256QAM/UL-64QAM, 4×4 MIMO. Ironically, mobile operators such as T-Mobile USA and Telstra which have been offering these advanced LTE features, are being supplied with the iPhone 7 with the Intel modem. While there haven’t been a shortage of iPhone 7 unboxing videos, subjective camera reviews, and more, we have been hard pressed to find any meaningful mention of cellular performance. This goes for any other flagship device on the market. In this day and age with mobile internet consumption at the all time high, we believe that a mobile device is only as good as its ability to seamlessly connect and maintain its connectivity with the mobile network. Most of the time mobile operators get blamed for dropped calls or session timeouts, but it’s often forgotten that the phone OEMs implementation of baseband, RF Front-End (RFFE), and the antenna design could play its role. We have been using the Rohde & Schwarz (R&S) CMWflexx setup containing two R&S CMW500 and one R&S CMWC controller, as well as the R&S TS7124 RF Shielded Box with four Vivaldi antennas. This study has been done entirely independently, and Cellular Insights takes full responsibility for the analysis and opinions in this report. We have self-funded the procurement of iPhone 7 Plus units through commercial retail channels. All units have been preloaded with the latest version of iOS (10.0.3) Consistent with our previous reviews, our focus has been on measuring the highest achievable LTE throughput in clean channel state, starting at RSRP value of -85dBm, and incrementally reducing radiated power level while maintaining Block Error Rate (BLER) under 2%. This allows us to measure RF sensitivity of the device under test while eliminating inter-cell interference and fully controlling the radiated environment. This also allows for high reproducibility and consistency of our tests, and takes into account the performance of the entire RFFE subsystem.  We’ve tested three unique LTE frequency bands, Band 12 (10MHz), Band 4 (20MHz), and Band 7 (20MHz) in 4×2 MIMO configuration using Transmission Mode 4. While both devices achieved the maximum sustained data rates at the cell center, simulating edge of cell scenarios by reducing power level did cause each iPhone to display two very different personalities. As the device attaches to eNodeB, it reports its LTE capability. To get this out of the way, 4×4 MIMO and 256QAM features are not supported on the iPhone 7 Plus. FDD LTE Band 12 is part of the lower 700MHz band plan, covering 15 MHz of contiguous spectrum across three blocks (A, B, C). Most LTE Band 12 deployments are either 5 MHz or 10 MHz wide even though Band 12 can theoretically be deployed up to 15 MHz widths. Coincidentally, LTE Band 12 capable devices are only certified to support up to 10 MHz operation. As opposed to mid and high band spectrum, low frequency such as 700MHz Band 12 can propagate further, penetrate the concrete structure better, and often times is the only LTE layer reaching the device. For this particular reason, high sensitivity of a smartphone receiver is extremely important in challenging signal conditions, and it could make a difference between completing and dropping a VoLTE call. Both iPhone 7 Plus variants perform similarly in ideal conditions. At -96dBm the Intel variant needed to have Transport Block Size adjusted as BLER well exceeded the 2% threshold. At -105dBm the gap widened to 20%, and at -108dBm to a whopping 75%. As a result of such a huge performance delta between the Intel and Qualcomm powered devices, we purchased another A1784 (AT&T) iPhone 7 Plus, in order to eliminate any possibility of a faulty device. The end result was virtually identical. We are hoping that this sudden dip in performance at a specific RSRP value will be further investigated by the engineering and hopefully resolved. At -121dBm, the Intel variant performed more in line with its Qualcomm counterpart. Overall, the average performance delta between the two is in the 30% range in favor of the Qualcomm variant.  Band 4 is the most commonly deployed LTE spectrum band in North America, while Band 7 deployments are spread across the rest of the globe. Mid and high spectrum bands are used to densify LTE networks and provide incremental capacity. Just like during our Band 12 tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem continues to struggle even at relatively higher RSRP values with unexplainable sharp dips in performance. The gap between the two variants is consistent and north of 30% again in favor of the Qualcomm variant. To put this into perspective, we have compared the edge of cell performance of a few other flagship devices to see how these iPhones compare in less than favorable conditions In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem. We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple’s decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone. Considering that the iPhone with the Qualcomm modem is being sold in China, Japan and in the United States only, we can not imagine that modem performance was a deciding factor. When all said and done, the iPhone 7 Plus is a beautifully designed smartphone, with arguably the best-in-class camera and system performance. It’s also the best iPhone ever. We hope that next year’s iPhone delivers best-in-class LTE performance.  banner 25 prev postSamsung Galaxy S7, the first 4×4 MIMO smartphone Milan M.P. view all post Leave a comment Comments (72) Reviewer • 4 weeks ago This is a great article. Could you please review the goole pixel cellular performance as well? reply brodie7838 • 4 weeks ago Agreed, great article - I too would love to see this updated with the Pixel (and others!). reply David Bannington • 4 weeks ago Could there be a connection between Intel modems and widespread reports of broken GPS/location services on some iPhone 7 and Pluses? https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7677433 reply Jon Dagle • 3 weeks ago David, the majority of problems in US seem to be on Verizon, so that's Qualcomm chip. I know of reports on AT&T and Sprint, and some European carriers--in UK I think. Many, but not all, report 10.0.3 or 10.1 fixed this. reply alex logvin • 4 weeks ago Excellent article, Milan! Love the charts. reply Georgi Dimitrov • 3 weeks ago It would have been an excellent one, if power measurements have been conducted too. Without it, it's nothing more than politics. reply Travis • 4 weeks ago Yes please review the Pixel radio compared to other phones. Out of all the reviews I have seen online for the Pixel no one actually reviewed the "phone". After all we demand these devices work well when no WiFi is around. reply Thomas Anderson • 4 weeks ago Please do not review Google Pixel. I don't care the result of it. Thank you. reply Dazza • 4 weeks ago Please dont read the article on the Pixel. Thank you reply John • 4 weeks ago Any way to determine which variant is in my personal iPhone 7 plus? reply Steven H. • 4 weeks ago Yes, easily. The article noted which carriers are selling the one with the Qualcomm modem. If you bought it outright, was it for use on one of those carriers? reply Holger • 4 weeks ago The model number of your iPhone is printed on the back of the device. reply Brian B. • 3 weeks ago You can also find the model number by going to Settings > General > Regulatory. reply ilikemyprivacy • 4 weeks ago A few thoughts: 1. Thanks for doing this, so little information available on RF performance of phones which is so critical for performance, battery life, etc. 2. I would be interested to see you rerun this test with the iOS 10 Beta. The latest beta includes modem firmware 1.25.00 on the Qualcomm version which seems to help significantly with a variety of issues 3. If possible, it'd be great to look at a comparison for other RF front end features like envelope tracking, antenna tuning, etc. between the Intel and Qualcomm models as we.. reply Walt French • 4 weeks ago Great article; thanks. Maybe I missed it, but I didn't see in the article what features in the new Intel modem differed from the 6S's MDM9635M. As the comparison chart makes the two parts look very similar, what appears is that the 9645's new features are (today) a year ahead of the 9635 and the Intel part. reply Marcus • 4 weeks ago My question is the one with the Qualacom modem vs Intel was there any correlation between battery life too? If the qualacom works better does it use more battery power based on tests than the Intel. Just trying to gage it if i do decide to purchase a iPhone 7 reply Flash • 4 weeks ago Thanks for sharing. Was this test conducted using the latest update iOS 10.0.3 which includes a fix for a bug that could cause issues with cellular connectivity, a problem that only affected the new iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus? Thanks. reply Dazza • 4 weeks ago Yes. It says so in the article reply Tom • 4 weeks ago Great article, I really liked your introduction paragraph! reply Maxwell • 4 weeks ago Can you do a review on the ZTE Axon 7 signal strength and LTE performance please and thank you reply Prasad • 4 weeks ago Marcus, Assume you are downloading a file that is 70MB in size. If your iPhone with Qualcomm chip downloads this in half the time, it will be able to go to sleep that much faster. It is not necessary that the performance is obtained at the cost of power. reply VP • 4 weeks ago So if this is the case my iPhone 7 Plus purchased thru T-Mobile should not have any Verizon or Sprint connectivity. However when accessing carrier in settings it scans for available networks & finds T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon & Sprint. It should not be possible due to hardware limitations. I couldn't get mine on release day even with pre-order. Could the demand & backlog have prompted Apple to add Qualcomm modems to all models? reply WiWavelength • 4 weeks ago VP, the available network scan on your 3GPP only baseband is detecting the LTE networks for VZW and Sprint, not their CDMA2000 networks. The latter use PRL based network selection, not user initiated network selection. AJ reply Eric • 4 weeks ago It would be great if you could provide a picture of the test setup. reply Yang • 4 weeks ago Without testing environment and setup specified, this type of comparison is less meaningful reply Jupiter Antunes • 4 weeks ago One important point must be kept in the picture, not only the modems makes the differences but the Antenna with the Modems. One significant information should be the Return Loss of the antenna scanning the channels in a Band. If a LAB is reading this could do it for us... thanks. reply Ehsan • 4 weeks ago Qualcomm should ask Apple for "Qualcomm Inside" sticker on the phones with Q chip. reply no • 3 weeks ago no reply Joe • 4 weeks ago If you swapped an Intel variant iPhone out at the Apple Store under warranty, would they supply you with another Intel or do they use the Qualcomm version for warranty replacements? reply Justin • 3 weeks ago Whenever you turn in a warranty claim, most likely you will receive a refurbished unit. Not a brand new one when you first buy/order. I would return it under the 30 day window and purchase another one personally. Although the phone is new, you could still potentially get a refurb reply Robert • 4 weeks ago It wold be interesting to see how the two different transceiver (RF + modem) compare in case of carrier aggregation that are in harmonic relationship, such as B12 as the primary carrier transmitting at 710 MHz and B4 as the secondary carrier with receive frequency at 2130. In this case the 3rd harmonic of the B12 transmitter lands right in B4 receiver thus potentially de-sensing it and degrading the throughput when the B12 TX power is high (cell-edge scenario). reply Ed • 4 weeks ago I am still waiting for Anandtech to do their digging. And offering some explanation to why. The Intel Modem is based on TSMC 28nm. Qualcomm X12 is on 20nm. ( Only the X16 is on 14nm FinET I believe ). X12 is / could be even better then the coming Intel offering 7480, which is STILL manufactured by TSMC. Why did Apple decide to use the newer X12 when they know the older MDM9635 was enough compared to Intel's 7360? Not supporting 4x4 MIMO in X12 was a rather simple decision because less then 10% of the network in the world support it, and no phone has yet to manage 4x4 MIMO inside. A some other details like X12 wasn't a true 4x4 MIMO and require separate chip to do so, while X16 is a true 4x4 MIMO. And I am pretty sure an Software update could make EVS possible. Whether or not they will do it is entirely different matter. What cost / patent issues are involved? reply Luka • 4 weeks ago How it could be achived more than 150M for SGS7edge on one carrier Band4? reply PD • 3 weeks ago 4X4 MIMO reply R • 3 weeks ago 2X2 MiMo single carrier using 64QAM is 75Mbps x 2... 150Mbps and 3CA with same config is 150Mbps x 3 giving 450Mbps peak.... too bad Apple did not use 256QAM! reply Luka • 3 weeks ago Then I would expect more than 180Mbps reply Bjoern • 4 weeks ago Nice rewiew, and measurements on the poewer drawn by both modules when performing differently? reply Mark • 3 weeks ago This is a great article. I happen to live in an area that gets marginal reception but I never knew it because I had a Nokia 928 from Verizon. When i finally had to trade it in after a couple of years, I tried the iphone 6S and found the reception to be horrible. I traded it in for a Galaxy S6 and was told "no more trades" so I was forced to keep it. That also had horrible reception at my house. My signal varies from -105 to -115 and calls constantly get dropped. My girlfriends Galaxy S5 worked great at my house and I took that as a sign as the antenna design changing in the Galaxies between the S5 and the S6...which I found to be true. When her phone was ready for replacement I searched around and found no bad things were said about the HTC10 reception. At my encouragement, she got the HTC 10 and gets great reception at my house. I have been searching for some sort of articles on antenna testing and this report is just what I was looking for. I would, however, like to see a wider range of phones tested. It would be interesting to see how that HTC10 does against the iphone and galaxy. And, I would also like to see how the new Droid Z and the Pixel fare. thank you again reply Alexander • 3 weeks ago Thank you for your effort, Milan. It would be nice to see the error bars on the graphs and the statistical comparison for the low signal LTE examples. Given the low average current networks speed limits (9-40 Gbs) it would be crucial to magnify graphs accordingly. I am going to use my phone mostly on the European GSM networks, so having A1661 with CDMA capability would not grant automatic CDMA network switch with European sim or ...?And of course after all it would be nice to prove the efficiency of your 30% discrepancy in real world or close to real world situation...What would be battery impact? reply John • 3 weeks ago The disabling of HD Voice - is it permanently disabled or is that a function that Apple could enable in the future? reply Adam • 3 weeks ago Lab test isn't field test. If you do field test,the results are almost same. reply Darrell Brand • 3 weeks ago Just called Apple and mentioned my concerns- I bought my iPhone 7 unlocked and no plan Apple has no response. reply landoncube • 3 weeks ago The SIM unlocked version is the Qualcomm modem, according to the article. reply JohnL • 3 weeks ago Only Qualcomm in the US and a couple of other places, it's Intel in Europe (1778 model is supplied as the unlocked one). reply JohnL • 3 weeks ago What was the modem firmware used in the tests please? Also IMHO worth repeating in 3-4 months to see if Intel have made significant improvements to a young product.. reply JohnL • 3 weeks ago I note 10.1 updates the modem firmware (Intel model) from 10.0.3's version 1.00.05 to 1.01..13, which seems like quite a bit. I don't know what was in 10.0.2 I'm afraid. reply JohnL • 1 week ago 10.1.1 takes it to 1.1.15 reply Jacq • 3 weeks ago This article made for great reading. A couple of things I would be interested in seeing in the future articles. 1. Testing this on Google's Pixel device along with every major flagship release. This is information that would influence a purchase decision. I also from daily use between the 5x and 6p felt the 5x was horrible and which you tested the 6p's signal as well, 2, Was there a measure of power consumption at the different signal strength between the two chipsets? Wondering if this affected the performance as well. Thanks - JSH reply Alessia Campoli • 3 weeks ago Good to see that iPhone 7 will be IP67 waterproof! When concerning about the waterproof function of mobile, I found an very interesting video about it. On this video, they drop VKworld T1 Plus, a budget 6.0-inch smartphone to the mud and clean it directly with water for long time, that is unbelivalble. reply VG • 3 weeks ago Even if you leave apart the intel vs qualcomm modem differences, the article clearly tells that SD 820 based devices will have far better connectivity as compared to any iPhone7 reply AP • 3 weeks ago If I'm on the AT&T network, is there anyway to check if I'm getting a Qualcomm version before I purchase/open the box? reply Alexis • 3 weeks ago the model number is written on the outside of the box. You could read it without breaking the seal or opening the box. The ATT model uses the Intel modem. If you want the qualcomm then buy a unlocked version reply landoncube • 3 weeks ago My research indicates that there is no AT&T Qualcomm phone available. I am looking into the SIM unlocked Qualcomm version for use on AT&T. reply Doug Lerner • 3 weeks ago I live in Tokyo and use KDDI Au. I can't find out which model they are using. AU shops say "it might be either, but you can't tell until purchasing and opening the box to look." All the floor models I've seen have the model number with the Intel chip though. I'm wondering how much of an issue this is and if I should upgrade my iPhone 6 Plus now. reply karyn • 3 weeks ago the model number is written on the outside of the box. You could read it without breaking the seal or opening the box. reply Doug Lerner • 3 weeks ago You're right! I can see that on the back of my iPhone 6 Plus box. That precludes being able to upgrade online, but perhaps I can do that in a store. Assuming there is even more than one model sold here in Japan for AU. I still haven't been able to confirm that yet. reply Kari • 3 weeks ago Let's wait a little and see what's Apple's response is, before jumping into conclusions. reply Doug Lerner • 3 weeks ago Actually, it turns out that the model sold here in Japan is neither the A1784 nor the A1661. For the iPhone 7 Plus it is the A1785. The details are at http://www.apple.com/jp/iphone-7/specs/ but the modem supports the following: FDD-LTE（バンド1、2、3、4、5、7、8、11、12、13、17、18、19、20、21、25、26、27、28、29、30） TD-LTE（バンド38、39、40、41） TD-SCDMA 1,900（F）、2,000（A） CDMA EV-DO Rev. A（800、1,900、2,100MHz） UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA（850、900、1,700/2,100、1,900、2,100MHz） GSM/EDGE（850、900、1,800、1,900MHz） I don't know if that means it's Qualcomm or Intel. The Japan model also supports FeliCa, which allows people to use it like Suica/Pasmo cards to ride the trains and subways. reply Pei • 3 weeks ago it's a qualcomm variant, not intel. reply Pei • 3 weeks ago this article has been seen in China. Only Qualcomm variants are sold here. Many apple users are not satisfied with APPLE because iPhone is expensive while Apple used a bad modem. reply JohnD • 3 weeks ago All devices with qualcomm have issues in the field. Lab vs field tests are completely different. The mobility tells how feasible a device is. Not speaking about the fact that in real NW the eNB will never give yous such a bandwidth. I really don't understand why you people struggle to have in the pocket the newest devices on the market... reply ElmCha • 2 weeks ago All Qualcomm devices have problems in the field? How so? Kindly elaborate. reply Alexhander • 3 weeks ago Great article! Very nicely detailed and accurate information based on the currently released iPhones. reply salman Khan • 3 weeks ago Both intel and Qualcomm modems are capable of supporting more than 400Mbps.if LTE network give them enough resources. and channel conditions are good. This means that performance of the intel modem may not be limitation here. It depends on test conditions, transport protocol parameters, both mobiles (Qualcomm and Intel) exact locations and many other factors. As a user, I dont care much if my downloading speed is 150Mpbs or 140Mpbs because I rarely run any application on my mobile phone that requires this much high data rate on my mobile(HD video stream needs few Mpbs speed). But I would be more interested in power comparison and battery life with these two modems. reply Bob H • 3 weeks ago My burning question is whether the inferior Intel modem I would get in my AT&T 7 Plus would also have inferior receptivity to my AT&T iPhone 6. If so, I will wait to upgrade until the 8. I already have spotty reception at home with my 6 and I can't afford to make it worse. Is there already a way to compare this or does it require a new test? Thanks. reply Bob H • 3 weeks ago I posted a question here that was held up for curation and then disappeared. It seemed perfectly harmless. What happened? reply Bob H • 3 weeks ago I had a chance to answer my question by doing a field test on my 6 at home and learning I was getting a reading of -114 in most places, and then bringing home a 7 Plus (with the inferior Intel modem) and getting readings between -108 and -112. Glad to learn that "inferior" doesn't mean worse than a 6, in my location at least, so I'll keep the 7 Plus. reply landoncube • 3 weeks ago Could you repeat the testing now that iOS 10.1 has been released? I have an A1784 iPhone 7 plus. reply JohnL • 3 weeks ago It is depressing how much my 1778 is slower than my 5s for LTE. A quick 4G test (or few) this evening gives 65.7MB/s down/14.1 up for the 5s and 60.0/6.5 for the 7... Plus I only tested it as I'd seen a trend so this wasn't a one-off. A bigger concern is the 5s holds onto a 4G signal much better, the 7 does like to be on 3G (iOS 10.1). reply Jos • 1 week ago There is a very interesting article about phone reception quality. Its writen by professor Gert Frølund Pedersen, from Denmark's Aalborg University. The direct link to the PDF: http://www.pts.se/upload/Rapporter/Tele/2016/MobilephoneTest2016-augusti-2016.pdf I ran some tests myself on the 3 Belgian providers. Reception quality inside my house is very bad where I live (bad coverage) with signal levels between -95 and -113 dBm. By the way, I'm an engineer and have quite some RF knowledge. Tested with a brand new iPhone 7 (Intel modem), iPhone SE, Nexus 5, Lumia 925 and Lumia 800 (both Lumia's are still Nokia design, not Microsoft). Tests are pure subjective, on different places in my house with all the phones and swapping SIM cards every time. With a signal of -95 dBm, the iPhone 7 often doesn't receive or can't make calls and text messages can't be send. More or less the same story with the iPhone SE. The Lumia's perform the best, the Nexus 5 sits between them. The Lumia's always have a better signal then the other phones. I don't care about LTE performance (I only get 3G at best over here) since I have Wifi in house. Don't understand why reviewers talk about all the gadgets of the phones, while the basic functionality (making phone calls) isn't even decently tested in an area with bad reception. Of course it's much more interesting to compare stuff like camera functionality, screen colours, quality of the Gorilla glass, bending phones etc, but it's all non-essential. I'd love to have a phone that bends when you sit on it, but at least has a good reception and can be used to make a call. Just want a phone with the best receiver sensivity. For each 3 dB decrease in level, the singal power is reduced by about one half. So a more sensitive phone just works better in environments with weak signals. That also includes using it in your car, a bad environment for a mobile phone (metal cage). And most of the time, the receiver in the phone is not the problem, but the antenna plays a much bigger role... As professor Pedersen suggests in his article, it becomes time manufacturers are open about this in the specs of the phone. reply Massi • 4 days ago What process node is the Intel modem? Would be very interesting to see power comparison between Intel and Qualcomm reply Psymon • 1 day ago Great article.. I found it just in time! Having just purchased an iphone 7 plus, 32GB on contract in the UK for use on the Three network. Without any hesitation I have now returned the device and will wait until the i8 appears. Here's why... I live in a network fringe area of Cornwall and also trunk travel quite a bit. The fringe signal at home for the i7 displayed a significant decrease on the previous i5 and i5s signals. 4G has been incredibly sporadic everywhere had appeared to offer no performance increase over 3g. Another immediate issue was a very sharp spike in data usage, I have been using the Three, All You Can Eat Data plans for years, peaking at 25gb in the heaviest usage months... In just five operational days of the i7 the daily use started to top 3gb when streaming music, using google maps and general browsing, close to 50% more than I had ever seen before. I spoke with Three technical for a few hours, explaining everything in great detail, in an attempt to overcome the issues or at least gain a good explanation. Three almost immediately admitted that the 4g was not working on the i7 properly and a solution was being sought between Apple and Three (Apple deny this) Three technical suggested turning off the 4g until being advised of an update that resolves the issue. There was no explanation as to why the signal was poorer on the i7 compared to all previous devices, but now I am starting to understand why, your article makes perfect sense. The Data usage increase was also not met with a good explanation but was dismissed by pointing out that I already have All You Can Eat Data, so why worry.. point taken... but be aware if you are paying for capped data limits! By the way the upgrade to iOS 10.1.1 has made no observable difference.! I also ran a performance test on the i7 using a little app "Performance Test" just to see whether the phone performed as advertised.. A friend also purchased an i7 with 256gb at the same time as me giving me the opportunity to compare both. What was remarkably disappointing was the write speeds... the read speeds were very similar but the write speed was significantly slower on my 32gb i7. Close to 50% less capable slowing the device down by 50% when writing to its memory. This was also observable when browsing images on both phone with maximum signal strength. (My friend has also retuned his iPhone 7 for the same reasons) As a final pass before returning the i7, with your article in hand, I made an appointment with Apple to see if they were prepared to shine some light on the issues. To be fair, they were not really interested, they did however offer me a replacement but with the Intel Model numbers. They confirmed that the Models with the Qualcomm component installed were not available in the UK. If you have an iPhone 7 with the model numbers A1778 or A1784 or are considering buying a new phone.. DON'T it really isn't worth the grief and they will be virtually worthless once the issues are widely known.. These phones WILL give you trouble, perhaps not so much in the city but rural and travelling they simply do not meet a price tag of £50.00 for a phone let alone £780.00 , they really are no more than just a very expensive camera/ipods. reply Cancel Reply Please be polite.

A WSJ report this morning upgraded the urgency, saying that a deal could happen as soon as this weekend. But according to other WSJ sources, Apple is also interested in Time Warner, and is "monitoring the situation." DON'T MISS: Everything we know about Apple’s exciting next-gen MacBook Pro Apple's interest in Time Warner, one of the biggest content creators out there, is not new. Reports surfaced back in January that Apple was one of a number of "possible suitors" to buy Time Warner. AT&T was also named as a potential bidder, so at least the rumors are consistent. With cable TV revenues faltering and Netflix making a bundle of cash producing and delivery video online, a number of companies are circling Time Warner as an easy way to get into the media business. AT&T, which is one of the largest cable and internet providers, would buy Time Warner to make distributing its content easier. Buying the content creators is also a good hedge against traditional cable TV, which is dying an increasingly quick death. https://twitter.com/shalini/status/789557346867507200 On the other hand, Apple is looking at subscription content services like Netflix, Spotify and Amazon. The latter's recent roll-out of Amazon Prime Music means that Amazon now offers a complete package of subscription services, while Apple is stuck with just Apple Music. It's unclear exactly what Apple would do with Time Warner, but it's in a good position to bundle popular content and channels into a web TV service. In the same way that it used its ownership of iOS to convert millions of people to Apple Music, something similar could happen with TVs and movies. In any case, Apple only said to be "monitoring the situation," not actively bidding. If AT&T is desperate enough for media to overpay, Apple is less likely to enter a bidding war. But if a good price isn't reached, or AT&T's acquisition is blocked by regulators, I'm sure Apple will be waiting in the wings.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple recently approached Time Warner about takeover bid, now “monitoring” AT&T talks By Christian Zibreg, Oct 21, 2016 Tweet 7 Comments AT&T, the second-largest carrier in the United States, is in advanced talks with media giant Time Warner about a possible merger and Apple “is now monitoring the situation”, people familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. The Cupertino-based gadget maker was first mentioned as a possible suitor for a Time Warner takeover back in January of this year. According to WSJ, Apple a few months ago approached Time Warner “about pursuing a combination”, but the discussions didn’t progress “beyond a preliminary stage.” Time Warner shares were up seven percent in afternoon trading. WSJ writes: From Apple’s end, executives under Chief Executive Tim Cook were involved in the earlier talks. Apple has pursued plans to build an online TV service and has begun creating original programming of its own. Before its most recent approach, Eddy Cue, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services, brought up a potential combination in a meeting with Time Warner’s head of corporate strategy Olaf Olafsson last year, the people said, though the talks never went further than that. Time Warner owns premium content brands like HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. The media giant doesn’t have a controlling shareholder. It reported $28 billion in 2015 revenue and had a market capitalization of $68 billion before WSJ reported on the deal. “The media giant’s advanced talks with the telecom company could set off a deal frenzy,” speculates the article, adding that a deal between AT&T and Time Warner could come together within days. Still, a host of other contenders could jump into the fray for Time Warner and scuttle the planned deal, media executives and analysts said. Google, however, doesn’t appear interested in making a Time Warner offer, a person familiar with the situation said. 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney Co. are also unlikely to join the fray. “There has been along list of companies speculated to be interested in acquiring Time Warner, starting with the almighty Apple. So if AT&T wants this deal, it is in their best interest to move as fast as possible,” said Todd Juenger of Bernstein Research. Good! Let them buy Time Warner, I say. We all know too well that those kinds of mega mergers between huge companies with corporate cultures that are polar opposites to one another collapse sooner than later. I don’t want Apple to buy a huge media company. I want them to focus on making great products, software and services and partner with media companies, not become one.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple discovers that selling smartwatches for $15,000 doesn’t work Chris Mills BGR NewsOctober 21, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share It feels like 1,000 years since Tim Cook stood on stage an announced that Apple was selling a gold-plated smartwatch for $15,000. At the time, it was difficult to say if this was a sensible move or just one involving "courage," because no one had tried to sell a small wrist computer for that much before. Two years later, the normal-human Apple Watch is doing surprisingly well, exceeding expectations by being the best-selling smartwatch in its category. The $15,000 gold Apple Watch Edition? Well, it's been discontinued, and now its fancy Paris flagship store is closing. DON'T MISS: Everything we expect Apple to announce next week that isn’t a Mac As Mac4Ever discovered, the dedicated Apple Watch boutique in Galeries Lafayette, a famous shopping center in Paris, is going to be closed down. The report cites dwindling sales figures and a "change in focus" as the reasons for killing off the picture-perfect store. The boutique is expected to close in January next year. There's two similar boutiques in Tokyo and London, and the future of those is said to be undecided. You can also see the shift in focus from the current Apple Watch lineup. When Apple debuted the Watch Series 2 last month, they Apple Watch Edition underwent a conspicuous change. The $15,000 gold-plated version isn't sold any more, and instead the Apple Watch Edition is wrapped in ceramic, and costs a much more palatable $2,000. Now, $2,000 is what you should spend on a laptop, not a smartwatch. But it put the top-end Apple wearable far closer to the rest of the company's lineup. It's possible to see someone who owns several $10,000 watches splurging on a ceramic Apple Watch Edition. It's far harder to see many people making their most expensive watch a gadget that will be out of date in a few years' time.

Comments By Lucas Mearian Follow Computerworld | Oct 21, 2016 12:32 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Sustainable IT Computer Hardware Comments Target has surpassed perennial champion Walmart as the U.S.'s top corporate user of solar power, according to a new report. Target has installed 147 megawatts (million watts or MW) of solar capacity on 300 stores, according to the 2016 Solar Means Business Report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). "We're incredibly proud of the progress we've made in improving building efficiencies and reducing environmental impact. Our commitment to installing solar panels on 500 stores and distribution centers by 2020 is evidence of that progress," John Leisen, vice president of property management at Target, said in the SEIA statement. Walmart had held the top spot for the previous four years and still claims second place with 145MW of solar power installed on 364 buildings, according to the SEIA, which has been tracking corporate solar deployments for the past five years. This year, real estate developer Prologis came in third with 107.8MW of solar. Apple, which is in fourth place with 93.9MW of installed solar power, is a likely contender for first place sometime next year. Last year, Apple announced it was investing $850 million in a solar power plant through a partnership with First Solar, one of the nation's largest photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers and provider of utility-scale PV plants. Through a 25-year purchasing agreement, Apple will get 130MW from the new California Flats Solar Project. The project is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Other Top 10 companies recognized in the SEIA's report include Costco (50.7 MW), Kohl's (50.2 MW), IKEA (44 MW), Macy's (38.9 MW), General Growth Properties (30.2 MW) and Hartz Mountain Industries (22.7 MW). While IKEA is in seventh place, it powers 91% of its retail locations through solar, according to the SEIA. Overall, U.S. corporations have doubled their solar installations year over year and are expected to close out 2016 with nearly 280MW of solar power -- compared to 130MW in 2015. The SEIA's report covers corporate solar installations in 38 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico; it tracks almost 1,100MW of solar installations at 2,000 U.S. companies. "To put that in context, that's enough electricity to power the equivalent of 193,000 homes every year," the report stated. "Also noteworthy, in just the first three quarters of 2016, the report found 142MW of corporate solar was added in the U.S., more than was installed in all of 2015 (129 MW)." In 2014, frustrated by a lack of renewable energy and a purchasing system that's too complicated, major U.S. companies joined an initiative to force the government and utilities to change. Along with the World Wildlife Fund and the World Resources Institute, the corporations signed a pact supporting six principles to clearly identify what's needed when purchasing renewable energy. The initial companies included Bloomberg, Facebook, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Mars, Novelis, Procter and Gamble, REI, Sprint and Walmart. The companies called for six specific changes they wanted the energy industry to adopt to increase renewable energy use: Greater choice in procurement options More access to cost competitive options Longer- and variable-term contracts Access to new projects that reduce emissions Streamlined third-party financing Increased purchasing options with utilities "Solar plays a vital role within our renewable energy portfolio," Mark Vanderhelm, vice president of energy for Walmart, said in a statement. "This is evident by our 2020 commitment of doubling solar energy projects at our Walmart stores, Sam's Clubs and distribution centers across the nation. Our focus is on finding those solar projects that are right for the business."

We merely had a cameo of Pepe,’ Treadstone continued. ‘We get banned because it’s a pro-Trump app, but you can have an app only about Pepe and that’s not offensive,'” Nash reports. “In July, Apple’s App Store also rejected a satirical game based on the Hillary Clinton email servers scandal. Apple branded the game as ‘offensive’ and ‘objectionable’ before reversing their decision following a report at Breitbart.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Poor Pepe.

You cannot use the argument that other apps currently in the app store more flagrantly abuse the same copyright. The official response I received was, it doesn’t matter if 1000 similar apps in the app store break , YOUR app appears to use similar imagery to “” and so is rejected. The decision was upheld upon multiple appeals.

They just went along with whoever was pushing whatever agenda. If Donald Trump wants to make America White Again, then Apple should sit on the sidelines and even maybe help kick out anyone that is not a white male citizen unless they belong to a union or the wrong religion. yojimbo007 Friday, October 21, 2016 - 5:41 pm · Reply My view is that its not Apple who should do that… its not their place as a company. every individual though can voice their opinion and place their vote.

And everybody have every right to comment on whatever I or anyone posts. And no, I don’t like Botty because he’s been a rude idiot to me and many people in this forum. He often acts like a troll and he’s never been able to provide a smart answer to anything. And sure, the feeling must be mutual. But regardless, I would defend to death his right to keep posting his opinion, as much as I dislike and disagree with him. Me2Sense Monday, October 24, 2016 - 5:48 pm · Reply “He often acts like a troll and he’s never been able to provide a smart answer to anything.” I guess you flunked grammar class by using absolutes. Wow, are you clueless. And your sarcasm excuse was just that — an excuse no believes. Grifterus Monday, October 24, 2016 - 7:05 pm · Reply Well, allow me to retort. First, let’s correct the absolutes (where I will grant you are correct, and will correct myself): He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM. Better now? It’s not absolute anymore. It’s constrained to the current forum. Speaking of absolutes: “an excuse no believes”…. makes you too a grammar champion. Shouldn’t that be “and excuse no one believes”? Oh, also, wouldn’t that also be an absolute? Because, if no one believes it, that sounds like there are no exceptions, or no cases where someone would believe it. That looks like an absolute to me. Man, who’s more clueless? The clueless guy, or the clueless guy who calls another guy that he’s clueless? Let’s leave it there. This is not worth my time. And I’n sure it’s not worth yours. Let’s call it a stalemate. Would you agree? Me2Sense Monday, October 24, 2016 - 7:25 pm · Reply “He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM.” Provide. You just can’t rid yourself of absolute statements. Botty is much more intelligent, witty and smarter than you. Your partisan HATE blinds you. So sorry. Grifterus Monday, October 24, 2016 - 8:07 pm · Where in my post I mention anything about political parties???? And yes, I had a typo…. And you mention nothing about your own absolutes…. It’s like talking to a rock. Do you want to believe I’m dumb? Please do. I don’t know Botty in person. I think everything he writes… oh, excuse me, I will allow absolutes… everything Ihe wrote that I’ve read is nothing but pure garbage. I see no intelligence there. Now, one man’s opinion doesn’t make the man smarter. Maybe I’m the stupid one and you are the smart one. Because you see it that way, and I see it another way. So… since only one of us can be right, and we will never agree, let’s leave it there. Me2Sense Monday, October 24, 2016 - 8:32 pm · Hey clueless, give it up.

I’d like to stay, but I don’t like what Apple’s doing with the hardware. I know Apple has always been proprietary, but they were never this proprietary.

First 2014, Then 2016 Friday, October 21, 2016 - 5:24 pm · Reply Only one candidate is not beholden to Wall Street, multinationals, and the special interests: Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for and has been for decades. The Trump Plan will retain the existing capital gains rate structure (maximum rate of 20 percent) with tax brackets shown above. Carried interest will be taxed as ordinary income. That is why the Wall Street-, multinational-, and Soros-owned Hillary Clinton is getting massive assistance from the mainstream media (also owned by the establishment) – they want their carried interest deductions to continue.

Outside of your little Right-Wing Echo Chamber and the most rural of rural areas Trump just isn’t seen as credible. BTW, where does this “Trump has at least an 87% chance of winning” BS come from? Not that article. Nick Saturday, October 22, 2016 - 2:29 am · Reply It’s funny to hear a leftist talking about an echo chamber. Our culture is soaked and consumed with progressive leftism, it’s not possible for a “right wing echo chamber” to exist. Those on the right are exposed to both sides of the spectrum. Those on the left are living in the mass-media-wide echo chamber, unless they take the effort to see things from another perspective. Most don’t and prefer to condescendingly spit on everyone else while furthering their lies. Whether or not Trump wins, you won’t be safe from the crowds with torches and pitchforks. Dave H Saturday, October 22, 2016 - 4:12 am · Reply That’s your perception, but one I disagree with. You only have to spend a few minutes reading comment boards on the Internet to see there are millions of people out there that living in a Right-Wing bubble. They repeat misconceptions and outright distortions at each other, over and over again until they utterly believe it. “Obama’s a Kenyan”, “The Government forces your kids to become gay”, “They’re going to take our guns”, “Muslims are ALL evil terrorists” etc. That’s your Right-Wing Echo Chamber. It’s another perspective, but one built mostly on ignorance. Me2Sense Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 3:03 pm · Reply You got it backwards. The left-wing echo chamber robots are dumb as a box of rocks. Nick Monday, October 24, 2016 - 3:44 am · Reply Obama’s own publisher called him Kenyan to promote himself as a speaker. The government does propagandize for homosexuality. Islam is an evil religion that promotes anti-semitism, slavery and violence. People may say extreme-sounding things, but they’re based on facts. Don’t compare message boards to all of the major broadcast networks, newspapers, magazines and social media sites, which are ALL globalist-progressive. Yes even FOX News is on the same team as CNN and the New York Times. DavGreg Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:27 pm · Reply You should take your meds. Drumpf is likely to get his ass whipped and the GOP is likely to lose the Senate. Thanks to Republican Gerrymandering they are likely to retain the House, but with a narrower margin.

The alt-right organized around precepts and values that are against the broad multi-cultural view that is widely accepted and in the mainstream through most of the US and developed world. The inclusion of that symbol in a thinly dusguised game to promote the Drumpf Campaign. Apple was right in rejecting it. If you do not like Apple’s decision, do the free market thing and go buy an Android or Windows phone. Apple is a private sector company and nobody is making you buy their stuff. Derek Currie Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:15 pm · Reply I Guess We Need To Talk About Pepe The Frog …Later, observers began noticing an increase in white supremacist themes in Pepe images — or a rise in Pepe usage by white supremacist accounts. Either way, an association was building. This May, an “anonymous white nationalist” told The Daily Beast that the shift was intentional: a dedicated campaign to “reclaim Pepe from normies,” or members of the mainstream, by making Pepe so culturally unacceptable that only the fringe Internet would dare to use him. Donald Trump had earlier tweeted an image of Pepe-as-Trump, and then his son posted an image on Instagram that included Pepe. Homeandmantel Friday, October 21, 2016 - 11:30 pm · Reply Can’t wait until the election is over and the landslide Hillary captured that the GOP will finally cut ties with the ignorant and racist constituency it has built up over the past decade and a half.

October 21 AAPL: 116.60 -0.46 WSJ: Apple has approached Time Warner in recent months, closely monitoring AT&T’s acquisition talks Zac Hall - 3 weeks ago @apollozac Apple TV Apple Time Warner View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Apple isn’t totally ruling out a Time Warner acquisition as talks between the network and AT&T appear to be moving forward. Yesterday it was reported that AT&T is looking at the possibility of a merger with Time Warner, then today it was separately reported that the talks could be much further along than previously reported. Now the WSJ is adding that Apple is once again monitoring the situation closely and has even approached the company in the last few months… Apple Inc. a few months ago approached Time Warner Inc. about pursuing a combination, but the discussions didn’t progress beyond a preliminary stage and none are currently under way, people familiar with the matter said Friday. […] From Apple’s end, executives under Chief Executive Tim Cookwere involved in the earlier talks, and now Apple is monitoring the current situation, one of the people said. If Apple is indeed not closing the door to a Time Warner acquisition, this wouldn’t make the first time in recent history. Back in January it was reported that Apple may want to acquire the media company to bolster its streaming TV service plans, but those plans have since been put on the shelf. Over the summer it was again said that Apple indeed considering buying Time Warner but focused instead on investing in original content of its own. In a Hollywood Reporter profile back in July, Apple TV head Eddy Cue actually cooled the flames on rumors of Apple providing a TV service when asked about the rumored interest in Time Warner: Whether we’re providing it or somebody else is, it really doesn’t matter to us. What we’re trying to do is build the platform that allows anybody to get content to consumers. If a Time Warner [Cable] or a DirecTV wants to offer a bundle themselves, they should do it through Apple TV and iPad and iPhone. As a matter of fact, I’m not a big fan of the skinny bundle. But last month Apple hired a former VP of Time Warner to work on cloud services at Apple under Eddy Cue. For its part, Apple has been rumored to be working on a number of things in the TV space including an actual TV of its own and a streaming TV service similar to Sling TV or PS Vue although both of these projects have been put on hold indefinitely. Apple’s latest venture is said to be a universal TV guide that pulls in content from various streaming services to present a traditional TV browsing experience. Features like universal search on the new Apple TV go half-way by searching for content across multiple channels. Apple has also promised a new single sign-on feature that unlocks multiple channels from a single content provider on iOS and tvOS, although this feature is billed as coming soon. Apple has continued to speak openly about the broken experience of TV currently, however, even after shipping the new Apple TV with the tvOS platform. As recently as yesterday at Vanity Fair‘s annual summit of media execs, Eddy Cue has talked about the TV experience being stuck in the past. As for the Time Warner situation, Apple’s interest is especially fascinating as reports have continuously described Apple watching the situation from a somewhat distant position.

We merely had a cameo of Pepe,’ Treadstone continued. ‘We get banned because it’s a pro-Trump app, but you can have an app only about Pepe and that’s not offensive,'” Nash reports. “In July, Apple’s App Store also rejected a satirical game based on the Hillary Clinton email servers scandal. Apple branded the game as ‘offensive’ and ‘objectionable’ before reversing their decision following a report at Breitbart.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Poor Pepe.

You cannot use the argument that other apps currently in the app store more flagrantly abuse the same copyright. The official response I received was, it doesn’t matter if 1000 similar apps in the app store break , YOUR app appears to use similar imagery to “” and so is rejected. The decision was upheld upon multiple appeals.

First, let’s correct the absolutes (where I will grant you are correct, and will correct myself): He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM. Better now? It’s not absolute anymore. It’s constrained to the current forum. Speaking of absolutes: “an excuse no believes”…. makes you too a grammar champion. Shouldn’t that be “and excuse no one believes”? Oh, also, wouldn’t that also be an absolute? Because, if no one believes it, that sounds like there are no exceptions, or no cases where someone would believe it. That looks like an absolute to me. Man, who’s more clueless? The clueless guy, or the clueless guy who calls another guy that he’s clueless? Let’s leave it there. This is not worth my time. And I’n sure it’s not worth yours.

I think everything he writes… oh, excuse me, I will allow absolutes… everything Ihe wrote that I’ve read is nothing but pure garbage. I see no intelligence there. Now, one man’s opinion doesn’t make the man smarter. Maybe I’m the stupid one and you are the smart one. Because you see it that way, and I see it another way.

Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for and has been for decades. The Trump Plan will retain the existing capital gains rate structure (maximum rate of 20 percent) with tax brackets shown above. Carried interest will be taxed as ordinary income. That is why the Wall Street-, multinational-, and Soros-owned Hillary Clinton is getting massive assistance from the mainstream media (also owned by the establishment) – they want their carried interest deductions to continue.

The alt-right organized around precepts and values that are against the broad multi-cultural view that is widely accepted and in the mainstream through most of the US and developed world. The inclusion of that symbol in a thinly dusguised game to promote the Drumpf Campaign. Apple was right in rejecting it. If you do not like Apple’s decision, do the free market thing and go buy an Android or Windows phone. Apple is a private sector company and nobody is making you buy their stuff. Derek Currie Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:15 pm · Reply I Guess We Need To Talk About Pepe The Frog …Later, observers began noticing an increase in white supremacist themes in Pepe images — or a rise in Pepe usage by white supremacist accounts. Either way, an association was building. This May, an “anonymous white nationalist” told The Daily Beast that the shift was intentional: a dedicated campaign to “reclaim Pepe from normies,” or members of the mainstream, by making Pepe so culturally unacceptable that only the fringe Internet would dare to use him. Donald Trump had earlier tweeted an image of Pepe-as-Trump, and then his son posted an image on Instagram that included Pepe.

We merely had a cameo of Pepe,’ Treadstone continued. ‘We get banned because it’s a pro-Trump app, but you can have an app only about Pepe and that’s not offensive,'” Nash reports. “In July, Apple’s App Store also rejected a satirical game based on the Hillary Clinton email servers scandal. Apple branded the game as ‘offensive’ and ‘objectionable’ before reversing their decision following a report at Breitbart.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Poor Pepe.

You cannot use the argument that other apps currently in the app store more flagrantly abuse the same copyright. The official response I received was, it doesn’t matter if 1000 similar apps in the app store break , YOUR app appears to use similar imagery to “” and so is rejected. The decision was upheld upon multiple appeals.

First, let’s correct the absolutes (where I will grant you are correct, and will correct myself): He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM. Better now? It’s not absolute anymore. It’s constrained to the current forum. Speaking of absolutes: “an excuse no believes”…. makes you too a grammar champion. Shouldn’t that be “and excuse no one believes”? Oh, also, wouldn’t that also be an absolute? Because, if no one believes it, that sounds like there are no exceptions, or no cases where someone would believe it. That looks like an absolute to me. Man, who’s more clueless? The clueless guy, or the clueless guy who calls another guy that he’s clueless? Let’s leave it there. This is not worth my time. And I’n sure it’s not worth yours.

I think everything he writes… oh, excuse me, I will allow absolutes… everything Ihe wrote that I’ve read is nothing but pure garbage. I see no intelligence there. Now, one man’s opinion doesn’t make the man smarter. Maybe I’m the stupid one and you are the smart one. Because you see it that way, and I see it another way.

Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for and has been for decades. The Trump Plan will retain the existing capital gains rate structure (maximum rate of 20 percent) with tax brackets shown above. Carried interest will be taxed as ordinary income. That is why the Wall Street-, multinational-, and Soros-owned Hillary Clinton is getting massive assistance from the mainstream media (also owned by the establishment) – they want their carried interest deductions to continue.

Our culture is soaked and consumed with progressive leftism, it’s not possible for a “right wing echo chamber” to exist. Those on the right are exposed to both sides of the spectrum. Those on the left are living in the mass-media-wide echo chamber, unless they take the effort to see things from another perspective.

If you do not like Apple’s decision, do the free market thing and go buy an Android or Windows phone. Apple is a private sector company and nobody is making you buy their stuff. Derek Currie Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:15 pm · Reply I Guess We Need To Talk About Pepe The Frog …Later, observers began noticing an increase in white supremacist themes in Pepe images — or a rise in Pepe usage by white supremacist accounts. Either way, an association was building. This May, an “anonymous white nationalist” told The Daily Beast that the shift was intentional: a dedicated campaign to “reclaim Pepe from normies,” or members of the mainstream, by making Pepe so culturally unacceptable that only the fringe Internet would dare to use him. Donald Trump had earlier tweeted an image of Pepe-as-Trump, and then his son posted an image on Instagram that included Pepe.

We merely had a cameo of Pepe,’ Treadstone continued. ‘We get banned because it’s a pro-Trump app, but you can have an app only about Pepe and that’s not offensive,'” Nash reports. “In July, Apple’s App Store also rejected a satirical game based on the Hillary Clinton email servers scandal. Apple branded the game as ‘offensive’ and ‘objectionable’ before reversing their decision following a report at Breitbart.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Poor Pepe.

You cannot use the argument that other apps currently in the app store more flagrantly abuse the same copyright. The official response I received was, it doesn’t matter if 1000 similar apps in the app store break , YOUR app appears to use similar imagery to “” and so is rejected. The decision was upheld upon multiple appeals.

First, let’s correct the absolutes (where I will grant you are correct, and will correct myself): He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM. Better now? It’s not absolute anymore. It’s constrained to the current forum. Speaking of absolutes: “an excuse no believes”…. makes you too a grammar champion. Shouldn’t that be “and excuse no one believes”? Oh, also, wouldn’t that also be an absolute? Because, if no one believes it, that sounds like there are no exceptions, or no cases where someone would believe it. That looks like an absolute to me. Man, who’s more clueless? The clueless guy, or the clueless guy who calls another guy that he’s clueless? Let’s leave it there. This is not worth my time. And I’n sure it’s not worth yours.

I think everything he writes… oh, excuse me, I will allow absolutes… everything Ihe wrote that I’ve read is nothing but pure garbage. I see no intelligence there. Now, one man’s opinion doesn’t make the man smarter. Maybe I’m the stupid one and you are the smart one. Because you see it that way, and I see it another way.

Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for and has been for decades. The Trump Plan will retain the existing capital gains rate structure (maximum rate of 20 percent) with tax brackets shown above. Carried interest will be taxed as ordinary income. That is why the Wall Street-, multinational-, and Soros-owned Hillary Clinton is getting massive assistance from the mainstream media (also owned by the establishment) – they want their carried interest deductions to continue.

Our culture is soaked and consumed with progressive leftism, it’s not possible for a “right wing echo chamber” to exist. Those on the right are exposed to both sides of the spectrum.

It burned furniture, floors, cars and even a house,” Zach Epstein reports for BGR. “The phone has officially been recalled and discontinued, with Samsung warning all owners that they should power down the device immediately and return it to a local retailer at once,” Epstein reports. “There has never been a more serious problem with a smartphone in the history of the industry, and yet many people refuse to turn in their handsets and insist on putting themselves and those around them at risk.” Epstein reports, “More than 1 million people have yet to return their potentially dangerous Galaxy Note 7 phones, according to [Korea JoongAng Daily]’s sources.” Read more in the full article here.

Where I depart on your opinion is about these Note 7 users though.

Amaturo More On: new york giants Victor Cruz won't play — and rookie gets his big chance Giants rookie out of Clemson should prep for more reps on 'D' The history lesson that has the Giants 'D' trying to join greats A chance for Giants prime-time revenge — with legends watching The Giants’ Josh Brown problem has metastasized into such an unsavory mess it prompted the mother of their rookie cornerback to blast the Big Blue brass — and divulge that she, too, is a survivor of domestic abuse. Annie Apple, the outspoken mother of Eli Apple, had some harsh words for John Mara after his comments on the latest disturbing revelations about their kicker’s domestic violence history. “He admitted to us that he’s abused his wife in the past,” Mara — seemingly making the problem worse — told WFAN on Thursday. “And I think what’s a little unclear is the extent of that.” Mara’s suggestion there are varying degrees of domestic violence was particularly upsetting to the 42-year-old mother of four. “The are no levels of domestic violence. It’s all bad. And it’s all wrong. It’s a crime,” an emotional Apple told The Post from London. “I don’t tweet for the NFL, I don’t tweet for the Giants. I tweet what’s in my heart. Whether the NFL knew, I don’t know, but domestic violence is not a just an NFL issues, it’s a society issue. And we have to attack the mentality of deliberate ignorance.” Her tweets drew both applause and criticism and sent a jolt through the football world. As a domestic violence survivor, reading these Mara comments makes me sad, angry and completely baffled. He just doesn't get it. This is sad — Annie Apple (@SurvivinAmerica) October 20, 2016 While she didn’t offer any details on her own ordeal, she called domestic violence a “terror” and said Brown’s disturbingly detailed account of his criminal behavior dredged up her own painful memories. “When you read about another woman’s nightmare; it makes yours real again,” she wrote. Apple — who rose to prominence during the NFL draft, when numerous outlets crowned her the greatest sports mom because of her candor and humor — said the last 24 hours have been difficult. “Nobody wants to be the poster girl for domestic violence, but I would have felt like a hypocrite to myself,” she said. “I needed to speak out and let all the Molly Browns and Annie Apples, the other victims, know that they are not alone.” She also refused to back down from her critics. Because someone signs your check, doesn't mean he or she owns your soul. The day you put that up for sale, your humanity ceases to exist. — Annie Apple (@SurvivinAmerica) October 21, 2016 Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under annie apple ,  domestic abuse ,  eli apple ,  josh brown ,  new york giants Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Josh Brown put on NFL hiatus, likely setting up Giants exi...

David Faber | Andrew Ross Sorkin | Anita Balakrishnan Friday, 21 Oct 2016 | 5:57 PM ETBreaking News SHARES show chapters <p>AT&amp;T, Time Warner deal could come shortly: Sources</p> <p>CNBC&#039;s David Faber reports the latest details surrounding merger talks between AT&amp;T and Time Warner.</p> AT&T, Time Warner deal could come shortly: Sources    Friday, 21 Oct 2016 | 1:01 PM ET | 04:40 AT&T is in advanced talks to acquire Time Warner, sources told CNBC on Friday. The companies have now reached agreement on most terms of the deal, according to Reuters. An announcement could come as soon as Monday before the opening bell, as the boards are expected to meet over the weekend, CNBC has learned. Time Warner could be seeking more than $100 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported. That's about in line with $110 a share, reported by Bloomberg. Sources also told CNBC that AT&T could pay well north of $90 a share for Time Warner, and speculated it could be up to $110 a share. Alan Gould, an analyst at Brean Capital, wrote in a research note that such a deal could hit the $110 to $125 a share range. News of the possible value of the deal sent Time Warner shares surging 4.6 percent after hours. The stock closed 8 percent higher in the regular Friday session, briefly breaking a 15-year high after a temporary trading halt earlier in the day. AT&T shares fell 3 percent in the regular session and fell 1 percent after hours. The move would merge AT&T with the entertainment giant whose holdings include Warner Bros. and cable networks including TBS, TNT and CNN. Such a tie-up could be a blockbuster deal, as AT&T has a market capitalization of around $231 billion, and Time Warner has a market capitalization of close to $70 billion, as of Friday. Time Warner and AT&T have declined to comment. Twenty-First Century Fox said it has no plans to bid for Time Warner. Bloomberg initially reported Thursday that executives of both companies had discussed a possible merger. The two companies had also discussed a number of alternatives, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. The talks have since accelerated, Bloomberg added Friday, out of concerns that other potential bidders such as Alphabet and Apple could jump in. The Wall Street Journal also intially reported details of the timing of the talks. While Bloomberg reported an Apple bid is unlikely, the Journal said Apple is "monitoring the situation" and that Apple had approached Time Warner a few months ago. Apple declined to comment. Alphabet did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but is apparently not interested in a deal. It's unclear whether a provision for other companies to "shop" would be included in the deal at this point. Word of the imminent deal comes amid consolidation in the media industry, as more customers "cut the cord" on their cable subscriptions, providing a challenge to TV companies. For example, nearly 6 percent of subscribers told Magid Advisors they were "extremely likely" to cancel their service in the next year, from just under 2 percent in 2011. Time Warner owns HBO, which has a popular streaming offering. "When you think about how content is being consumed today, more and more of millennials are consuming content over tablets, over their smartphones," Amir Rozwadowski, head of telecom services research at Barclays, told CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Friday. "When you think about that opportunity set, there's a tremendous opportunity to push content to those subscribers." Taking into account DirectTV and wireless customers, AT&T has grown to become one of the largest distributors of video content nationwide, Rozwadowski said. "We have always believed that the combination of content and distribution makes sense and over the long term [Time Warner] has been the greatest content factory for films and TV," Gould of Brean Capital wrote. CNBC had previously reported that AT&T wanted to buy a media company, including potentially Time Warner, as rivals such as Verizon and Comcast have made moves in the media business, with ownership of properties like AOL and NBCUniversal, respectively. Owning a media company can be a powerful advertising play, leveraging data on telecommunications customers. "The challenge a company like AT&T has ... is that they're landlocked to the relationships they have with consumers," Greg Portell, partner in A.T. Kearney's consumer products and retail and communications, media & technology practices, said earlier this fall. "What content gets them is economic opportunities beyond their consumer base." But Barry Diller, chairman of IAC, told CNBC this week that Time Warner faces the challenge to figure out the course from "old media" company to thinking digitally. But AT&T's base of wireless customers may not be the answer. "Those are huge challenges," Diller said in an interview that aired Friday on "Squawk Alley." "If you can't figure something out, you get bought. I like very much Time Warner. Its management I think are really good, and there's every reason they will figure it out. I don't think AT&T helps them." Other media companies also saw volatile trading Friday. Viacom shares rose nearly 3 percent, Verizon fell nearly 2 percent and CBS gained almost 2 percent. — Reuters and CNBC's Mariam Amini, Josh Lipton and Michelle Castillo contributed to this report. Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com. Barclay's received non-investment-banking related compensation including compensation for brokerage services, if applicable) from AT&T and/or Time Warner. Barclay's is a market-maker in debt and equity securities issued by this issuer.

Sign up now Menu ARN Target passes Walmart as top corporate solar customer Target passes Walmart as top corporate solar customer Corporate solar installations could now power 193,000 homes every year Lucas Mearian (Computerworld (US)) 22 October, 2016 06:32 - - - - print email Distributors Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions BMS Technology Dicker Data Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Synnex Comments Target has surpassed perennial champion Walmart as the U.S.'s top corporate user of solar power, according to a new report. Target has installed 147 megawatts (million watts or MW) of solar capacity on 300 stores, according to the 2016 Solar Means Business Report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). "We're incredibly proud of the progress we've made in improving building efficiencies and reducing environmental impact. Our commitment to installing solar panels on 500 stores and distribution centers by 2020 is evidence of that progress," John Leisen, vice president of property management at Target, said in the SEIA statement. Walmart had held the top spot for the previous four years and still claims second place with 145MW of solar power installed on 364 buildings, according to the SEIA, which has been tracking corporate solar deployments for the past five years. This year, real estate developer Prologis came in third with 107.8MW of solar. Apple, which is in fourth place with 93.9MW of installed solar power, is a likely contender for first place sometime next year. Last year, Apple announced it was investing $850 million in a solar power plant through a partnership with First Solar, one of the nation's largest photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers and provider of utility-scale PV plants. Through a 25-year purchasing agreement, Apple will get 130MW from the new California Flats Solar Project. The project is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Other Top 10 companies recognized in the SEIA's report include Costco (50.7 MW), Kohl's (50.2 MW), IKEA (44 MW), Macy's (38.9 MW), General Growth Properties (30.2 MW) and Hartz Mountain Industries (22.7 MW). While IKEA is in seventh place, it powers 91% of its retail locations through solar, according to the SEIA. Overall, U.S. corporations have doubled their solar installations year over year and are expected to close out 2016 with nearly 280MW of solar power -- compared to 130MW in 2015. The SEIA's report covers corporate solar installations in 38 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico; it tracks almost 1,100MW of solar installations at 2,000 U.S. companies. "To put that in context, that's enough electricity to power the equivalent of 193,000 homes every year," the report stated. "Also noteworthy, in just the first three quarters of 2016, the report found 142MW of corporate solar was added in the U.S., more than was installed in all of 2015 (129 MW)." In 2014, frustrated by a lack of renewable energy and a purchasing system that's too complicated, major U.S. companies joined an initiative to force the government and utilities to change. Along with the World Wildlife Fund and the World Resources Institute, the corporations signed a pact supporting six principles to clearly identify what's needed when purchasing renewable energy. The initial companies included Bloomberg, Facebook, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Mars, Novelis, Procter and Gamble, REI, Sprint and Walmart. The companies called for six specific changes they wanted the energy industry to adopt to increase renewable energy use: Greater choice in procurement options More access to cost competitive options Longer- and variable-term contracts Access to new projects that reduce emissions Streamlined third-party financing Increased purchasing options with utilities "Solar plays a vital role within our renewable energy portfolio," Mark Vanderhelm, vice president of energy for Walmart, said in a statement. "This is evident by our 2020 commitment of doubling solar energy projects at our Walmart stores, Sam's Clubs and distribution centers across the nation. Our focus is on finding those solar projects that are right for the business." Brand Post Top Myths About SSL Encryption More from Blue Coat Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the ARN newsletter!

We merely had a cameo of Pepe,’ Treadstone continued. ‘We get banned because it’s a pro-Trump app, but you can have an app only about Pepe and that’s not offensive,'” Nash reports. “In July, Apple’s App Store also rejected a satirical game based on the Hillary Clinton email servers scandal. Apple branded the game as ‘offensive’ and ‘objectionable’ before reversing their decision following a report at Breitbart.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Poor Pepe.

You cannot use the argument that other apps currently in the app store more flagrantly abuse the same copyright. The official response I received was, it doesn’t matter if 1000 similar apps in the app store break , YOUR app appears to use similar imagery to “” and so is rejected. The decision was upheld upon multiple appeals.

It’s not absolute anymore. It’s constrained to the current forum. Speaking of absolutes: “an excuse no believes”…. makes you too a grammar champion. Shouldn’t that be “and excuse no one believes”? Oh, also, wouldn’t that also be an absolute? Because, if no one believes it, that sounds like there are no exceptions, or no cases where someone would believe it. That looks like an absolute to me.

Carried interest will be taxed as ordinary income. That is why the Wall Street-, multinational-, and Soros-owned Hillary Clinton is getting massive assistance from the mainstream media (also owned by the establishment) – they want their carried interest deductions to continue.

Either way, an association was building. This May, an “anonymous white nationalist” told The Daily Beast that the shift was intentional: a dedicated campaign to “reclaim Pepe from normies,” or members of the mainstream, by making Pepe so culturally unacceptable that only the fringe Internet would dare to use him. Donald Trump had earlier tweeted an image of Pepe-as-Trump, and then his son posted an image on Instagram that included Pepe.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Examining reports of slow write speeds on the 32GB iPhone 7 by Jeff Kampman  2:20 PM on October 21, 2016 Reports are going around of late that the 32GB iPhone 7 has demonstrably slower write performance than its larger siblings. Under the provocative title "iPhone 7 - What Apple Doesn't Want You To Know," YouTuber Unbox Therapy has shown that the 32GB version of the phone has much slower write performance than the 128GB version. He concludes that Apple "probably went a little bit chintzier on the lower-capacity models in terms of the quality or caliber" of the devices' storage, leading to the performance difference. When I saw these results, I immediately surmised that the write performance of the storage subsystem in the iPhone 7 is limited by the number of dies hooked up to the device's storage controller. In general, we know that the more flash devices one can hook up to a controller, the more performance one can extract from solid-state storage, at least to a point. It appears that hunch could be correct. Thanks to the fearless folks at iFixit and Chipworks, we know some of the details of the iPhone's storage subsystem. At least some iPhone 7s use a 32GB SK Hynix H23QEG8VG2ACS storage chip. According to SK Hynix's data sheet, that chip contains four flash devices inside one package, for a total of 256Gb—or 32GB—of raw storage space. At least some 128GB versions of the iPhone 7 use the SK Hynix H23Q1T8QK2MYS chip, according to Chipworks, and that part has eight dies in a package. Chipworks also says the 256GB iPhone 7 uses an eight-die package with Toshiba 3D NAND inside. We know next to nothing about Apple's storage controller in the iPhone 7, but it seems possible the controller isn't able to saturate all of its channels when it's paired with the 32GB SK Hynix chip. If that's true, the drop in write performance is regrettable, and it has unfortunate implications for moving data onto the device. Still, the difference seems to be a result of well-understood limitations in flash storage architectures, not because Apple "went a little bit chintzier in terms of the quality or caliber" of the 32GB phone's storage.

Target has installed 147 megawatts (million watts or MW) of solar capacity on 300 stores, according to the 2016 Solar Means Business Report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). "We're incredibly proud of the progress we've made in improving building efficiencies and reducing environmental impact. Our commitment to installing solar panels on 500 stores and distribution centers by 2020 is evidence of that progress," John Leisen, vice president of property management at Target, said in the SEIA statement. Walmart had held the top spot for the previous four years and still claims second place with 145MW of solar power installed on 364 buildings, according to the SEIA, which has been tracking corporate solar deployments for the past five years. This year, real estate developer Prologis came in third with 107.8MW of solar. Apple, which is in fourth place with 93.9MW of installed solar power, is a likely contender for first place sometime next year. Last year, Apple announced it was investing $850 million in a solar power plant through a partnership with First Solar, one of the nation's largest photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers and provider of utility-scale PV plants. Through a 25-year purchasing agreement, Apple will get 130MW from the new California Flats Solar Project. The project is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Other Top 10 companies recognized in the SEIA's report include Costco (50.7 MW), Kohl's (50.2 MW), IKEA (44 MW), Macy's (38.9 MW), General Growth Properties (30.2 MW) and Hartz Mountain Industries (22.7 MW). While IKEA is in seventh place, it powers 91% of its retail locations through solar, according to the SEIA. Overall, U.S. corporations have doubled their solar installations year over year and are expected to close out 2016 with nearly 280MW of solar power -- compared to 130MW in 2015. The SEIA's report covers corporate solar installations in 38 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico; it tracks almost 1,100MW of solar installations at 2,000 U.S. companies. "To put that in context, that's enough electricity to power the equivalent of 193,000 homes every year," the report stated. "Also noteworthy, in just the first three quarters of 2016, the report found 142MW of corporate solar was added in the U.S., more than was installed in all of 2015 (129 MW)." In 2014, frustrated by a lack of renewable energy and a purchasing system that's too complicated, major U.S. companies joined an initiative to force the government and utilities to change. Along with the World Wildlife Fund and the World Resources Institute, the corporations signed a pact supporting six principles to clearly identify what's needed when purchasing renewable energy. The initial companies included Bloomberg, Facebook, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Mars, Novelis, Procter and Gamble, REI, Sprint and Walmart. The companies called for six specific changes they wanted the energy industry to adopt to increase renewable energy use: Greater choice in procurement options More access to cost competitive options Longer- and variable-term contracts Access to new projects that reduce emissions Streamlined third-party financing Increased purchasing options with utilities "Solar plays a vital role within our renewable energy portfolio," Mark Vanderhelm, vice president of energy for Walmart, said in a statement. "This is evident by our 2020 commitment of doubling solar energy projects at our Walmart stores, Sam's Clubs and distribution centers across the nation. Our focus is on finding those solar projects that are right for the business."

Cynthia Littleton Managing Editor: Television @Variety_Cynthia 2 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Print Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of AT&T and Time Warner October 21, 2016 | 12:40PM PT As AT&T and Time Warner executives hunker down in merger talks, the most significant questions swirling around the deal revolve around the price tag and the timing of the courtship for AT&T. Speculation is growing that the talks are focused on setting a cash and stock transaction. The floor price was set two years ago when Time Warner rejected an unsolicited offer valued at $85 a share from 21st Century Fox. Analysts are suggesting the deal would have to be in the $105-$110 per share range (although some say higher) to offer a roughly 30% premium over the Time Warner’s trading price earlier this week, before shares began to spike Thursday on news of the AT&T talks. TW shares were up as much as 12% in trading Friday, soaring to the $93 range before settling back down to close at $89.48, up 8%. That’s still a huge leap from trading in the $79 range during the past few months. From AT&T’s perspective, the timing of the deal is puzzling, leading observers to speculate that the telco giant was afraid of another suitor beating them to the acquisition of Time Warner. Apple is known to have flirted – but not much more than that — with acquiring Time Warner in the recent past. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Apple is “monitoring the situation closely” as AT&T and Time Warner talks progress. Apple and Time Warner’s HBO partnered early last year on distribution of the standalone HBO Now service, which had helped strengthen ties between the companies. Apple content guru Eddy Cue and HBO CEO Richard Plepler shared the stage on Thursday at Vanity Fair’s New Establishment Summit, talking up the success they’ve seen in tying their two brands together. Related AT&T + Time Warner: 3 Reasons a Merger Makes Sense and 3 Hurdles Google has been mentioned as another potential suitor as it moves to beef up its video businesses under the YouTube umbrella. There’s also the potential of a deep-pocketed player from overseas, such as China’s Dalian Wanda Group, although that would surely be a much harder sell to investors and regulators. Fox is not in the mix this time around, a source said. Apple and Google have the financial wherewithal to easily scoop up Time Warner, if they were so inclined. The same cannot be said for AT&T at present. The company closed its $48 billion acquisition of satellite giant DirecTV last year. It already has about $126 billion in debt on its books, a load that would balloon to nearly $200 billion with a Time Warner transaction, according to an analysis by New State Research’s Jonathan Chaplin. AT&T reports its third quarter earnings on Tuesday, which is likely another factor in the rush to get an agreement in hand. The lack of overlapping assets between AT&T and Time Warner would limit the amount of cost savings that could be immediately squeezed out of the combination. AT&T chairman-CEO Randall Stephenson has made no secret of his interest in expanding the telco’s reach in the content arena. But AT&T observers expected Stephenson to wait at least another year to take on an acquisition of this magnitude. Peter Chernin, the former News Corp. COO who launched a digital content venture with AT&T in 2014, is understood to be advising Stephenson on the Time Warner talks amid speculation he could play a larger role if the deal comes together. The timing of setting a cash-and-stock deal is less than idea for AT&T as its shares have been in a slump since mid-August, dropping nearly 17% during the past two months. The stock closed at $38.65 on Thursday. It took another 3% hit on Friday as the reports of the acquisition talks gained steam. Reaction to the prospect of a deal was mixed among Wall Street observers. Some were skeptical of the value of marrying Time Warner’s content with AT&T’s satellite TV and high-speed Internet services. Others suggest that adding Time Warner’s high-end content would help AT&T position DirecTV to compete with Comcast and other large MVPDs and help AT&T enhance its wireless offerings on the telco side of the equation. DirecTV is about to embark on the ambitious launch of an Internet-delivered channel package, DirecTV Now, in the hopes of making a more attractive offer to subscribers for bundling video and high-speed data services. “The price paid for any deal could be overkill as (1) licensing content has become more pervasive than it was a few years ago and (2) exclusivity is not necessary and in fact may not be a good use of Time Warner’s valuable content,” Cowen & Co. analyst Colby Synesael. “It is not clear how 1+1 in this case equals something greater than 2 despite AT&T’s success with other large acquisitions.” Chaplin, who covers AT&T for New Street Research, sees AT&T’s interest in acquiring a significant content portfolio as a “defensive” play against competition on the video and wireless services front coming from Comcast and other cable giants. “We are very skeptical of there being synergies between owning both content and distribution assets, but both AT&T and Verizon appear to have a different view,” he wrote. The specter of the disastrous AOL-Time Warner merger, completed in early 2001, hangs over any transaction involving Time Warner. Under the leadership of Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, the company has pursued a clearly defined strategy to pare down its holdings to focus squarely on content. In 2009, the company divested Time Warner Cable, the nation’s second-largest operator, under the rationale that Time Warner would be better served by plowing resources into content creation and distribution, not the capital-intensive needs of an MVPD. AT&T’s desire to grow may wind up reversing that course with an offer too good to refuse, or an aggressive bid that brings other players out onto the field. Whatever the outside, the flurry of activity around Time Warner in the past 48 hours will be good for other media stocks and likely ignite the consolidation that analysts have been predicting for the past two years or so. “This final thesis is playing out quicker than we expected, but it demonstrates the embedded value of media content in distribution platforms,” RBC Capital Markets Steven Cahall wrote.

Stan Lee Says Doctor Doom Is Not A Villain AT&T Looking To Buy Warner Bros & DC Entertainment Parent Company Matthew Mueller - 10/21/2016 4 comments share Newsletter Share on Facebook Tweet This Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Pin to Pinterest Time Warner is the belle of the ball at the moment, as the prominent company has multiple suitors in addition to the previously revealed courting of AT&T. AT&T is well aware of the increasing interest in the company, and according to a source close to the situation (via Bloomberg Markets) is attempting to head off other possible bidders at the pass and close the deal as soon as possible. The source, who wishes to be unidentified, has also said the conversations between the companies has intensified. The last thing they want to do is lose Time Warner to other companies like Google or Apple. The renewed interest has had a significantly positive effect on Time Waner's stock, which has risen 14% to $94.44 and has increased the company's market value to over $70 billion. Both Apple and Google are staying quiet on their plans or interest, but a source within Apple says they aren't planning on bidding, at least at the moment. The rumor of their involvement stems a discussion between Eddy Cue, Apple's services and content chief, and Olaf Olafsson, who is Time Warner's corporate strategy head. Still, it's unlikely that they will enter the fray. Regardless of who puts in a bid for Time Warner, the bid itself will need to start at $100 a share according to Brean Capital analyst Alan Gould, who values the shares at $123 currently. “We have always believed that the combination of content and distribution makes sense,” Gould said in the note. Time Warner “has been the greatest content factory for films and TV. Given the rapidly evolving distribution universe, we believe content ownership could be beneficial.” AT&T is still the predominant favorite to absorb Time Warner, and it would definitely have positive effects for the company. Time Warner owns HBO, CNN, Justice League studio Warner Bros., and of course DC Comics, all assets that would definitely be worth coveting. The only problem is that if they do absorb the company, they will also take on at least another 24 billion in long-term debt, adding to their current debut of $120 billion. While Time Warner's stock went up, AT&T's went down 4%. If the deal does go through, many will be interested to see how things shake out at AT&T in the long term, and how they adjust to their sizable new addition. As for Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment, it's doubtful that any significant changes would occur, at least in the short term.

The rumor comes from noted Japanese publisher Macotakara which was among the first to predict the iPhone 7 is killing the headphone jack. New York, meet the world’s tech scene 5,000 Tech leaders are coming to NYC this November to learn and do business. This is your chance to join them. Check it out The website claims that along with the USB port, Apple may also get rid of the MagSafe 2 and Thunderbolt 2 ports. Instead, the new MacBook Pro will support Thunderbolt 3. This means you’ll likely have to charge the laptop through the USB-C port or Thunderbolt 3. Of course, you’ll still need to resort to some sort of USB 3.0 adapter since the majority of peripheral devices still use the traditional standard. Macotakara’s report further suggests the tech titan will unveil the new MacBook Pro at an event sometime this month. According to the rumor, it will arrive in 15.4-inch and 13.3-inch models. The Japanese publisher also speculates Apple will release a next-gen 13.3-inch MacBook Air, but will likely discontinue its current 11-inch model. Previous reports around the the company’s new lineup of laptops hinted that – much like the iPhone 7 – Apple might also be considering killing the standard headphone jack on the MacBook Pros. So in case the reports turn out to be true: Apple fan boys and girls better prepare to spend a boatload of cash on auxiliary adapters and docks. At present, Apple sells its own USB Type C dock with ports for USB 3.0, USB-C for charging as well as HDMI. Still, it’s a bit pricey at $79. via Engadget on Macotakara Read next: This digital frame streams beautiful, curated art to any wall AppleGearMacBookMacBook Pro Share on Facebook (870) Share on Twitter (351) Mix is a reporter from Amsterdam.

Smith Twitter feeds   Newer Older Main | Yet Another Post Office Story » Friday Oct212016 Is Apple Going the Way of the Post Office? by Amy Ridenour | Oct 21, 2016 at 3:26 PM Hate to say it, but I think Apple, one of America's premier companies, may have its best days behind it. Yesterday, I wrote about incompetence at the U.S. Postal Service. Today, it's Apple. Used to be, you paid more for an Apple computer, but, in exchange, you got hardware that would last and an operating system that was superior, even if you did have to give up on a lot of software options because many developers only made their products for Windows or, showing my age here, MS-DOS. I speak, obviously, of the Steve Job days, so I concede there was an exception for some years in the 90s (although we stayed loyal, even then). I went for Apple -- which means the National Center for Public Policy Research went Apple -- in 1985, and we never looked back, despite some concern for the company's politics, and a well-covered contretemps with Tim Cook after we submitted a shareholder proposal examining the company's actual record on environmental issues versus the one the public hears about. But last week, one of our laptops, purchased in 2015, wouldn't start up. We took it to an authorized Mac repair shop in Severna Park, MD. Bad logic board. Apple sent a replacement. It was bad also. Ever since, we've been trying to get Apple to ship a second replacement logic board to the repair shop. It won't. It says it will, or so we're told, but, every day, it doesn't. I even called Apple myself to try to find out why it wouldn't ship the part, but got nowhere, because the person at Apple, while cordial, had no idea how to tell if Apple would ship the part and he told me he had no idea how to transfer me to someone at Apple who would know -- even though the repair facility gave me the order number so Apple could pull the record up on its computer system and trace the request. The guy I'm speaking with at the repair shop tells me he worked for Apple itself for a decade, and he swears Apple has these orders on a computer (of course it does!), but the guy at Apple had no idea how to find us in the system, even with all our data on hand. Once upon a time, when I needed Apple repairs (rarely) or upgrades (more likely), I actually would go to the back of the shop and watch them work, to learn how to do it myself. The company in those days seemed organized and well-run, even though everyone swore it couldn't last. This version of Apple seems to be in chaos. Logic boards really should last longer than a year, but let's set that aside, and just say this: One ought to be able to get a replacement if it does go out. Apple's not claiming it has a shortage, or a backlog, of logic boards for late-model laptops. It just isn't sending the part after saying it will. Day after day. How long will this go on?

Apple Investigating Report Of iPhone 7 Catching Fire Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Investigating Report Of iPhone 7 Catching Fire Image courtesy of Australia's 7 News October 21, 2016 1:44 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler Another hot device samsung apple iphone fires iPhone 7 damage investigation australia report While we’ve heard numerous reports of Samsung smartphones and tablets overheating and catching fire — sometimes destroying property and injuring customers — now Apple is on the receiving end of at least one similar report.  Apple says it has opened an investigating into the alleged fire of an iPhone 7 device in Australia, Business Insider reports. The incident, which happened last week, reportedly occurred when the owner of the week-old phone left it in his pants’ pocket inside his car while he went surfing. Australia’s 7 News reports that when the man returned to his car it was filled with smoke and its interior was destroyed. The man says that he hadn’t dropped the phone or used a foreign charger. Photos taken by the man show the phone destroyed: broken in two pieces and charred from the fire. A spokesperson for Apple told Business Insider that it is aware of the incident and has opened an investigation. A search of the Consumer Product Safety Commissions’ SaferProducts.gov database shows several reports of customers experiencing fires with their iPhones, however, most were related to the device’s charging cable or an older version of the phone. In a report from 2013, the owner of a iPhone 3GS tells the CPSC that his device was working fine when he noticed the battery had exploded. “The phone is now useless,” the report states. “This could have caused serious harm if I had been holding the device to my head and talking on it.” The Australian incident comes after dozens of customers reported similar fires or smoking of Samsung devices. The issues eventually led the tech company to recall and discontinue production of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone.

Finally. We've been waiting for this MacBook Pro overhaul for years. The event will be taking place at 1pm ET and we'll be covering it as it happens. As always, Apple will be livestreaming the presentation on its website. You can watch with Safari for macOS, Safari on iOS, the Apple TV, or Microsoft Edge on Windows 10. As always, a lot of what we're expecting to see has been leaked out. Here's what to expect. A totally redesigned MacBook Pro Image: Martin Hajek - This is a design concept of what Apple's new MacBook Pro with OLED touchscreen could look like. This is the big one. Apple is expected totally overhaul its 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro notebooks. This is a big deal because the actual MacBook Pro design hasn't been changed since 2012, when Apple rolled models with Retina displays. Since then, we've begged and pleaded with Apple to release something worthy of replacing the 2012 MacBook Pro with Retina display. Back in May, analyst Ming Chi-Kuo from KGI Securities reported that Apple was going to overhaul the MacBook Pro, making it thinner and offering an OLED touchscreen above the keyboard. The touchscreen will sit where your function keys sit on the MacBook Pro now, and will dynamically change, based on what apps you're using and what is on your screen. Cult of Mac later obtained "spy photos" of the chassis, showing off where the OLED touchscreen will sit. Image: Cult of Mac The MacBook Pro is also expected to add USB-C ports and Thunderbolt 3 ports for faster connectivity. In fact, a recent Macotakara report suggests Apple will only have USB-C ports on the MacBook Pro. Apple could even get rid of MagSafe, its long-patented (and very useful) power adaptor, and use just USB-C. When it comes to internals, Bloomberg reported back in August that the new MacBook Pro would use AMD graphics. As for processors, Apple could go with Intel's sixth-generation Core Skylake chipset or it could update to the new Kaby Lake processors. We'd love to see Kaby Lake MacBook Pros, especially after waiting this long, but it might come down to yields. Updated MacBook Air Image: Apple Although the MacBook Pro is expected to be the big star of the event, Apple is also expected to update the MacBook Air. Though it might have lost its thin and light crown to the MacBook, it's still Apple's best-selling notebook. It's also Apple's most affordable. Both Bloomberg and Macotakara report that the MacBook Air will be updated with USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 support. The actual hardware design, which Apple has used since 2010, is expected to be the same. The screen is not expected to get an upgrade, so if you want Retina, you need to pony up for a MacBook or MacBook Pro. Macotakara also reports that Apple will be getting rid of the 11-inch MacBook Air, leaving only the 13-inch model in the lineup. Updated iMac Bloomberg reports that Apple will update its 4K and 5K iMacs with faster processors. This makes sense, since Apple did the same thing last year. It's possible the iMac could also get USB-C ports, though we are really hoping to see some Thunderbolt 3 love. Graphics on the iMac are also expected to get a boost, thanks to newer chips from AMD. 5K External Display Back in June, Apple discontinued its beautiful Thunderbolt Display. The discontinuation was notable because there wasn't another product in Apple's lineup to replace it. For years, professional users who use 4K displays have asked where Apple's first-party solution might is. The problem is that in order to successfully drive a 5K display, you need powerful graphics, something a lot of MacBooks just don't have. Back in June, 9to5Mac reported on rumors that Apple was working on a 5K display with an external GPU, in order to drive that needed performance. We just might see it this week. If Apple does roll-out Thunderbolt 3 across its laptop line, that could pave the way for a 5K display with built-in GPU. No Mac mini and Mac Pro updates Image: Apple Apple hasn't updated the Mac Pro since its release three years ago. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the Pro machine will get an update, even thought the addition of USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 would be very welcome to pro users. Similarly, the Mac mini hasn't had an update since October 2014. The Mac mini is a low-volume seller, but plenty of users rely on it for an inexpensive Mac; it's also often used as a server. Sadly, the Mac mini isn't expected to get an update this time.

Join the Conversation To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs AT&T said seeking Time Warner deal by Monday Alex Sherman and Ed Hammond, Bloomberg 2:34 p.m. EDT October 21, 2016 AT&T is in "advanced talks" to acquire entertainment group Time Warner in a move to add in-house content to distribution services, The Wall Street Journal reported on October 21, 2016. AT&T could seal the deal "as early as this weekend," the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. (Photo: Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images) AT&T Inc. is pushing to clinch a deal to buy Time Warner Inc. by Monday, aiming to close the door on other potential bidders, according to a person familiar with the matter. Talks between the companies have accelerated since Bloomberg first reported Thursday that executives had met in recent weeks to discuss potential business combinations, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing private discussions. Part of AT&T’s concern is that other suitors such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google or Apple Inc. could jump in, the person said. Shares of Time Warner, the owner of CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. studio, surged in trading Friday, advancing as much as 14 percent to $94.44. That gives the company a market value in excess of $70 billion and pushes the stock beyond the $85-a-share Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox Inc. unsuccessfully offered in 2014. AT&T, the largest U.S. pay TV company through its ownership of DirecTV, fell as much as 4.4 percent. Apple is unlikely to bid for Time Warner, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Apple’s services and content chief Eddy Cue brought up the idea of a possible deal with Time Warner’s corporate strategy head Olaf Olafsson late last year and said in a podium discussion on Thursday that he was a huge fan of the company’s Home Box Office. Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. AT&T and Time Warner declined to comment. A deal for Time Warner would have to begin at a “bare minimum” of $100 a share, Alan Gould, an analyst at Brean Capital, said in a note Friday. His private market value for the company is $123. “We have always believed that the combination of content and distribution makes sense,” Gould said in the note. Time Warner “has been the greatest content factory for films and TV.Given the rapidly evolving distribution universe, we believe content ownership could be beneficial.” Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bewkes is a willing seller if he gets an offer he thinks is fair, said one of the people. AT&T has transformed itself over the past decade from a regional phone company to a national telecommunications powerhouse. Its plan to focus on media and entertainment targets include companies worth $2 billion to $50 billion, people familiar with the plans said earlier this month. If talks progress to a deal, the combination would make Dallas-based AT&T a media colossus as well. But investors would be asked to swallow another heap of debt, and probably a diluted equity stake, just a year after the company borrowed to acquire DirecTV for $48.5 billion. AT&T, with the third-lowest investment-grade rating, could make a deal work without getting downgraded to junk — but it would be tough. The company has $120 billion in debt, while New York-based Time Warner had long-term obligations of more than $24 billion. AT&T’s long-dated bonds dropped after the news. Its $2.5 billion of 4.55 percent coupon notes due in 2049 sank 4.03 cents to 96.64 cents at 11:34 a.m in New York, according to Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Its $3.5 billion of 4.75 percent securities due in 2046 declined 4.73 cents to 99.93 cents at 12:28 p.m. The cost to protect against losses on Time Warner bonds dropped 1.64 basis points to 64.36 basis points at 12:22 p.m. in New York, according to prices from data provider CMA.

Consumers are likewise unaware that the counterfeit Apple products that Amazon.com sourced from Mobile Star have not been safety certified or properly constructed, lack adequate insulation and/or have inadequate spacing between low voltage and high voltage circuits, and pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock."  Amazon is not named in the lawsuit, though it directly sold the products. Amazon said in a statement to 9to5Mac that it "has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site. We work closely with manufacturers and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively."  The products were bought by Apple as part of the company's regular efforts to analyze items sold on Amazon that are labeled as Apple products.

Getting right down to it, the new A10 Fusion chip that powers Apple's iPhone 7 is an absolute beast. While new iPhone models are always faster than their predecessors, Apple really outdid itself with the A10, both in terms of overall performance and power efficiency; as we were reminded in a new showdown on Friday, the iPhone 7 crushes leading Android phones. DON'T MISS: iPhone 7 Plus vs Google Pixel speed tests: Closer, but Android was still crushed in the end When Apple introduced the iPhone 7, it boasted that the A10 Fusion is the "most powerful chip ever in a smartphone" and, truth be told, it's hard to disagree. As a quick point of reference, consider this: the A10 chip is 40% faster than the A9 chip Apple used in the iPhone 6s. That's a tremendous year-over-year improvement no matter how you look at it. Since the iPhone 7's release, a variety of testing has confirmed that Apple's A10 Fusion processor is best in class. Most recently, microprocessor analyst Linley Gwennap of Mobile Chip Report recently said that the A10 "blows away the competition." Apple’s investment in custom CPU design continues to pay off, as the new iPhone 7 delivers better performance than any other flagship smartphone and outscores even some low-end PCs. The phone uses a new processor chip, the A10 Fusion, that contains not one but two custom CPU designs, representing Apple’s first foray into the Big.Little approach that many other mobile processors employ. The massive Hurricane CPU improves performance by 35% over the previous-generation Twister, boosting both the clock speed and the per-clock performance. The smaller Zephyr CPU helps the iPhone 7 extend battery life compared with its predecessor. You might also remember that Anandtech had similar praise for the iPhone 7's hardware, calling it "unparalleled and a cut above anything else in the industry." Putting the iPhone 7 through any number of tests, the results speak for themselves.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Your iPhone has a secret one-handed keyboard Apple Your iPhone has a secret one-handed keyboard By Bindu Nair - Oct 21, 2016 The advent of huge phablets in the market has necessitated the need for a one-handed mode in keyboards so people can type without stretching their fingers to uncomfortable lengths. While a number of manufacturers ship their handsets with such a feature in-built, Apple isn’t one of them. As it turns out, Apple has been hiding a secret one-handed keyboard for years. Developer Steve Troughton-Smith uncovered the code for this buried ability while tinkering about iOS Simulater, a tool which lets people test apps for bugs. Surprisingly, the mode has been around since at least iOS 8 which came out in 2014. Why Apple has been sitting on a one-handed keyboard for so long is a mystery. Owners of the bigger iPhone 6/6S/7 Plus would probably love to have a more convenient option when typing up a storm. According to Troughton-Smith, the feature can be activated by swiping either left or right from the edge of the normal keyboard. Also Read: The iPhone 7 has a hidden virtual home button While the area of the keyboard remains the same, the one-handed mode automatically squeezes the keys closer together and introduces three big buttons for cutting, copying and pasting. Unfortunately, there’s no easy way for iPhone users to start using the secret skill straight away. Troughton-Smith’s made the code for the one-handed mode publicly available in case someone wants to try it out. However, they’ll have to be in possession of a jailbroken iPhone to do so. Apple will hopefully get going and release the keyboard in a future iOS release for people who don’t happen to have one ready.

The New York pop-up shop will be open through the end of this year, and let people get their hands on new Google devices such as Pixel smartphones which began shipping Thursday in a direct challenge to Apple's latest iPhones. "This is not even a testing ground, just an extension of the launch," Google spokeswoman Chrissy Persico said at the showroom opening event. "We want people to come in and experience the products." Google early this month took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching the in-house designed Pixel smartphone and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess. By producing both the phone hardware and its Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. The pop-up shop also displayed Google's freshly unveiled Daydream View virtual reality headset, a modular wi-fi system, and a Home virtual assistant that will challenge the Amazon Echo device. Nothing is sold at the Google shop, but the staff directs potential customers to the company's online store or telephone operators who can take orders for products. A wall in the shop is decorated with an artful arrangement of blue, red, yellow and green blocks, arranged to display the internet company's trademark colors. Only 30 or so visitors ventured into the pop-up store for its opening morning, a lean showing in comparison to mobs typically drawn to new Apple stores.

(Matthew Emmons/USA TODAY Sports) 1. Do you have any faith anymore that, when faced with a crisis, Roger Goodell will do the right thing? As a football fan, you want to feel good about the state of the game, and you want to have some confidence that those who are running the show have the best interest of the game at heart. When presented with a challenge, they’ll figure it out. The NFL has survived for almost 100 years and gone from dirt fields and leather helmets to a billion-dollar industry because there have been smart, talented people at the helm who all find a way to make it work. But over the last dozen years, watching Goodell and his team bungle things like domestic violence policy, player safety, or the wildly inconsistent disciplinary process — all against the backdrop of declining TV ratings and the #boycottNFL hashtag — it’s clear that, to paraphrase veteran receiver Steve Smith, “the system is broken.” The latest example? The ghastly Josh Brown case. It’s hard to imagine an investigation being mishandled worse than what the league and the Giants did when it came to their kicker and the charges against him. Make no mistake: This is not some New Englander viewing Goodell through a local prism. There’s no Deflategate-related axe to grind, although Smith did adroitly note that when it comes to comparing Tom Brady’s four-game ban and Brown’s situation, the league has “valued the amount of air in a ball but yet devalued when a person or persons may have been harmed and fail to put forth necessary actions of energy and time in which far less important things have taken precedent!” The bottom line? I can’t recall a time where so many fans and players — no matter their background — have had so little confidence in a sitting commissioner. Never is this more aptly shown than when, on the few occasions where Goodell comes down from his ivory tower to address the media — hat’s when social media turns into an episode of “Mystery Science Theatre” where players gleefully take their shots at the commissioner. I wasn’t around for much of his reign, but from talking to people who were involved in the NFL during his tenure, you had faith that Pete Rozelle would always find a way to do the right thing. There were missteps, but no one did a better job growing the game than Rozelle. There was almost always some measure of faith in Paul Tagliabue and his decision-making process. There’s none of that anymore. Zero. Of course, you can argue that Goodell has never had that sort of backing from the public to begin with. But even if he did have it at some point, after his decisions over the last decade or so, it’s gone, and never coming back. At the end of the day, the commissioner doesn’t need the approval of the fans. He doesn’t need a thumbs up from the NFLPA. The only people he needs to keep happy are the 32 NFL owners. And as long as the money keeps flowing, they probably won’t be making a change anytime soon. But like Smith said, the system is broken. Whether or not the league makes the fix could ultimately end up determining the course of the game for the next 100 years. 2. Annie Apple, the mother of New York Giants rookie corner Eli Apple, became a minor celebrity after her son was drafted, developing an affiliation with ESPN while offering a unique opinion on the state of the NFL. Good for her for speaking he mind when it came to the Brown situation this week. In a series of Tweets, she attacked New York co-owner John Mara for his stance on the Brown issue. “As a domestic violence survivor, reading these Mara comments makes me sad, angry and completely baffled. He just doesn’t get it. This is sad,” she wrote. “Don’t know why it’s difficult [for] folks to realize there’s nothing remotely acceptable bout violence against women. No excuse no justification.” Apple has apparently taken a lot of heat from Giants fans for her Tweets, and while it couldn’t have been easy for her, it was the right thing to do in this instance. 3. We’ve written about the “GTFB” mantra that’s been preached by the New England defense over the last dozen or so years, and while there are worrisome elements to the defense through the first six games (third-down, red-zone), their work on limiting explosive plays is certainly worth noting. Through six weeks, the Patriots are the only team in the league not to allow a pas splay of 40 yards or more. (For some perspective, the Raiders lead the league with nine.) New England is 11th in the league when it comes to yielding pass plays of 20 yards or more with 20. (The Raiders are also tops in this department, having given up 28.) It’s probably no shock that the Minnesota defense is one of the best in the league in both departments, having allowed just one pass play of 40 yards or more (second to New England) and 11 pass plays of 20 yards or more (best in the NFL). The other thing worth noting? From the outside it’s tough to tell what sort of job he’s doing, but you have to give some credit to new safeties coach Steve Belichick. The Patriots took some grief when the son of the head coach was named as the new safeties coach, but whether it’s been coaching, execution, good matchups or all three, the younger Belichick deserves some acknowledgement for the good numbers put up by the defensive backs. 4. As expected, quarterback Tom Brady was really deferential to the Pittsburgh defense this week, saying that while the names and faces have changed over the years, the overall hard-nosed philosophy has never been altered. “They play the game the right way,” Brady said of the Steelers. But it’s worth noting that when it comes to the Steelers, Brady has almost always posted phenomenal numbers. In eight career games against Pittsburgh, Brady is 6-2, and has completed 69 percent of his passes, to go along with 2,604 passing yards, 22 touchdowns, just three interceptions and a passer rating of 113.4. In his last five starts against Pittsburgh, Brady has 17 touchdowns and no interceptions, with a 127.9 passer rating. Two more notes when it comes to touchdown passes — with six in his first two games, Brady has more passing touchdowns this season than four of the quarterbacks who have started every game so far. And the Patriots’ quarterbacks have not thrown an interception in their first six games of the season. In New England’s last nine games (including the 2015 postseason), Patriots quarterbacks have just two picks, both of which came via Brady in the AFC title game. In his last nine starts, New York’s Ryan Fitzpatrick has thrown 15 interceptions. 5. With all the talk about Stephen Gostkowski’s recent run of inconsistency, thought it was worth noting that the Patriots did not bring in any kickers for tryouts this week. From this viewpoint, the steady veteran has earned enough currency with the team; he’ll figure it out sooner rather than later. When it comes to the level of faith his teammates have in him, this is a good look from colleague Ryan Hannable about the confidence level many have in Gostkowski, even though he’s gotten off to arguably the worst start of his professional career. 6. While the Patriots are one of seven or eight teams that aren’t simply crossing days off the calendar and waiting until draft season at this point, it’s never too early to at least start thinking about draft season. The current draft order will change from week to week, but at this point, New England holds the 31st overall selection, one spot from the bottom of the first round. A lot has to play out between now and then — including free agency — but it’s reasonable to speculate that the Patriots would be in the market for some tackle depth, as well as edge rushers and/or linebackers. (As everyone knows, much of their priority list could depend on their ability to re-sign the likes of Dont’a Hightower, Jamie Collins, Jabaal Sheard and perhaps Martellus Bennett, among others.) For what it’s worth, this site has the Patriots going after inside linebacker Raekwon McMillion out of Ohio State. CBS Sports has them chasing Derek Barnett, a defensive end/outside linebacker out of Tennessee. And Walter Football has New England landing Stanford running back/wide receiver Christian McCaffrey out of Stanford at the end of the first round. 7. With all the talk about the future of Jimmy Garoppolo and what he might be able to draw on the open market, the same question could surround the quarterback the Patriots are facing this weekend, Pittsburgh’s Landry Jones. The 27-year-old, who is in the last year of a four-year deal he signed as a rookie, will be able to use Sunday’s game against the Patriots (and however long Roethlisberger will be out) as an audition for the 2017 season. He’s done well in limited action — the third-year backup out of Oklahoma has made two starts as a professional, both in 2015. In his career, the 6-foot-4, 225-pounder is 32-for-56 (57 percent) for 513 yards, three touchdowns, four interceptions and a passer rating of 76. How he performs could also potentially impact the trade value of someone like Garoppolo, if the Patriots do decide to explore those options. Regardless, it certainly adds another layer of intrigue to Sunday’s matchup. 8. I’ve always been a big fan of the work of Chase Stuart, and have utilized his information on several occasions in the past. This week, he produced a look at the strength of schedule left for all 32 NFL teams. The teams that might be in the best situation over the second half? The Titans, Texans, Chiefs, Chargers and Bills, all of who have the easiest schedules the rest of the way. At the other end of the spectrum, there are the Eagles, Redskins, Seahawks, Cowboys and Ravens. Locally, the Patriots are in the middle of the pack with the 16th easiest schedule the rest of the way. 9. When it comes to winners, this week, I’ve picked Green Bay, New York Giants, Kansas City, Tennessee, Minnesota, Cincinnati, Detroit, Oakland, Buffalo, Baltimore, Tampa Bay, Atlanta, New England, Seattle and Denver. Make your picks with us over at the WEEI Pro Football Pick ‘Em Challenge. 10. We’ve got “NFL Sunday” coming your way from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m., getting you prepped for Patriots-Steelers. It’ll be me, Pete Sheppard, Tom E. Curran, Field Yates, Christian Fauria and the great Pete “Rotobahn” Davidson. Join us at 93.7 or at WEEI.com/listen.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley defends newsletter article on ballot measures amid scrutiny Friday Oct 21, 2016 at 10:38 AM Oct 21, 2016 at 10:52 AM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — A half-page article published in the Town of Apple Valley's October-December edition of the “Our Town” newsletter has come under scrutiny for its portrayal of the voter-initiated, Liberty-funded Measure V. In a post on the Flash Report, Sacramento-based political blogger Katy Grimes wrote that the article in the town’s newsletter constitutes an illegal use of taxpayer funds that “undermines” Measure V and advocates for the town-sponsored Measure W. “This newsletter misrepresents and provides the voters of Apple Valley with a false comparison of the Town Council’s Measure W, and the People’s Voter-Approval Measure V,” Grimes wrote. “... While the Newsletter lists a number of alleged ‘public concerns’ regarding the provision of water services to the citizens of Apple Valley, the striking difference between Measures V and W is that the Apple Valley Town Council measure is nothing more than an attempt to undermine the initiative qualified by the 4,000 Apple Valley residents.” Measures V and W are competing measures and are both on the Nov. 8 ballot. Measure V would require voter approval of any project in Apple Valley valued at more than $10 million. Measure W, supported by the Town Council, would require voter approval of any project valued at more than $5 million, except the town's attempted takeover of the water system owned by Liberty Utilities. It also would eliminate the need for a vote as long as the Town Council met four key criteria. Apple Valley resident Pat Hanson, along with her late husband Chuck, submitted more than 5,300 signatures to the town clerk in May, and 3,873 of those signatures — about 12 percent of voters in the town — were found to be valid in June, according to a previous Daily Press report. That percentage has been used by both sides leading up to the election in attempts to sway voters. While proponents of Measure V say that the citizenry has effectively spoken by providing their signatures, Measure W backers reiterate the sentiment of Councilman Larry Cusack: “Only about 12 percent of the town’s voting population signed the petition, and signature gatherers were out there for a long time.” While Grimes argues the “Our Town” article “is neither impartial nor merely informational,” town officials say they were not contacted for comment before the post's publication on Oct. 18. Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin told the Daily Press the town is allowed by state law to provide “neutral, factual information” about the ballot measures. “We are confident the ‘Our Town’ newsletter article meets these standards,” Martin said. Despite the town’s stance, Sacramento-based attorney Thomas Hiltachk — who drafted Measure V — sent a letter to Town Attorney John Brown on Sept. 28 that objected to the “Our Town” publication, which he referred to as a taxpayer-funded “political newsletter.” “Clearly and undeniably,” Hiltachk wrote, “the newsletter content is the Town’s campaign rhetoric without facts critical to a fair and impartial description for voters.” To illustrate that “impartial description,” Hiltachk included in his letter a side-by-side comparison of the legal text in both Measures V and W, saying, “The very essence of the two measures is described completely differently, though the exact same language (Hiltachk’s emphasis) is used in each of the two proposed ordinances.” Hiltachk concluded: “... The expenditures made for this mailing (or at least a portion thereof) are clearly unlawful and fully reportable as a campaign expenditure under the Political Reform Act.” Hiltachk told the Daily Press on Thursday he never received a response from Brown on the letter. Brown did respond, however, to a letter sent earlier in September in which Hiltachk cautioned against what Brown called “the use of public funds for the purpose of educating and informing (town) residents and taxpayers.” In the response letter, Brown said he regularly advises Councilors and town staff on their obligations under California law with regard to public expenditures in relation to elections. “The Town Council is very familiar with the general rule against advocacy outlined in your letter,” Brown wrote. “Although not mentioned in your letter, I know that you are very familiar with the Town’s right to continue expending public resources on informational activities which fairly present the facts.” Brown added that the town “has very different opinions about these initiative measures.” “Most importantly,” he wrote, “what you characterize as a citizen initiative measure has been publicly acknowledged to have been funded by Liberty Utilities ... In accordance with the Town’s long-standing practice of community outreach, I anticipate the Town will continue to provide its public with information on these initiative measures which I am sure you would agree could have profound consequences for the residents and taxpayers of the Town of Apple Valley.” Brown’s letter is dated Sept. 8. The “Our Town” newsletter was released on Sept. 16, according to town spokeswoman Charlene Engeron, and included in mailboxes over the next few days. Engeron said every residential address receives the newsletter. On Thursday, Fair Political Practices Commission spokesman Jay Wierenga said the commission would not “comment on or get involved in an election in terms of weighing in on whether something is or isn’t in violation,” but he provided the “Do’s & Don’ts” on campaign-related communications at public expense from the FPPC website. While there are certain instances when it may be appropriate for a government agency to issue communications related to a campaign, there are prohibitions against mass public mailings, including those that are campaign related, according to the FPPC. “The determination of whether a communication ‘expressly advocates’ is relatively straightforward,” the FPPC web page shows, “and is based on whether it contains so called ‘magic words.’” Examples of those words include: “Vote For,” “Elect,” “Support,” “Cast Your Ballot,” “Vote Against,” “Defeat,” “Reject,” or “Sign Petitions For,” according to the FPPC. The document continues: “A mailing ‘unambiguously urges a particular result in an election’ if it: (1) can be reasonably characterized as campaign material or activity, and (2) is not a fair presentation of facts serving only an informational purpose when taking into account the style, tenor, and timing of the communication.” Meanwhile, Hiltachk said the town's newsletter is not only in violation of the Political Reform Act, but “it's actually a violation of our state constitution, which contemplates the government staying out of politics.” “There’s a whole range of legal options available to the taxpayers,” Hiltachk said. “I won’t say this is unique to the Town of Apple Valley. It’s come up before. That’s why we have rules about it. But it’s really up to the people of Apple Valley to decide what they want to do about it. It's their money.” Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254. Follow him on Twitter @DP_MatthewCabe.

It burned furniture, floors, cars and even a house,” Zach Epstein reports for BGR. “The phone has officially been recalled and discontinued, with Samsung warning all owners that they should power down the device immediately and return it to a local retailer at once,” Epstein reports. “There has never been a more serious problem with a smartphone in the history of the industry, and yet many people refuse to turn in their handsets and insist on putting themselves and those around them at risk.” Epstein reports, “More than 1 million people have yet to return their potentially dangerous Galaxy Note 7 phones, according to [Korea JoongAng Daily]’s sources.” Read more in the full article here.

They populate the left side of the bell curve and therefore should be expected to frequently make poor decisions and arrive at faulty conclusions.

Mr. Tuttle Friday, October 21, 2016 - 4:12 pm · Reply I agree with you to an extent about broadbrushing ALL Android OS users as idiots. Where I depart on your opinion is about these Note 7 users though. The idea that these people still want to keep a phone that MAY potentially be a health and physical hazard to them and people around them is idiotic. This after a recall and instruction by Samsung to return the phones to the carrier. ivid Friday, October 21, 2016 - 2:09 pm · Reply Samsung should employ Apple style nag-ware, broadcast messages to Note 7 owners that their phone is a risk and might explode etc. Maybe that would get their attention.

Apple investigating car fire caused by its latest flagship It looks like the year of exploding smartphones. Sami Khan   October 21, 2016 21:14 IST 10 Shares 10 Shares Apple iPhone 7 catches fireReuters Samsung suffered a multi-billion-dollar loss due to the Galaxy Note 7's explosion fiasco. But it seems its biggest rival Apple is falling on the same lines. Following a recent report of an iPhone 7 Plus catching fire, Apple has been hit by another incident involving an iPhone 7 being the cause of a car fire. According to 7 News, a south coast surfer identified as Mat Jones found his car filled with smoke after his one-week-old iPhone 7 ignited and damaged his car. Why advertise with us? Related Samsung Galaxy Note 7 explosion: Samsung's loss is potentially Apple's gain Galaxy Note 7: AirAsia joins other carriers to ban Samsung smartphone "Ash was just coming from inside the pants which then, once you unwrapped the pants, the phone was just melting inside of it," Jones told 7 News. Jones said that he never dropped his new iPhone nor he used a third-party, unauthorised charger, which may have caused the malfunction. According to Tech First Post, Apple is aware of the incident and it is investigating the cause of the phone's ignition. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 explosions have put mobile users on the edge. The South Korean tech giant issued a formal statement to switch off the phones and recalled all units of the much-hyped flagship. The extent of the Galaxy Note 7 was so huge that the devices were banned from airplanes. It is too soon to tell if Apple's latest flagships, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, are at similar risk, but if the reports continue to pour in then Apple would need to consider a thorough check-up. As of this moment, the iPhone 7 series hasn't reached to the level where the company must recall its units, which would not only harm the business, but also tarnish Apple's reputation.

Comments Computerworld | Oct 21, 2016 8:17 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Apple Mac Operating Systems Windows PCs Apple MacBook Pro Comments The word “hello” means something in the Apple universe. It was the first word on the first Mac, the first word on the iMac, and was part of the company’s WWDC invitation, where it announced adoption of the name “macOS” to replace OS X. Now it is the buzz word on its invitation to the latest news from the company. Hello to what? That Apple is saying “Hello” must be significant, especially with some Mac models having seen no upgrade for almost three years (1,000 days). We won’t know how significant until next week, but with claims it plans to enhance touch in Macs with is new ‘Magic Keyboard’ and ‘Magic Touchbar’ and reports claiming the A10 series processor used inside current iPhones is equally as powerful as a low end MacBook (and the A10X easily competes), there are plenty of tongues turning speculation of all types. There is even renewed speculation about what kind of processor the company wants to adopt and whether it will dump the audio jack from Macs. “Star of the show looks set to be a major revamp of the MacBook Pro line-up, with an OLED touch-bar replacing physical function keys,” writes 9-5Mac. “Also rumored to see a refresh is the 13-inch MacBook Air,” says AppleInsider. ABOVE: Does anyone remember Apple's big iPhone hello in 2007? Inflection point We’ve reached a critical point. IBM this week told us all that Macs are a much better deal for enterprise deployments than Windows PCs, and while some enterprise users may delay upgrading to Apple’s superior technology for a while, the move to standards-compliant, platform-agnostic cloud services is mandatory and means the technology lock-ins that once blocked Mac adoption are rapidly disappearing among those enterprises that hope to remain in business in five years time. (Though some resistance will emerge from incumbents in the tech support teams). The time is now and Apple knows it has a huge opportunity and is trying to embrace it. The impact of mobile on its market is also clear. The move to adopt iOS among enterprise users could become a stalking horse for Mac sales in the sector. What can Apple do to its platforms to entice enterprise purchasers to climb aboard the Mac? One thing that makes a lot of sense is to make it as easy to manage Macs in the enterprise as it is to manage an iPhone, and solutions to achieve this are now available from Jamf. Coming soon Apple is not about to give the rest of the PC industry an easy ride. The three-year wait to launch new Macs will turn out not to have been based on any lack of interest in a platform. Think about it: has Apple not updated the OS each year? Has its move to adopt modern languages and to strip the OS (again) of legacy code escaped your notice? Does its determination to adopt a new filing system in the next 12-months mean nothing? Think a little and it seems highly probable the wait has been by design, presumably while the Mac manufacturer developed a range of new technologies – such as the Magic Touchstrip – that it can then safely manufacture in the kind of quantities it takes to bring these to the mass-market. If this is true (and I think it is) then speculation of all kinds is completely reasonable and some or all of the most way out rumors may turn out top be a little truer than we originally thought. That could mean new processors, new iPad/Mac hybrids and radical redesigns (is it time the Mac Pro became the hideously powerful A10X Cube, for example?) Might Apple choose to retire the hardware completely in favor of macOS support on mobile devices? (No). I'm not expecting changes as big as these -- yet -- but never say never with Cupertino. Whatever the company does it will do in full knowledge that: The future is now Following a long break Apple is going to be eager to tell Mac users and the wider PC industry what it sees as the future of the ailing PC market. I do think some of the new Macs it tells us about won’t ship until next year. I also expect the critics to continue their sad and lonely existences inside their tiny reality distortion field bubbles, peddling pusillanimous and predictable criticism of whatever it is the company does announce. All the same, I do not expect Apple’s news will be trivial. The company will webcast its announcement starting at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET) on October 27. I’ll keep you posted during the event. Google+?

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Anick Jesdanun. Updated October 21, 2016 9:39AM SHARE ALSO SEE Amazon Amazon Echo Streaming Music Fire TV Amazon Prime Alexa Apple TV Netflix Hulu Amazon's own video store will no longer have the starring role on the company's Fire TV streaming devices. Software updates coming this year will give movies and TV shows from Netflix, HBO and other competitors equal prominence on the devices' home screen. The approach is similar to one Apple took when it refreshed its Apple TV device last year. Amazon's Fire TV has offered solid performance at reasonable prices, but its home screen has been cluttered with Amazon products -- whether to rent or buy, or offered at no extra charge through Amazon's $99-a-year Prime program. That's made it tough to find video from competing providers without turning to a voice-search feature that, until recently, excluded Netflix. For the most part, finding video typically required opening a service's app first. Now, competing services will be offered space on the home screen. Netflix, for instance, could choose to highlight its original series "Stranger Things" alongside personalized recommendations. Netflix can also include a short video trailer that plays on the home screen. And while Amazon has long had a watch list for viewers to keep track of what they want to watch, choosing a title has directed the viewer back to Amazon's store. Now, Amazon will offer viewers a choice of providers. If a video is available for free through Netflix, for instance, that will be the most prominent option, even if Amazon's own store is selling the same title. The development comes as leading video services make major investments in original shows, making it difficult for any single service to fulfill all of a viewer's needs. An Amazon-centric approach winds up penalizing viewers looking for not just Amazon's "Transparent" but also Netflix's "Luke Cage" and Hulu's "The Mindy Project." The refreshed Fire TV Stick, which begins shipping Thursday for $40, will get the free software update first, followed by the standard $100 Fire TV device released last year. Both will get the updates by the end of the year. Amazon says older devices will get the updates, too, but no timetable was given. © 2016 Associated Press syndicated under contract with NewsEdge.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech Reviews Titan Juxt Pro review: There is nothing smart about this watch Titan Juxt Pro review: There is nothing smart about this watch The biggest thing favouring Titan is its watchmaker tag but can it hold its ground against Android Wear, Tizen and now cheaper Apple Watch? Read on to find out Rating: 2.5 out of 5 Written by Karthekayan Iyer | Updated: November 10, 2016 3:06 pm Titan Juxt Pro is the second smartwatch from India’s leading traditional watch maker For wearables as an industry, September was a really constructive month. Fitbit unveiled Charge 2, the successor to best selling Charge HR fitness tracker. Samsung then upped the ante with two new Tizen powered Gear S3 smartwatch while Apple re-engineered its Watch with new fitness tracking and swimproof body. There has never been a better time to buy a new wearable. On the other hand, Android brigade is playing down the hype until the release of Android Wear 2.0 while traditional watchmakers continue joining search giant’s wearable platform. Tag Heuer, Michael Kors, Fossil have their own smartwatch running Android Wear. In India, Titan is reimagining traditional watches into smart wearable. Titan Juxt Pro Early this year, Titan surprised the watch industry with its HP collaboration to create an analog smartwatch. The onus with that watch was on the word analog, enough to tempt a watch buyer or watch collector away from a regular watch. At Rs 15,990, Titan also made sure the price was justified. Six months later, Titan is going the exact opposite way with its next smartwatch. Titan Juxt Pro is not made in collaboration with HP but takes cues from Android and Tizen counterparts for a real smartwatch. It has digital display in place of analog dial and the mechanical movement of watch hands are replaced by digital ones. The biggest thing favouring Titan is its watchmaker tag but can it hold its ground against Android Wear, Tizen and now cheaper Apple Watch?

At maximum brightness, it becomes extremely bright and at minimum, there is barely anything to see If there is one thing to like about this watch then it has to be its build quality. This watch is built like a tank but that also translates into bulky dimensions. There is elaborate use of stainless steel infused with plastic, which gives it a distinguishing look in the overly crowded smartwatch market. Another thing to like about the watch is its strap. Our review unit came with a black leather strap which is one of the finest I have ever wrapped around my wrist. The leather feels nice to touch and even endured the sweat glands. Since Titan Juxt Pro is a smartwatch and not analog smartwatch like it’s predecessor, the display used here is top notch. At maximum brightness, it becomes extremely bright and at minimum, there is barely anything to see – so setting a medium brightness worked for me most of the time. If your basic needs are knowing your step count from a Titan watch – Juxt Pro does quantify that need well. Titan Juxt Pro tracks steps, and count calories. Most trackers come close to being accurate but it’s very difficult to get the perfect reading. Titan Juxt Pro is definitely not accurate but it came very close to the reading I found on my other fitness tracker. If your basic needs are knowing your step count from a Titan watch – Juxt Pro does quantify that need well. What is not good? Tt’s almost impossible to wear the bulky Titan Juxt Pro and take a nap. I tried wearing the watch during sleep and often found it irritating or being cautious about that hefty watch on my wrist in the middle of the sleep. For comparison, Withings’ Activate Steel is super light and you don’t really feel like you are wearing one. The biggest problem with Titan Juxt Pro’s software is the sync time and gesture UI. Titan collaborated with HP for the software of its first smartwatch and this time, it has gone solo with its efforts. Titan Juxt Pro’s neat software elements like converter and phone finder are quite useful but the entire experience pales in front of the competition. For Rs 22,999, I expect a software that goes beyond the watch – which is exactly the promise of Android Wear 2.0 – coming to many smartwatches later this year. Titan Juxt Pro’s software is designed to be like Android but fails to do so. The biggest problem with Titan Juxt Pro’s software is the sync time and gesture UI. I found the app taking forever to sync with the watch to get the data and the UI lagged to reproduce my actions. I found the swipe up and swipe down gestures work but they are slow. The software seems to be in beta but without that label. After using Titan Juxt Pro for nearly three weeks, I found the battery to last one day for my brightness setting An important metric while getting a smartwatch or fitness tracker has to be battery life. After using Titan Juxt Pro for nearly three weeks, I found the battery to last one day for my brightness setting. There were days when the battery died in the middle of the night and failed to track sleep. Should you buy? The answer is a straight no. If you are using an iOS device then go ahead and buy the first generation Apple Watch and for Android users, Huawei Watch is definitely the best option right now. If you are serious about fitness, then look at Fitbit Blaze or Garmin’s Forerunner. For the time being, I would advise waiting for the next Titan smartwatch or getting one of the above mentioned gadgets. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaChill sets in early: Oppn moves to corner Govt, PM Modi hits back, says his decision troubles them IndiaKadak like my chai, rich don’t like it: PM Modi on demonetisation IndiaNo regrets, but govt addressing inconvenience, says Venkaiah Naidu IndiaPakistan says seven of its troops killed in Indian fire at LoC IndiaPanama Papers: 415 Indians under scanner as probe widens EntertainmentIn Bigg Boss 10, Bani is the most selfish contestant: Navin Prakash opens up after eviction EntertainmentKoffee With Karan 5: Twinkle Khanna's shocking revelations on the KJo's show EntertainmentITA Awards 2016: Mouni Roy, Shabbir Ahluwalia emerge big winners, see pics, video EntertainmentSalman Khan is spoiling nephew Ahil and Arpita Khan Sharma has proof, see pics Must Read SportsIndia vs England: Slow to adopt, now learning on the job SportsBCCI gets Lodha approval to pay Rajasthan players SportsRanji Trophy 2016: More brain than brawn TechnologyDemonetisation: Now, a tool to find ATMs with money across India TechnologySamsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 model numbers leaked TechnologyDemonetisation effect: Here's how to sign-up for Paytm, Mobikwik and use the e-wallets  Guru Nanak Jayanti 2016: India celebrates Gurpurab with great fanfare Nov 15: Latest News US President-elect Donald Trump could return Iraq war boosters to power Punjabis react to Trump’s decision to deport illegal immigrants: ‘May affect economy, hit unscrupulous travel agents’ Securities and Exchange Commission Chair leaving at end of Obama administration INLD hits out at Congress, BJP for ‘doublespeak’ Punjab, Haryana should resolve SYL issue amicably: BJP union minister Narendra Singh Tomar Karthekayan IyerEngineer by training, tech journalist by passion.... read more Dell Inspiron 11 Review: The fun Windows 10 notebook Titan Juxt Pro review: There is nothing smart about this watch Offline will be a gamechanger, exploring space keenly: LeEco India head                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

Tuesday 15 Nov 2016 / Tehran - 04:22 / GMT - 00:52 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology Fri Oct 21, 2016 1:24 iPhone 7s with Intel Modems Struggle Badly in Low-Signal Areas Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Apple has a reputation for tight supply chain management and demanding rigorous quality control, but the company may have a modem problem on its hands. Previously, Apple has tapped both Samsung and TSMC to build its SoCs, but stuck with the same Qualcomm modem for all its hardware. With the iPhone 7, Apple adopted an Intel modem for its AT&T and T-Mobile variants, while the factory-unlocked devices, Sprint, and Verizon hardware all use Qualcomm’s modem silicon (MDM9645M if you want to get technical). According to an analysis performed by Cellular Insights, both devices perform equally well if you have a strong signal, but the Intel modem (XMM7360, pictured at top) drops off significantly as signal strength weakens. Cellular Insights tested multiple LTE bands (Band 4, 7, and 12) in a 4×2 MIMO configuration. The graph here is from Band 4, which Cellular Insights describes as the most common band for North America LTE deployments. RSRP is a measure of LTE signal strength and is expected to range from ~-75dBm when measured directly on top of a cellular base site to -120dBm at the edge of coverage. What we see here is that the Intel modem can’t sustain the same throughput as the Qualcomm device, particularly at the -105dBm threshold. At -115dBm, the gap between the Intel and Qualcomm modems is roughly 2x — meaning the Qualcomm device is sustaining about twice the network throughput on the same signal strength. Cellular Insights also compared the two devices against the Galaxy S7 Edge, the iPhone 6s, the LG G5, and the Nexus 5X. First of all, kudos to Samsung; the S7 Edge does extremely well in all cases. The Intel XMM7360, in contrast, is the worst overall performer of the lot — though the 6s doesn’t exactly distinguish itself well, either. That might explain why Apple was willing to work with Intel in the first place, but the Intel XMM7360 doesn’t keep up with Qualcomm’s MDM9645M. It would be interesting to see a battery life comparison between Intel and Qualcomm devices and it’s possible that Apple could improve the Intel modem’s performance via a software update. If you really care about LTE performance on an iPhone or live in an area with marginal LTE coverage, the factory-unlocked version of the device is definitely your best bet — right now, the Intel modem isn’t performing where it ought to be. Winning the iPhone 7 was a huge victory for Intel’s beleaguered modem division, but that victory was predicated on the idea that the Intel and Qualcomm modems would offer equal performance. So far, that doesn’t seem to be the case. It’s not clear how much this impacts the iPhone 7’s range, network timeouts, or other issues that might arise in areas where cellular connectivity is weak, but the general implication is that the Qualcomm modem offers better performance and possibly better range when operating in low-signal areas.         LATEST STORIES (5) Anti-Trump Protests Break out in Chicago Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus Syrian Army Missile Hits Militants' Gathering in Southern Aleppo Hashd Al-Shaabi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Military Operations West of Mosul Anti-Trump Protests Continue across US Cities Spokesman: Iran's Missile Power Not Negotiable Tasting Justice: ISIL Being Driven Away in Iraq and Syria Iran, Russia Stress Boosting Mutual Cooperation Spokesman: AEOI Not Concerned About Trump Aides' Remarks Hashd Al-Shaabi Rescues 300 Sunni Families Battle for Mosul Day 28: Hashd Al-Sha'abi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Mosul Operation Russia, Iran Plan $10bln Arms Deal Report: Russian Strategic Bombers Prepare to Strike Terrorists in Syria Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syria: Jeish Al-Fatah Declares State of Emergency in Aleppo Anti-Trump Protests Break out in Chicago TEHRAN (FNA)- Demonstrators in Chicago took to the streets to continue protests against the election of Donald Trump and show common hate against him.

With Gaga's fan base, known as Little Monsters, forced to wait three years to hear fresh music from the pop star, it is no surprise that Joanne topped the charts in at least 18 countries within hours of release. Joanne is available to buy on Apple Music and stream on services such as Spotify. Joanne reached number one in the US, UK, Brazil, Canada, Italy, Australia and India, while it reached number two in South Africa, Japan and Norway. The record has received glowing reviews from fans, including Arrow actor Colton Haynes, who tweeted: "Honestly, @ladygaga 's new album #Joanne is easily my favorite album of the year & I just listened to it. So heartfelt/raw. So happy for her." The album sees Gaga, 30, address the police brutality and gun control issue in the US with the song Angel Down dedicated particularly to Trayvon Martin. Martin, 18, was unarmed at the time he got into an altercation with neighbourhood watch member George Zimmerman, who gunned the youngster down. Explaining her decision to dedicate the song to Martin, Gaga told Zane Lowe on Apple's Beats 1 radio show: "I was overwhelmed by the fact that people just stood around and didn't do anything about it, and that the justice system continues to, over and over again, not seek justice for these families." She added of African-American men: "They tell me they drive in their cars, and if they hear a siren, there is a paranoia that runs through their body, that they freeze up, that they can't think. This is a tremendous anxiety. This is something that I care about. This is something that has to stop, something that we all need to heal from. How can I not say something? How could I possibly make an album about twerking my a*s in the club?... In my mind, I can't reckon it. It feels empty. It feels irrelevant." Angel Down lyrics include: "Doesn't everyone belong in the arms of the sacred/ Why do we pretend we're wrong has our young courage faded / Shots were fired down the street by the church where we used to meet/ Angel down, angel down, why do people just stand around?" Gaga has also responded to the long-running comparisons between herself and queen of pop Madonna. Listing the differences she sees between the two, the Bad Romance singer told Lowe: "Madonna and I are very different. Just saying. We're very different. I wouldn't make that comparison at all and I don't mean to disrespect Madonna, she's a nice lady, and she's had a fantastic huge career, biggest pop star of all time. Lady Gaga will bring her Joanne album songs to the Super Bowl in 2017Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images "I play a lot of instruments. I write all my own music. I spend hours and hours a day in the studio. I'm a producer. I'm a writer. What I do is different. There is spontaneity to my work. I allow myself to fail. I allow myself to break. I'm not afraid of my flaws." Clearly annoyed by Lowe's analysis that Gaga and Madonna, 58, have similar relationships with their fathers, the pop star continued: "I don't mean that in a disrespectful way. I just will not be compared to anyone anymore. I am who the f**k I am and this is me. My life story is my life story, just like yours is. The thing is we all express things in different ways, but my rebellion at my father for him being angry with me, that has ended. It's like finally I can bite back."

Services Web App Development JavaScript Support Workshops Blog About Us Contact Login Hub Login Support Login PhoneGap, Palm Pre, and the State of Mobile Apps By Jason Cline on January 12, 2009 11:24 pm With their announcement of the Pre last week, Palm has placed their bet that great mobile applications can be built using the same open web technologies that drive the desktop environment today. Web applications that run on modern desktop browsers are constantly pushing the envelope of the types of applications that no longer require a proprietary platform-specific SDK. When Apple first launched the iPhone in 2007 their first answer to developers was similar to Palm’s new OS. Apple gave a long talks at its 2007 Worldwide Developers Conference about how you can build great applications using standard web technologies. Unlike Palm’s webOS the iPhone web SDK was severely lacking in many areas. Apple has corrected some of these shortcomings in the subsequent releases of their mobile browser. Mobile Safari now supports multi-touch gestures, basic rotation tracking, and hardware accelerated CSS animations. Unfortunately, Apple’s open web SDK still lacks many of the most critical features that would allow developers to build applications that take full advantage of the mobile environment. By contrast, Palm’s webOS appears to treat web applications as first class citizens by providing direct access to the GPS location, acceleration, camera, and messaging functions of the phone. Adding these features to your existing mobile-ready web application should be trivial once Palm releases its SDK to the public. If you want to attempt the same feat on the iPhone, you have to download the 1.5GB iPhone SDK, learn Objective-C, and rewrite your application using Xcode. And if you want to test your app on real hardware you have to pay Apple a licensing fee of $99 (or $299 for enterprise development) and wait for approval. Google’s Android platform had taken a similar, but more open, approach to application development. They have an excellent WebKit-based web browser that has the same sandbox limitations as the iPhone. They have a proprietary native SDK based on the Java SDK which makes it accessible to a wider group of developers than Apple’s SDK, but it still requires web application developers to rewrite their application and display logic in yet another proprietary environment. Where Apple has failed to provide easy solutions for web developers, others have stepped in to fill the gap. The appropriately named PhoneGap project aims to make it easier for web developers to create native applications while still using their existing web development expertise. The project is attempting to create a single JavaScript API for use on the Android and Blackberry platforms as well as the iPhone. PhoneGap does this by creating a skeleton application using the native API for each target platform. The application creates a mobile browser that lacks the usual browser chrome and loads a remote url into the browser or displays a web page that is embedded in the application itself. PhoneGap injects a JavaScript API into the browser that gives the web application access to the native functions on the phone. Currently, the PhoneGap project provides access to the phone’s location, camera, accelerometer, and vibration functions. PhoneGap also supports offline web applications by allowing the application’s HTML and JavaScript to be loaded from local resources stored on the phone. This feature allows for much more JavaScript code to be loaded than would normally be feasible in a mobile web application. The existing SQLite database built into WebKit give the application the ability to download and store data locally and increases application performance and allows access to data when network coverage is spotty. Although it is incredibly powerful, PhoneGap is far from a perfect solution. PhoneGap builds native applications that must be dowloaded through either Apple’s App Store or Google’s Android Market. With this approach, you lose the benefit of a zero-install web application; however, it can also a great way to distribute and sell mobile apps. Palm has yet to release many details about how their applications are build and deployed. We will have to wait and see if Palm can improve upon this process when they release their SDK. If the Pre proves to be successful and popular with developers perhaps we will see similar functionality for web applications from Apple and Google in the near future. Windows Mobile, by comparison, has seen little innovation since the iPhone’s release. Rumor has it that Microsoft’s mobile operating system may be getting a major refresh soon. Will Microsoft follow the lead of Palm, Google, and Apple and create a first class platform for mobile web development? Native mobile application development can be difficult and costly, especially when attempting to support multiple platforms. Palm is attempting to reinvent itself with the Pre and looks to be creating a truly innovative environment for mobile application development. For those developers who already have major investments in their desktop web applications, the idea of reusing that code base is compelling. Time-to-market and ROI have to be considered when deciding to support the mobile environment. Using open web technologies that reuse existing application code and in-house developer experience could save considerable time and money for anyone looking to expand their product offering into the mobile environment. ajax Dojo mobile ShareTweet this articlePost this article to FacebookShare this article on Google+ Shane O’Sullivan What almost all articles comparing the iPhone and Pre development models seem to leave out is that, to develop for the iPhone, you need a Mac!! For the 95% of people who use Windows or Linux, this is a massive blocker. I’d love to write some iPhone apps, and even have nothing against downloading the iPhone SDK and learning Objective-C. But dropping over a thousand euros just to play around and see if I can come up with something interesting? Not going to happen. So, congrats to Palm. Another small thing to note is that it seems that Palm’s Mojo framework for the Pre is based on Dojo, which is always nice :-) Ken Law We have just launched a product called MotherApp (http://motherapp.com/) that allows people to create iPhone apps without learning Objective-C or even owning a Mac. Just create a website based on MotherApp HTML specification. Then, MotherApp is a converter that takes your website as input and generates the native iPhone app as output. Finally, we will then send you the native app through email. Instead of creating an app by embedding a web browser inside, MotherApp actually builds the app using the iPhone SDK. This means: – Professional UI: All the UI widgets (such as buttons, tabs) are based on the iPhone SDK instead of emulated by web techniques. – Camera: Use camera to upload images to server. – Cache: Use cache to improve the performance and allow people to use the app offline. Our product is still very new and your comments are most welcome. Steven If they offer a custom API to access the phone features, they aren’t really using web technologies any more, are they? HTML means “write once, run anywhere!”. Using advanced CSS, SVG, and HTML5 database API a lot can be done with current web technologies. Sadly, hardware-specific features will always require some sort of … hack. It would be nice if there was a nice, standard way to request the user’s location – much like the iPhone’s “XYZ wants to use your location” feature of their native apps. Dylan @Steven: the only way to really get effective standards is to have something to standardize on. Let them experiment and extend this round, and then standardize in a year or two after they’ve figured out what works and makes sense. I imagine this argument (lack of standards) is why Apple has not exposed these features, but I’d rather see extensions that can later be standardized, than no option at all. HM Sathish Good and valuable information. Mobile app development is not an easy task, there are many mobile app development companies are doing itself perfectly. Here in India we are on of them.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 21 October 2016 | MYT 3:38 PM Apple Watch Series 2: Getting better all the time by tan kit hoong Better, faster: A dual-core processor and the addition of GPS makes the Apple Watch Series 2 much better than before.— Photos: TAN KIT HOONG/The Star Version 2 of any product is always the one to go for, or so they say, especially when it comes to technology. Such is the case with the latest incarnation of the Apple Watch, now called the Apple Watch Series 2 – although the changes are modest, they do make the watch a whole lot more useful than the first version. This time, Apple has kept the design mostly the same – in fact, at first glance you’d probably not be able to tell it apart from the original Apple Watch. However, there are changes, and it’s mostly on the inside. The 38mm Apple Watch Series 2 looks the same and uses the same straps despite being a hair thicker than the original. Watch me Although the aesthetic design of the Apple Watch Series 2 is the same as the original Apple Watch and even accepts the same straps as before, there are actually a couple of differences if you look closely. For one thing, the watch is 0.9mm thicker than the original – it’s a minimal difference and you really can’t tell unless you put the original right next to new one. The other difference is that there is an additional hole on the side of the Series 2 – apparently, the new improved waterproofing requires one additional opening so that the barometric sensor can work properly. Yes, that’s right, in case you don’t already know, Apple has improved the waterproofing on the Series 2 and now instead of being splashproof like the original model, it’s now water-resistant down to 50 metres, so you really can take it swimming. For the Series 2, Apple has retained the three different variants – namely the aluminium and ion-X glass model, the stainless steel and sapphire crystal model and the luxury Apple Watch Edition which now features a ceramic case and sapphire crystal instead of the solid gold from the first generation. Apart from the price (the ceramic one costs a whopping RM5,699), the different models feature the same 50m water resistance no matter what material – interestingly the aluminium model, which used to feature a composite back (a fancy word for plastic), has now got the same scratch-resistant ceramic back as the other more expensive models. The ceramic back which houses the heart rate sensor is now standard on all models. The one we got is the black stainless steel and sapphire crystal model with a black sports band – I personally still think a watch is more likely to get banged up and scratched than a smartphone is (especially when you stick your hand through the gate and accidentally knock it) so having the added scratch-resistance of the sapphire crystal is always welcome. More importantly, though, inside is where you’ll find all the most significant changes to the Series 2 – the watch now features a dual-core S2 processor, a slightly bigger battery and a GPS chipset. The GPS chipset is used to track your outdoor sport activities like swimming or running and have it more accurately track your distance and speed traveled while also using the data to overlay your track on a map in the Activity app. Yes, if you carried your iPhone around with you, it would also have recorded your location using the iPhone’s GPS, but now you can at least leave your phone at home and still have the advantage of accurate location tracking. Talking about GPS, Apple automatically turns it on during specific activities only and you have no option to control or to manually turn it on. On the upside, the GPS starts up much faster than any GPS sports tracker I’ve ever tried – apparently, the watch periodically downloads GPS satellite data from your iPhone and stores that information in the watch so that it can achieve a location lock as fast as possible whenever you start an activity. The speaker enclosure expels water by producing a beeping sound when you unlock the Series 2 after a swim. Waterproofing Thanks to the new waterproofing measures, Apple has added pool swimming and open water swimming to the list of activities it can track – in case you're wondering, the GPS isn’t used for pool swims but it is on for open water swimming, although it can only accurately track you when your arm is above water. One thing Apple has done for the pool swim option is to let you enter the length of the pool so it can use the accelerometer to track your calorie burn. Since water interferes with the touchscreen, when you engage pool swim or open water swimming, the screen is also locked – you unlock the screen by turning the digital crown. You can also lock the screen manually by swiping up on the main watch screen to bring up Control Centre and tapping the little water droplet icon – useful if you’re say, running in the rain and want to prevent accidentally activating the screen. Unlocking the screen when in screen lock mode also does something quite interesting – it makes the watch beep loudly a few times. This loud beeping vibrates the speaker and expels water from the speaker enclosure – if you have a lot of water in there, you really can see it being expelled when you turn the Digital Crown. Oh yes, the OLED screen on the Series 2 is two times brighter than on the original Apple Watch – you probably won’t notice it indoors, since the watch automatically adjusts brightness, but outside in bright sunlight, it’s actually a little more readable. watchOS 3.0 offers more watch faces, like this cool one that shows your activity rings, integrated into an analogue display. Battery life and performance Thanks to the slightly larger casing, Apple has managed to fit in a slightly larger battery into the Apple Watch Series 2 as well. While it’s probably meant to compensate for the increased power draw from the GPS chipset, it also seems to increase battery life slightly for day to day use – I’ve noticed that at the end of the day I’d end up with about 20% more battery life left than with the original Apple Watch. On the 38mm version, this extra battery life will probably take you quite easily to about 1.5 days without charging or just barely till evening of the second day if you don’t engage the sport activity tracking at all. The 42mm will probably do much better since it has an even bigger battery. What you'll notice however, is that with the new dual-core S2 processor, apps are actually a lot snappier, especially when starting up certain apps and when doing dictation using Siri. WatchOS 3.0 No review would be complete without some mention of watchOS 3.0, since I think it’s actually a very significant part of the whole Apple Watch experience. Not only does installing watchOS 3.0 significantly improve the speed of launching apps on the original Apple Watch, but there are a number of enhancements that make the Apple Watch in general a much better smartwatch. For one thing, Apple has finally added a way to input text by directly writing on the screen with your finger with the Scribble option. Before watchOS 3.0, the only way you could input text was to have Siri transcribe your voice – while transcription was actually surprisingly good, if you use any special words or colloquialisms it will struggle to transcribe what you’ve just said. In fact, before watchOS 3.0 I had learned to speak in short, clear sentences if I wanted the Apple Watch to transcribe my speech but finally, with the Scribble option, I can now write out exactly what I want to say. The other significant change that watchOS 3.0 introduces is the Dock – you can now store up to 10 apps in the Dock so they launch faster and can be accessed quicker. To get to the Dock, Apple has repurposed the side button (formerly used to bring up a quick contact list) to show you a scrollable list of apps resident in the Dock. If you're interested in more watchOS 3.0 tips, check out our story here. Final word I’m one of the early converts to a smartwatch and besides the Apple Watch I’ve also owned various smart activity trackers before that. Sure, a device like the Apple Watch doesn’t do much beyond what your smartphone already does, but believe me, it’s a lot more useful than you think to just lift your wrist during a run to check and respond to messages and other notifications. With the Apple Watch Series 2, Apple has made the activity tracking parts even better by adding GPS and beefed up the water resistance so it’s now a very competent device to track your calorie burn when engaging in sporting activities. At the same time, though, there’s little that has changed that justifies upgrading to the Series 2 if you already have the original Apple Watch, especially since you already get many of the benefits by upgrading the Apple Watch to watchOS 3.0. If you haven’t already got one though, then the Series 2 is worth a serious look – if you're an iPhone user, Apple's combination of hardware and software improvements in the Apple Watch Series 2 means it's hard to beat, except maybe in price. Pros: Brighter screen; better battery life; GPS built in; watchOS 3.0 Cons: Battery life could be better.

By Alistair Charlton October 21, 2016 09:43 BST Apple executive Eddy Cue says current TV interfaces are 'brain dead'Reuters Just when we thought the rumours of Apple making a television has finally been laid to rest, company executive Eddy Cue believes TV needs to be "reinvented". Head of Apple's internet software and sales division, Cue also leads the company's television efforts with the Apple TV set-top box. His comments come after years of speculation and rumours that Apple was planning to produce a television; with regard to how the system would work, the late Steve Jobs said he had "cracked it" shortly before his death in 2011. During an interview at Vanity Fair's annual New Establishment Summit, Cue said: "I do think television needs to be reinvented. Today, you live with a glorified VCR. The problem is the interface," reports Business Insider. Echoing thoughts held by Jobs, Cue added: "It's really hard to use [a cable or satellite TV service]. Setting something to record, if you didn't watch something last night, if you didn't set it to record, it's hard to find, it may not be available. There may be some rights issues." Cue sees a future where viewers decide what they want to watch and the TV service finds it for them. Instead of searching through channels and subscribing to the right service or package, the content is just there on an a-la-carte basis. "It's great to be able to tell you device 'I want to watch the Duke basketball game, I don't care what channel it's on'... Today you got to bring in the TV, go through the guide, find which sports programmes or whatever – it's just hard to do." The senior vice president added: "The problem is the interface. The ways you interact with it are pretty brain dead." Apple has been in discussions with TV content producers since at least 2009, but has struggled to come to an agreement with enough of them to make a service worthwhile to consumers. The company sees a future where every programme, series and sports fixture is available to everyone through a single user interface, but complex rights agreements currently make this impossible. But Cue sees the situation gradually improving every year as rights holders become less protective over their content. "It's moving rapidly... Look, it's going to get better every year." Rumours that Apple is building its own television have all but disappeared, but only after the well-known analyst Gene Munster claimed the new product was happening in 2011, early 2012, late 2012, twice in 2013 and again in 2014. The Apple TV set-top box was being sold (and improved upon) throughout this time, but the mythical television never arrived. In 2015 Munster finally accepted defeat, saying: "It's hard to accept the reality of no Apple television."

Yeah, they're fake By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · Oct 21, 2016 with 24 comments Apple is warning users about buying counterfeit merchandise on Amazon. The company is also suing one of the big suppliers that was presenting its hardware as “original” or “genuine”, which was then sold by Amazon itself. According to documents from the suit, posted by Patently Apple, the Cupertino-based company has been ordering and testing hundreds of Lightning cables and chargers that were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products. To nobody’s surprise the company found that nearly 90% of the items tested were in fact counterfeit, despite being sold and shipped directly by Amazon. Besides the obvious infringement upon copyrights and trademarks, Apple is also warning that the fake merchandise can also pose serious risks because it doesn’t go through consumer safety testing. And there’s ample anecdotal evidence to go with Apple’s assertion, considering the number of devices that have caught fire due to faulty chargers. Apple is now suing Mobile Star LLC, one of the companies that supplied counterfeit chargers and cables to Amazon. Apple is asking the court to issue an injunction against all the products developed by Mobile Star that infringe on its IP, to have the items destroyed, to have all the money that Mobile Star earned afforded to Apple, and to receive damages on the order of many millions of dollars. Meanwhile Amazon said it had “zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits” and that it was working with partners to ensure this doesn’t happen.

Apple said in a lawsuit filed Monday, Oct. 17, 2016, that it has been buying Apple products labeled as genuine on Amazon.com and has found nearly 90 percent of them are counterfeit. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, File) By Don Bishop The revelation comes in a federal lawsuit filed by Apple against a New Jersey company. Apple says it has been buying Apple products labeled as genuine on Amazon.com and found nearly 90 percent of them to be counterfeit. In the lawsuit, Apple says Mobile Star imprinted Apple logos on products that "pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock." Apple says it purchased the products on Amazon and later told the online retailer that they were fake. Amazon then identified Mobile Star as the source. Amazon isn't named in the suit.

Cabral/Dubai Filed on October 21, 2016 Share More > Vote Apple's iPhone has been a dominant force in the smartphone world for years, and Google is determined to challenge that with its new Pixel. Is the Mountain View team indeed ready to challenge the dominance of Cupertino? Google just declared war on everyone, and they just have the right amount of resources to do so. Veering away from its Nexus line, the Internet giant finally decided that it was time for them to start giving others a run for their money with its own smartphone, the Pixel. And with Samsung charred from the Galaxy Note 7 mess, it's a perfect opportunity for the rest of the Android mob to take their shots at Apple - and Google is just raring to go. Let's see how Apple's signature flagship and Google's new toy stack up against each other. At the end of each parameter, we'll have a scoreboard (in an iPhone 7-Pixel format) to see where we're clawing towards to. Front camera: The iPhone 7 has a wider aperture, but the Pixel has a higher resolution. The tie-breaker would then be the iPhone 7's Retina flash. 1-0. Audio: A dual-speaker stereo system on the iPhone 7 versus the Pixel's single downward-firing one? Easy. 2-0. Memory: While the Pixel edges out the iPhone 7 in RAM (4GB to 3GB), the latter has more storage options; the 32/128GB choices on both cancel each other out, leaving the iPhone 7's massive 256GB on top. But since you may not require that much space on your phone, let's give RAM some preference here. 2-1. Display: The Pixel has a larger five-inch screen compared to the iPhone 7's standard-issue 4.7 inches, and it also uses AMOLED, brighter than the latter's LCD. Google's device also has a higher resolution and pixel density, though Apple has its own 3D Touch for added functionality (if you actually use it). Make no mistake, the iPhone 7 has a great display, but the numbers point to the Pixel tying things up. 2-2. Platform: It's iOS versus Android. 10 against 7.1 Nougat. Each system has its own crowd and functionalities, so we'll leave it at that. Digital assistant: Siri, meet your new rival, Google Assistant. And it seems that you're about to get a run for your money if the latter's demonstration at the Pixel launch event was any indication, in which it flaunted some really interactive "dialogues". 2-3. Fingerprint scanner: The iPhone 7 retains this on its home button up front, while the Pixel has its own on the rear. Normally, most of us hold our phones with our thumb and index finger on those positions, respectively, so it's really a matter of what suits you better. So let's move on. Main camera: While both practically have 12MP shooters, the iPhone has a wider aperture and optical image stabilisation, while also outshining (pun intended) the Pixel's dual-LED flash with its quad-LED flash. And most importantly, the iPhone 7's snapper has proven that it is really better in low-light conditions compared to its predecessors. 3-3. Chipset: Let's see... the Apple A10 Fusion chip gives 40 per cent faster performance at one-fifth the power and 50 per cent better graphics thanks to an M10 motion coprocessor, while the Snapdragon 821 blurts out a 10 per cent faster performance than the 820. Oh well. 4-3. Build: Apple was wise to bring out the Jet Black colour. With design mostly another user-preference judgment, let's take this one to durability: the iPhone 7 is dust- and water-resistant - as we proved ourselves just to get a kick out of it - while the Pixel can, well, take just sprays of water. And it helps when Jony Ive is on your bench. 5-3. Battery: The Pixel's 2770mAh power pack clobbers the iPhone 7's 1960mAh. But note to both: seriously, can't you stick in larger batteries? (It should be noted, though, that the iPhone 7 lasts longer - up to two hours, Apple says - than the 6s.) 5-4. Connectivity: Not a few people were ticked off when Apple removed the 3.5mm audio jack, leaving the iPhone 7 with only one port for connecting an audio device or charger. Apple may have viewed it as some sort of future-proofing (obviously not everyone agreed), but Google did a better thing at it by slapping in a USB Type-C on the Pixel... and retaining good ol' jack on top. 5-5. Well, that was a close, tense one. We may have ended up tied in our mano-y-mano, but the real winner is for you to decide. (Why not get one of each to spare you the trouble?) If ever you disagree on something, feel free to let us know (no NSFW or swear words, please). - alvin@khaleejtimes.com Share More > Vote MORE FROM Technology Technology Massive web attack disrupts Twitter, Amazon among ...

What To Expect At Apple's 'Hello Again' Mac 2016 Event iDigitalTimes 21/10/2016 Cammy Harbison © Apple "Magic Toolbar" could be the name of the 2016 MacBook Pro's new OLED panel according to a recent trademark filing. Fund out everything to expect at Apple's "Hello Again" Mac event October 27, here. On Wednesday, Apple announced it’s upcoming Mac event, dubbed “Hello Again,” which is expected to showcase the new MacBook Pro 2016 model. All throughout the year, rumors and leaks concerning the new MacBook Pro have emerged and this week is no exception. The new MacBook Pro is expected to see a revamp to its physical form, arriving thinner and lighter than earlier models It is also rumored to feature a larger trackpad and flatter keyboard. But the feature that has us most excited is the OLED display touch panel that is expected to replace the function keys found at the top of the keyboard. The new touch pane is rumored to incorporate a Touch ID function that allows unlocking the device via fingerprint, which could be integrated into the power button slot. The touchpad is also rumored to be contextual in nature, meaning the controls do different things depending on which app or program is active on the screen. © Martin Hajek Macbook Pro 2016 concept design by Martin Hajek featuring his interpretation of the new OLED touch pane. The new MacBook Pro touchpad has thus far been referred to as a “Dynamic Function Row,” but a new trademark filing suggests that Apple’s official name for the new feature may be the “Magic Toolbar.” The trademark filing, which was expertly hunted down by Brian Conroy at The Trademark Ninja seems to be fitting for Apple’s new OLED touch panel as it would fall right in line with other magically named MacBook features like the Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard. Of course, there’s no sure way of knowing if this will be Apple’s new name for the touchpad, but we wouldn’t be surprised if we heard the “Magic Toolbar” introduced at Apple’s “Hello Again” event next week. What To Expect From Apple’s “Hello Again” Mac Event © Apple On Wednesday, Apple sent invitations to its upcoming "Hello Again" Mac event, scheduled for October 27. After two years without any kind of MacBook Pro updates, Apple may have finally decided to release an updated model as invitations for the “Hello Again” Mac event made their way to invitees Wednesday. The event, which will be live streamed online, Thursday, October 27 will begin at 10AM PT / 1PM ET and should hopefully bring the Macbook Pro update we’ve all been waiting for. Here are a few of the things Apple is rumored to showcase at the Hello Again event: MacBook Pro 2016 – The new MacBook is rumored to feature: - OLED Touch Control Bar - Bigger Trackpad - Move to all USB-C ports (will replace both classic USBs and MagSafe power cords for a simple all-in-one port) - Thinner, lighter body - Touch ID support MacBook Air - Apple rumored to discontinue 11-inch model - I2016 model not expected, but if announced may see conversion to USB-C only like MacBook Pro - Price reduction for 13-inch model iMac - Revamped design with improved graphics performance. New options for AMD graphics processing units may be announced. - 5K resolution (5120 x 2880) display could be announced, which features built-in GPU. As more is learned about what may be ahead for Apple’s “Hello Again” Mac event, we’ll be sure to update this post.  Go to MSN Home More in News Dilapidated military bases 'need £8.5bn to ensure they can react to threats' The Guardian Briton will be extradited to US over hacking charges Sky News Farage: Marine Le Pen has done a good job Huffington Post UK Trial hears Jo Cox was murdered 'by gunman repeating "Britain First"' The Guardian Mosul: Snipers, car bombs and trapped families Sky News Nazi memorabilia on offer at school car boot sale The Guardian Up Next MiG-29 fighter jet crashes into sea Sky News More in News IVF mum marries donor after tracking him down and falling in love Mirror Tracking an elusive diary from Hitler's inner circle The New York Times £1bn Madonna becomes highest-grossing solo touring artist ever Evening Standard AdChoices AdChoices More from iDigitalTimes iPhone 7 more powerful than iPad Pro, reveals Geekbench score iDigitalTimes What to expect from Google Pixel and Pixel XL iDigitalTimes 4 of the weirdest objects made into Pokemon iDigitalTimes Samsung Galaxy Note 7: The story behind blue coral and dual-edge design iDigitalTimes Home News Weather Entertainment Sport Money Lifestyle Horoscopes Health & Fitness Food & Drink Cars Travel Dating © 2016 Microsoft Privacy & Cookies Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Anti-Spam Newsletter

Police probe doctor’s death Coalition youths split Home / World / Samsung kills off Galaxy Note 7 smartphone Samsung kills off Galaxy Note 7 smartphone By The Post Tweet Pin It Updated: October 14, 2016 By CHOE SANG-HUN ­SEOUL, South Korea — Samsung Electronics is killing its troubled Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, a humbling about-face for the South Korean giant and its global brand. In an unprecedented move, the company will no longer produce or market the smartphones. The demise of the Galaxy Note 7 is a major setback for Samsung, the world’s largest maker of smartphones. The premium device — with a 5.7-inch screen, curved contours and comparatively high price — won praise from consumers and reviewers, and was the company’s most ambitious effort yet to take on Apple for the high-end market. But Samsung has struggled to address reports that the Galaxy Note 7 could overheat and catch fire because of a manufacturing flaw. Last month, the company said it would recall 2.5 million phones to fix the problem. But in recent days, Galaxy Note 7 users emerged with reports that some devices that had supposedly been repaired were overheating, smoking and even bursting into flames. And on Monday, Samsung asked Note 7 customers to power off the phones while it worked on the problem. In a statement filed with the South Korean stock exchange late Tuesday, Samsung said it had made a “final decision” to stop production. The company will no longer make or market the phones, said a person familiar with the decision, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because Samsung did not publicly disclose details. Samsung has a strong position in modestly priced smartphones and has made progress in challenging the Apple iPhone for the high end of the market. Samsung showed its confidence in the new Galaxy Note 7 by skipping a sixth version in the series and offering the new phone beginning in August, before Apple’s introduction of its iPhone 7. It was unclear where the Galaxy Note 7’s problem began. But Samsung’s fight to catch up with Apple by cramming increasingly sophisticated features into the device may have been the phone’s undoing. Industry experts are scrutinizing Samsung’s supply chain to see whether the rush to market caused technical problems or led to corners being cut. “With the Note 7, Samsung strengthened its power as a speedy competitor,” said Lee Seung-woo, an analyst with IBK Investment & Securities. “But one wonders whether it hasn’t raced ahead alone, without helping its component suppliers to catch up.” The company is facing an immediate, and substantial, financial blow. On Tuesday, even before Samsung had announced it was killing the Galaxy Note 7, its South Korea-traded shares fell more than eight percent, its biggest daily drop since 2008, knocking US$17 billion off the company’s market value. Strategy Analytics, a research firm, had earlier estimated that Samsung could lose more than US$10 billion from the phone’s troubles. Samsung’s smartphone business also helps its other divisions by buying their computer chips and panel screens. Tougher to predict is how badly the Samsung brand itself will suffer. “It’s difficult to estimate now the damage it has caused to Samsung’s mid- and long-term brand value,” Mr. Lee said, “as well as its impact on Samsung’s smartphone sales in the future.” An editorial in South Korea’s largest newspaper, the Chosun Ilbo, said: “You cannot really calculate the loss of consumer trust in money.’’ It said that Samsung must realize that it “didn’t take many years for Nokia to tumble from its position as the world’s top cellphone maker.” No major manufacturer has killed off such a high-profile smartphone at the height of its popularity. But the person familiar with Samsung’s decision to terminate production said that the company had determined that simply removing the Galaxy Note 7 from the market would be the quickest way to stem further confusion and anxiety about the phone, albeit a costly one. It is an embarrassing moment for Samsung, whose name has come to be synonymous among South Koreans with cutting-edge technology and manufacturing prowess. The Galaxy Note 7 was one of the most ambitious products Samsung had begun marketing under the leadership of Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong, who took the helm of the country’s largest family controlled conglomerate, or chaebol, after his father, Chairman Lee Kun-hee, became ill in 2014. The senior Mr. Lee, who has not been seen in public since, famously burned a pile of 150 000 defective Samsung phones 21 years ago to demonstrate the company’s commitment to quality. Initially, Samsung watchers credited Lee Jae-yong — also known as Jay Y. Lee — with acting with similar decisiveness when Samsung first recalled the 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 devices. But as the phone’s problems lingered, scrutiny intensified. The troubling part for many is that Samsung recalled the devices, but then had to try to fix the problem a second time. “Maybe they should look harder and closer at what is happening at the management level,” said Roberta Cozza, a research director with Gartner Research, who cited the damage to Samsung’s credibility with customers and with telecommunications carriers. Earlier on Tuesday, the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, a government organization, recommended that Samsung stop selling the device, saying that it had enough reason to believe the replacement model also had a “possible defect.” The agency did not provide details. The government also ordered South Korean airlines not to accept Galaxy Note 7 phones in luggage and to ensure that those who carry them on board powered them down. Just hours before the Galaxy Note 7’s demise, Samsung said it would stop selling the model around the world, essentially pulling it from the market as it sought to determine what had caused the fires. It said it had asked telecom carriers and retailers globally to stop sales and exchanges of the device. Samsung had also asked all consumers with original Galaxy Note 7s or replacement models to power them down and to stop using them while the company worked with regulators to solve the problem. Just a few hours before that, Samsung said it had temporarily halted production of the Galaxy Note 7 to try to fix the problem. In South Korea, the company apologized to consumers and business partners, while mobile carriers offered refunds to owners of the phones or allowed them switch to other Samsung models. The decision to end production came on the same day that the recall spread to China. Samsung had said earlier that models sold in China contained batteries that were different from those that had caught fire. But on Tuesday, before it announced the end of the Galaxy Note 7, Samsung said it was recalling nearly 191 000 of the devices in China. That did not go over well with many Chinese consumers. “Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 explodes, and they recall their phones in every other country except for China. They really look down on us,” wrote one user on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform.  – New York Times ← Previous Story Saudi Arabia admits defeat Next Story → The problem with referendums Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Home Industry Tech Google Pixel XL: Real, direct competition to the Apple iPhone 7 Google Pixel XL: Real, direct competition to the Apple iPhone 7 When Google launched artificial intelligence (AI)-powered premium devices Pixel and Pixel XL earlier this month, the message was clear: The device with the personal Google Assistant built right in sounded the threat bugle for Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. By: IANS | New Delhi | Published: October 21, 2016 12:45 PM The comparison is natural, especially in the absence of another flagship device, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which leaves Google and Apple fighting for the premium segment. (Reuters) When Google launched artificial intelligence (AI)-powered premium devices Pixel and Pixel XL earlier this month, the message was clear: The device with the personal Google Assistant built right in sounded the threat bugle for Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The comparison is natural, especially in the absence of another flagship device, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which leaves Google and Apple fighting for the premium segment. Google has been synonymous with innovation. This time, with a brand new Android OS Nougat and Google Assistant, Pixel devices are set to counter Apple’s iOS 10 and intelligent assistant Siri. Let us see what the 5.5-inch Pixel XL (32GB, black colour) has for Indian consumers who are searching for a premium smartphone. The aluminum and glass-built device looks elegant and fits comfortably in the palm. Unlike Nexus 6P, which had a thin glass strip at the top, Pixel XL’s back panel has almost one-third glass covering. Putting an end to Android users’ long wait, the Google Assistant in Pixel XL definitely has an edge over Apple’s Siri. See for yourself. When asked, :Are you a man or a woman?”, Google Assistant responded with answers like “I’m all inclusive :D” and “Does it really matter?” while Siri staidly replied: “I was not assigned a gender.” To “Who will win the US presidential election?” Google Assistant displayed poll results by the New York Times, The Telegraph and Independent while Siri returned Wikipedia and Quora with an iOS 10-powered iPhone. While searching restaurants near our office, Google Assistant displayed food joints as close as 300 metres while Siri said that the nearest restaurant is 600 metres away. To further test its intelligence, Google Assistant was asked, “Who is Siri?” It explained, “Siri is Apple’s intelligent assistant. She is very witty.” Siri, however, was more informative than Google Assistant when asked “Who is the Prime Minister of India?”. While Siri threw up results like when Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister and how long has he been serving, Google Assistant came back only with his name. Google Assistant can tell jokes, remember your passwords and even set the alarm for you in a clear voice. The “Pixel Imprint” fingerprint scanner is located at the back and is extremely responsive. It not only unlocked the device in a split second but also accepted (authorised) half a fingerprint for unlocking. While lock and volume up/down buttons are on the right of the Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protected AMOLED display, a nano-SIM slot sits at the left bumper of the device. Google has retained Type-C charging port that charged the 3,450 mAh battery in a flat 48 minutes. The device with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 821 Quad core processor and 4GB DDR4 RAM will get first updates and free unlimited cloud space is not to be missed. Google has put in a lot of accessories inside the box, including a two-way Type-C port cable ensuring OTG device (also included) support. With this cable, one can charge Pixel XL with another phone having a Type-C port. The smartphone runs like a charm on Android Nougat 7.1 — the only device till date to have it. The apps explorer icon is replaced by a pull-up App Drawer which is more convenient. A swipe right on the screen brings the notable search results in line with browsing history. When we swiped right, information about the FC Barcelona vs Manchester City football match; updates about the Indian Soccer League tournament; and scores for the India vs New Zealand One-Day cricket match popped up. Pixel’s 12.3MP rear camera with f/2.0 has been rated the highest ever 89 DxOMark Mobile score. It is very fast, responsive and has a video stabilising mode. As expected, the photos in broad daylight were stunning. Even in “very low light conditions”, the camera did not disappoint. Under natural light at 7 pm, the photos clicked without flash had clarity and little grains while the photo taken with flash were sharper. As compared to shooting video in normal mode, we noticed a remarkable difference when we shot the same video with “Video Stabilisation” on. There were low or no jerks and no picture distortion. The 8MP camera works fine and while using it with Google’s video calling app Duo, the receiver gets a sharper image (as compared to the Nexus 6P). One can even try new gestures, relish the audio output and save unlimited data online in original quality for free. What doesn’t work? Pixel devices are not waterproof. At a time when Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (and the now discontinued Galaxy Note 7) and Apple are offering IP68 rating (waterproof ratings), Pixel smartphones fall behind in this category. The camera does not have an optical image stabilisation feature and the Type-C to Type-C charging is slow. Conclusion: If you think about shelling out Rs 72,000 for the 32GB variant of iPhone 7 Plus, consider Google Pixel XL for Rs 67,000 as your date with Google Assistant will floor you without any doubt.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Prep Boys Volleyball: Warriors wrap up season sweep of Knights Thursday Oct 20, 2016 at 12:01 AM Oct 20, 2016 at 11:07 PM Matthew Peters Staff Writer @DP_MattPeters APPLE VALLEY — Life as the lone boys volleyball team in the High Desert was, well, lonely for Apple Valley Christian. That’s not a problem anymore. With Academy for Academic Excellence adding a program this season the short trips were nice. And getting three wins was even nicer. Apple Valley Christian (10-5) finished the season sweep against AAE with a three-set victory (25-20, 25-20, 25-23) on Thursday evening at the James Wood Community Center. Apple Valley Christian dropped just one set to AAE all year. Both teams begin the Inland Coast League post-season tournament on Tuesday. Apple Valley Christian finished the year in third place in the league while AAE is fifth. Apple Valley Christian coach John Richart said almost all road trips required a minimum drive of an hour and 15 minutes before AAE arrived. Now they have a team just across town to play. “I’ve been coaching off and on for like 16 years and we’ve never had a local team,” Richart said. “It was great to have an away game that was just across town. “They improved a lot as well. They are a scrappy team. They are going to have a great future in the league, I can see that. They work hard. A lot of improvement.” AAE coach Emily Gruver, just one year removed from playing volleyball on the AAE girls team, took a bunch of basketball and baseball players and helped the team get better along the way, finishing 5-15. “It’s been fun,” Gruver said. “There was a lot that I had to learn that I didn’t know, but teaching wise it’s the same.” Although they were swept Thursday, the Knights made it a difficult match for the Warriors at times. AAE had leads late in the both the second and third sets only to watch those slip away. AAE had a 17-12 lead in the second set and then a 22-20 lead late the third set before dropping both. Richart said Thursday’s match wasn’t his squad’s most focused effort, and that can sometimes be a trend with his Warriors. “The blessing and the curse of my team is a lot of these guys have been with each other since kindergarten, from a very young age,” Richart said. “They are like a bunch of brothers. So they goof around and play loose, and that’s great. But then they goof around and play loose and that’s not great. So that all depends.” Josh Berry led Apple Valley Christian with 11 kills, 15 blocks and two aces; Khahn Messner had eight kills and four aces; Noah Leslie added four kills and 12 assists; and Alex Richart had three kills, five assists and two block. Richart said the team had aspirations for a second-place finish in league but will now try to take the title in the league’s post-season tournament. With five seniors this is one of the best Apple Valley Christian squads in recent history, Richart said. “It will be a tough road but I think the guys will be up for the challenge,” Richart said.

Sounds like a dream but don’t be fooled Gaby Hinsliff The head of Apple, Tim Cook, says all payments could soon be via smartphone apps. But there’s a sinister side to this vision, that would lead to us losing our freedom ‘Even for those who no longer believe in fairies, there’s something oddly magical about money.’ Photograph: JGI/Jamie Grill/Getty Images/Blend Images Friday 21 October 2016 01.30 EDT Last modified on Friday 21 October 2016 03.24 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger The tooth fairy is dying. Soon, there will be no more scrabbling under pillows in the middle of the night; no more wondering what to do with a tiny molar, swapped for the traditional pound. (Chucking it in the bin seems heartless, keeping it faintly grisly.) But although my nine-year-old is reaching the limits of belief in fairies, it’s not just the magic that’s fading. It’s the habit of carrying cash. By 2025, three quarters of payments in Britain are expected to be made without notes or coins. We’re not quite Sweden – where even street beggars are starting to take plastic, via card-readers handed out by charities – but we’re moving in the same direction, towards a world of tapping contactless card to reader and paying by app, and who knows what else besides. Why cash isn't king any more Read more This week the former Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins predicted the end of banks as we know them within two decades. What’s the point of these antiquated vaults, he suggested, when all that’s really needed to underpin the movement of wealth around the globe is a vast electronic ledger tracking who’s worth what, and some nifty apps for shunting it between us? So by the time my son grows up perhaps pound coins will be for ceremonial uses only, like silver sixpences stuffed in a Christmas pudding, and kids with gappy smiles will simply swipe left on the tooth fairy app. But I can’t help feeling we’ll miss real money when it’s gone. For if cash is, as the saying goes, cold and hard then life without it may be more so. The under-30s increasingly seem to regard forking out actual coins as akin to bartering with seashells No more saving coppers in jars, dropping spare coins in charity boxes; no cash means no change, the end of that faint illusion of getting something back on the transaction. And the mind boggles at how men will mark their domestic territory, once they can’t leave small slagheaps of coins on every recently cleared surface in the house. But the bigger question here is who exactly a cashless society is designed to serve. Last week in Japan, Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, once again spelled out the company’s aim to wean the world off cash, preferably in favour of using the Apple Pay app to buy everything via their smartphones. And while his airy insistence that “we don’t think the consumer particularly likes cash” might be true for the under-30s, who increasingly seem to regard forking out actual coins as akin to bartering with seashells, it should set alarm bells ringing for the rest of us. It’s not just that people tend to spend more freely when the money feels abstract, just numbers on a screen. Turn a phone into a virtual wallet, the one thing nobody leaves home without, and you’re shackled to it for ever. What was once an expensive toy becomes a necessity, a contract you can’t cancel if times get tough – but also, perhaps, a tracking device. As any cheating spouse ever caught out by their credit card bill knows, paying with anything other than cash creates a trail, a record of transactions from which behaviour can be deduced. You don’t have to be a deranged conspiracy theorist to worry about the uses to which that information could one day be put, if not by authoritarian governments here or abroad, then by hackers. The freedom of cash isn’t something to be surrendered meekly or without thinking. But even if we don’t abandon the folding stuff altogether, the drift away from it has costs. The tooth fairy is not the only one at risk of redundancy. This summer, the last remaining bank branch in our nearest small market town closed down, which in retrospect was hardly surprising; every time I went in, invariably lugging bagfuls of change from school PTA fundraisers, there seemed to be fewer customers. In the last financial year more than 600 high street bank branches closed, which is bad news for the elderly and those who can’t travel, but even worse news for people working in them. Jobs in banking will go and they won’t be the kind of bankers everyone loves to hate but modestly paid counter and back-office staff, holding down what would once have been considered steady careers. Why we should fear a cashless world | Dominic Frisby Read more Automation has been eating away for years at one end of cash transaction, replacing shop assistants with machines, but is now coming for the other end: the places where cash is moved and managed. It’s not robots coming for these jobs, but apps that link buyer and seller or lender and borrower more directly, blowing up established professions in the middle. And while this world of fintech – the point where finance meets technology, almost certainly to the bafflement of most of us – should ultimately create jobs, they may not be the kind into which redundant bank cashiers can move seamlessly. Ah, say the prophets of plastic, but think of the problems a cash-free society solves: no more black markets in drugs or guns; fewer street muggers and cash-in-hand traders dodging tax. Really? This is surely not the end of crime, just the beginning of new ones, where hackers and fraudsters replace bank robbers and thieves, and new black markets emerge, using either virtual currencies such as bitcoin or whatever else comes to hand. (A few years ago a craze for shoplifting Tide detergent in the US was blamed, somewhat surreally, on addicts bartering the stuff for crack.) And for every would-be illegal immigrant deterred by the practical difficulties of surviving in a cash-free world, there will be homeless or otherwise marginalised Britons struggling to get by without smartphones and bank records. If we’re headed for a society where only the poor or the suspiciously shifty carry cash, it’s not hard to guess which outlets will carry on accepting their money and which will shut them out. You don’t have to pine for the days of bringing wages home in a brown paper packet to worry about whether a cashless future serves corporate interests rather better than social ones. Besides, even for those who no longer believe in fairies, there’s something oddly magical about money. Small enough to be slipped under a pillow or dropped in a busker’s hat, strong enough to be universally trusted, and foolproof enough to work even when your phone battery’s flat. Hang on to your cash. You never know when a rainy day is coming.
