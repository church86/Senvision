Apple returned to the practice field seven days ago and has held his own. The rookie injured his left knee during the team's first preseason affair and has been nursing it every since. With the regular season right around the corner, the Giants are eager to get Apple as much in-game experience as possible before throwing him into the gauntlet.

Yesterday he got through a three-hour practice in good shape.  Q: What do you see from him, do you see flashes? More than flashes? Do you want to see more? What do you see? A: Yeah, when he first got out here this week, he showed a burst and showed some acceleration, he can put his foot in the ground. He had a really nice release on a slant, which reminded me of the Houston game a few of years ago, so it is encouraging.  Q: Do you think he looked better the last couple of days than he did earlier in camp?  A: He had flashes early in the camp, too. I wouldn’t say he looked better, I just think he looked good.  Q: Will he play with the first group for the same length of time as they play or do you have a different plan for him?  A: We will put him out there early in the game.  Q: What are you hoping to see from him? What is important for you to see in the preseason from him? A: I would love to see him get his hands on a football and make some plays for us  Q: Ben, have you gone back to 2011 or any of the earlier days when you weren’t here to see the best of him or would that not be something that you would be interested in?  A: No, I saw enough of him in 2011, especially in that divisional playoff round.  Q: Are the starters going to play through the first half and into the third quarter?  A: As a general proposition, we would like to take our starters into early in the third quarter. We will evaluate it at halftime and see how it goes and then different guys based off of where they are physically. We may give a little bit more or give a little bit less, too.  Q: Is Cruz a guy who fits into that less category?  A: We will evaluate it  Q: How have you challenged your group this week?  A: We talked a little bit after the game and some emotions were flying around and we put it in perspective earlier in the week. We challenged them with the workload yesterday and coming out with the pads on and being in the pads for three hours with some conditioning and throwing a lot of situations at them. They responded in practice.  Q: Ben, we know how generally the unofficial rule is the starters play the most in the third preseason game and then in the fourth, a lot of times people don't even put their starters in at all. Are you even looking ahead to how you are going to break it up over two weeks or have you even figured that out yet?  A: Yeah, we have a plan in place for the third and fourth preseason games, but you have to be able to adjust and improvise with the way things go.  Q: What is your Friday practice? What do you look to get out of the guys? A: Fresh Friday. We try and challenge them in as many ways as we can between the ears and keep it simple from the waist down.  Q: Do you get on the field though?  A: Yes.  Q: For how long usually? Or is there a set amount of time?  A: We get out there and go through, we play the game before we play the game on Fridays. Q: How about tomorrow?  A: Yeah, tomorrow is launch day for us. We try to launch and rev them up and get the speed going 80 percent or so and get everything functioning again and get it firing and get ready for the game day.  Q: Ben, do you expect Eli Apple to play Saturday? A: Yes. Q: What about Justin Pugh?  A: We will see. Q: Has Apple shown you everything that you guys knew about him when you took him in the first round?  A: He is just getting back out there right now. He has had a little bit of a layoff there, he has been nicked so I have not seen much of him recently. It looks like he is chomping at the bit to get back out there.  Q: When could Darian Thompson get back on the practice field?  A: We are evaluating him. We say week-to-week, but to me it's hour-to-hour. I know the game is very important to the young man and he wants to be out there and help his teammates and contribute. He is getting as many mental reps as he can right now. That part of it is important to him, but we will take a look at him next week, too.  Q: Is he doing better? Is he improving this week?  A: Yes. Q: How would you describe your dynamic with Eli Manning and why it facilitates a successful offense that can move the ball?  A: My dynamic?  Q: Yeah, I guess what is unique about him, working with him as a quarterback and as a leader of the offence  A: Eli is very steady. He is a great guy to work with in the room. He gives you honest feedback and enjoys being a part of the process and part of the plan. He is just Steady Eddie.  Q: Do you work with him less now that your role has changed?  A: My role has changed, but I am in the quarterback meetings  Q: How are you going to handle the kickers on Saturday and the next two preseason games now that it is a competition?  A: They will both get work  Q: Is Geremy Davis going to suit up Saturday?  A: He is working to get out there.  Q: Do you sense that the offensive line thinks it is important to put a better product on the field Saturday night?  A: I think the offence as a whole feels that it is important to put a better product on the field  WR Victor Cruz Q: How ready are you for Saturday night? A: I’m ready. Obviously it’s been a long time coming. I had a good week of practice, everything feels great so I’m just excited to put that out there on the game field for the first time in a long time. Q: Do you have some sort of count in your head? Do you know how long it’s been? A: No, but you guys do a good job of detailing that on my social media channels, so I get a grasp of it. I don’t necessarily look it up in my head. I just look forward to tomorrow and being better than I was the day before. Q: Does it feel like an eternity? A: For lack of better words, yes. It feels like a long time since I’ve been out there. Last week was kind of fun for me to dress up and obviously not play but to warmup with my team, put that jersey on again and feel like an athlete again. It was a good feeling and now it comes to life. Q: We think of it sometimes as “just a preseason game.” Is this more than just a preseason game for you? A: Absolutely. I think this one is more of just the game. This one is crossing so many hurdles, so many barriers. So many ups and downs that I had to face to get to this moment. Now, I’m just ready to relax and go play some football again. To me, this game is bigger than just the game. Although it’s just a preseason game, for me, mentally and emotionally, physically, it’s more than just a football game. Q: Is it interesting to you that it comes against the Jets, which is a team that you’ve had some history with? A: It’s the story of my life. You can’t write it any better than this. This is the way my career has gone. It’s the way my professional career has gone. The Jets preseason game has always been some type of landmark situation for me, so here we go again. Q: Is it fair to say that the butterflies, anticipation and excitement will make you feel like a rookie again? A: I don’t think I feel like a rookie again, I can tell you that. There will be butterflies, there will be anxiety, there has been for some time now. Those feelings will all be back obviously. I get butterflies before every game until that ball is kicked off and until we’re playing. That’s when everything kind of settles down and I can hone in on what I’m doing. This week will be no different. Q: Do you have to prove anything to yourself in this game? A: Not necessarily. I think I proved a lot to myself on the practice field. Just being able to come out here and play, run routes and come out unscathed and feel good the next day. That’s what I really wanted to prove. Obviously this game is more for me to get hit, have that opportunity to get that game rep, have those game-like actions with Eli, being on the same page, all those things that you look forward to as a player. Q: How pleased were you with this week’s practice? You said you were waiting for that moment, did that come this week? A: I think it came a couple times. It felt good. It felt like myself. It felt like what I was used to doing and how I was used to playing. I think a couple moments came and I was excited about it. I just want to continue to stack those moments and stack those personal victories. Q: What was that like in Buffalo, going on the field for warmups knowing you weren’t going to play? It had to be difficult? A: A little bit. It’s been awhile since I even dressed up and got out there and warmed up. I was happy to be out there with my teammates and having them cheer me on. It was like, ‘Okay, one step closer, 80.’ Everyone just on my side and rooting for me was a great feeling. Just to be out there was the best part. Whether I was playing or not, going to be in that game or not, being out there going through the warmup with my team was definitely a step in the right direction. Q: Did you see Rex Ryan at all? A: I did. He came out to me during that warmup. He was like, ‘Good to see you. I know you’re not going today, but get healthy and we’ll see you throughout the year.’ We’ve always had a mutual respect for each other over the years. It was good to see him again. Q: You’ve been close to this point a couple times and it hasn’t worked out. When you finished practice yesterday, having the big heavy part of the week gone by and you were finished, was there a sense of relief that this was going to happen now? A: A little bit. Obviously there was a little bit of an exhale once that practice was over. I was like, ‘Okay, I finished this week strong and not going backwards. Everything is going forwards and I’m moving in the right direction.’ That was a good feeling and a tremendous exhale that I was one step closer to getting back out there on the field in a game-like atmosphere and playing with my teammates again. Q: You’ve had two heavy practices. Were you able to go back and look at it and watch it. What is your critique? Where do you think you need to get better? A: I think it’s continuing to get a feel for the routes, the route combinations, the spacing. Continuing to work on catching the football, being explosive, continuing to catch the ball, running after the catch. Just getting that consistency back is the last part of it now. Understanding what I’m getting out there on the field from a coverage perspective and then working backwards from there. Everything is going in the right direction, I just want to continue to stack and build on that. Q: Mike Sullivan said he watched you this week and had visions of 2011, watching tape. Did you? A: I did. Some of those moments I spoke about earlier about things that I wanted to see in myself, they were out there on that football field. Some of that quickness and some of that elusiveness that I felt was definitely out there. I just want to continue to build on that. Like I said, it’s one thing to do it one day but to continue to do it everyday and be consistent is what you want. I think I built a good foundation to continue to move in the right direction. Q: Given the stops and starts of this whole process, was there a level of anxiety that you had coming into the week practice-wise and were you concerned that things might have been set back again? A: Of course. The anxiety to come out, the training staff told me I was full go. If I had any limitations, they wanted me to let them know. Obviously I know my body after all this time that has passed. I was positive, I got a text from a friend of mine that said just go out there and have fun. I said that’s how I’m going to approach it. I came out, I was smiling, I was running around, having a good time. I think that was the thing that tipped the ice burg for me. Here I am and I’m ready to play. Q: Was that right before practice you got that text? A: About an hour before practice. Q: Care to say who sent it? A: Not Lebron. QB Eli Manning Q: Any early impressions of what you saw from number 80 out there? A: I thought Victor had a good week of practice. It was good to have him back. He looked explosive, fast and healthy. He was making plays. That little rest he got paid off and it’s good to see him. Excited to see him on a game day and to see him in some live action. Q: Did you make an effort to feed him in practice this week at all? A: No, just going through my reads and trying to stick with what I normally do. Having faith with all the guys who are out there, whoever is running routes and just sticking with the progression I’ve been taught to do. It seems like he got a few opportunities to make some plays so that’s good. Q: Especially with him inside running those routes that he’s been running, is there something to be said about being at the right place at the right time and being where you’re supposed to be that makes it more fluent for you guys? It seemed like that at the practice that we saw on Tuesday and that seemed to get him going. A: Yes, obviously in football a lot of it is just having the right routes against the right coverages and the right timing. I think he’s had a good understanding of the timing of this offense and when the ball is going to be coming his way. He’s always been a special guy in the slot just having a good feel. Giving sticks and it’s been easy for me to read his body language when he’s coming in and out of breaks. It’s good that we still have that. Q: What do you recall about his famous night against the Jets in 2011 when he caught three touchdowns? A: I think I was getting stitches in my head. I think I missed a lot of it. I saw a few of it on TV in the locker room. I saw it in the game film and he made plays. I know he had a fade down the left sideline, made a one-handed catch, had a back shoulder catch, a couple that were fade routes. Obviously a big part of him making the team was that night, stepping up and making plays. Q: He was number three back then? A: He was. It was Victor Cruz before anyone even knew who Victor Cruz was. He made a name for himself that night. Q: How about the 99-yard catch and run? What do you recall about that? A: Great play. We were backed up on the one-yard line, end of the second quarter. Just did a little out route to him versus a two zone. Tight throw, he ran a great route, caught it while feeling the cornerback, was able to side-step him, show his speed and get a 99-yard touchdown. A huge play for us winning that game and making the playoffs that year that led to a Super Bowl. Q: We know you’re always so calm but do you allow yourself to get anxious and butterflies for a teammate like Victor? I’m sure you’re anticipating the eagerness of wanting to throw him a pass and getting that completion out of the way. A: I don’t think it’s nervous or anxious. I’m excited for him. He’s a long time teammate and friend. I know what he’s been through and I know it’s been a tough road these last two years. I know he wants to be out there so I’m excited for him to have that possibility. Obviously it’s preseason, it would be nice to get him out there but when it comes to the regular season to get him some action, some catches, a touchdown, that would be special. Q: Has his footwork in practice, those quick moves, stood out to you more this week? A: I think it’s been a while since he’s had to move around like that. I think those are things that have always probably come really natural to him. He just has to get used to doing it again. He has to get used to catching the ball, making that first defender miss, where he’s not thinking about anything. Just thinking about catching it and acting normal. It’s what he naturally does. I think it takes a little time to trust it and realize that he’s still got it, but it seems like he’s moving that way. Q: Do you look at trying to get him the ball early? Maybe look at him a little bit more because you’re trying to get him action, trying to see what he can do? A: It doesn’t always work that way. Hopefully it works out and we can get him the ball, but it’ll depend on the coverage, on the play, and what’s going on. I’m not going to bypass somebody to get him a catch in a preseason game. Hopefully it works out, and if he’s out there enough he should get a catch. Q: How have you guys balanced this week, not freaking out over the past two preseason games but having an urgency to get things right for the third preseason game? A: Our focus has been on this week. We understand that this has been about as close as our game week schedule will be. The game planning, from the practice schedule, and everything that’s going on. I thought we had a good week of practice, a good urgency. The tempo was better, fixing things and cleaning up things. The practice was better. We just have to put the practice onto the field. We have to do it on game day and make the plays when they count. Q: What will a healthy Victor Cruz do for you and this offense? A: He’s a talented player. If he can get healthy it gives us another playmaker and a guy that can play the outside and the inside. When you have receivers that can play multiple, like Victor, like Odell, like Sterling, you can move guys around and it’s harder to game plan for certain teams. We’re going to try and be versatile with that and having him be part of that action. Having a guy you can trust and have that chemistry with is important. DT Damon Harrison Q: How much do you hate the Jets? A: I don't hate them at all, I don't hate too many teams in the league. It's just a game, it'll be fun to get out there and play with my former teammates and some guys I consider family. Q: Does it help at all that it's a preseason game? A: No, I kind of hate that it's a preseason game. Because, again, all games count, preseason or not but it would be that much more fun and exciting if it was a regular season game and if it was a year ago. Q: How much communication have you had with your former teammates leading up to this game? A: Well the D-line, we talk, I'm going to say every other day; Muhammad (Wilkerson), Sheldon (Richardson), Leonard (Williams), T.J. Barnes, Stephen Bowen. I'm sure it would be more if we weren't in camp but I talk to those guys all time, not only the D-line but a lot of the guys on offense and defense. Q: Have they been razzing you about the game? A: I told them we're just going to leave that for Saturday, whenever it is, I think it's Saturday. I told them I was going to leave it there so let’s just not talk about it now. Q: How does this defensive line and the defensive room here compare to that one? A: Oh man, I really can’t get into comparisons, it's really not fair to either side to even do that. These guys, I'm just still getting to know them so it wouldn't be right for me to formulate a solid opinion on them yet, but so far so good. Q: When you're on the field, who's voice are you hearing most behind you? A: Well it's been different because the linebacker rotation it's been changing a lot; I guess they're still trying to figure some things out. But, Jasper (Brinkley), JC (Jonathan Casillas) and JT (Thomas). Those are the consistent voices I hear. Q: Wasn't that long ago that you admitted that you don't feel like a Giant, there’s still some Jet blood in you...You’ve kind of indicated that it's still an adjustment for you, is it still that way? A:  Well I mean, I played a few games as a Giant since that comment, I would like to think. Yeah, it's coming along nicely. Again, it's still different, I'm a guy, I don't like change at all, I like consistency, I like everything to be the same every single day. I definitely have been embracing it a whole lot more now. Q: I know you guys have done some game planning for them, how different is it to not have to go after Ivory in the backfield? A: Forte is a good back, he's an older back but he’s still a really good back. But I'll tell you, the funny thing is just to watch your former team on the field and watch the guys you're going up against and spoke to everyday for the past four years. That's been weird, and you know, to actually hear opinions from other teams and what they think about guys, that's funny man. That's real funny. Q: Does it reinforce your opinions or change your opinions of those guys? A: It reinforces it, because sometime it's spot on. Like I asked one coach today 'how did you know?' and he told me but I don't want to get too deep into that but yeah they're right. Q: You've been in both locker rooms now, is there any rivalry left between the Giants and the Jets? If so, how does it manifest itself? A: I wouldn't call it a rivalry; I think it’s more for the fans. And you know, a respect thing around the town, seeing each other out, the Giants and the Jets but as far as Cowboys-Giants and Jets-Patriots, it's not that kind of rivalry Q: Was this game a bigger deal when Rex Ryan was around? A: Everything was a big deal. Everything. He made you believe that every game, every snap, everything mattered, as do a lot of coaches. But it was just a little different with Rex, and he wanted the Snoopy Bowl more than some others. Q: You practiced against this offensive line before, have you ever gone full speed against them? A: Against our O line? Q: Against the Jets. A: Yes, I'm a big guy so I wouldn't consider it full speed but yes, in training camp definitely, and during the season we had on shoulder pads quite a bit during my time there, even into the season. Q: Do you know what to expect from them? A: Oh yeah, you want me to tell you more? Q: Who are you looking forward to going against? A: I'm excited to see everybody, but the entire O-line. It'll be fun to have on a different jersey and go up against them. It'll be weird at first, but hopefully Mangold gets to play, because we've always had some good battles. He's still one of the better centers in the league and you know that'll be the last time before his last preseason game. Q: Have you guys talked about bringing the Snoopy Trophy back? A: No, I couldn't remember the name of it until somebody just told me. So, it's not that big of a deal. It is for the fans so we care about it. Wide Receivers Coach Adam Henry Q: What have you seen from Victor in the past couple of days? A: I've seen progress with Victor. It's going along, slowly but surely. So just taking our time with him. But I'm optimistic. Q: You're one of the few guys here who's never worked with him before this year. Is that difficult, or do you get a new perspective? A: No. I look at each situation totally different. It doesn't matter if I haven't worked with him. I consider myself a coach, so coaching different players that do different things. But the transition has been really, really good. For him, as a person, he's a hard worker, he wants to learn, he's doing all the things he needs to do to be successful.  Q: What have you learned from Victor, not just as a receiver but as a person? A: Just as a person, he has many talents. He likes to do a lot of other things besides being a football player. But he is a good person. Q: When you see a veteran with the kind of summer that he's had, with the ups and downs, do you find a way to get through to him? How’s the last couple of weeks been with him one on one? A: Always. I'm always going to be optimistic, I'm always going to be positive. That's just who I am, and the type of coach that I am. So I'm always there for him, just talking to him, whether it's football or not football. But he's always been upbeat, always been positive about the situation. Just taking it slowly with him. But as far as the mental aspect, you can see him growing as a person, as a player. Mentally, he's in a good place.  Q: Does Sterling seem more like a rookie, or less like a rookie? A: He's got a ways to go. There are a lot of learning curves, situationally smart in an NFL game. Again, he works hard, that's the biggest thing that you want from a player. He's out there, he likes to have fun, he's smiling, he loves to work. When you hold him out of plays, he gets upset. So, those are the things that you look for in players. Q: Who gets more upset when you hold them out of plays, him or Odell? A: Both. It's different. So they compete, and so what we try to instill is just positive peer pressure, then a room of making plays and being a playmaker and working hard, finishing plays and things of that nature. That's the collective group was taking ownership of that group and just working hard. Q: You've coached Odell in the past, and now you're coaching him here. How different is this Odell then the player that you coached at LSU? A: He's a little different. Of course, New York, the media. It's just things are different. There are receivers that I've coached at LSU that are at some other places, so he's different because of the NFL and the things he's done so far. So of course, he's grown as a person. At LSU, everything was so enclosed, and being in college, going to class or back. Even though, LSU football is a big deal, it was just a little different. Q: Different in a positive way or a negative way? A: It's just the media. It's just, it's expounded. A lot of the plays that he did at LSU and making plays, he's always done that.  Q: LeBron was not in contact with him? A: That's a little different. But again, he works hard. He's one of the hardest workers in the group. He's doing everything that we ask of him as a staff.  Q: What has Tavarres King done to separate himself? A: He's been consistent, making plays down the field. Just each and every day, just working on his craft. I've seen some good things from him. Q: What about Roger Lewis Jr, how much progress has he made and where do see him at this point? A: He's making progress every day and again he's a hard worker. He's willing to learn, he's always with the other quarterbacks, asking questions. He asks a lot of questions; he writes a lot of notes down. Just in translating the things in his brain, and what he needs to do. From a player point of view, from the first day, he’s really grown, he's progressed. Q: Did he start at a lower point; he came from a different kind of offense- more college? A: The college game is different. So it's the situations, because a rep is like a bar of gold. So when you have an ability to get in there and get a rep, and to learn, it's a learning curve. Again, because of the offenses in college and the style of going fast and things of that nature, it’s just different. Q: With your receivers, how interchangeable do they have to be or how interchangeable are they now? A: They're all interchangeable; just play receiver. So, that’s the thing, it's just learning the concept, the conception of how a play is unfolded. Not just learning a certain position. You always want to put yourself in a position to play that next best player. So as far as the X receiver or Z receiver, we just have receivers and so they're interchangeable. Of course we need to put them in spots to be successful. Secondary/Safeties Coach Dave Merritt Q: How disappointing is it that Darian (Thompson) has to miss a game? A: Very disappointing. I feel sad for the young man. He has been doing well for us as far as communicating and controlling the coverages on the back end, so for him to miss a game, he was definitely upset. Q: Do you think this derails him, or do you envision him still ready to start the season? A: Oh, he will be ready. He will be ready. My thing is, I told the young man, ‘You are a young fella, you should heal well, if you were my age you would be out for six months’, but by him being young, I truly believe that he will be ready to go. He is in there taking notes and has continued to try to help all the other guys in the room as far as the game plan and etc. So I don’t think it derails him at all. Q: What has he shown that has made him able to seize the starting job basically from day one? A: The assertiveness. This kid has come in from day one, he’s been able to go out and receive the calls that would come into the huddle and he is able to go out and actually execute it and just being very firm with his calls whether he is right or wrong. That is the one thing that he has shown from day one, is just being assertive and making a call and sticking to it. Q: Have you seen the kind of jump from Landon that you were looking for in year two? A: Absolutely. So far, Landon has been a breath of fresh air versus the young man from last year because he understands the defense a little more being in his second year, so he is communicating, he is taking charge out there as well as Darian, so I am very happy with Landon and where he is mentally. Q: He looks faster. How much of that is physically better conditioning and how much of that is knowing what he is doing? A: I think it is the second part that you said, knowing what he is doing because of course if you know what you are doing, you are going to actually be able to play faster. You are not going to be mentally constipated and the fact that he is able to go out and just as Darian, being able to receive the call and actually executing and knowing what he is doing, he is playing much faster. Another thing is Landon is taking care of his body. I think he is down to seven percent body fat. Don’t quote me on that, but I told him, ‘If you want to become one of the elite safeties in the league you are going to have to at least get between 212 and 216.’ He texted me this morning, it is funny and he said, ‘Coach, I am at 216’, I said, ‘Great. Keep it up.’ Q: What weight was he at last year? A: I can’t recall exactly where he was, but I am quite sure that he was heavier than 216. Q: There was so much about Landon being a box safety last year. I am curious, has that remaking of his body helped him in coverage or has the knowledge has helped as much as anything? A: I think it is both. I think the fact that just talking about as far as his body --- I think, being able to play at a lighter weight has allowed him to have his change of direction more so than when you are heavy you are trying to plant and drive. It is with any athlete. The more weight that you are carrying and you are trying to plant and drive it is going to be tough for that particular athlete to get in and out of cuts. There are some elite guys that can actually do it, but I think the fact that he trimmed some of his body fat, like I said, down to seven percent body fat. That is pretty dag on good for a 215, 16, 18-pound man. But, then again, just as was mentioned earlier, just his mental --- being able to know what to do and do it quickly and do it decisively is ahead of the ball game. If you can get that done before the snap actually happens and you understand formation and recognizing what they are actually trying to do to you, that is going to give you a jump start for sure. Q: If Darian can’t go against the Cowboys, do you know right now who would fill in? A: I have no clue. The thing is, the Nat Berhe’s and all the guys that we have are ready to go, they have all been tested, each guy, so I really don’t know right now. I couldn’t answer that question. Q: Do you feel that if Darian is able to get onto the field you are going to have any nerves about throwing a rookie out there? A: Not at all. Landon went through it last year. Not at all. Landon came in last year as a second round pick and he had to start and he started every game, so not at all. I don’t feel squeamish at all about starting a young guy. The best players are going to play and right now, if he is the best player which he has stepped up and he has taken the bull by the horn, he is ready to go. We have all the confidence in the world that he will be our guy ready to go on opening day. Q: Eli Apple seems pretty even keeled for a rookie. What is it about him? Does he come off more mature? What have you learned about him so far? A: It is actually biblical. If you don’t say much, if you just kind of sit back and just let it go and look at what is going on and watch the other guys, sometimes you may seem smarter than actually what you really are, so the thing is, Eli hasn’t said much, but he is watching the veterans and he is actually learning from what they are trying to teach him. So maybe that is what you are seeing, is the fact that he is just calm, but again, this kid is coming from a big program. I attribute a lot of that to Ohio State. He has played in the big games and he is up here now going against NFL caliber players. I have told all the guys that you have to understand they put on their pads just like you just put on your pads, so just because you see an emblem on the side of their helmet that may say the Jets or may say the Bills, you have to understand that this is football. This is what you have done all your life, all of your career, so I truly believe that this kid is going to be one of the great ones for us down the road. Q: What have you seen from Leon Hall? A: Leon is a smart veteran. He is a guy that, it is funny, he is a guy that can actually, you can tell him once and he knows exactly what you are talking about. He understands concepts. The fact that he is a veteran player that has been playing in the NFL for the time that he has been in the league, eight, nine years, whatever it is. He is seeing a lot of the route concepts, so by him going back and seeing it from a deeper depth perception it has actually been refreshing for him. You ask him that and it is like, ‘Wow. This is pretty cool, I can see exactly what is going on in front of me’, and that is what you get as a safety. You are actually able to pull your eyes back and see it for what it is. That is what you are, you are the safety and you have to keep everyone else safe. You are the racer; you are the guy that has to make things right. What I think about Leon is the fact that he is very smart and he is able to understand the concepts and he is vocal as well. Q: How much does it help the back end of the defense that the D-line has been fortified? A: I will tell you. I have been fortunate to be able to be around here when we won two championships and it starts up front. Coach McAdoo preaches that it starts up front with the big guys. Whether you are on the offensive side or whether you are on the defensive side, but it is definitely going to help us tremendously. I mean, with the new guys we have in here; OV and Darian and Snacks. These guys are doing the things that I have been used to in the past, so we have that back.

AP FILE PHOTO Giants rookie cornerback Eli Apple (AP File Photo/Julio Cortez) The Giants’ first-round pick had textbook coverage on receiver Darius Powe – playing the scout-team part of Jets receiver Brandon Marshall – and showed no lingering limitation from the bruised knee that cost him a week of practice with a leaping interception. Afterward, Apple was not overly impressed. He expects to make plays like that often as the Giants continue to challenge him with plenty of first-team snaps in the secondary opposite Janoris Jenkins with veteran Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie shifting inside as slot cornerback. Well, that and Apple admitted the play shouldn’t have counted. “It wasn’t too great because we got an offside called on us, so technically it wasn’t a pick,” he said. “It felt good being out there with my team and being able to make those plays.” Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said he likes the way Apple has taken to his responsibilities within the Giants’ defense. “I think missing that game [in Buffalo last Saturday] kind of hurt, but I am keeping my fingers crossed that he stays healthy and gets into this game and gets a lot of reps and works with that first group,” Spagnuolo said. “I think that he is another young guy that has developed really well for us, and quicker than maybe we expected. I know always when you are drafted in the first round the expectations are way up here, and sometimes I think they are unfair, but when he stepped in for that first day it was pretty evident he could handle what comes with that. “We have to get into the game, and he has some good receivers that he has to go against, but I like the way he is developing right now.” Apple has taken his share of coverage assignments against Odell Beckham Jr., Sterling Shepard and Victor Cruz this summer, so he’s looking forward to the opportunity of matching up with Jets star receivers Marshall and Eric Decker as a good barometer for what’s to come. “They’re two of the best combo receivers out there in the league for sure,” Apple said. “Brandon Marshall is a big physical guy. Decker is a great route runner and is also pretty physical. They’re definitely going to help get us ready for the season. The third preseason game is very important for us to play well because most of the starters are going to be out there for the first half and a little bit of the third quarter. “We definitely want to pick it up, make those necessary adjustments from the last couple weeks and do our thing.” The Giants will meet the media this afternoon for the final time before Saturday night’s game with the Jets. Cruz is expected to speak about the chance to play his first game since Oct. 12, 2014, while Eli Manning and former Jets defensive tackle Damon “Snacks” Harrison could also talk with reporters. As for Apple, his maturation continues to progress. “I’m proud of myself on picking up the playbook. I don’t think I’m making too many mental mistakes,” Apple said. “I just want to play fast out there. That’s the main thing for me. We’ll see come Saturday how my development has been. That’s something I definitely want to show to everyone.” NorthJersey.com : Sports NorthJersey.com : Sports August 25, 2016, 12:22 PM Last updated: Thursday, August 25, 2016, 12:25 PM Giants' Eli Apple ready for Jets on Saturday Buy this photo AP FILE PHOTO Giants rookie cornerback Eli Apple (AP File Photo/Julio Cortez) By ART STAPLETON STAFF WRITER |  The Record EAST RUTHERFORD – The football was in the air and Eli Apple had no problem going up to get it.

The plan would be to store an unauthorized user's biometric information to boost security. Potentially, this data could then be transmitted anywhere or used in later legal proceedings. For example, server-side systems could potentially cross-reference fingerprint data and photos with an online database of known users. Revealed in Apple Insider, Apple's invention covers "Biometric capture for unauthorized user identification". Using different constraints, varying levels of capture could be set. For instance, a single or multiple failed authentication triggers could be used to capture fingerprint data and a picture of the user. Other data can augment the biometric information, for example time stamps, device location, speed, air pressure, audio data and more, all collected and logged as background operations.

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Patents-Patents+ Future Apple devices with fingerprint scanners and cameras may employ a new method for dealing with potential abductors, and when we say abductors, we actually mean unscrupulous gadget thieves. It's a terrible feeling, this – realizing that your cool high-tech toy has been stolen. An endless stream of questions enters begins tormenting your racing mind: who did it? What can they do with it? Should I change all my passwords? Is there any hope of ever finding the device? The struggle is real. Okay, that might have been a bit of an exaggeration on our part, but it's totally an uncool position to be in. Trust us. Anyway, there are various things you can do if your smartphone is stolen (or lost, for that matter), and we'd advice to take a good look at all of them, in case you find yourself in such an unenviable position. Links down below. Apple is now looking at adding another possible course of action to the mix, by securing a patent that could result in future iDevices storing biometric information and other data of unauthorized users. In other words, next iterations of the iPhone and iPad may store fingerprint data and attempt to snap a picture of the user with the front-facing camera, in case their biometric credentials are not recognized. Apple was granted the patent, initially filed in late April, by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) earlier on Thursday. The abstract of the patent goes over some of the data that may be collected by the security system, should it be implemented in the first place, which includes “one or more fingerprints, one or more images of a current user of the computing device, video of the current user, audio of the environment of the computing device, forensic interface use information” and so on. Said data will likely be initially stored locally on the device itself, and sent to remote servers for further evaluation, when the device is connected to the Internet. The patent documentation states that once delivered to the servers, the biometric data may then pass various procedures for cross-referencing it with an already existing database of information for existing users. With all that said, don't hold your breath that this year's iPhone will implement this technology, or next year's for that matter. Or maybe even next next year's. One such proactive security system would fall into a legal gray area, as far as current anti-theft measures go, and would call for a considerable amount of deliberation before its implementation is allowed. Furthermore, even if it is eventually allowed, it might have to undergo drastic changes in order to fit within the established regulatory measures.

Front cam stealth photo taken with wrong password entry, GPS location sent to email / iMessage, all toggles disabled and powerdown requires passcode. Very nice. Still wont stop someone from going into dfu mode though. But gives me enough time to catch the dude with the police. Regardless, a stolen iPhone is literally completely pointless /useless with activation lock now. Thieves just steal for parts. posted on 25 Aug 2016, 11:39 0 Reply 7. PHYCLOPSH (Posts: 334; Member since: 28 Jun 2014) Apple should just include a tiny charge of C4 with - oh perhaps 2mm ball-bearings inside their next iPhone along with an update to Siri that gives her capability to use a "HAL9000 kill mode" to deter and/ or disable thieves in the event the phone is reported stolen.

Wiencon (Posts: 1917; Member since: 06 Aug 2014) I hope so because atm there the protection has enormous, stupid flaws. First thing I'd do after stealing iPhone is entering DFU mode, it gets untraceable so easily. Turn on airplane mode from lockscreen? No problem, turn on airplane mode when CC is disabled? No problem, use Siri Seriously, I know the thief wouldn't be able to use it but you still won't have your phone and even a way to find it Jailbreak solves all of these problems but on 9.3 it's tethered so just reboot and all ani theft tweaks are gone posted on 25 Aug 2016, 10:52 1 Reply 6.

Called “Biometric capture for unauthorized user identification,” the patent describes how an unrecognized user’s biometric information (fingerprint) could be stored locally, or on the cloud, to be utilized at a later time for identification. A couple of years ago, it was recognized that iPhones were the most targeted by UK thieves. At the moment, there’s no official plan to actually implement the system, but Apple has deemed the idea important enough to file a patent. If implemented one day, it would be a drastic change in how biometric information is handled. With current policies, most devices avoid transmitting biometric information and keep them encrypted in a secure area of the hardware. The fear is that transmission could be prone to interception and decryption, given enough time and computing power. Without transmission, physical access to the phone would be required, which limits the possibility of mass leaks of millions of records at once. Learn more: How do Fingerprint Scanners Work? If transmitted, the biometric data (either fingerprint or fingerprint digital signature) could be cross-referenced with a database of known users or government databases. At the same time, it’s very easy to record and send other information pertinent to theft, such as the GPS location (or recent route), the keystrokes and swipes or even photos taken with the front camera. Of course, it would be a huge problem for thieves who would then need to take extra precautions, although this would target the careless thief rather than the organized one. Thieves have proven very resourceful and some don’t hesitate to dig tunnels to steal iPhones. Also, it’s easy to imagine how children could trigger false alerts etc… Transmitting information about thieves is not new, and there are plenty of examples of stolen iPhones sending data to the cloud, like this thief who streamed his photos from a stolen iPhone, or that one who was unknowingly documenting his life on Tumblr. This is an idea that is worth discussing because phone theft is rampant, and OEMs are often accused of not doing enough to deter illegal sales of stolen property. For instance, it’s a fact that the Activation Lock deters theft. What do you think? Yay or Nay? Filed in Apple. Read more about iPad, iPhone, stolen, theft.

We’re most likely only a matter of weeks away from Apple releasing the iPhone 7 and with it, iOS 10, so it’s a little surprising to see Apple pushing out one last point release for iOS 9. Still, that’s what it has done, but not with a focus on new features or functionality. Where iOS 9.3.4 largely existing to lock down a route to jailbreaking, iOS 9.3.5 instead addresses some serious "zero day" exploits that could leave your data exposed to malicious parties. Apple’s security advisory for iOS 9.3.5 states that it addresses exploits that could affect the operating kernel, memory corruption issues and the possibility for malicious web sites to execute arbitrary code on your iOS 9 device. While the company that originally identified the exploits noted that previously they would only have been used against specific high-value targets, with the publicity around them it’s more likely that criminal types would add them to their arsenal of exploits, so updating would be exceptionally wise. How do I update my iOS device? If you haven’t already been prompted to do so, head to Settings>General>Software Update. If you’re running an applicable device (which is pretty much any iOS 9-capable gadget) you should be prompted to download the update and apply it. As it encompasses the code found in iOS 9.3.4, that does mean that if you’re using a jailbroken iPhone or iPad, it will remove the jailbreak. What does this mean for iOS 10? It appears at this stage that the exploits in question don’t apply to iOS 10, so if you’re running the beta version of iOS 10 on your device, you should be secure, at least until malicious types work out the next exploit.

Worse yet, as Apple continues to demand lower prices for more labor and more products, we see companies trying to push back on the giant. It’s still not enough for the people toiling at the factories, though, according to advocacy group China Labor Watch. CLW talked with employees inside parts supplier Pegatron and found hazardous working conditions, poor management of about 100,000 workers and cover-ups that have helped the company pass Apple’s welfare inspection. Conditions have deteriorated as CLW gathered paystubs and  accounts from 2015 into this year. Hanging laundry inside a workers’ dormitory. At Pegatron’s Shanghai complex, the company raised wages in accordance with local law, but made its workforce take on welfare cuts and insurance deductions. An hourly wage of $1.85 went up to $2 in actual terms, but actually fell to $1.60 post-deductions. Overtime is rampant, mismanaged and has led to student interns working more than regulations allow for and one employee garnering 293 hours of work in a month. Add to that a security regimen that cuts break time and paid time and denials of leave, and everything falls apart. Monthly wages have fallen since March. As the minimum wage went up in April and May, real monthly income fell thanks to those deductions. On average, maintenance department workers made $615.50 in March, $486.68 in April and $474.08 in May. 2,015 were analyzed dating back as far as May 2015. China Labor Watch’s report blames not only Pegatron for skirting safety and wage laws, but Apple also for dedicating only $11.3 billion or 4.8 percent of its total revenue last year to buying products made by some 1.6 million Chinese laborers. Apple has responded to previous reports from CLW, assuring the public that it investigates problems and makes sure every supply chain worker gets treated right, but it seems that inaction has spoken louder than words. Not uncommon for multinational conglomerates to fail at this. Source: China Labor Watch Via: 9to5Mac Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Now, Apple’s Korean counterpart is following suit with a “pink gold” Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. That’s right — it’s not rose gold, though it looks an awfully lot like it. Samsung’s color variant for its flagship S7 and S7 Edge has been dubbed pink gold to distinguish itself from the rose gold trend. The color for the S7 pair isn’t new — the company announced the pink gold option back in April, except it was only available in select markets such as South Korea. Related: One man’s shiny new Samsung Galaxy Note 7 exploded while charging “Pink gold was chosen as it, like the other colors available for the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, is a natural color that provides a sense of comfort,” the company wrote in a blog post back in April. “These hues glitter and shimmer as if illuminated from inside their glass surfaces. In particular, the refined pink gold color scheme is intended to soothe and incorporate a touch of gentleness, radiance and sophistication to the smartphones’ design.” The color option is now available in the United States, if you fancy the need for a touch of gentleness and sophistication, but you’ll have to head over to Best Buy. The retailer has exclusive access to the color, and you’ll get a $150 Best Buy gift card if you purchase and activate a pink gold S7 or S7 Edge. Related: Let the games begin: Samsung unveils Galaxy S7 Edge Olympic Edition It’s unclear if the new Galaxy Note 7 will get the same pink gold treatment, but you’re now able to choose from black, gold, white, silver, and pink gold for the S7 and S7 Edge. Samsung also offered an Olympic Games edition of the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge exclusively through Best Buy, but the device was only available in limited quantities and cost an expensive $850. The S7 costs $670, while its Edge variant is priced at $770. Also watch: Samsung KS9800 Review Please enable Javascript to watch this video

Both reports fingered the NSO Group, an Israeli company with a reputation for flying under the radar, as the author of the spyware. (AP Photo/Daniella Cheslow) Apple boosts iPhone security after Mideast spyware discovery RAPHAEL SATTER AND DANIELLA CHESLOW ASSOCIATED PRESS | August 25, 2016 PARIS — A botched attempt to break into the iPhone of an Arab activist using hitherto unknown espionage software has trigged a global upgrade of Apple's mobile operating system, researchers said Thursday. The spyware took advantage of three previously undisclosed weaknesses in Apple's mobile operating system to take complete control of iPhone devices, according to reports published Thursday by the San Francisco-based Lookout smartphone security company and internet watchdog group Citizen Lab. Both reports fingered the NSO Group, an Israeli company with a reputation for flying under the radar, as the author of the spyware. "The threat actor has never been caught before," said Mike Murray, a researcher with Lookout, describing the program as "the most sophisticated spyware package we have seen in the market." The reports issued by Lookout and Citizen Lab — based at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs — outlined how an iPhone could be completely compromised with the tap of a finger, a trick so coveted in the world of cyberespionage that in November a spyware broker said it had paid a $1 million dollar bounty to programmers who'd found a way to do it. Such a compromise would give hackers full control over the phone, allowing them to eavesdrop on calls, harvest messages, activate cameras and microphones and drain the device of its personal data. Arie van Deursen, a professor of software engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, said both reports were credible and disturbing. Forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski described the malicious program as a "serious piece of spyware." Apple said in a statement that it fixed the vulnerability immediately after learning about it, but the security hole may have gone unpatched had it not been for the wariness of an embattled human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates. Ahmed Mansoor, a well-known human rights defender, first alerted Citizen Lab to the spyware after receiving an unusual text message on Aug. 10. Promising to reveal details about torture in the United Arab Emirates' prisons, the unknown sender included a suspicious-looking link at the bottom of the message. Mansoor wasn't convinced. Not only had he been imprisoned, beaten, robbed and had his passport confiscated by the authorities over the years, Mansoor had also repeatedly found himself in the crosshairs of electronic eavesdropping operations. In fact Mansoor already had the dubious distinction of having weathered attacks from two separate brands of commercial spyware. And when he shared the suspicious text with Citizen Lab researcher Bill Marczak, they realized he'd been targeted by a third. Marczak, who'd already been looking into the NSO Group, said he and fellow-researcher John Scott-Railton turned to Lookout for help picking apart the malicious program, a process which Murray compared to "defusing a bomb." "It is amazing the level they've gone through to avoid detection," he said of the software's makers. "They have a hair-trigger self-destruct." Working feverishly over a two-week period, the researchers found that Mansoor had been targeted by an unusually sophisticated piece of software which likely cost a small fortune to arm. "Ahmed Mansoor is a million-dollar human rights defender," Scott-Railton said. In a statement which stopped short of acknowledging that the spyware was its own, the NSO Group said its mission was to provide "authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime." The company said it had no knowledge of any particular incidents. It said it would not make any further comment.

The use of Israeli technology to police its own citizens is an uncomfortable strategy for an Arab country with no formal diplomatic ties to the Jewish state. And Israeli complicity in a cyberattack on an Arab dissident would seem to run counter to the country's self-description as a bastion of democracy in the Middle East. Authorities in both countries did not return calls seeking comment. Attorney Eitay Mack, who advocates for more transparency in Israeli arms exports, said his country's exports of surveillance software were not closely policed. "Surveillance is not considered a lethal weapon," Mack said. And Israeli regulations "don't take into consideration human rights or that it would be used by a government to oppress dissidents." He noted that Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cultivated ties with Arab Gulf states. Netanyahu in 2014 urged Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to join him in the war on terrorism. "Israel is looking for allies," Mack said. "And when Israel finds allies, it does not ask too many questions." ___ This story has been corrected to show the accurate spelling of the researcher's surname is Murray, not Murrary. ___ Cheslow reported from Herzliya, Israel.

Spotify Nearing IPO Amid Struggle with Music Labels; Is this the End? Spotify is being pressurized by investors to go public while it struggles to secure major music labels for long contracts; the future looks grim for the music streaming giant By: Staff Writer on Aug 24, 2016 at 9:09 am EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Add to Flipboard Magazine. It is evident that the relationship between Spotify and Apple has become more strained since the launch of the latter’s music streaming service, Apple Music. Spotify – the current leader of the music streaming space – went as far as accusing the tech giant of anti-competitive behavior, claiming that it favors its own product at the expense of third-party rival offerings’ disadvantage. Now, it seems Spotify faces further trouble at the hands of Apple when it comes to signing deals with music labels and artists. As Spotify gears up for a possible initial public offering (IPO) next year, it lacks a major ingredient in its pitch to investors. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the music streaming service is struggling to secure the proprietors’ licensing for their content. The publication learned from its sources that the company is having some trouble obtaining rights for the music that its users would want to play in the future. Currently, Spotify is surviving on short extensions of its previous contracts with the three major music companies in the US. Spotify’s contract with Universal Music Group ended over a year ago, agreement with Warner Music Group earlier this year, and the deal with Sony Music a few months ago. However, this hasn’t had any major impact on the end user as of yet. Spotify still streams content from these three labels based on month-to-month contracts and they will probably not pull their content out of the service suddenly. What’s noteworthy here is the growing uncertainty of Spotify’s relationship with these labels. The company is now focused on negotiating new contracts with music labels that would make its business more appealing to investors. While Spotify is the biggest player in the game, it is not necessarily minting money. The company saw an increase in its net loss last year to nearly $200 million although revenue doubled to over $2 billion. Due to lack of income, Spotify wants to pay record labels and musicians a lower percentage of its revenues that it currently does – nearly 55%. It also pays 15% to songwriters and music publishers. However, according to people familiar with the matter, top-level music label execs want the company to pay 58% of its revenue generated from both the subscription-based paid tier and the ad-supported free tier. Apparently, that is the percentage that deep pocketed Apple pays for subscribers that are no longer on the free trial period; currently Apple Music reportedly has five million users in their free trial period. Meanwhile, executives believe that Spotify should toss in more money than it did five years ago. Other music label execs might let the company pay less only if it grants additional rights. The music streaming service currently has over 30 million paying subscribers with 70 million free users; some executives want only the paying customers to have access to certain content. Some want the company to put a cap on free usage in hopes to boost growth in paid subscriptions. If you think the music industry is giving Spotify enough tough time, its investors aren’t cutting it any slack either. The company is under growing pressure from investors to go public amid the clauses of its latest financing round; a group including hedge fund Dragoneer Investment Group, private equity firm TPG, and Goldman Sachs issued $1 billion investment as convertible debt. The debt is accompanied by an interest rate that would only increase the longer Spotify prolongs going public. Investors can avail 20% discount on the stock if they choose to convert debt into equity; the discount is set to increase the longer Spotify delays the IPO. Spotify should have spotted – all pun implied – the uncertainty of its relationship with the music industry when artists like Taylor Swift, Gwen Stefani, and Adele decided to part ways in the past. It has been struggling to land music from some of the most popular artists in the US for some time now. It took Coldplay’s “A Head Full of Dreams” single seven days to appear on the music streaming service following the release. Similarly, it took Adele’s “25” 217 days while fans still wait for Taylor Swift’s “1989” and Beyoncé’s “Lemonade.” Licensing disagreements fuel the shaky relationship between Spotify and the big music labels, which obtained minority stakes as part of initial licensing contracts. The music labels and investors have a common goal – to see Spotify succeed. Paid services bring in substantially more money per user than the ad-supported ones; something that Apple figured out before it even entered the space. In its relatively young age, Apple Music has already secured 15 million paying subscribers while Spotify’s subscription growth is slowing down. Labels and musicians have criticized the service for making its massive 40 million track catalog available to both paid and free users. Spotify has tested out several acts to please the labels such as releasing music on only the paid tier for short timespans but did not adopt such practices amid fears of alienating users who may turn to YouTube in search of user-uploaded unsanctioned versions of new songs. Some labels would like Spotify to set time limits for free music listening since many have grown accustomed to the ad-supported tier. Cowen & Co., a financial research services firm, claims that most free listeners start subscribing within the first six months. However, if Spotify doesn’t want to sabotage its free listening experience, it could devise other ways to make money. Since its launch in the US in 2011, it has been offering subscriptions at a flat $10 rate; raising this price would make sense but may even seem bizarre to pay say $15 for Spotify than $10 for the premium branded Apple service. Spotify appears to be stuck in a bit of a pickle while Apple Music crosses benchmarks in its userbase regularly. The latter had 15 million paid subscribers up till this summer. At the given rate, Apple Music will approach Spotify’s paid subscription numbers in a year tops. Meanwhile, the iPhone-maker is inking deals with some of the most popular artists and music labels for exclusive rights; such the case with Drake’s latest album as well as the upcoming Britney Spears “Glory” and Frank Ocean albums.

By Adrian Stevens  | Aug 24, 2016 5:15 pm EST Amazon’s music streaming Amazon.com (AMZN) is preparing to launch a cheaper music streaming service for its Echo speakers, Recode has reported. Citing industry sources, the report stated that the subscription cost would be somewhere around $4 or $5 per month, which is about half the price of what Apple (AAPL) Music and Spotify charge. However, Amazon’s cheaper service will only be available on its Echo smart speakers, while Apple Music and Spotify function on a variety of devices. Amazon currently offers music services to its Prime members, but the service has limited music. Meanwhile, it has been working on another subscription service that would work on multiple devices for about $10 a month. The company is expected to launch both these services in September. Increased investments in the UK Amazon is increasing its investment in the UK (EWU) as the company is planning to open a new distribution center in Tilbury, England. The move is likely to create about 1,500 new jobs in 2017. This news came after the company announced a new fulfillment center in Doncaster, England, which is expected to create about 500 new jobs. These new distribution centers should support the expanded operations of the company. Earlier, Amazon expanded its fresh food delivery service in the UK because the adoption rate for fresh online groceries is rising. Amazon’s quick delivery, low prices, and enhanced offerings should also position it to garner a greater market share in the UK. Now let’s look at Amazon’s analyst recommendations.

Android 7 Nougat: See How Each OS Stacks Up Against The Other, Galaxy 7 Vs. iPhone 7 Comparison Kevin Carneglia iPhones and Androids seem to be locked in a never-ending battle of “anything you can do, I can do better.” Though Android is several years behind Apple in actual age, both companies’ operating systems (iOS 10 and Android Nougat) for mobile are relatively similar. However, Android has a reputation for allowing more flexibility inside its OS, while Apple is your best bet if you want a phone that’s reliable and secure. With that in mind, here’s how Android Nougat and Apple’s iOS 10 compare to one another. Multi-tasking As Business Insider will tell you, Android 7 (or Android N) lets you switch between your two most recent apps by double-tapping the recent apps button. Apple introduced multi-tasking to its iPad Pro models this year, but iPad Pros on iOS 10 aren’t necessarily as powerful at multitasking as their Droid counterparts. If you want shortcuts galore, Android N’s power flexibility is the way to go. Notifications The Verge mentions that notifications also gain more power thanks to Android Nougat. When you get a message of any kind, you’ll now be able to pull down on the bubble to write back without having to enter an app. Again, it’s Android’s openness and flexibility that allows for this. iOS 10 shows no signs of allowing users to quick reply without having to first open an app. Sorry, Siri.

This could possibly be done as an extension of the current system in place on Android and iOS, which hyperlinks, event dates, and times, and lets you add them to your calendar with a single tap. NEW VIDEO – iPhone 6s or Galaxy S7? – https://t.co/lzE1YRld9t RT! pic.twitter.com/8mvaPbvM8Z — Lewis (@UnboxTherapy) August 23, 2016 Battery Life Users of both companies have long been concerned about better battery life on their Android or Apple devices, and it seems Google and Apple are hearing those concerns. Nougat has a feature called Doze that will automatically put your phone into low-power mode if it senses it’s in your pocket, according to USA Today. Likewise, iPhones have had decent battery life for some time now, and Apple introduced a new option to turn off motion parallax in iOS 7. This option disables animations when moving between screens, possibly one of the most draining features. Yeezus approves this message. [Image Via Giphy.com] To Float Or Not To Float Make Use Of noted that Galaxy S7 devices possess the Floating Window feature. This shiny-but-useful improvement is like having Picture-In-Picture on your phone, letting one app “float” above all others. It can be useful if, for instance, you need to run numbers from a website while using your calculator and don’t want to look back and forth. iPhone 7’s do not currently possess any form of multi-tasking, but it’s possible we could see them in future models. A woman holds an iPhone 6S and uses the Instagram app. [Image Via Jirapong Manustrong/Shutterstock.com] Need A Lyft? Ask Siri! Despite not having multi-tasking, iOS 10 levels the playing field in other categories. Possibly anticipating Google’s book-a-reservation-from-your-messaging app, Apple has made Siri play nice with a number of apps. For instance, you can ask Siri to “get me a Lyft” when you need a ride or send money to someone using the SquareSpace app. No more worrying about forgetting your wallet! You can accomplish similar things through Apple’s Maps application as well. Tapping on a restaurant will open the option to book a reservation with OpenTable, for example. Google’s Answer To Siri By comparison, Google Now can book reservations and other similar appointments using the power of apps. This has been in place through many versions of Android, but keeps improving with each new generation. Google suggests apps depending on what you’re looking for and can even get a sense of what that is using just keywords. As an illustration, if you ask it for “best way to manage my music collection,” the mobile assistant might suggest Google Play and Amazon Music, and then give you direct links to download said applications.

In a test done by Phone Arena, phones were assigned “points” to measure their fastness. The Galaxy S7 accumulated 145,143 points to the iPhone 6S Plus’ 58,664. Given that rumors are suggesting the iPhone 7 won’t be much faster than its predecessors, it’s safe to assume the Galaxy wins out for speed. However, the iPhone 7 is also said to be using a new processor, so only time can say for sure. [Photo by Ilya S.

(AAPL): Despite No Significant YTD Gains Stock Remains Top Pick, Here's Why Apple stock has underperformed S&P 500 Index YTD, despite this the stock remains a hot buy Published By: Ken Bock on August 25, 2016 11:14 am EST Facebook Google+ Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon AAPL Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed at $108.30 yesterday, down about a meager 0.75% in comparison to the previous day’s close. The stock has managed to hike around 2.63% since the start of this year through yesterday, but still underperforms the broader S&P 500 Index’s gain of 6.45% during the same time frame. The stock has a total market capitalization of around $583.94 billion and around 32.44 million shares of Apple exchange hands on a daily basis. Apple stock trades between the 52-week range of $89.47 and $123.82, and a daily range of $108.68 and $108.75. Apple’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Tim Cook, yesterday celebrated his five years at the company after succeeding the iconic Steve Jobs. During his five years at the company, Apple witnessed immense expansion, so much so that the tech titan also added several products to its portfolio. Under Mr. Cook’s five year reign so far, the stock has surged 114.08%, substantially outperforming the 85% surge in S&P 500 Index over the same time span. Apple is a stock which is usually receiving coverage by Wall Street analysts. Several analysts believe the growth of its flagship product, the iPhone is “inevitable”, while some believe that although the company has grown leaps and bounds under Mr. Cook, the growth rate has now slowed down.

All rights reserved Contact About iPhone 8 may scrap the Home button Computers Chromebooks Laptops Ultrabooks Smartphones Android Phones iPhone Tablets Android Tablets iPad Windows Tablets Trending: Macbook Pro (2016) iPhone 7 Plus iPhone 7 Dell XPS 15 Macbook 12 Dell XPS 13 Smartphones iPhone 8 may scrap the Home button by Jonathan FeistAugust 25, 20160 comments For many, Apple products have exemplified that less is more, and rumor has it that Apple is taking that to the next level when they release the 2017 version of their iPhone. With full expectation of the removal of the headphone jack this year, Apple may be removing the very familiar round Home button next year. As always, rumors are sometimes not to be trusted, and that may be extra true of this little tidbit, landing almost 13 months ahead of the expected product in question. So what are we looking at then? If you’ve made it this far into a tech enthusiast website, I’m sure you’ve seen the rather iconic Apple Home button in one of its forms. You may remember the early days when it was a circle with a small square icon in the middle, or the later, fingerprint-scanner equipped, plain circle. The design was simple, the otherwise unmarred front glass of your Apple device had a circle cut out, a small metal ring installed on that inner edge and a second small piece of matching glass was affixed to a button to fill the hole. Perhaps that’s just too much work, or there is a superior option in the works, either way, you can expect no further cuts to the glass, just one clean sheet on the front of your iPhone, and probably iPad as well. If I may purely speculate, there is plenty of technology available to embed the same functions into a sensor underneath the glass of your display, this button served as little more than tactile feedback and aesthetics. Having said that, and having used other devices that hide said buttons under clear glass, I do not applaud this decision. I find that without at least a dimple to allow blind usage of the buttons, they are clumsy and annoying to use. On the other hand, perhaps Apple has something else in mind. Related reading: iPhone 7 rumor roundup Final food for thought, it is rumored that Apple is adding extra functionality into the Home button of the iPhone that is expected this year. I find it just a little odd that the next move would be to scrap the button, but as I say, we’ve got over a year until this phone becomes a reality, we’ll see what happens between then and now. Curves One last thing, we’re already seeing rumor that there will also be a curved iPhone option in 2017. Apparently this will be a curve not like that of the LG G Flex, rather like that on the newer Samsung flagship phones. What do you think, is this a legit sounding rumor? More importantly, what do you hope to see in place of a Home button on your next iPhone? iPhoneNews Apple, ipad, iPhone, IT, Samsung Apple, ipad, iPhone, IT, Samsung  Bloomberg  Verge You may also like MORE   How to reset iPad – erase all d...4 hours ago   Apple’s latest product will be ...16 hours ago   Nintendo’s Super Mario Run laun...21 hours ago   Best Apple TV accessories – rem...22 hours ago   Apple patents earbuds with biometric ...23 hours ago   How to backup iPhone on iTunes1 day ago Load Comments Giveaway   Apple iPhone 7 international giveaway – TabTimes Monthly November 2016 Reviews   Dell XPS 15 2016 review – watch out Apple!   iPad Pro 9.7 review – the best iPad to date?   Razer Blade Stealth review   Huawei MateBook review – a sleek tablet, but a mediocre ultrabook   Surface Pro 4 vs Surface Pro 3 – two generations of power View All The Best   Best Apple TV accessories – remotes & more!22 hours ago   Best WiFi router to keep you connected!2 days ago   Best iPhone 7 slim cases – where style meets substance3 days ago   Best Shopping Apps for iPad – get ready for Black Friday!4 days ago   Best Windows tablets5 days ago View All Stay connected © 2016.

PC-Tablet Videos Tech Apps Telecom Science Business Social Auto Reviews How-To’s Featured iPhone 7 in pictures: Everything you need to know about the upcoming iPhone By Anand Narayanaswamy - 25/08/2016 Apple iPhone 7 is expected to release on September 7. According to rumors, the iPhone 7 will be equipped with a 4.7-inch IPS LED display and the Plus variant will flaunt a 5.5-inch display. As reported previously, Apple has shelved the release of Pro variant to next year to celebrate the 10th anniversary of iPhone in a grand style. The upcoming iPhone 7 will be available in 32GB default storage instead of 16GB. Moreover, Apple is expected to ditch the traditional 3.5mm headphone port to accommodate lightning port connector. You can also expect improvements to the camera including the addition of OIS. The iPhone 7 Plus will most probably offer a dual-camera lens with a slight bump. The new iPhone 7 will be infused with iOS 10, which was introduced in the recently held WWDC 2016. Apple iPhone 7 will ship with A10 processor, which will be faster than the currently available A9 processor. Moreover, the amount of heating will be less. iPhone 7 Plus will be equipped with a dual-camera mechanism, which will have the ability to capture excellent pictures. Apple iPhone 7 will be relatively thinner when compared to the currently available models. It will measure 6.0 to 6.5mm thickness. There are rumors that Apple will migrate to ceramic material instead of metal. Apple iPhone Plus 7 will have a slight camera bump. Moreover, you can expect 3GB RAM instead of 2GB based on the latest technological trends. Apple iPhone 7 will eliminate the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack to accommodate lightning port connector. A pair of fully functional lightning EarPods was leaked on the web. Recently, an image reportedly with the alleged mute button in black color has surfaced on the web. This hints at a possibility of a iPhone 7 in Space Black color or a darker shade of Space Gray. There are reports that the home button on the iPhone 7 won’t physically click when pressed. The home button will simulate a click with vibration. The rear of both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus with protruding camera bumps and dual-lens camera revealed. Apple iPhone 7 front display with a physical home button without cutout revealed. We expect the possibility of force touch-like technology paired with a Touch ID fingerprint sensor.

The cases will be light weight. Apple is expected to start pre-orders after two days of official launch. Hence, you will be able to place orders from September 9. However, orders will be shipped only from September 16. To attract customers, Apple will most likely bundle free Bluetooth headphones with the product package.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile The Definitive Roundup – iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus Specifications, Design & Features Summarized By Ramish Zafar Posted Sep 7, 2016 29Shares Share Tweet Submit The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus will be with us in less than a month. The pair have surfaced regularly on the rumor mill over the course of this year. While no major changes are expected in terms of design, Apple should nevertheless introduce some upgrades to differentiate this year’s devices from last year’s pair. iPhone sales have seen their first slump in years after all, and Cupertino’s hard pressed to reverse this trend. The amount of leaks and rumors which have surfaced so far can very rightly be said to be countless. If you’ve been following us regularly for the past couple of months, we’ve covered quite a bit about the upcoming devices. This covers leaks related to specifications, to blueprints and alleged image leaks. Given that the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus are expected to be launched next month, it’s time to do a complete roundup of everything that’s surfaced so far. If you’re looking for an iPhone upgrade this year, head over below to find out more on what to expect this year. The Definitive iPhone 7 Rumor Roundup; Design, Blueprints, Specifications And More Apple’s approach on this year’s iPhones will be different from last year’s pair. In 2015, it was all about upgraded materials, camera specifications and 3D Touch. This year, we’re expecting a more subtle approach. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have seen very diverse rumors so far. For starters, we’ve been hearing more about new color options for the pair. These include new variants such as Space Black and Deep Blue, which should breathe new life in the lineup. In terms of hardware, little information has surfaced on Apple plans for the A10. Given that 10nm isn’t expected to reach complete maturity until next year, the A10 is expected to come with 14nm FinFET on board. We’re also expecting the devices to be slightly thicker than last year’s pair. Starting from that, take a look below at some alleged blueprints of the devices which surfaced earlier. We’ll progress gradually from blueprints, to design to performance and finally to miscellaneous. Dimensions: The images which you can see above represent almost every design detail that’s leaked on the iPhone 7 so far. In terms of dimensions, the pair are expected to be slightly thicker, with the iPhone 7 rumored with a width of 0.34 inches. In addition, the smaller variant of the device is also expected to feature a larger rear camera sensor. This will fall neatly in line with Apple’s policy of almost regularly updating the lineup’s camera specifications. All done with dimensions, let’s move over to the design of this year’s devices. Apple’s expected to continue with the spaceship approach of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s lineups. This has rightly led some quarters to comment that the iPhone 7 will in essence be the last of the theme introduced with the iPhone 6. Before you get too disappointed however, there will be some changes this year. The most definitive of these in terms of aesthetics will be redesigned antenna bands. Design: Rather than the antenna bands for the iPhone going around the back, this time we’ll see a different approach. According to leaks so far, the pair will come with antennas going around the top and bottom. In addition to this, the second change this year will be the removal of the 3.5mm earphone jack. This will create a more simpler bottom for the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. Still, we’re not sure how Apple intends to sort out earphone connectivity this time around. Some sources claim that we’ll get to see a lightning to 3.5mm dongle being provided with the iPhones. Others claim bluetooth earphones for the pair. It’s a bit unclear at the moment as to what approach Apple will actually take. However, disappointingly, the space freed up by the removal of the earphone jack won’t be supplemented with extra speakers. Rather, according to sources, we should see the microphone being adjusted here. Hardware: Coupled with design, we’ve also been seeing several hardware related leaks take place over the past couple of months. These range from the motherboard of the devices to its display panel surfacing in alleged images. The pictures of the device’s logic board show little differences. The few images that have leaked so far don’t contain any components. Therefore, hardware changes under the hood are difficult to predict at the moment. Nevertheless, if you take a look at the third image above, you’ll see that we just might be looking at an Intel LTE modem on the device. Santa Clara’s rumored to make a presence on the devices this year as well, so it’s possible that you’re looking at the real deal right here. Images of the display panels of the devices are slightly more interesting. Taking a look at them above, you’ll see that the home button appears to be slightly changed this year. It’s hidden under the flex cable for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Whether we’ll get a Touch sensitive capacitive home button this year is unclear – Apple will have to make quite a bit of adjustments if this does turn out to be the case indeed. Resolutions for the device are unknown as well, though the rumor mill claims that the 4.7 and 5.5 inch devices will get 1080p and 2K displays. Apple loves its optimum 326ppi though, so we’re not sure whether this will materialize. Advertisement Camera: The camera for the iPhones this year should once again be the one to come with the lion’s share of changes. The smaller iPhone 7 will get OIS and a larger camera sensor, as you can see in the images above. While we know the benefits of OIS, it’s not clear how the larger sensor will affect photography. It’s most likely to improve low light scenarios, especially as Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge improved in this area significantly. The larger iPhone 7 Plus on the other hand might feature the lineup’s most significant camera upgrade so far. Rumors for the device’s camera have revolved around a dual camera setup for quite a while. Image, component and render leaks have further boosted these claims. Information so far suggests a dual camera for the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple appears to finally be following in the footsteps of Android once again. While Cupertino’s been as stubborn as ever for display resolution, the dual camera just might actually materialize this year. As far as technical specifications for resolution go, we’ve got no concrete information at the moment. Miscellaneous: Finally, let’s move towards the ‘other’ rumors for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Interestingly, these are the ones that sound quite promising for the devices. For starters, Apple’s rumored to finally do away with 16GB as base storage for the pair. This should entice a lot of users to upgrade, especially if the second rumor of a $100 price decrease for the pair also turns out to be true. Coupled with this, there’s also been talk of 256GB storage for the iPhone 7 Plus. Space Black, Deep Blue and 32GB as starting storage with a $100 price decrease. These just might be Apple’s taglines for the 2016 iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. What defining change this year’s pair will see? We’re not sure right now. The removal of the 3.5mm earphone jack and a dual camera seem to be ‘it’ at the moment. Of course, before you proceed towards lambasting us in the comments section below, keep one thing in mind. All of this information is preliminary in nature. Treat it with a grain or a bag of salt; depending on your preference. The rumor mill has been accurate previously as well, so we’d recommend a grain.

Controversial move by UMG may reshape the music industry LF By Laurie Fullerton-25 August 2016 15:32pm The fragmentation of the music industry has been ongoing for 16 years since the advent of iTunes and record labels have seen 60 per cent of its revenue evaporate since that time. However, a new threat to musical artists and the music industry has just emerged according to Bob Lefsetz (via HighSnobiety), who runs an influential music industry newsletter. The report that Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Music Group, sent a statement - in the wake of Frank Ocean’s Apple Music exclusive Blonde - saying UMG's is banning the practice of exclusive streaming. indie music photo UMG is the former label of musician Frank Ocean who took his sound and his brand and broke away from his label recently. The move by UMG is a way to protect the music or musicians they have invested heavily in. The ban on exclusive streaming behind an Apple Music paywall means that music fans may no longer have quick access to Frank Ocean or their favorite or emerging artists. Additionally, for the unknown musicians releasing their first record, the move by UMG implies that it is less likely a consumer will pay for music without hearing it first and this move might squeeze new artists out of the industry entirely if record labels follow UMG's lead. Music is at risk of becoming the domain of manufactured pop stars and studo-backed youngsters and money makers, Lefsetz suggests. "It is not hard to believe this is happening when Jimmy Iovine at Apple Music used to be a label executive, when Apple used to have monopolies via breakthrough products," Lefsetz writes "Apple Music is a me-too product that works badly that’s locked behind a paywall and the music industry wants it to be the dominant platform so the fan is squeezed and indie acts are pushed down to the bottom." UMG's move is to try and hold back the tide and protect the record labels. In other words, while A-list artists bring in a large chunk of revenue for the labels, it also allows labels to lock up younger artists who probably won’t move records on their first release with advances that they otherwise couldn’t afford. Because the music industry cannot afford to have their superstar artists leave the label system altogether for streaming services, UMG may be trying to prevent a power shift. The shift would be a move that the industry hasn’t experienced since iTunes hit the scene in 2003, Lefsetz suggests. For streaming services, nothing changes. This is no different for them than doing a standard exclusive when the label is involved, although it’s probably easier to negotiate with a single artist compared to an entire company. The modern exclusive deal for an album release has allowed the artist to get paid an upfront sum from the streaming service — money from Apple, an ownership cut from Tidal — while the label gets no direct financial benefit from the deal. UMG is the umbrella company to nearly 80 record labels including Interscope, Capitol and Def Jam, along with artist-ran minor labels like Kanye West’s GOOD Music, Cash Money, Dr. Dre’s Aftermath, Eminem’s Shady and J. Cole’s Dreamville, streaming their music may slow to a trickle. To put this into perspective, the site reports that all five of this year’s album of the year Grammy nominees: Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, Chris Stapleton and Alabama Shakes, would have been affected under the change. It remains to be seen whether other labels follow suit.

Stream it below, then scroll onward to find out where you can experience the visual album Endless. Original story (8/25): Frank Ocean's Blonde and Endless, the near-simultaneous follow-ups to 2012's Channel Orange, came in an all-time off-the-wall album delivery times two. Since the big Frocean weekend, the places to stream Blonde and Endless have been proliferating in interesting, curious ways. After its Thursday night supposed-to-be-exclusive surprise premiere on Apple Music, Frank's visual album Endless was streaming pretty openly on Vimeo. Those multiple copies seem to have been mostly or completely pulled after copyright complaints. At least a couple hip-hop sites still have Endless video bootlegs streaming, though. More:The 44 Best Lyrics on Frank Ocean's 'Blonde' & 'Endless' The "official" way to watch Endless, of course, is on Apple Music. You can't buy Endless there, or anywhere yet, despite music videos like "Pyramids," "Novacane" and "Swim Good" being available in the iTunes Store for $1.99. There's also no aboveboard way to listen to the Endless audio as a regular, track-by-track album so far. Googling "download frank ocean endless audio" yields pretty immediate piratical results. It's also, as with all things great and small, on torrent sites. How can you listen to Blonde? Pretty easily, at this point. Its Apple Music exclusivity is officially over, with Pitchfork noticing that Frank's new album is now on Pandora. It's still on Apple Music, and iTunes for $9.99. More:The 15 Wildest Album Unveilings: Frank Ocean, Taylor Swift & More Blonde is on Soundcloud via a variety of accounts; many songs have tens of thousands of streams, some climbing close to 100,000 at this time. The site Digital Music News has been on to some stuff, though. On Sunday, they found the album available to download via a public Google Drive upload (boosted on "a heavily trafficked Reddit thread"); it stayed there at least two days. On Tuesday they ran a similar story, about Blonde being available on a public Dropbox for multiple days. Today they're noting that it's been uploaded a number of times to YouTube. It's fair to expect Blonde to stream at places like Spotify and Tidal soon; The Fader did find out on Tuesday that the album is an independent release, with Endless completing Frank Ocean's Def Jam contract. And artists typically, y'know, like as many people listening to their music as possible. Especially when that music is Blonde, and Endless.

This follows a  company-wide email by the Chairman and CEO  Lucian Grainage, informing of the discontinuation of exclusive releases of artists' music to streaming services owing to the intense competition observed between the streaming sites such as Apple Music and Tidal. It however remains to be confirmed if the CEO's action is connected with the exclusive release of "Blonde" on Apple Music. play Frank Ocean (Getty images)   Online pop-culture website, The Fader reported on Tuesday, August 23, 2016, that Frank Ocean ended his contract with Def Jam/Universal Music with the   release of the visual  album " Endless" exclusively to streaming service Apple Music, which marked Universal's last streaming release exclusive. Fader also reported on same Tuesday August 23, 2016  that Frank Ocean released the "Blonde" album under his purported independent label Boys Don't Cry. play Frank Ocean (Getty Images)   While full credits for "Blonde" have not been released yet, iTunes and Apple Music both attribute the album's copyright to Boys Don't Cry, which is possibly Frank's newly formed independent entity or maybe just a placeholder. play frank-ocean-blonde-album (Boys Don't Cry)   The grounds on which Def Jam/Universal Music may also sue is if a minimum-delivery contract clause required Frank to deliver both albums within a set time frame and according to a label-determined quality. Many recording contracts also specify a window of time during which artists cannot release music on another label. The singer's "Blonde" is being projected to chart at number one on the Billboard 200 with an estimated sale of 250,000 to 300,000 equivalent album units.

Edition: Global | اردو | 中文 | ⌛ Pakistan World Business Lifestyle Sports Technology Viral Top Lists Campus Life Advice Opinion Skip to content 🔔 Subscribe ☰ Sections Pakistan World Business Lifestyle Sports Technology Viral Top Lists Campus Life Advice Opinion Apple iPhone 7: Let the Guessing Game Begin Technology by Web Desk | Published on August 24, 2016 (Edited August 25, 2016) 🔗 We all have seen the famous meme where Apple is seen being chipped off and Samsung logo taking birth. Well other than the logo taking birth the meme actually reflects the fan following and the customer base both the giant have enjoyed. Apple till today is considered a pioneer of smartphone and its brand iPhone keeps on growing. From the very beginning of iPhone all up till now, Apple hasn’t really been disturbed by any of its contemporary from BlackBerry to Samsung and from Motorola to HTC. From specifications to price factor and from appearance to innovation all has been summed by Apple meticulously. Apple iPhone 7 Price The expected arrival of iPhone 7, the latest of Apple invention, is rumored to be around September this year, and along all the other speculations, the Apple iPhone 7 price is alongside being discussed. We are yet to hear a formal word from Apple itself, one that will for sure trigger pre-order trial, but for now it is just iPhone 7 rumors that are satisfying the appetite of the loyal customers. People are still guessing what Apple is going to charge for all the new iPhone 7 features and the all stunning iPhone 7 specifications. One thing for sure, whatever it turns out to be the loyal ones are going to have it as they cannot resist. Apple iPhone 7 Price in Pakistan Just like any other country on the planet Earth, Apple has a huge fan following in Pakistan, where people are crazy about its gadgets. Any of the Apple products, be it the phones, computers, tablets, or even the Apple watches, are all welcomed by tech geeks, who look to both praises and criticize the products. For now, the iPhone related rumors are about the Apple iPhone 7 Price in Pakistan based on the previous iPhone 7 rumors. The Apple iPhone 7 price in Pakistan will perhaps decide upon its success. Unlike its predecessors, this time, the Apple iPhone price may just cross the 6 figure mark. iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S both were initially sold for PKR 70,000 and PKR 80,000 and hence a safe speculation for now, based on the all the amazing iPhone 7 specs we are hearing about is being made around PKR 100,000, a definitely huge one for people down here. We bring you both the previous reviews of the famous Apple iPhone 7 and then will delve into the expected Apple iPhone 7 specs. Apple iPhone 7 Reviews We don’t know if the word “review” is even the right one to use hear for now. Till the time you don’t get hold of the real thing, you cannot really review it for sure. In our case, and for this particular section, we have some of the user feedback based on leaked specifications and photos. For now, people are expecting a more of a sophisticated phone that may require a more fragile handling based on the change of design. Some of the leaked images that the side buttons (volume and camera) will become part of the display, unlike the previous design where they were separate. This can be believed to some extent as the critiques believe this as a competition to Samsung and LG, who are now bringing curved and stretched screens. Another of the iPhone 7 review rather speculation that is making rounds is the one relating to multiple model launch. Now this is going to be a first timer in the history of Apple launches, as normally the communication giant has a simple strategy of launching new, single model in September 2016 (as expected). But this time, if the rumors are to be believed, Apple is changing its game. Not only will we get to see a new Apple iPhone 7, but if the rumors are to be believed we might see an enhanced version of iPhone 6 with advance features. Obviously, Apple will be differentiating finely between its enhanced features and iPhone 7 specifications and features. This will for sure affect iPhone 7 price as if a newer iPhone 6 is launched it will affect the price of the new iPhone 7, that will be rise substantially. This can become a source of worry for the users here in Pakistan, who are praying that iPhone 7 price in Pakistan to remain in 5 figures. With already a 6 figure rumor, one can only hope for good. Let us take a quick look at what we are getting in iPhone 7. iPhone 7 Specifications & Features All New Camera: Well among all the rumors and leaks that are going on, and after the launch of its new Prisma application, one can hope for a next generation camera hardware in the new iPhone 7. If the leaks and expectations are to be believed we are in for a separate circular camera opening. One can also expect a transparent casing along with 3D incorporation. So if the speculated iPhone 7 features are to come true we are for sure in for some lifetime snapping experience. Waterproof iPhone: Yes the dream may just become a reality. Some reports are also suggesting that the new iPhone 7 features will include, waterproof resistance. So, the next time you are planning to jump into a pool, or will forget to take your phone out of your pocket before drying. Worry not. Apple has got you covered now. According to some reports, the phone will have a new compound material that repels water. This means that there will be additional strips of plastic that will be included in the phone design. Display Screen: Apple is all set to revolutionize the IPhone brand. It is being rumored that the new Apple iPhone 7 feature will have a next generation display screen support. It is not going to be the typical LED screen that you will find in your iPhone 7. The phone is expected to have an advance OLED screen, a relatively new technology. For now this all that we have for you. The new phone, iPhone 7 will be making its appearance in September. One can only hope and expect that these features come true, because if they do, the product for sure will be one remarkable one. So, what are you waiting for? Start filling in your bank accounts and your piggy banks as the iPhone 7 price will be no easy thing. Till then we wish you all the best of luck and an amazing IPhone experience.

Computers Chromebooks Laptops Ultrabooks Smartphones Android Phones iPhone Tablets Android Tablets iPad Windows Tablets © 2016. TabTimes.com. All rights reserved Contact About iPhone 7 and 7 Plus: Everything you need to know Computers Chromebooks Laptops Ultrabooks Smartphones Android Phones iPhone Tablets Android Tablets iPad Windows Tablets Trending: Macbook Pro (2016) iPhone 7 Plus iPhone 7 Dell XPS 15 Macbook 12 Dell XPS 13 Smartphones iPhone 7 and 7 Plus: Everything you need to know by Kris CarlonSeptember 7, 20165 comments What happens on Twitter stays on Twitter – even when it’s an accidental tweet announcing the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus before Tim Cook has had the honors. Despite that little hiccup, the new iPhones have been officially announced and while the most exciting new iPhone 7 feature is water-resistance, better battery life, a new chip and stereo speakers are also right up there. iPhone 7 & 7 Plus Price and release date The iPhone 7 release date is September 16 with pre-orders as of September 9. The iPhone 7 price starts at $649 for the 32 GB version (with options up to 256 GB) and the iPhone 7 Plus price starts at $769 for the 32 GB version (again, with models up to 256 GB). Don’t miss: iPhone 7 and 7 Plus drop test: will they survive? To put that in perspective, those are the same price points as the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, except you get double the internal storage for the same price. Because that means no one would probably bother with the iPhone 6s or 6s Plus any more, Apple is also upping the storage on last year’s models. The brand-new Jet Black iPhone 7 only comes in 128 GB and 256 GB options, making it the new “must-have”. iPhone 7 & 7 Plus Design If you’ve seen any of the iPhone 7 leaks you’ll know not much has changed in terms of design, but those familiar antenna bands have now migrated to the edges of the device rather than the back. The enclosure creates the housing for the camera bump because it is all crafted from the same bit of aluminum. The removal of the 3.5 mm port means there’s now a second speaker grill (that hides a microphone, not a speaker) on the bottom edge. There are two new iPhone 7 colors: Jet Black and regular Black. Jet Black is the “piano black” you might have heard about and it is glossy and sexy as all get out. Black is more of a matte black but will definitely appeal to those that aren’t into building their fingerprint collection. You’ve also still got options for Gold, Silver and Rose Gold. iPhone 7 & 7 Plus Home button The home button has been re-engineered from the ground up on the iPhone 7. The iPhone 7’s solid state home button is now Force Touch sensitive and works together with Apple’s Taptic Engine to be more responsive to a wider range of frequencies. According to Cook, it provides an “incredible new feel”. What’s more, the new home button is used throughout iOS, providing unique feedback for messages, notifications, ringtones and navigation. It actually sounds pretty cool, meaning you’ll know by touch alone what is going on with your iPhone 7. IP67 water resistant For the first time, Apple has released a water-resistant iPhone. With an IP67 certification, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are protected against harmful dust particles as well as immersion in up to one meter of water for up to half an hour. In our iPhone 7 water test we found the phone to handle that with ease as well as a swim in the ocean (which we don’t advise because salt water is bad for phones). iPhone 7 & 7 Plus Camera Apple introduced all-new cameras on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. They feature optical image stabilization (on both the iPhone 7 as well as the 7 Plus), meaning they can comfortably handle up to three times longer exposures. The 28 mm f/1.8 aperture six-element lens and faster sensor lets in 50% more light too. The new 12 MP sensor is 60% faster and 30% more energy efficient than the iPhone 6s and the True-Tone flash now has four LEDs and a Flicker Sensor that reads the flickering of artificial lighting for even better exposures. The iPhone 7s gets a new image signal processor that has twice the throughput of previous versions. It uses machine learning to set exposure, focus and color balance, all in 25 milliseconds. I don’t care what anyone says, this new iPhone 7 camera is going to be good. If you opt for the larger-screened iPhone 7 Plus, you’ll even get a second 56 mm f/2.8 12 MP camera on the back: a regular lens (the same as the iPhone 7) and a second zoom lens. The two lenses not only allow you to switch between regular and zoom photography, they will also work in concert with software to create a depth map of the scene in front of the lenses. This all happens automatically in Portrait mode. Although the new iPhone 7 Plus won’t ship with this new depth-mapping feature, it will be a free update later in the year. What it does is essentially allow the software to analyse the image and create an artificial Bokeh effect by distinguishing between the subject and de-focusing the background. What’s even better is that this all happens in real-time, meaning what you see in the on-screen preview is what you’ll get if you take the photo. If you buy the iPhone 7 Plus, you’ll see a little button in the camera app that says ‘1x’. This means you’re using the regular lens. Tap this to switch to the zoom lens (it will then say ‘2x’) and slide it to go right up to ’10x’ (via software). To recap, the iPhone 7 plus supports up to 2x optical zoom with up to 10x digital zoom. What’s more, the new iPhones have improved low-light performance thanks to the larger aperture, a faster sensor that supports high-speed exposures and you even get OIS when shooting Live Photos, which are now supported by third-party apps. Oh, and RAW file support has finally come to the iPhone (time to buy the high storage capacity version kids…). Both new iPhones come with a f/2.2 7 MP FaceTime camera up front with auto-image stabilization. Improved color capture capabilities guarantee better looking selfies than on any previous iPhone. iPhone 7 & 7 Plus Display The iPhone 7 Retina HD display is, according to Cook, “the best on any smartphone” – although Samsung might argue with that (even if they did make it). It is apparently 25% brighter than the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus and offers a wider color gamut, color management and 3D Touch layer. One app taking advantage of the Retina display and the new iPhone 7 cameras is Instagram, which will have an app update supporting both features later this year. Ian Spalter, Instagram’s head of design, announced that all Instagram photo filters are now going to use the iPhone 7’s full color gamut, so you’ll see more impressive colors from any photos taken on an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus in the near future. iPhone 7 & 7 Plus Audio No surprises here: the 3.5 mm headphone port is a thing of the past on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. According to Jony Ive, Apple “believes in a wireless future”, so the company has decided to help get consumers there a little faster by rendering their old headphones obsolete. But not without a grace period, unlike previous Apple “discards” like optical drives and ethernet ports. The usual semi-convincing argument for ditching the 3.5 analog jack for a fancier new one – in this case, Lightning – was made, but fortunately for those of you not interested in ditching your current headphones, Apple is actually including a free (that’s right, free) adapter for Lightning to 3.5 mm in the iPhone 7 box. You’ll also get an included pair of the new Apple EarPods that have a Lightning connector on the end and you can of course power other devices via that same connection. According to Apple, there are over 900 million Lightning-enabled devices in the world today. Not bad considering Apple has “only” sold a billion iPhones. But if cables aren’t really your thing, Apple’s vision for the wireless future will be available soon too. AirPods are the new truly wireless ear buds for the iPhone 7. They cost $159 and will ship in late October. They’ll get you 5 hours of battery life with a battery charging case that has an additional 24 hours of charge. Pairing them to your iPhone or Apple Watch is as simple as opening the case near your iPhone or Watch and tapping ‘Connect’ when the pairing prompt appears on either device. iCloud syncing means that you only ever need to go through the setup process once to have multiple device compatibility. Infrared sensors detect when the AirPods have been inserted, so they only play when you’re ready to listen. They contain the new Apple W1 chip, as do a variety of new Beats headphones including the Beats Solo3 Wireless with 40 hours of battery life. There’s also the Powerbeats3 Wireless for sportier types and BeatsX for an affordable, light and comfortable “all day” experience. For the first time, stereo speakers have been added to the new iPhones with one above the display and the other on the bottom in its usual position. Apple claims these speakers offer twice the volume of the iPhone 6s speakers as well as increased dynamic range. It will be interesting to see how good the quality is, given the need for water-resistant gaskets in the speaker cavities. iPhone 7 & 7 Plus Performance The new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus both utilize the new 64-bit, quad-core Apple A10 Fusion chip. The A10 chip has two high-performance cores and two energy-sipping cores for less intensive tasks. A new performance controller analyses what you’re doing and manages the CPU output accordingly to optimize energy-saving and performance at all times. The two high-performance cores are 40% faster than the A9 chip in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. They are twice as fast as the A8 chip found in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and 120 times faster than the original iPhone. On the other end of the scale, the two high-efficiency cores use just one-fifth of the power of the high performance cores for even longer battery life. There’s also a new hexa-core GPU chip that’s 50% faster than the A9 and three times faster than the A8. Again, to put it in old-school perspective, the new GPU is 240 times faster than the original iPhone. It uses two-thirds the power compared to the A9 and just half of what the A8 uses. According to Apple, it is “the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone.” iPhone 7 & 7 Plus Battery As always, Apple is keeping tight-lipped about the actual battery capacity of the new iPhone 7, but the company is promising the best battery life of any iPhone ever. On average, you can expect two more hours than the iPhone 6s and one more hour compared to the iPhone 6s Plus. The first teardowns have revealed a 1,960 mAh (7.45 Wh) battery in the iPhone 7 and a 2,900 mAh (11 Wh) cell in the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple is promising 50% longer battery life on the iPhone 7 Plus and both new iPhones have seen a battery increase since last year: the iPhone 7 has a 14.5% bigger battery and the iPhone 7 Plus has a 5.5% larger battery. iPhone 7 & 7 Plus – iPhone Upgrade Program Finally, Apple is expanding the iPhone Upgrade Program to encompass the UK and China later this year, and if you sign up you’ll also get AppleCar+. There is a range of 27/32 month carrier subsidy plans available for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, but you’ll have to check in again for details on those. iOS 10 will be rolling out on September 13.

PREGNANCY BABY TODDLER BIG KID TEEN EDUCATION SPED KIDS WELLNESS FAMILY LIFE CELEBRITY MOMS Daddy iPhone 7 Latest News & Updates: Leaked Photo Reveals Thinner Phone, No Head Phone Jack and Waterproof; Apple Confirms Image? By Rovin Migcy, Parent Herald August 25, 08:00 am TAG iPhone 7, Jimmy Lin, iPad mini, iPhone 6s iPhone 7 is now readily available for viewing thanks to Taiwanese pop star, Jimmy Lin. The actor who mostly have a bad habit of leaking Apple's new products is at it again. Advertisement Apple's plans to release the new iPhone 7 this September is fast approaching and fans are eagerly awaiting what really is in store for the upcoming iPhone. With Jimmy Lin's new post on how the iPhone 7 would look like, it seems that this man is pretty credible when it comes to Apple's new products Lin has been leaking images of himself together with upcoming iPhone products for four years so he is probably giving iPhone 7 fans a great view of what is ahead. In the photo image, Lin is holding a 5.5-inch screen size pink iPhone that has a dual camera. The appearance of the phone coincides to what mostly predicts regarding the new iPhone 7. It is speculated that the upcoming iPhone 7 will have a 5.5 and 4.7-inch displays. While Apple has not confirmed whether Lin's photos are real but as he was also able to provide photos regarding the iPhone 5c, iPad mini tablet and the iPhone 6 from 2012 to 2014, most are assuming that the latest photo of him holding an iPhone 7 is accurate. According to Mac Rumors, the upcoming iPhone 7 will have a modest update, unlike the iPhone 6s. It will have the same general shape as its predecessor and will no longer have antenna bands across the back. When it comes to the front of the iPhone 7, there will be some great changes such a flush pressure-sensitive home button, longer earpiece cutout, and an ambient light sensor and may probably be waterproof. There is also a possibility that the new phone will be thinner by 1mm as it will not be having an earphone jack. However, things are still not concrete until we finally see Tim Cook holding the end product of the iPhone 7. At this time, let us just marvel the first photo of the iPhone 7 and hope that it is really the one. © 2016 ParentHerald.com All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

Latest leak shows the alleged iPhone 6 SE run through Geekbench test with better score than the iPhone 6s. By Ritesh Bendre | Updated: August 25, 2016 5:03 PM IST Email @GadgetFreak4U comments Tags: Apple Apple iPhone 6S Apple iPhone 7 Apple iPhone 7 Plus News After hearing about Apple’s 2016 smartphones, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus for months, there comes a small twist in the tale. Just yesterday, we came across some sketchy photos of what appears to be the leaked packaging and pamphlets of the alleged iPhone 6 SE. Now, while we tried to debunk the myth around iPhone 6 SE yesterday, the alleged smartphone has surfaced once again. Someone from China managed go hands-on with the iPhone 6 SE prototype and also put it through paces on Geekbench. The person has shared a photo on Weibo, revealing some details about Apple’s next smartphone. While the photo itself is a little blurry, it does show the operating system (iOS 10) and model number (iPhone 6 SE). It logged a score of 3,040 in single-core test and 5,210 in multi-core test. According to GSMArena, the iPhone 6s logged a score of 4,427 and 2,542 in single and multi-core tests, respectively. If we have to go by the scores, the alleged iPhone 6 SE clearly beats the iPhone 6s. However, one could easily inflate the score by jailbreaking the iPhone and overclocking the processor clock speed. Regarding the model number and operating system, it remains a mystery for now. The source also mentioned that the iPhone 6 SE sports the same physical home button as the iPhone 6s, and we’re unlikely to see the rumored capacitive touch button with Force Touch feature on 2016 iPhones. That’s not all; the source did confirm the ‘Plus’ variant to come with a dual-camera setup at the back.ALSO READ: Rumor has it: The Apple iPhone 7 will be a massive upgrade over the iPhone 6s While these rumors don’t quite add up, we’re left wondering why Apple would confuse people with its devices portfolio – iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 SE. Though there were rumors earlier this year about the possibility of Apple not launching the iPhone 7 and instead launch the iPhone 6 SE because the new phones don’t have any major design changes. ALSO READ: Apple iPhone 6 SE packaging leaked, but here’s why it makes no sense What exactly Apple has in mind is something that we will only come to know when it launches the new iPhones. Although Apple has not started sending out media invites, the event is rumored to take place on September 7. Pre-orders are expected to kick-off starting September 9, and the sale could begin from September 23. Along with the new iPhones, Apple may also introduce the Apple Watch 2 with slightly better internals and onboard GPS. The MacBook Pro lineup is also rumored to get a massive overhaul, where the function keys are expected to be replaced by an OLED touch panel. Rumors about new iPad Pro with 10.5-inch display have also recently surfaced, but it remains to be seen what all Apple ends up announcing at the event.

Some eager iPhone fans arrived to queue at 4am on Thursday morning to be the first to purchase Apple's new products, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, with iOS 8 featuring 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. (Photo by Cole Bennetts/Getty Images)  ( Cole Bennetts/Getty Images ) With the rumors that the upcoming iPhone 7 will be less appealing, next year's Apple iPhone 8 is reportedly all set to sport many new revolutionary features including an all-glass chassis and curved edged display screen. Advertisement According to a post from the Nikkei Asian Review, the iPhone 8 device is expected to flaunt an all-glass design, reported Huffington Post. Reports claimed that with the glass chassis, the Cupertino-based company is also rumored to integrate the Touch ID sensor into the phone, which will lead to the removal of the physical Home button. Furthermore, there are reports that the iPhone 8 will receive a major upgrade in terms of its display as it is touted to consist of a curved screen with rounded edges, which will be a never-seen-before look for the Apple device. "There will be a 4.7-inch model, another that will be 5.5-inches and a premium handset that will be either 5.5-inches or larger equipped with a screen bent on the two sides," said Nikkei's source familiar with Apple's plans, as reported by Mac World. Advertisement Along with the curved screen, rumors stated that the new iPhone will incorporate the OLED display, which will help the device to consume less power and also provide the users with increased contrast ratios. However, few reports claimed that Apple will introduce the OLED screen in this year's iPhone 7 Pro. Also, the iPhone 8 is expected to consist of Lithium-O2 batteries and motion charging technology to provide the users with longer battery life. Besides, rumors hinted that Apple might release three variants of iPhone 8 varying in the internal storage capacity. Meanwhile, the release date rumors hinted that the iPhone 8 might be launched in September 2017 following the trend over the years. It is also stated that the new device will be released to mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. However, there is no official confirmation as of now.

Is this the confirmation that we need for the larger storage capacity on Apple's flagship smartphone?  ( The Malignant | Twitter ) Advertisement The iPhone 7 rumor mill is busy churning, with the latest leak perhaps finally confirming that Apple will be releasing a 256 GB model for the upcoming flagship smartphone. The storage space for iPhones, specifically the lack thereof, has consistently been one of the major complaints of the device's users. While Android-powered competitors boast of expandable memory through microSD card slots, Apple's iPhones have traditionally offered limited storage spaces in 16 GB, 64 GB and 128 GB capacities. Apple, however, may finally be addressing the problem, with rumors dating as far back as several months ago claiming that the iPhone 7 will come with a 256 GB option. The rumor has since been reiterated several times, with the most recent report on the matter released just last week. According to that report, the iPhone 7 will also be bumping up its minimum storage capacity to 32 GB. An internal spreadsheet acquired by a Twitter leaker who goes by the name The Malignant could be the confirmation that most users have been waiting for on the 256 GB model of the iPhone 7. The spreadsheet, which is believed to belong to one of the manufacturing partners or component suppliers of Apple, shows three different storage capacities for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, specifically 32 GB, 128 GB and 256 GB. With those capacities, Apple will be doubling the storage space in the three options currently being offered for the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus. The Malignant has a decent track record in his leaks, which should excite users who have been looking forward to bigger storage space for their iPhones. In addition, with the rumor being mentioned so many times, there has to be some truth behind the larger storage capacities for the upcoming iPhone 7. However, it should be noted that the leaked spreadsheet has no obvious connection with Apple or the iPhone 7. The numbers indicated on the document follow Apple guidelines in terms of formatting, but that is not unique to the company. While the 256 GB model of the iPhone 7 has long been requested, the move would likely lead to a higher starting price for Apple's flagship smartphone. It would be reasonable to assume that Apple will be keeping the price of the 32 GB and 128 GB models constant, while dropping the cheapest 16 GB price point and adding a new highest one with the 256 GB model. The exact details of the iPhone 7 will not be fully confirmed until Apple makes an official announcement though, with the company expected to do so next month.

Image Credit: Getty Images Here's what the internet is asking about the iPhone 7 By Aric Suber-Jenkins August 25, 2016 SHARE TWEET PIN The iPhone 7 is all but guaranteed to get a September release. While a number of the device's supposed features have been reported thanks to months of persistent leaks, many prospective buyers still have some questions for Apple. For example: when does the iPhone 7 come out cuz I don't think my phone is going to last much longer Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 7 on Sept. 7, but the phone's actual release date remains unclear. Most rumors pegged the iPhone 7 to arrive on Sept. 16, but recent speculation pushes the big day back to Sept. 23. Hopefully Apple sets the record straight at its upcoming press conference. So the iPhone 7 won't have a headphone jack but add an extra camera? .. Apple is expected to introduce a dual lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus that will help mobile photographers take brighter and sharper photos in low-light settings. And it's looking pretty likely Apple will ditch the traditional headphone jack in favor of Bluetooth and Lightning audio output.  sooo the iPhone 7 coming in a navy blue color? A rumor from last week suggests the iPhone 7 will indeed feature a navy blue option. That remains unconfirmed, but the new hue could be this year's version of rose gold.  Are they really coming out with an iPhone 7 pro? Or is that truly just an iPad mini? Recent reports suggest the iPhone 7 Pro has been killed off in favor of a stronger version of the iPhone 7 Plus. Don't give up hope, though. John Webber, founder of Carved — an iPhone case-making company — told Mic that he's "got a couple guys over in China that work for [him] and have for about 5 years," and that "they are in contact with numerous factories." "As far as I know, there may be a third model down the road called the iPhone 7 Pro with the smart connector," Webber said in an email. The smart connector would allow the iPhone 7 Pro to wirelessly transfer data and power to compatible accessories. If Webber is correct, let's hope Apple rolls out the iPhone 7 Pro sooner than later. We'll find out for sure when the iPhone 7 is (likely) unveiled on Sept. 7. Like us on Facebook: SHARE TWEET POST Aric Suber-Jenkins Aric is a writer covering technology.

Why, you ask? Well, they discovered an Isreali company had been selling and exploiting security vulnerabilities to Apple products. The company, Israeli NSO Group, is so secretive about what they're doing, they've changed their name countless times just to avoid detection. The group gained access to text messages, emails, contacts, and calls - this is according to a report by researchers at Citizen Lab out of University of Toronto and Lookout, a San Francisco mobile security company. While we can go over all the details of what they did and perhaps why they did it, the point is to simply update your iPhone now! A statement from Apple, as reported by Buzzfeed: “We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5...We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits.”   Last Updated ( Thursday, 25 August 2016 )   < Prev   Next > [ Back ] Recent News The New Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 Has Arrived!

VA now plans to “amend our policy to make clear that Confederate flags will not be displayed from any permanently fixed flagpole in a national cemetery at any time.” Robert E. Walters, VA’s interim undersecretary for memorial affairs, announced that policy in a letter to Rep. Jared Huffman, a California Democrat, and other House members.  The policy will continue to allow small Confederate flags on individual graves on Memorial Day and Confederate Memorial Day. The flags also will be allowed during graveside committal services. Apple boosts spyware PARIS  — A botched attempt to break into the iPhone of an Arab activist using hitherto unknown espionage software has triggered a global upgrade of Apple’s mobile operating system, researchers said Thursday. The spyware took advantage of three previously undisclosed weaknesses in Apple’s mobile operating system to take complete control of iPhone devices, according to reports published Thursday by the San Francisco-based Lookout smartphone security company and internet watchdog group Citizen Lab.  Leslie Jones website hack LOS ANGELES  — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Thursday it is investigating the hack of Leslie Jones’ website that revealed several private details of the actress-comedian’s life.

Old People Like Me Christina Warren | Gizmodo MediaAug 25, 2016, 09.20 PM IST FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedinReddit AppleImage Credit Image: Gizmodo Apple is reportedly working on its own Snapchat clone. It would join companies like Twitter and Facebook who are furiously trying to copy the features that have made the image and video sharing app popular with younger users. Young people are important, sure, but where Apple is uniquely positioned to succeed is in building a Snapchat for text-addicted old people like me. What better way to keep old people like me chatting with friends inside the Apple ecosystem than to build features directly into iMessage?! It's kind of genius. Instagram has already showed that serving up Snapchat-style features to an already devoted user base can work. And with all of the new features coming to the Messages app in iOS 10, it makes total sense that Apple might try a similar tack. The new report comes from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Alex Webb who claim Apple is preparing Snapchat-like video and image editing features, as well as a social networking component, to be launched sometime next year. The features might be a standalone app or work directly within its existing camera app. Regardless of what shape it takes, iMessage integration seems obvious. The software is currently being designed to be used mostly with one hand and with the intention that video could be shot, edited, and uploaded in less than 1 minute, the people said. At least one of the prototype designs for the app would shoot video in an Instagram-like square shape, one of the people said. Bloomberg paints the effort as just another way Apple is trying its hand at getting more social. Apple's past forays into social networking (remember Ping?) haven't always worked. Where it has had some success in the space is with iMessage, which is basically SMS elevated to the level of low-impact social network. I'm in plenty of group-texts with people I don't know, whose phone numbers I don't have. Our connection is iMessage. Apple knows that it's got people locked in to using the Messages app, and the iOS 10 update will already integrate features from other social networks, like stickers and text effects. Why not ape Snapchat at the same time? It's easy to imagine quickly taking a photo or video, adding some doodles or text, and then seamlessly sending it to a friend over iMessage. For now, it's unclear if these new features will materialize at all. But it seems clear that it would be deeply integrated into iOS, and that it would be built to work with Apple's immensely popular iMessage platform. Moreover, expanding the reach of Messages to include one-handed photo and video sharing-with filters and drawings-could be compelling for a lot of people who are already using iMessage and don't want to bother with Snapchat. Consider that the reason Instagram Stories has already been so successful is because 500 million people are already using Instagram. Personally, I'm seeing and creating Instagram Stories all the time because I'm always in Instagram. Inertia wins over Snapchat's geofilters. But then, I'm over 30 and thus old. I don't have the time or desire to live inside multiple chatting apps every day, I have shit to do and wine to drink. I don't already live on Snapchat and neither do my friends, so I'm not about to start using it. Apple won't necessarily win over the kids with a Snapchat clone, but baking the features that make Snapchat so addictive into its apps and operating system would keep people like me even more reliant on Apple's ecosystem. Done correctly, it could keep me from ever switching to Android. And more importantly, I would finally be able to doodle the images I send my friends, just like the teens do.

In a white paper, the US Treasury said the EC probe into alleged special tax treatment that certain EU countries gave Apple, Amazon, Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler "undermines the international tax system." With potentially billions of dollars in tax levies at stake, the Treasury also reiterated its view that the investigations "disproportionately" target US companies and would prevent Washington from recovering taxes that it is eying from the companies' offshore earnings. "These investigations have major implications for the United States. In particular, recoveries imposed by the Commission would have an outsized impact on US companies," said Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Tax Affairs Robert Stack in a statement. "US taxpayers could wind up eventually footing the bill" if the commission forces the companies into tax settlements, he said. The US acknowledged the problems around the issue of multinational firms obtaining state aid, in the form of secret and extremely lucrative tax breaks, from Ireland, Belgium and Luxembourg for setting up business in those countries. But it said those deals were made under international treaties and accepted tax practices. The Treasury accused the EC in the white paper of taking a "new approach" to established European Union tax law in challenging EU member states' legal tax breaks offered to multinational firms. In addition, the Treasury said the European Commission is effectively changing the tax rules now, but planning to apply them retroactively to the companies, which the US said was inconsistent with EU law and international practice. "The Commission should not seek retroactive recoveries under its new approach," the white paper said. Moreover, the white paper said the commission was acting as "a supra-national tax authority" that oversteps its powers in EU challenging member state tax policies. In a statement, an EC spokesperson denied it was targeting US companies in particular and said that EU rules do not allow national tax authorities to give tax breaks to some companies that are not available to others. If such breaks are ruled illegal, the benefits from them have to be repaid. "This is a standard feature of EU state aid rules," the spokesperson said.

Exploits patched by Apple today hint at years of surreptitious government hacks Posted Aug 25, 2016 by Devin Coldewey, Contributor 0 SHARES Next Story Garmin releases its first luxury smartwatch, the Fenix Chronos You’ll want to be updating your iOS devices to 9.3.5, the version released today by Apple — especially if you’re a prominent human rights activist. A recently thwarted attack on just such a person employed not one but three zero-day exploits addressed by the patch. The subsequent investigation suggests these were the work of a shadowy cybersecurity company whose software may have been used for years by governments looking to compromise political targets. Ahmed Mansoor (pictured above), an award-winning activist based in the UAE, received some suspicious text messages two weeks ago promising information on detainees being tortured — but Mansoor, who has been targeted multiple times in the past by high-profile “lawful intercept” tools, decided instead to send the text to Canadian security research organization Citizen Lab. The texts sent to Mansoor. Assisted by Lookout Security, Citizen Lab went down the rabbit hole, and found it much deeper than expected. The text messages were a trap, of course, but one of unprecedented complexity. That single link would have leveraged three separate and highly serious exploits in iOS — executing arbitrary code through WebKit, gaining access to the kernel, and then executing code within the kernel. It’s rare enough to find a zero-day in the wild, let alone three at once. The result would have been a one-step jailbreak with malicious code injected under the hood — granting complete access to all the phone’s data and communications. This triple threat of exploits building on one another gained the appropriate moniker “Trident.” Taken from Hacking Team’s leaked emails, an illustration showing the reach Pegasus would have once installed. These exploits were immediately sent to Apple, which ten days later — today — issued a patch fixing them. Apple declined to comment beyond the following statement: “We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5. We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits.” Worth noting is the fact that there were references in the code to iOS versions going as far back as 7 — so either the exploits have been around that long or they’re simply effective that broadly. After breaching with Trident, the malware that would have lingered on the device was immediately recognized by the researchers as Pegasus, a piece of commercial spyware software sold by Israel-based cybersecurity company NSO Group. This was the first time it had been caught in the wild. (Perhaps the team working on it should have been called Bellerophon.) Pegasus was one of the tools that Hacking Team apparently used — and later, inadvertently publicized when its emails were leaked. NSO also showed up when, retrospectively, Citizen Lab’s investigation found traces of the company’s work in a separate threat being tracked in the UAE known as Stealth Falcon. Lastly, the NSO signature was also on malware that had targeted Mexican journalist Rafael Cabrera; he had been working on a story that potentially discredited the country’s president. NSO is reportedly owned or at least invested in by San Francisco equity firm Francisco Partners, which did not respond to requests for more information. Pegasus and NSO, then, have been lurking in the wings for quite a long time, and while the evidence is certainly circumstantial, it suggests that the company has long been providing governments with highly sophisticated intrusion software. And, predictably, this software has not been deployed only (or perhaps at all) against the likes of terrorists and spies, but against citizens acting against the government’s interests. Citizen Labs sums it up well in their conclusion: Citizen Lab and others have repeatedly demonstrated that advanced “lawful intercept” spyware enables some governments and agencies, especially those operating without strong oversight, to target and harass journalists, activists and human rights workers. If spyware companies are unwilling to recognize the role that their products play in undermining human rights, or address these urgent concerns, they will continue to strengthen the case for further intervention by governments and other stakeholders. Be careful out there, and keep your phone updated. The global internet is a dangerous place.

Dubbed Trident, the newly discovered exploit chain utilizes three “zero-day” iOS vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to remotely jailbreak a user’s iPhone and install spyware capable of accessing the device’s camera, microphone, location information, calls and messages, the pair said. Citizen Lab said the chain begins when a victim visits a maliciously crafted website – perhaps one that is sent via a phishing text message – opens the door for arbitrary code execution. The second prong of attack comes from an application that may be able to disclose kernel memory while the third element is an application that may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. It’s that last bit that is used to jailbreak a device and essentially turn it into a “digital spy” in the user’s pocket via the installation of spyware software called Pegasus, Citizen Lab said. “Pegasus is the most sophisticated attack we’ve seen on any endpoint because it takes advantage of how integrated mobile devices are in our lives and the combination of features only available on mobile – always connected (WiFi, 3G/4G), voice communications, camera, email, messaging, GPS, passwords, and contact lists,” Lookout wrote in its report. Citizen Lab and Lookout said Apple was immediately notified about the exploits once they were confirmed on August 15. Apple on Thursday released a patch in its iOS 9.3.5 update to close the vulnerabilities exploited by Trident. Apple said the fix applies to the iPhone 4s and later, iPad 2 and later and the 5th generation iPod touch and later. The news comes on the heels of Apple's announcement earlier this month that would start offering cash rewards of up to $200,000 to hackers who come forward with information about security flaws in the company's software. How Trident was discovered According to Citizen Lab and Lookout, the exploits were discovered by tracing the source of suspicious text messages sent to Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Mansoor, who had previously been the target of two other spyware attacks in 2011 and 2012, forwarded the dubious message on to Lookout and Citizen Lab for investigation. Citizen Lab said it recognized the links sent to Mansoor as part of an exploit architecture linked to NSO Group, an American-owned, Israel-based “cyber war” company. NSO is the company behind Pegasus, a government-exclusive spyware product, Citizen Lab said. In an August 2014 interview with the Wall Street Journal, NSO co-founder Omri Lavie likened the company’s operations to being a “ghost.” Lavie said NSO’s techniques were “totally transparent to the target” and “leave no traces.” How it works The initial phase of the infiltration through the one-click vector looks innocent enough. Citizen Lab said the websites used in the initial link of the exploit chain have used fake domains to impersonate reputable sites – like those of Google, Facebook and WhatsApp as well as news organizations like the BBC, CNN and Univision, telecommunications companies like Mexico’s TelCel and Iusacell and shipment tracking companies like FedEx – to help induce clicks. Researchers found 38 percent of lookalike websites imitated news media, while 25 percent mimicked internet service providers or telcos and 18 percent impersonated streaming or sharing media sites. But from that initial quick, things quickly – and invisibly – turn ugly. Once the rest of the exploit chain is completed and Pegasus spyware is installed on the device, an attacker gains full access to a device’s data. Citizen Lab said Pegasus can either actively or passively access a phone’s files, messages, microphone and camera. Targeted data can include regular voice calls or those made through WhatsApp and Viber; SMS messages and messages from apps like Gmail, WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook and others; and personal data like calendar information, contact lists, and passwords, Citizen Lab said. Based on the evidence found in its investigation with Citizen Lab, Lookout said the Pegasus spyware appears to have been “in the wild” for a while – even dating back to iOS 7. Lookout said it believed the tool was being used to attack “high-value” targets, including “high-level corporate espionage on iOS, Android and Blackberry.” Citizen Lab said it has found evidence that “state-sponsored actors” have similar tactics to attack a Mexican journalist who outed top-level corruption in that country and an unknown target in Kenya. In Mansoor’s case, Citizen Lab said it concluded the UAE government was the “likely operator” behind the targeting. Lookout on Thursday urged all Apple users to update to the latest version of iOS immediately to shield themselves from Trident attacks.

Stops Signing iOS 9.3.2 and 9.3.3, Effectively Blocks Restores For Jailbreak The only firmware you can update to right now is iOS 9.3.4 Published By: Ken Bock on August 25, 2016 12:40 pm EST Facebook Google+ Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon AAPL Today, Apple stopped signing the jailbreakable firmwares iOS 9.3.2 and iOS 9.3.3, which effectively means that restores to the versions won’t be possible and all restores will automatically be made to iOS 9.3.4. Earlier this month, the jailbreak for iOS 9.3.3 was finally released by the Pangu team. The tool is compatible with iOS 9.2-9.3.3. Just a week after the release of the jailbreak, Apple was quick to issue iOS 9.3.4 which only featured a singular change, which was patching the vulnerability used for the jailbreak. Apple even credited the Pangu team for discovering it in the release notes. Now that iOS 9.3.2 and 9.3.3 are not longer being signed, users won’t be able to restore to the any of the firmwares in order to jailbreak their devices. Downgrades and upgrades are both blocked. If you’re on a jailbroken device, we recommend to hold off restoring their device since it’ll only update to 9.3.4 which cannot be jailbroken. And if you’re already on iOS 9.3.4, we wouldn’t recommend holding your breath for an iOS 9.3.4 jailbreak. Pangu has already demoed an iOS 10 jailbreak and they’ll release it eventually, so it’s better to wait for it. Releasing a jailbreak for iOS 9.3.4 would effectively mean giving up another exploit and having to find another one for iOS 10, which is counterproductive. This cat and mouse game between Apple and iOS jailbreak developers has been going on ever since the iPhone was launched and it’s unlikely that it’ll end anytime soon.

Register Now Advertise New iPhone App Has Video, Art Tools by Gavin O'Malley@mp_gavin, August 25, 2016, 6:58 PM Recommend (1) Apple is reportedly testing an app that sounds a lot like Snapchat. The app in question lets iPhone users record video, add filters or drawings, and share it with one or more contacts, sources tell Bloomberg News. The app -- which has no official launch date yet -- comes as Apple’s core businesses are struggling, particularly iPod sales. As a direct result of sagging iPhone sales, Apple revenue just fell for a second quarter in a row. Year-over-year, it declined 14.6% to $42.36 billion. It also saw profit fall 27% during the fiscal third quarter. On the bright side, that revenue number was “near the high end of our guidance range,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts on last month's earnings call. This “reflected stronger customer demand,” Cook said. “We had a very successful global launch of the iPhone SE. Overall, we added millions of first-time smartphone buyers during the quarter.” Worldwide, revenue from mobile video will reach $25 billion by 2021, per a recent Strategy Analytics report. Top platforms are anxious to turn this bonanza into bucks. Earlier this month, Facebook said it was testing a new format in which 15-second ad videos can be placed into Facebook Live streams. More broadly, Apple has reason to be optimistic. During the fourth quarter, the tech giant said its active-install base surpassed 1 billion devices for the first time ever. From iPhones to iPads, Macs to Apple Watches, the number of gadgets syncing with Apple’s services increased by a healthy 25%, year-over-year. Stateside, Apple's share of smartphone users is expected to account for a 43.5% share in 2016 -- up slightly from 43.3 in 2015, by eMarketer’s estimation. Android, by comparison, will see its share of U.S. smartphone users rise slightly to 52.0%, up from 51.7% the previous year. Looking ahead, analysts say Apple's biggest and best hope lies in the success of its next iPhone. 8 SHARES Tags: apple, iphone, mobile Recommend (1) Print RSS All content published by MediaPost is determined by our editors 100% in the interest of our readers ... independent of advertising, sponsorships or other considerations.

Image Credit: Getty Images Apple is reportedly working on its own version of Snapchat By Aric Suber-Jenkins August 25, 2016 SHARE TWEET PIN Apple is reportedly making a foray into social media. According to Bloomberg, Apple is "starting to develop a video-sharing app that allows users to record video, apply filters and drawings to the media." Sound familiar? These features strongly resemble Snapchat. The new app, which is unnamed in the report, is "designed to be used mostly with one hand" and will allow users to shoot, edit and upload videos in under one minute. Users can share this media with contacts — presumably iOS only — and send clips to "existing social networks." Twitter is the example given, and prototype designs allegedly utilize Instagram's square-shaped video, which could hint at the photo-sharing app's involvement, as well. Apple's alleged social media app will resemble Snapchat Source: Carl Court/Getty Images Bloomberg adds that Apple's new social media app is being developed by the team responsible for Final Cut Pro and iMovie. This suggests an emphasis on video editing, but sources close to the project maintain it will be "simple" and appeal to users familiar with Snapchat and Instagram. Apple is reportedly shooting for a 2017 release date, but the report warns the app could be "killed if it doesn't meet the company's timetable and expectations." iOS 10, which is coming this fall, includes a number of features inspired by Snapchat. Larger emojis, handwritten messages, stickers and drawing ink on videos and photos are all coming to iMessage. Apple appears to be joining Instagram on a mission to "borrow" from Snapchat.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is developing an application to allow users to create, edit, and share videos on social media platforms. The company is also testing other similar features for its operating systems (OS) used in smartphones and tablets. In 2015, Former president of a video production company Joe Weil was hired to provide expertise and lead the project. Mr. Weil developed a video-blogging app called “KnowMe.” The new application is being developed in the same department that worked on Final Cut Pro and iMovie software, which are two of Apple’s premium video editing tools for Mac. Since Apple’s hardware segment has been underperforming in the past few years, it has been actively participating in the services sector. CEO Tim Cook hopes for an increased revenue growth with his strong focus on services like App Store and Cloud storage. The iPhone maker is trying to stay in the social media network by deducing different ideas that include video editing application as well. The tech titan worked on iTunes-based social network, Ping, which failed to launch. Social media’s importance has increased with time and considering the number of hours users spend on it each day shows its high significance. Mobile users spend an average of about 50 minutes per day on Facebook NewsFeed or Messenger. Similarly, Snapchat’s 150 million daily active users spend about 30 minutes each day. Facebook desires exclusive features, especially for younger generation to mark its significance in the market. The tech juggernaut’s plans don’t end on its upcoming video editing app only. It has also been working on fusing the old and present communications between two users to a single panel. Facebook aims to create a platform where two users can view emails, text messages, and other activities in a single window. The social media giant will have to come up with something innovative, since the idea of video editing and sharing is not new. Recently, Prisma, a photo editing app started working on video editing and sharing. While Prisma is still working on its app, a Russian competitor created and launched another app called “Artisto,” which allows users to turn their videos to Picasso’s style. With similar applications already available in the market, Apple would have to introduce something completely new to break the records.

Dan Seitz 08.25.16 3 months ago Facebook Twitter EMAIL faungfupix / Shutterstock.com Apple, for all its ability to sell us phones and tablets, doesn’t seem to “get” some parts of the tech industry. Just ask any gamer, or, for that matter, social media fans: Remember Ping, Apple’s attempt to turn iTunes into the Facebook of music? But Apple has seen the value in Snapchat-like features already, and it might be pushing further into the app’s turf. Unlike a lot of Apple rumors, the Snapchatting of Apple is already well under way. iOS is already cribbing from the app, adding tweaks like the ability to send texts “loudly” or “softly” and including interactive features like “grit,” which you have to swipe away to read the message. But Bloomberg states Apple is thinking about adding more features to text messages and video: …Apple is starting to develop a video sharing app that allows users to record video, apply filters and drawings to the media — much like Snapchat does — and send it to contacts or via existing social networks such as Twitter Inc., according to the people familiar with its development. The software is currently being designed to be used mostly with one hand and with the intention that video could be shot, edited, and uploaded in less than 1 minute. At least one of the prototype designs for the app would shoot video in an Instagram-like square shape. In other words, this mystery app, whatever Apple might call it, would be a heck of a lot like Snapchat, but easier to access. In fact, it seems unlikely Apple would bother making this a separate app, and more likely to incorporate it as a feature set into iMessage and its video and camera functions. And if this holds true, it’s big trouble for Snapchat. Snapchat is already struggling with problems, not the least of which is user backlash over the racism found in some of the company’s filters. Facebook, having been rebuffed by the company for not offering it enough billions of dollars, is cribbing the app’s ideas instead. Not to mention social media is, at best, volatile; Whisper and Ello are just two recent examples of how quickly a site can be forgotten. If Apple is showing up to push it out, Snapchat will need to figure out how to push back, and fast.

The New York Times writes that this rapid release comes in response to what appears to be a government attempt to compromise the iPhone of Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent human rights activist based in the United Arab Emirates. Two weeks ago, he reported several suspicious SMS text messages to researchers at the digital rights watchdog group Citizen Lab. With assistance from the research team at Lookout, Citizen Lab was able to identify the texts as coming from an exploit infrastructure created by NSO Group, an Israel-based “cyber-war” company that makes phone surveillance software. The chain of exploits would have led to a remote jailbreak enabling the attacker — likely the UAE government — to install sophisticated spyware on Mansoor’s iPhone. Citizen Lab reported these vulnerabilities to Apple, which promptly fixed them in iOS 9.3.5; Citizen Lab’s report makes for fascinating reading — it’s a real-world thriller. The three specific vulnerabilities, as outlined by Apple’s security note, involve bugs that could allow applications to disclose kernel memory or allow application execution and a vulnerability that would allow malicious Web sites to execute code. It’s extremely unlikely that most people would be targeted by NSO Group’s exploit chain, given that it undoubtedly sells for big bucks. However, now that the vulnerabilities on which it relies have been blocked by iOS 9.3.5, it’s easy to imagine the price dropping significantly, enabling garden-variety miscreants to buy and use it against those who don’t update. Since the result could be your iPhone being used to track your movements, record audio and video from your surroundings, snoop on messages in chat apps, and more, we recommend that you install iOS 9.3.5 as soon as possible. Download sizes vary, but it was about 38 MB on an iPhone 5s, and you can update via Settings > General > Software Update or through iTunes.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Apple is getting into the social media business. Bloomberg reports that the company is testing out an app that essentially lets iPhone users record videos while adding filters and text onto content, kind of like Snapchat. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, users can record a video, edit it, and upload it all under a minute. He breaks it down further below: Apple is starting to develop a video sharing app that allows users to record video, apply filters and drawings to the media — much like Snapchat does — and send it to contacts or via existing social networks such as Twitter Inc., according to the people familiar with its development. The software is currently being designed to be used mostly with one hand and with the intention that video could be shot, edited, and uploaded in less than 1 minute, the people said. At least one of the prototype designs for the app would shoot video in an Instagram-like square shape, one of the people said. The goal behind the project’s development is to offer simple video editing with tools that appeal to the generation of users growing up with Snapchat and Instagram Apparently, they’re trying to push this out for a 2017 release. It also means the project can be dropped if it doesn’t meet expectations, and of course, its deadline. We’ll learn more as time passes, this is a pretty early scoop from Bloomberg so time will only tell. Apple is holding press conference sometime in September to unveil the new iPhone.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Apple Is Working On A Snapchat-Style Video Sharing Social App For Launch In 2017 By Ali Salman Posted Aug 25, 2016 23Shares Share Tweet Submit A report from Bloomberg suggests that Apple is prepping to go head-to-head with Snapchat and Instagram by developing its own video sharing social app. The company’s motives is to target younger audience and generate greater revenues in the services industry. Apple is said to acknowledge the fact that social media apps adhere to most time spent on an iPhone. Apple’s Video Sharing Social App To Be Launched In 2017, Said To Carry Serious Video Editing Tools Apple is looking to grow into the services sector as its hardware sales have slowed down followed by a modest update year for its iPhone lineup. An average user spends 50 minutes a day on Facebook and 30 minutes on Instagram. This means that the following sector has immense potential for growth. The growth of Apple’s hardware business is slowing and Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is looking to the company’s services business, such as the App Store and iCloud storage, as a way to generate increased revenue. Apple has failed to successfully launch social-media services in the past, including an iTunes-focused social network called Ping in 2010. Now as Snapchat and Facebook’s Instagram and Messenger apps grow atop Apple’s iOS mobile operating system, Apple is seeking to create its own features to remain relevant, particularly for younger users. Apple’s video sharing social app will focus on short and fun videos with easy to use controls and operations. The app will allow users to record videos, apply filters and drawings to the media and share it with friends. This is more or less similar to what Snapchat and Instagram Stories has to offer. The current development process suggests at one handed use of the app and that users will be able to record video, edit and upload in less than a minute. We’re not sure if this would be the key potential feature to convince users. Apart from the fun app experience, Apple is also said to be bringing some serious video editing tools to the table. This comes in as the company has hired the same team who developed Final Cut pro and the iMovie software. Moreover, Apple has also hired the former president of a video production company who will lead the project with his expertise in the field. The release date for Apple’s video sharing social app has been targeting 2017. Nonetheless, Mark Gurman suggests that the final decision has yet not been made and it will depend on whether the app sees the daylight. However, this is not the first time that Apple has developed any social-related features. The company has previously developed ‘multiple social-related features’ out of which not a single was released. Advertisement One system that has been tested and still may launch in the future is a bolstered version of the “proactive assistance” functionality. The current implementation, bundled into iPhone software since 2015, recommends points of interest, contacts, and apps based on location and time of day. As of now, Apple’s 2017 launch of the unnamed app can be pushed back indefinitely so we may suggest to take the news with a grain of salt. Nonetheless, if by any mean Apple’s video sharing social app makes it to the public, it will be interesting to see what features are part of the platform. This is it for now, folks. What are your thoughts on Apple’s video sharing social app? Do you think it’s a good move to focus on software at this point as the company’s hardware isn’t reaping as much profits as it used to? Share your thoughts in the comments.

Apple, as it turns out, may be one of those interested parties. Sources familiar with the matter tell Bloomberg that the Cupertino-based company is actively developing a video sharing app that would allow users to record video and apply filters and other fun markups after the fact. The teams behind iMovie and Final Cut Pro are reportedly working on it. The project will become a standalone app, at least initially. Apple may at a later date bake some of the functionality into its existing camera application, sources say. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. Apple’s interest in becoming more social shouldn’t come as a surprise (and in fact, is already under way). With sales of its iPad and iPhone cooling (but still very impressive), Tim Cook and company are actively looking to branch out into new markets to bolster their slowing revenue stream. As apps like Instagram, Snapchat and WhatsApp have shown, social media is hot right now and Apple wants its cut. The company's next major mobile OS release, iOS 10, will come with a heavy dose of “social” features such as rich artwork and video capabilities in iMessage. And of course, there will be plenty of new emojis (they’ll even be recommended as predictive “text” as you type). Barring any unforeseen circumstances, Apple will unveil its next batch of iPhones early next month before launching a couple of weeks later. The new video sharing app, however, won’t be ready until sometime in 2017 at the earliest.

 Apple is reportedly working on an app that sounds a lot like Snapchat James Cook Aug. 25, 2016, 9:06 AM 2,235 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook with musician Dave Grohl.Justin Sullivan/Staf/Getty Apple is reportedly building iPhone and iPad apps that will feature video editing and sharing, according to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman. Gurman says the app will let people record short videos on their iPhone and then apply filters and doodles on top of them — similar to Snapchat and Instagram. In fact, one early version of the app sees users recording square videos, which is similar to how Instagram users take photos. Videos recorded and edited through Apple's new app could then be uploaded to social networks like Facebook and Twitter, Bloomberg reports. Apple is reportedly aiming the app at younger users who regularly use apps like Snapchat or Instagram but may not see the appeal of Apple's social-networking features like iMessage. Bloomberg reports that the app is being built with a target release date of 2017, but that could change. That means the video-editing app won't be in the coming iOS 10 software release.

According to Bloomberg, Apple is in the process of developing a video sharing and editing application that will allow users to shoot video, use filters and apply drawings. Users will be able to send the recordings to their contacts or upload them to a social media network like Facebook or Twitter.

The new feature may either be integrated into the iPhone’s existing camera feature or released as an app downloadable from the App Store. Earlier this month, Instagram also took a page out of Snapchat’s playbook (or maybe copied the entire thing), adding “Instagram stories” to its app. Users of the photo sharing platform can now upload videos or pictures to their stories and share them with their followers, which also expire after 24 hours.

Snapchat Cody Simpson, CodySimpson, on Snapchat: His Snapchat account recently came under fire for allegedly exposing his girlfriend doing drugs.

Snapchat Jared Leto on Snapchat: Leto communicates regularly with fans across multiple social platforms, teasing the reveal of his “Suicide Squad” haircut on Twitter and Instagram recently.

Snapchat Keegan Allen on Snapchat: Allen, best known as heartthrob Toby Cavanaugh on the show, offers fans an inside look at the making of the series.

Bryan held a Snapchat scavenger hunt, hiding swag in a cooler in the sand at Panama Beach City for fans to find. Snapchat Anna Kendrick on Twitter: When she’s not shooting off self-deprecating zingers or sharing her food porn proclivities, the “Pitch Perfect” star loves a live TV event (looking at you NBC). She’s so fast and funny, you half-expect her to reveal a writing team behind each tweet. Getty Images Zach Braff on Twitter: Things you can’t miss if you follow Braff on Twitter: There isn’t a selfie he doesn’t like, “Scrubs” lives on and the bromance with Donald Faison will last forever. And, like so many stars, he loves a live musical TV event.  Getty Images Billy Eichner on Twitter: In one subtweet, Eichner manages to skewer the entire TV musical genre and pin it all on “Sound of Music” sweetheart Carrie Underwood. TBS Will Wheaton on Twitter: Comedy Central owes the “Star Trek: The Next Generation” star a paycheck, benefits and a yearly bonus. When Wheaton isn’t guesting on friend Chris Hardwick’s internet-themed improv show “@Midnight,” he’s racking up points and retweets playing the show’s hashtag games like #XmasAMovie or #StonerSports. Will gets our vote as a very punny guy. William Shatner on Twitter: The onetime Captain Kirk is just as likely to be found live-tweeting CW or SyFy dramas as engaging in Twitter feuds or railing over his pet peeve: Twitter’s verified accounts. Mia Farrow on Twitter: Farrow is as likely to tweet about the “Sound of Music Live” and “Peter Pan Live” as she is about civil rights, global injustice or tune-in alerts for son Ronan Farrow’s MSNBC show. Getty Images Josh Groban on Twitter: In between concert updates, a lot of dog tweets and flirting with Twitter friends like Anna Kendrick and Michael Buble, Groban spoke for us all when he praised staged-for-TV musicals as a great American holiday tradition.  Getty Images Judge Reinhold on Twitter: The “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” star can’t seem to post enough #TBT (Throwback Thursday) snapshots. But he gets a special mention for pulling this 1982 headgear shot out of the archives and comparing himself to Christopher Walken during NBC’s live musical event, “Peter Pan Live.” Getty Images Jerome Jarre on Snapchat: In 2014, he was the fourth most followed individual on Vine, and in 2013, he co-founded GrapeStory, a talent agency for Vine and Snapchat stars.   Getty Images Shaun McBride on Snapchat: Known by his username, Shonduras, he became famous for his art work, and he is making thousands of dollars in advertising deals.  Snapchat Sanjay Gupta on Periscope: CNN's doctor brought Periscope into Surgery with him.  Getty Images Jimmy Fallon on Snapchat: The Tonight Show has started posting their line-up for their upcoming shows to their Snapchat users, with artsy drawings and graphics.  NBC Tony Reali on Snapchat: He often takes over Good Morning America's Snapchat, and even live snapped/chatted Taylor Swift's concert in 2014.  ESPN Carson Daly on Periscope: Daly will often tweet that he is live streaming using Periscope, whether it's backstage at The Today Show or at The Voice.  Getty Images David Beckham on Facebook: The soccer player has 50,654,657 likes on Facebook, posting personal pictures and videos. Also, Beckham just became an instagram user a couple of days ago.  Getty Images Vin Diesel on Facebook: Mashable called him the second most popular person on Facebook after President Obama. Currently, he has 91,714,170 likes, and is known to his followers as authentic.  Getty Images Shakira on Facebook: The singer has 100,233,197 likes on her Facebook page, making her the most-liked celebrity on this platform.  Getty Images Justin Bieber on Twitter: Bieber has the second-highest following on Twitter, after Katy Perry, with 63.3 million followers.  Getty Images Kim Kardashian on Instagram: The reality star is evidently one of the most followed Instagram users, with a total of 31.5 million followers. Her wedding photo with Kanye West was also the most liked instagram photo of all time.  Marcus Johns on Periscope: Johns already enjoys celebrity status inside the Twitter ecosystem, thanks to his popular Vine account. Some of his entertaining streams have included aerobic dancing on Hollywood Blvd in fluorescent green shorts. Getty Images Amanda Oleander on Periscope: A Los Angeles-based artist, Oleander quickly became one of Periscope’s most popular personalities. “I was surprised. I have never been really popular on any other social media app,” Oleander told TheWrap in an interview. She says her streams are focused around motivational talks, exploring Los Angeles and connecting with her audience.

The spyware is said to target flaws in the operating system that allows remote access to iPhone handsets with as little as a tap of a finger. Apple says it worked quickly to fix the access issue, but credits the activist in the United Arab Emirates for alerting them to the defect which could have gone unchecked. The security breach has even had an affect beyond the technology with Apple stock shares trending lower as a result.

However, we wouldn't advise skipping this one. The firm is today rolling out iOS 9.3.5 and, even though most iPhone users will be rid of the OS in a few weeks, remains a must-download with Apple calling it. update is an “important security update.” Related: iOS 10: Tips, tricks and secret features According to the New York Times, the update patches a trio of vulnerabilities that enable surveillance software to read iPhone users text messages, emails and track calls. The Times’ writes: “Investigators discovered that a company called the NSO Group, an Israeli outfit that sells software that invisibly tracks a target’s mobile phone, was responsible for the intrusions. The NSO Group’s software can read text messages and emails and track calls and contacts. It can even record sounds, collect passwords and trace the whereabouts of the phone user.” Apparently it has taken Apple ten days to plug the holes in iOS 9 and the update can be accessed over the air today. The 39MB update doesn’t list a particular flaw, and the version is not yet listed on the security content section off Apple’s software updates page. It’s been a long old haul for iOS 9, with early versions coming under fire for bricking older iPhone and iPad models. Apple must be looking forward to its retirement. UPDATE: More has emerged about the spyware, which potentially enabled hackers to pry on targets if they clicked on a link within a text message. The research companies who reported the flaws to Apple said they withheld details until Apple had addressed the situation (via BBC). The texts were received by Arab lawyer and activist Ahmed Mansoor on August 10 and 11, promising to reveal details about people being tortured in the UAE if he clicked the link. Had he clicked his iPhone would have been jailbroken. Thankfully for Ahmed, he did not and instead reported the incident. The Israeli cyber-war organisation the NSO Group are believed to be behind the botched attack, which alerted Apple to three previously unknown weaknesses within Apple iOS 9. "Once infected, Mansoor's phone would have become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone's camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements," said Citizen Lab, who published today's report alongside US smartphone security firm Lookout. "We are not aware of any previous instance of an iPhone remote jailbreak used in the wild as part of a targeted attack campaign, making this a rare find." So yeah, download iOS 9.3.5 now.

Update your phone now! By Chloi Rad Today, Apple released a software update addressing a number of major security vulnerabilities that, in the last week, have reportedly allowed hackers full access to the contents of a target's iPhone. Apple urges all iPhone users to upgrade to iOS version 9.3.5 now, which you can do by navigating to Settings > General > Software Update, and hitting "Install." “We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits,” said Apple spokesman Fred Sainz in a statement to The New York Times. According to the New York Times, the security flaws allowed some groups to access the texts, emails, call history, and contacts of a targeted iPhone, and could also steal passwords, record sounds, and track the user's location. The group that reportedly caused the security concerns would impersonate other companies to gain users' trusts, including Google, Al Jazeera, and even The Pokemon Company, which has of course gained prominence on mobile devices thanks to the release of Pokemon Go.

This means that users now won’t be able to restore to these firmwares via iTunes anymore. Instead, the devices will only be restored to iOS 9.3.4. This is important because the iOS 9.3.3 and 9.3.2 can be jailbroken, while iOS 9.3.4 cannot. Just a week after the release of the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak, Apple released iOS 9.3.4 which had but one purpose: to block the Pangu jailbreak. However, users could still restore to iOS 9.3.3 and jailbreak their device; now that option is no more. But what if you’re already on a jailbreakable firmware like iOS 9.3.3 and you want to restore your device to get a fresh start or fix issues? Going to iOS 9.3.4 probably won’t be an option for a person with a jailbroken firmware. So here’s a method which will allow you to restore your device to factory settings while staying on the same firmware so it can be jailbroken. Note: Please ensure that you’ve backed up all your data before starting with this guide. This method wipes your entire device. Step 1: First of all, launch Cydia and search for the tweak Cydia Eraser. This tweak allows you to remove all traces of Cydia to unjailbreak your device. The tweak is free. Step 2: Once the tweak is installed, run it. The tweak will proceed to remove the jailbreak along with Cydia. When that completes, you’ll be able to restore your device using the option built into Settings since your device won’t be jailbroken anymore. Jailbroken devices go into a bootloop if the option is used, but non-jailbroken devices do not. Step 3: Navigate to Settings > General > Reset and select Erase All Content and Settings. You’ll be prompted to enter your passcode, enter it. And that’s it. In a few minutes, your device will be completely restored and it’ll remain on the same firmware. Now, you can jailbreak your device using the Pangu jailbreak.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software How To Downgrade iOS 9.3.5 By Uzair Ghani Posted Aug 25, 2016 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Here’s how you can downgrade iOS 9.3.5 to iOS 9.3.4 in a few easy steps on iPhone, iPad, iPod touch. Downgrade iOS 9.3.5 Today If You Think You’ve Made A Mistake Upgrading Earlier in the day Apple made the big move and stopped signing iOS 9.3.3 and iOS 9.3.2. This meant users who had updated to iOS 9.3.4 could no longer downgrade to the aforementioned firmware. Furthermore, this also meant that users could no longer downgrade to jailbreak using Pangu. Now, it seems as though Apple wants to keep the ball rolling on the software side of the fence by releasing iOS 9.3.5 download, which happens to tighten the noose on security for iPhone, iPad, iPod touch users. And quite frankly, if you’re seeking for a personal opinion on the matter, we highly recommend sticking with iOS 9.3.5 as it patches an extremely grave security flaw with iOS. But, of course, you might have your own reasons to stick with older firmware such as iOS 9.3.4, so we totally can’t argue with that. Nonetheless, here are the steps you should follow in order to downgrade iOS 9.3.5 to iOS 9.3.4. Downgrade iOS 9.3.5 Tutorial Before you begin, we highly recommend taking a backup of your data using either iCloud or iTunes. Downgrading iOS firmware erases everything off your device. 1. Download the iOS 9.3.4 firmware file for your device from here. 2. Assuming you have iTunes installed on your computer, connect your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch using the supplied USB cable. 3. Launch iTunes if it didn’t launch automatically. Advertisement 4. Select your device from the top left hand corner of iTunes. 5. See that ‘Restore iPhone’ button in the center? Click on it while holding down the left ‘Shift’ key (Windows) or the left ‘Option’ key (Mac). 6. When a new pop-up window comes into view, simply select the iOS 9.3.4 firmware file you downloaded in step 1 of this tutorial. As soon as you double click on the firmware file, the downgrade process will start to begin. During this time we do not recommend doing anything else since you want everything to go as smoothly as possible. Wrap Up If you’re not reliant on a jailbreak at all – and keep in mind there isn’t any for iOS 9.3.4, at least publicly – then we urge everyone to upgrade to iOS 9.3.5 as it patches three critical flaws that allowed a hacker to snoop on your phone calls, read your text messages and whatnot. Basically, anything before iOS 9.3.5 is a security nightmare and iOS 9.3.5 is the only cure. But of course, the final decision on which side of the fence you wish to sit on lies with you.

However, if you accidentally updated to iOS 9.3.4 or above, you will no longer be able to downgrade. When a downgrade of firmware is requested Apple has to approve it and ‘sign’ the firmware allowing the downgrade to happen. With Apple no longer signing iOS 9.3.3, it becomes impossible to downgrade to that firmware. Therefore, given the most recent Pangu jailbreak only supports up to iOS 9.3.3 and not the latest iOS 9.3.4, you’ll want to stay on the older version if Jailbreaking your device is important to you. Apple closing the signing window for iOS 9.3.3 comes around three weeks after iOS 9.3.4 was released so there has been plenty of time to downgrade. Apple usually leaves around two weeks before closing the window following a new iOS release, so this period has been longer than usual. Most users won’t care about upgrading and won’t think twice about hitting that upgrade button since Jailbreaking is of no interest to them. But for those users who care about a Jailbreak, make sure you hold off hitting that update button. You can check out this handy guide on how to stop your iDevice constantly asking to be updated.

However, Apple’s latest update, iOS 9.3.5, eliminates several critical security and privacy exploits and should [hopefully] keep you safe. NSO Group, an Israeli startup that sells software that can track mobile phones, was responsible for the intrusion. Its software can read text messages and emails, track calls and contacts, record sounds, collect passwords, and physically locate the mobile phone user. NSO Group executives have boasted that its spyware functions like a “ghost” and is untraceable. The company was founded five years ago by entrepreneurs Omri Lavie and Shalev Hulio. It was purchased by Francisco Partners Management LLC for $120 million USD last year. NSO Group frequently changes its name in order to remain a “ghost”. Most recently the company was known as “Q”. NSO Group is incredibly popular with national governments, and its annual earnings amount to roughly $75 million. Its revenue is likely to increase as government spending by countries such as the United States and China jumps from $77 billion this year worldwide to $108 billion by 2019. Countries such as France and Germany are trying to pass legislation that would make it easier to access citizen's phones. Researchers Bill Marczak and John Scott Railton gave Apple the heads-up, and the company responded with the patch in less than two weeks. Suspicions were further confirmed when when Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, began receiving suspicious text messages. The messages claimed to have information about the torture of U.A.E. citizens. Fred Sainz, a spokesperson from Apple, remarked, “We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits.” Tags:  Apple, cybersecurity, (NASDAQ:AAPL) Via:  The New York Times Show comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Follow Us: Twitter Facebook RSS Email YouTube AppStore Google+ 85K 9K 4K 27K CONVERSATIONS Ubuntu Based Zorin OS 12 Linux Could Be...32 Netflix 4K Streaming Comes To PC, But...11 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Mocks Apple...9 Apple Reportedly Throttling iPhone 7...8 NVIDIA Offers Free Gears Of War 4...5 Microsoft Rumored To Include x86 on...4 Stanford Study Shows That Students Are...4 FEATURED Hot Holiday Gift Guide 2016: Tablets,...

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Software updates-Software updates+ Apple has just released the second iOS update in a month. After launching earlier this month iOS 9.3.4 that fixed a specific workaround that would allow an application “to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges,” the Cupertino-based company is now getting more serious and fixes no less than three vulnerabilities in the latest patch. Although it might look like a regular maintenance release that should fix some minor bugs and issues, iOS 9.3.5 is actually very important. Apple has already released an official changelog for this update, but New York Times has more information and reports that “investigators discovered that a company called the NSO Group, an Israeli outfit that sells software that invisibly tracks a target’s mobile phone, was responsible for the intrusions.” According to the same report, the Israeli company's software could read text messages and emails, as well as track calls and contacts. But that's not all, as the same software can even record sounds, collect passwords and trace the location of the phone user. How about that? The current iOS 9.3.5 security update is Apple's answer to the vulnerabilities that the Israeli firm exploited, but it only managed to do so 10 days after it's been tipped by two of the researches that found these security holes. NSO Group prides itself for its spyware, which is said to work like a “ghost,” tracking not only the moves, but also the strokes of the target. Until recently, it was unclear how this group was monitoring its targets, but the bubble burst when it was discovered the Israeli company has been tracking the moves of a human rights activist in the UAE. After receiving several suspicious messages, the person tracked by NSO Group passed them on to security specialists at Citizen Lab, who determined the fact that they were an attempt to track him via his iPhone. Citizen Lab and Lookout have dig even deeper and discovered that the tracking was possible through three older iOS vulnerabilities that Apple didn't knew about. This type of vulnerabilities are called “zero days” and they sell for large amounts of money, especially if they're iOS vulnerabilities. Two of the vulnerabilities discovered are related to the kernel, while the other one to the WebKit, but all three should be fixed by installing the latest iOS update. Speaking of which, iOS 9.3.5 is now available for download for iPhone 4s and later, iPad 2 and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, so get it as soon as possible. source: Apple, New York Times Solitaire and tic-tac-toe can now be played via a Google search 25 Aug Prev news Fallout Shelter for Android, iOS updated with two new characters, more 25 Aug Next news Close newer posts No Nougat for your Android phone?

App store is the worst thing in Apple Products. Takes ages to load (Don't blame on Data speed, I have stronger connection and on my S6 Edge Play store loads in seconds) and I don't know if you have found a glitch on it or not. But I tested 6 to 7 iPhones and if you go to store and click on Grossing it will open Wishlist. I am wondering why Apple and iSheep did't noticed it. posted on 25 Aug 2016, 19:10 5 Reply 5. guests (Posts: 165; Member since: 19 Jun 2016) Wait, according to the sheep io-ass is the most secured mobile operating system in the universe, right?? posted on 25 Aug 2016, 19:19 2 Reply 9.

Of course I know you're just trying to bait an argument. posted on 29 Aug 2016, 17:51 0 Reply 36. flyingcarpet (Posts: 1; Member since: 29 Aug 2016) Absolutely agree! BB has the best security, in my opinion. And their email application is world's better than Apple's. I really hated going from the Q10 to the latest Apple iPhone but during my research it looked more and more RIM was turning our those f$@/ing Android systems garmented as Blackberrys. I wasn't living with that nightmare. How I do miss the BB simply because its security has yet to be equaled, by my experience, nor its email capabilities. Definitely a production device for literate grown-ups not relying on spending their quality time playing the 21st century version of Donkey Kong and its 57 varieties. posted on 25 Aug 2016, 19:20 5 Reply 10. kiko007 (Posts: 2987; Member since: 17 Feb 2016) If you think any form of software is invulnerable, you're an idiot. We iOS users have never claimed otherwise, we simply acknowledge Apple being faster to act. Meanwhile, the only Android OEMs who've even disclosed the latest malware epidemic (let alone patched it) are Sony, Samsung, and BlackBerry (the first to crush it). posted on 25 Aug 2016, 19:35 3 Reply 13. meanestgenius (Posts: 12734; Member since: 28 May 2014) Totally agree with you here. Apple is damn fast at releasing patches, almost as fast as BlackBerry, which is saying a lot since BlackBerry is a security based company. It's one of the main reasons why I choose to use BlackBerry's Secured version of Android, as opposed to one of the other Android OEM's that have been making Android handsets longer. posted on 26 Aug 2016, 03:49 0 in response to #13 in response to #13 Hide Reply 34.

I don't want to bring android response to problems - but you know what I'm talking about don you? It's funny that everytime theses links are posted it was like a year ago and were patched within a week. Old and inapplicable news - that's all that is.

At least one year!? Fast? Even after their initial refusal to fix the problem. The news is Feb this year. Besides, my purpose is not to talk down Apple without any proof to back me up like mxy did. At the end of the day it's your money so buy all the Apple gadget you want. Don't expect everyone to agree that it's the smart thing to do.

Leo_MC (Posts: 1654; Member since: 02 Dec 2011) If you're talking about error 53, I think it was thought as a security feature and I was a supporter of it. Why is that? Because if a iPhone gets stolen, none of its parts will be usable, a stollen iPhone would have 0 sell value on the black market. posted on 26 Aug 2016, 01:48 0 in response to #23 in response to #23 Hide Reply 31.

Pangu To Release Tools In 2017? By Feliciano Rodriguez III Posted on August 24, 2016 Source: Apple Share Tweet Share Share Email Apple has recently slapped the hands of jailbreaking enthusiasts with its recent iOS 9.3.4 update. The update was issued earlier this month and one of its main feature is the disabling of a software feature exploited by jailbreakers to install their software. With the latest Apple update seemingly bringing an end to jailbreaking iOS 9, all eyes are fixed on the upcoming new iOS, the iOS 10. The iOS 10 was announced last July at the 2016 WWDC. While Apple is hard at work, what with the constant releases of the iOS 10 Public and Developer Betas, renowned jailbreaking team, Team Pangu, is reportedly hard at work as well, developing tools to jailbreak iOS 10. Apple, it seems, is determined to make things hard for the jailbreaking community. The release of the recent iOS 9.3.4 update is proof enough that Apple takes jailbreaking really seriously. The update was specifically created to address a software exploit used by jailbreakers to install their software, as reported in an earlier article by TechPlz. Source: myicloud.info According to a report by our sister-site, TheBitBag, Pangu is reported to be able to release a jailbreaking tool in-sync with Apple’s projected September release of the iOS 10. Looking at things, historically, there’s a fifty-fifty chance that Team Pangu will be able to release a jailbreak for iOS 10. Team Pangu’s last jailbreak tool was for the iOS 9.3.2, and that tool took six months to release. If we take into account the six months it took for Pangu to break Apple’s code and create a jailbreaking tool, it’s safe to assume then that this will be (more or less) the time that it will take for them to create a jailbreak for iOS 10. If iOS 10 is released this September, then we might see an iOS 10 jailbreak this coming February 2017. Stay tuned for more tech news here at TechPlz.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software iOS 9.3.5 Download For iPhone, iPad, iPod touch Users Released – Changelog Included By Uzair Ghani Posted Aug 25, 2016 29Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has released iOS 9.3.5 for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users for download. We have direct download links and changelog. iOS 9.3.5 Is A Pure Security Related Update – ‘Recommended’ For All Users It seems quite evident at this point that Apple is stepping up its game when it comes to security, as iOS 9.3.5 is a pure security tightening release, nothing more, nothing less. iOS 9.3.4 that dropped around three weeks ago did the same as well, killing the Pangu jailbreak in the process. If you’re wondering how important today’s release is – according to NYT, iOS 9.3.5 patches three security vulnerabilities that allowed an ill-intentioned individual to read your text messages, snoop on phone calls and more. In other words: anything before iOS 9.3.5 is a security nightmare for users and we urge everyone to update straight away without giving it a second thought. iOS 9.3.5 is available as an over the air download and here are the steps you should follow in order to update: Advertisement Make sure your device is charged beyond the 50% mark and connected to WiFi. Head over to Settings, then navigate to General > Software Update. As soon as iOS 9.3.5 update pops up, tap on the ‘Download and Install’ button. The update will be verified and installed on your device once the download process is complete. If you want to perform a clean install of iOS 9.3.5, then you will of course require the IPSW firmware file itself, which we have linked below as well. iOS 9.3.5 IPSW download links for iPhone: iPhone 6s iPhone 6s Plus iPhone 6 iPhone 6 Plus iPhone SE iPhone 5s (GSM) iPhone 5s (CDMA) iPhone 5c (GSM) iPhone 5c (CDMA) iPhone 5 (GSM) iPhone 5 (CDMA) iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 IPSW download links for iPad: iPad Pro iPad Pro (Cellular) 9.7-inch iPad Pro 9.7-inch iPad Pro (Cellular) iPad Air 2 (WiFi) iPad Air 2 (Cellular) iPad mini 4 (WiFi) iPad mini 4 (Cellular) iPad mini 3 (WiFi) iPad mini 3 (Cellular) iPad mini 3 (China) iPad Air (WiFi) iPad Air (Cellular) iPad Air (CDMA) iPad mini 2 (WiFi) iPad mini 2 (Cellular) iPad mini 2 (CDMA) iPad 4 (WiFi) iPad 4 (Cellular) iPad 4 (CDMA) iPad mini (WiFi) iPad mini (Cellular) iPad mini (CDMA) iPad 3 (WiFi) iPad 3 (Cellular) iPad 3 (CDMA) iPad 2 (WiFi) iPad 2 (Cellular) iPad 2 (CDMA) iPad 2 (Rev A Model) iOS 9.3.5 IPSW download links for iPod touch: iPod touch 5 iPod touch 6 If you are a jailbreak user then please refrain from updating to iOS 9.3.5.

Here's how you can get it today. From September 1, those signing up for pay monthly deals or upgrading their current handset will have unmetered access to the streaming service. Registered customers will be able to access Apple Music on their phones or the iPad, Apple TV, Mac and PC. EE has confirmed to TrustedReviews that the offer will also be open to those buying Android smartphones, so this isn’t a just a push for the new iPhones.

I must confess, I do believe (do believe!) this is a mighty fine offer from the UK's largest 4G network. Just last month EE revealed customers would be getting six months of free BT Sport (of course, EE is now owned by BT).

Contrary to reports that Britney Spears' new album Glory will be released Friday streaming exclusively via Apple Music, Billboard has confirmed the pop star's ninth studio album will be come out on all digital platforms.  From Beyonce to Frank Ocean, Breaking Down the Mechanics, and Politics, Behind Streaming Exclusives Confusion arose earlier this month when Spears tweeted promoting the new album's pre-order, stating that it would be available on Apple Music without any mention of Spotify or other services.  #Glory. My new album & the beginning of a new era. Available 8/26 on @AppleMusic. Pre-order tonight at midnight ET. pic.twitter.com/pkZZkC2QLR— Britney Spears (@britneyspears) August 3, 2016   With Spears now headlining London's Apple Music Fest next month, it's possible her tweet favoring Apple Music was is in order to generate good will with the company around that booking.  Sources at Spotify tell Billboard that their service is actually partnering with Spears' team on the release to feature the new album across the platform, but not as part of any exclusive deal.  'Bad for the Industry': Spotify's Artist Whisperer Troy Carter Slams Exclusives, Updates Company's Subscriber Total As well, source with Spears' label Sony Music Entertainment have verified that Glory will not be released exclusive with any service.  Amidst the ongoing streaming wars between major players Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal, streaming exclusives have become a new industry standard for high-profile releases. But the tides might be turning, as Universal Music Group chairman Lucian Grainge has now called for an end to these single-platform exclusives on his label.  Troy Carter, Spotify’s global head of creator services and former manager to Meghan Trainor and John Legend, told Billboard in a recent interview: "Most labels are getting around to understanding that exclusives aren’t great for the business. As a manager, I would want my artists' music to be everywhere. When you carve it out to one service, you miss out on fans."

The Democratic presidential candidate raised US$18 million on a three-day trip through California, or roughly $270,000 an hour. Related Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel host fundraiser for Hillary Clinton, share photobooth shots It’s somewhat rare for pop culture figures outside the campaign team such as Johnson to post photos from private fundraisers. Nonetheless, three of the family’s accounts lit up with images from the event they co-hosted with Samuel L. Jackson and Denzel Washington and their wives, LaTanya and Pauletta. Thank you to our co-hosts, Denzel & Pauletta Washington and Samuel L. & LaTanya Jackson for putting together an amazing event for @hillaryclinton! #imwithher #sheswithus A photo posted by Earvin "Magic" Johnson (@magicjohnson) on Aug 22, 2016 at 9:40pm PDT @thecookiej, our family and I enjoyed hosting our friend of over 25yrs and the next President of the United States @hillaryclinton at or home this evening! #imwithher #sheswithus A photo posted by Earvin "Magic" Johnson (@magicjohnson) on Aug 22, 2016 at 9:32pm PDT But even amid the stretch of high-dollar fundraisers, Clinton’s final stop in Northern California on Wednesday was notable for its price of admission: $200,000 per person. The early evening gathering was held at the Woodside home of Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs, the co-founder and former chief executive officer of Apple Inc., according to information released by Clinton’s campaign. About 20 people were said to have attended. The visit to the West Coast comes amid a prosperous August for Clinton’s campaign, with the candidate and her surrogates hosting at least 54 events over the final two weeks of the month, according to a fundraising schedule obtained by The Associated Press. A weekend trip to Cape Cod featured stops at seaside estates and a Sunday “summer celebration” with the pop star Cher. Clinton is trying to use the relatively quiet month of August, when voters are more focused on vacation than politics, to fill her campaign war chest. In the Golden State, many of her events were at well-worn stops on the Democratic money trail. In Los Angeles, she stopped by Johnson’s Beverly Hills compound, where she spoke to the 500 supporters gathered outside. Then she headed a few house down the street to entertainment executive Haim Saban’s sprawling property, where she was feted at a 100-person dinner on grounds that included some of Saban’s lighted animal-shaped topiary. The price of admission: $50,000 a plate. President Barack Obama had visited the same homes in 2013. But unlike Obama, who allows reporters to observe some of his opening remarks to donors, Clinton leaves the press waiting outside in vans and guesthouses, giving no hints at what she might be telling some of the country’s most powerful people. Behind closed doors, Clinton soothed the worries and answered the questions of some of her most ardent backers. At an intimate Bay Area dinner for 30, one donor asked about “healthers,” likening the unfounded rumours about Clinton’s health to the so-called birthers who questioned Obama’s birthplace. Outside the Piedmont mansion, a crowd of children and their parents waited over two hours for Clinton, chanting her name in the chilly night air. Clinton emerged from the home and, for about a few brief moments, campaigned. She made her way down the hastily assembled police line, shaking hands, snapping selfies and admiring the homemade signs. Then it was back in the motorcade to prepare for another busy day raising money. ———— Associated Press writer Julie Bykowicz contributed to this report from Washington.

Stock? Should you consider buying shares of InvenSense near its IPO price? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Aug 25, 2016 at 6:08PM Image Source: Getty. The past two years haven't been kind to InvenSense (NYSE:INVN), which makes motion sensors for smartphones, tablets, wearables, and other devices. Back in Aug. 2014, the stock peaked at $25 on surging sales and expectations that its sensors would be installed in the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch. But Apple eventually chose STMicroelectronics' (NYSE:STM) motion sensors for the Apple Watch, and slumping smartphone and tablet sales caused InvenSense's growth to hit a brick wall. As a result, the stock plunged to about $8 per share over the past two years. But after that steep drop, which brings the stock near its IPO price of $7.50 per share, can the fallen supplier be considered a contrarian buy? Let's examine InvenSense's growth, valuations, cash flow, and competition to decide. Image source: InvenSense. How fast is InvenSense growing? InvenSense's revenue rose 12% to $418.4 million last year, compared to 47% growth in fiscal 2015. Last year, 40% of InvenSense's revenue came from Apple, while 16% came from Samsung. This means that Apple's ongoing decline of iPhone and iPad shipments are taking a huge bite out of InvenSense's top line. InvenSense's revenue fell 43% annually last quarter, compared to a 20% decline in the previous quarter and 59% growth in the prior-year quarter. Sales of new smartphones, like the iPhone 7, are expected to boost its sales in the second half of the year, but not by much. Analysts still expect InvenSense's full-year revenue to fall 24% this year. InvenSense's non-GAAP earnings rose 6.5% to $0.49 per share in 2015, but that figure is expected to plummet 76% this year. Increased competition from STMicro, which is much bigger and has its own foundry, could force InvenSense to slash prices to stay competitive. Valuations and cash flow To make matters worse, InvenSense's massive decline still hasn't made the stock cheap. It trades at 27 times forward earnings, which is much higher than STMicro's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18. Moreover, STMicro is actually expected to grow its earnings by 11% this year, while InvenSense is headed toward a full-year decline. InvenSense currently trades with a five-year price-to-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio of 3.3, while STMicro has a PEG ratio of 0.7. Since a PEG ratio under 1 is considered "undervalued," InvenSense looks pricey relative to its earnings growth potential, while STMicro looks cheap. InvenSense also trades with a price-to-sales ratio of 2, which is double STMicro's P/S ratio of 1. InvenSense is burning through a lot of cash. Its cash and equivalents fell 44% sequentially to $23 million last quarter. STMicro's cash pile, by comparison, stayed nearly flat sequentially at $1.68 billion last quarter. Therefore, it isn't surprising that STMicro has generated much stronger cash flows than InvenSense over the past five years. That's why STMicro pays a forward annual yield of 3.1%, while InvenSense has never paid a dividend. Data source: YCharts. Competitive threats and potential catalysts The biggest threat to InvenSense is STMicro. The chipmaker already pulled the Apple Watch away from InvenSense, and might do the same in iPhones and iPads in the future if it offers comparable sensors at lower prices. As fierce competition puts further pressure on smartphone margins, plenty of other OEMs could do the same. InvenSense's main response to these threats is to diversify into new markets like virtual and augmented reality headsets, drones, cars, Internet of Things devices, and industrial machines. Unfortunately, STMicro is also expanding into many of the same markets. Furthermore Bosch is becoming a major player in VR headsets. The company's six- and nine-axis sensors are already used in Facebook's Oculus Rift and Razer's HDK 2 VR headsets. InvenSense's six-axis sensor can be found inside HTC's Vive, which is pricier than both headsets. InvenSense is too risky to touch InvenSense's plunging sales and earnings, weak cash flow, unattractive valuations, lack of competitive advantages, and its dependence on Apple make the stock too risky for investors. Investors who are looking for a stable play on gyroscopes and accelerometers should simply stick with STMicro instead. Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

But it's not the rate hike Jim Cramer says to worry about, it's a frightened investor. "I think the stock market's psychological impact — both negative and positive — is almost always underestimated by economists and investors alike," the "Mad Money" host said. In many declines in the past, it wasn't so much the market event that caused major declines. The hype and fear surrounding the decline prompted volatility in the market. "I have made no secret of the fact that I think the endless obsession with the Federal Reserve … has caused millions of people to miss this amazing run from the generational bottom seven-and-a-half years ago," Cramer said. In fact, Cramer refuses to make investments based on what he thinks the Fed will do next. Dissecting every word from Fed officials wastes time for investors trying to find high-quality companies that can dominate a global economy. So, Cramer warned not to overthink Yellen's speech on Friday. The placid nature of the stock market in the past week could help investors more than they realize, and could resume shortly after Yellen's speech, barring an all-out attack on the market by either major presidential candidate. "The Fed I've known over the course of my life as an investor is a fickle beast that is often wrong," Cramer said. Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images Janet Yellen, chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve It is no secret that investors no longer love Apple like they used to. Cramer believes the tech titan should put that massive $231 billion cash hoard to work and buy Sirius XM. "My position has not changed: you should sit tight and own this stock, not try and trade it," Cramer said. Apple needs to merge Siri with Sirius XM, Cramer said. Acquiring the under-appreciated Sirius XM could kill two birds with one stone. The subscription satellite radio business could dramatically boost Apple's service revenue stream. Sirius could also give Apple a serious presence in the automobile infotainment space, which Cramer thinks is the next frontier for technology. "Anything that puts Apple on the path toward owning the automobile would really brighten the company's long-term outlook," Cramer said. Cramer also had faith that the free market will produce a competitive product and drive down the price of Mylan's EpiPen. "There was a cheaper alternative at one point from Sanofi that would have prevented what I do perceive as Mylan's price gauging. I know because I bought it before the FDA took it off the market," the "Mad Money" host said. Many investors demonized Mylan for its monster price increase of the EpiPen, but for Cramer, the problem is that it could do so in the first place. This is merely a reflection of a glitch in the system. While he doesn't know for sure, Cramer speculated that Mylan put through the price increase simply because it hoped to make money until a competitor came along and offered a generic alternative. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., speaks during the Apple World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Monday, June 13, 2016. Incidents such as the Democratic Party hacking and the hacking into the National Security Agency recently have made it clear to Cramer that the need for cybersecurity has never been greater than now. But sometimes, cybersecurity comes with its own set of problems: who watches the watchmen? Companies like RedSeal, a privately held developer of security risk management, work to ensure that the companies people trust with personal information are doing so. "Normally we only talk about public companies, but tonight we are going off the tape with RedSeal because I think this could be the next frontier in cyber protection," Cramer said. RedSeal provides an analytics platform that helps to ensure the effectiveness of online customer security. It provides a digital resilience score that is modeled after the concept of a credit score in order to measure and quantify an organization's digital resilience. Cramer spoke with RedSeal's CEO Ray Rothrock, who explained why companies like Cisco and FireEye enlist RedSeal for its security, even though they are considered security-oriented companies already. "They have the best engineers in the world like everybody else has the best engineers in the world. But they understand that the complexity of these networks needs something extra, and they need RedSeal," Rothrock said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller favorite stocks: Cyberark: "I know the group has gotten high risk. I didn't like that downgrade, I think Cyberark is doing well. But I've got to tell you, I understand. The high priced earnings multiple stocks have not faired that well ... but Workday did go up last night. Maybe there's hope here." Carrizo Oil & Gas: "I think Chip Johnson [CEO] has done a good job, but I like these companies that have just done deals that are good. I like Concho. I like Concho better than Carrizo, I've got to tell you. I think that one is ready to ride. I also like Occidental for those who like a dividend. That's owned by my trust."

Jim Cramer believes the tech titan should put that massive $231 billion cash hoard to work and buy Sirius XM. "My position has not changed: you should sit tight and own this stock, not try and trade it," the "Mad Money" host said. Apple CEO Tim Cook made headlines recently when he estimated that Apple's service stream revenue could become as big as a Fortune 100 company next year. Apple clearly does not get enough attention for its powerful service revenue. But its cash hoard impressed Cramer more. Even a $580 billion company has many channels to use that money. Cramer has said for years that Apple should make a big acquisition, or multiple big acquisitions, to reignite its growth rate and make investors fall in love with its stock all over again. "I've got a terrific new merger idea that would seriously benefit both Apple and the takeover target in question. Not that either company has to do it, but it sure would make a lot of sense," Cramer said. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., speaks during the Apple World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Monday, June 13, 2016. Apple needs to merge Siri with Sirius XM, Cramer said. Acquiring the under-appreciated Sirius XM could kill two birds with one stone. The subscription satellite radio business could dramatically boost Apple's service revenue stream. Sirius could also give Apple a serious presence in the automobile infotainment space, which Cramer thinks is the next frontier for technology. "Anything that puts Apple on the path toward owning the automobile would really brighten the company's long-term outlook," Cramer said. Sirius XM's revenue has steadily grown, up 10 percent for the last four years. Sirius had more than $1.2 billion in sales ub its most recent quarter. That could immediately boost Apple's overall service revenue by 20 percent, Cramer said. Sirius XM's stock is not cheap compared to the average S&P 500 stock. Cramer thinks that is simply because investors recognize the positive aspects of its subscription-based model. Cramer also noted that once a customer signs up for Sirius, they tend to keep it. Its low churn rate has stayed at 1.9 percent for years. But Sirius XM does not control its own destiny, which could make the deal difficult. Liberty Media owns 65 percent of the business, so any decision to sell would need to come from Liberty's management. "Every six months, Apple spends the equivalent of Sirius XM's entire market cap on buying back its own stock, and they have got more than $230 billion just lying around," Cramer said. "Apple should use some of that cash to take over Sirius XM in order to bolster its service revenue stream and give itself a foothold in the connected car." Questions for Cramer?

Apple has done an admirable job of battling back against thieves with tools such as Find My iPhone and giving iPhone owners the ability to wipe their devices remotely when they are lost or stolen. But the future of iPhone security could be far more impressive. DON'T MISS: New video goes behind the scenes of an iPhone 7 leak for the first time ever On Thursday morning, Patently Apple shared a patent from Apple that describes a security system which would allow iPhones to capture a thief's fingerprint data using Touch ID and then record video or capture a picture of the thief. Here's the full explanation from the patent: "A computing device may determine to capture biometric information in response to the occurrence of one or more trigger conditions. The trigger condition may be receipt of one or more instructions from one or more other computing devices, detection of potential unauthorized use by the computing device, normal operation of the computing device, and so on. The computing device may obtain biometric information and may store such biometric information. Such biometric information may be one or more fingerprints, one or more images of a current user of the computing device, video of the current user, audio of the environment of the computing device, forensic interface use information, and so on. The computing device may then provide the stored biometric information for identification of one or more unauthorized users." Knowing that your face and fingerprint might be captured by a stolen iPhone could be a strong deterrent for potential thieves. As always, it's worth noting that Apple files hundreds of patents that never result in any tangible products or features, but this one seems like a no-brainer if Apple can make it work.

Spyware Sold to Governments Behind Recent iOS Zero-Days GO Apple fixes three zero-days used by Pegasus spyware Aug 25, 2016 23:25 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Earlier today, Apple released iOS 9.3.5 to fix "important security issues," as the company described them. Reports from Citizen Lab and Lookout released after Apple's announcement show that these "important security issues" were three iOS zero-days used to spy on political dissidents across the world. According to the two organizations, the zero-days were part of a software suite called Pegasus, developed and sold by Israeli company NSO Group to governments around the world, which deployed it against targets of interest. Pegasus, described as surveillance software developed for law enforcement agencies, is nothing different from spyware developed and sold on underground hacking forums. Governments, security vendors, and news agencies knew of Pegasus and NSO's existence for many years, but the company has always been outshined by its more powerful competitors, Gamma Group, which sells FinFisher, and HackingTeam which sells the RCS surveillance package. Apple patched zero-days that enabled Pegasus spying features Apple released a fix today to address Pegasus features that allowed it to spy on iOS users without them ever being aware. These features were powered by three zero-days that allowed a remote attacker to compromise iOS devices by fooling a victim into accessing a malicious website. Once the zero-day exploit code was executed, the attacker would use the Pegasus software to control the victim's iPhone or iPad. According to Lookout, the attackers had full control over the device, and could exfiltrate data, listen on conversations via the microphone, detect the user's GPS position, follow IM conversations, and many more others. Zero-Day Description Exploit Capability CVE-2016-4655 Information leak in Kernel – A kernel base mapping vulnerability that leaks information to the attacker allowing him to calculate the kernel’s location in memory. An application may be able to disclose kernel memory CVE-2016-4657 Kernel Memory corruption leads to Jailbreak – 32 and 64 bit iOS kernel-level vulnerabilities that allow the attacker to silently jailbreak the device and install surveillance software. An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges CVE-2016-4658 Memory Corruption in Webkit – A vulnerability in the Safari WebKit that allows the attacker to compromise the device when the user clicks on a link. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to arbitrary code execution "Pegasus is the most sophisticated attack we’ve seen on any endpoint because it takes advantage of how integrated mobile devices are in our lives and the combination of features only available on mobile," the Lookout team explained. A further, in-depth analysis of Pegasus also revealed traces of a kernel mapping table that has values that target previous iOS version, way back to iOS 7, meaning the spyware was used for years without being detected until this past month. Meet Ahmed Mansoor, the most spied on activist in the world One of the people targeted with Pegasus, and the one that detected something wrong and led to the discovery of the three zero-days, was Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Coincidentally, Mansoor was also targeted in the past with both FinFinsher and RCS spyware. As such, he was able to quickly recognize a phishing lure he received via SMS, which promised new details about torture practices in the UAE. Mansoor forwarded the SMS messages to Citizen Lab, an investigative interdisciplinary laboratory at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, Canada, specialized in political cyber-espionage. Pegasus software also sold to Mexico and Kenya Recognizing the sophisticated campaign behind this SMS message, Citizen Lab brought in Lookout to investigate the technical side of the attack. Lookout discovered the three zero-days, while Citizen Lab connected the zero-days to the Pegasus software and the NSO Group, an Israeli company bought by US firm Francisco Partners in 2014. Citizen Lab tracked down the Pegasus software and discovered export licenses for various governments. The organization tied NSO's Pegasus suite used against a Mexican journalist who uncovered corruption by Mexico's President, and a few attacks against unknown targets in Kenya. "While these spyware tools are developed in democracies, they continue to be sold to countries with notorious records of abusive targeting of human rights defenders," the Citizen Lab team explains. "Such sales occur despite the existence of applicable export controls." Lookout provides a technical look at the three iOS zero-days fixed in iOS 9.3.5 in its report, while Citizen Lab's report focused on the morals and political background behind these recent attacks.

The thwarted attack on the human rights activist, Ahmed Mansoor, used a text message that invited him to click on a web link. Instead of clicking, he forwarded the message to researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. The hack is the first known case of software that can remotely take over a fully up-to-date iPhone 6. Experts at Citizen Lab worked with security company Lookout and determined that the link would have installed a program taking advantage of a three flaws that Apple and others were not aware of. The researchers disclosed their findings on Thursday. "Once infected, Mansoor's phone would have become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone's camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements," Citizen Lab wrote in a report released on Thursday. The researchers said they had alerted Apple a week and a half ago, and the company developed a fix and distributed it as an automatic update to iPhone 6 owners. Apple spokesman Fred Sainz confirmed that the company had issued the patch after being contacted by researchers. The Citizen Lab team attributed the attack software to a private seller of monitoring systems, NSO Group, an Israeli company that makes software for governments which can secretly target mobile phones and gather information. Tools such as that used in this case, a remote exploit for a current iPhone, cost as much as $1 million. NSO Chief Executive Shalev Hulio referred questions to spokesman Zamir Dahbash, who said the company "cannot confirm the specific cases" covered in the Citizen Lab and Lookout reports. Dahbash said NSO sells within export laws to government agencies, which then operate the software. "The agreements signed with the company's customers require that the company's products only be used in a lawful manner," he added. "Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes." Dahbash did not answer follow-up questions, including whether the exposure of the tools use against Mansoor in UAE and a Mexican journalist would end any sales to those countries. NSO has kept a low profile in the security world, despite its 2014 sale of a majority stake for $120 million to California private equity firm Francisco Partners. That company's chief executive, Dipanjan Deb, did not return a call on Thursday. In November 2015, Reuters reported that NSO had begun calling itself "Q" and was looking for a buyer for close to $1 billion. Sarah McKune, senior legal adviser to Citizen Lab, said Israel tries to follow the strictures of the Wassenaar Arrangement, which puts controls on the international sale of nuclear and chemical weapons technology and more recently cyber intrusion tools. NSO may have had to apply for an export license, she added, saying that raised questions about "what consideration was given to the human rights record of UAE." The Israeli embassy in Washington did not respond to an email seeking comment. NSO marketing material says that it also has capabilities for Android and BlackBerry devices. No version of the software has been exposed, indicating it remains effective. Citizen Lab did not directly accuse UAE of carrying out the attack on Mansoor with NSO gear called Pegasus, but it said other NSO attacks on critics of the regime were connected to the government. It also said a Mexican journalist and a minority party politician in Kenya had been targeted with NSO software and that domain names set up for other attacks referred to entities in Uzbekistan, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and other nations, suggesting that other targets lived in those nations. A call to the UAE embassy in Washington was not immediately returned. The market for "lawful intercept," or government hacking tools, has come under increased scrutiny with revelations about authoritarian customers and noncriminal victims. Two popular vendors, Hacking Team of Italy and Gamma Group of the United Kingdom, have had their wares exposed by researchers or hackers. Mansoor had previously been targeted with software from both of those companies, according to Citizen Lab. "I can't think of a more compelling case of serial misuse of lawful intercept malware than the targeting of Mansoor," said one of the Citizen Lab researchers, John Scott-Railton.

Seriously, stop already. A.) It hasn’t happened yet. B.) If it does happen, you have no idea how Apple is going to handle the transition. C.) When it does happen, you’ll get over it. Just like we did with floppy drives, ADB, FireWire, CD/DVD drives, 30-Pin Dock connectors. Look at that list. Every time Apple cut one of those things, everybody and their brother was up in arms. I might have been one of them on the FireWire front. It’s hazy, and I’ve worked hard to let it go. But is there one amongst us who can stand up now and say (with a straight face), “Jeesh, Apple was wrong to ditch [some legacy technology].” I can’t make a case for wanting anything that Apple has dumped on the ash heap of progress. This is, after all, what Apple does. The company pushes relentlessly forward, whether or not we want it to. But in the end, we tend to be pleased as punch when we get there. The Woz Steve Wozniak is the highest-profile complainant. In an interview this week with the Australia Finance Review, Mr. Wozniak said, “If it’s missing the 3.5mm earphone jack, that’s going to tick off a lot of people.” He’s right. It will. And then they’ll get over it. [Edit: geoduck noted in the comments that the Woz also complained about Bluetooth. He’s right about that. Bluetooth isn’t the answer. Lightning connectors are. More on that below. – Bryan] Out with the old The headphone jack is old. It’s prone to being damaged from normal use. It’s a point of egress for liquid into your device. It’s surprisingly big for what it does (when viewed through a modern eye). Using a Lightning connector for our headphones solves all of those issues. The only possibility for legit complaint (in my eyes) is if Apple fails to provide a method for passthrough charging or adapters for legacy headphone jacks. I doubt either will be the case. I will be the first to whine about either of those eventualities, but until we know, there’s just nothing to complain about. For what it’s worth, part of what colors my thoughts here is that I have a pair of Audeze EL-8 Titanium headphones for review. They’re amazeballs, but my point is they came with two cables. The first is a standard headphone jack, and the second comes with a Lightning connector and a built-in digital signal processor (DSP). Audeze-EL-8 Cipher Lightning Cable The Lightning cable works great. It sounds better, too, but without an A/B test, I couldn’t tell you how much can be attributed to the DSP and how much to the Lightning connection. My point is not about how great the very expensive headphones sound, but rather about having practical experience with a Lightning connector. It works wonderfully well, and I haven’t experienced any charging issues despite the lack of a passthrough option. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: Apple, Lightning 8 Comments Add a comment geoduck August 25, 2016 I do agree with Woz on one thing. I hate Bluetooth. A Lightning adapter at a reasonable price would be fine. But I’m not ditching my $120 Skullcandy headphones for some Bluetooth POS that’s always losing pairing or has a dead battery. August 25, 2016 at 6:46 EST PM Bryan Chaffin August 25, 2016 Good point, geoduck. I added a line to the piece about that. Thanks. 🙂 August 25, 2016 at 6:50 EST PM Lee Dronick August 25, 2016 Yeah, we will get over it and the audiophiles will get over it if it doesn’t happen. August 25, 2016 at 8:30 EST PM BurmaYank August 25, 2016 The headphone jack provides an analog audio signal from its device. Without it, there will apparently no longer be any primarily-generated analog sound streaming possible for capture by other (especially recording) devices, so that IMHO the DRM side of the contest between producers & consumers will have thus won a significant battle (even if the only folks affected by this will be a tiny minority of geeks). August 25, 2016 at 9:48 EST PM Lee Dronick August 25, 2016 Good point BurmaYank August 25, 2016 at 10:29 EST PM jfutral August 26, 2016 If the iPhone passes on the DSP handling because lightning doesn’t pass analog audio, then likely all the credit goes to the headphone’s dsp/dac. Joe August 26, 2016 at 9:25 EST AM jfutral August 26, 2016 The only thing that bothers me is most of the writing and proponents of this potential move simply just don’t know what they are talking about when it comes to audio technology. Yes, Apple has a history of ditching legacy COMPUTER technology. AUDIO technology is not the same thing. That analog connector is still around for a very valid reason. Sound is still ultimately analog. The only question is who gets to turn the audio material into the electrical impulses that create the sound—the player or the headphones. As to which is better, that debate has raged, pretty much since the beginning of audio electronics. Apple is not going to solve it with the iPhone. Also, all this talk about Apple pushing the future ignores that all this is available now, as you clearly show. Is it the future of the iPhone? Quite likely. Is it the future of audio? Not anytime soon and likely never. That analog connection is still capable of passing the highest quality audio. If it wasn’t, there would be no benefit to high quality DSPs and DACs because at the end of the line it still has to be converted to analog electrical impulses. You never get away from that last step. An analog connection is only limited by the quality of the DACs used. There is no such thing as digital sound. I agree with Gruber that Apple’s ultimate solution is wireless. That’s their push on everything Apple. And that is the only reason for Apple’s possible move that makes sense. Joe August 26, 2016 at 9:45 EST AM Lee Dronick August 26, 2016 “That analog connection is still capable of passing the highest quality audio” High enough for most uses, and users. I stopped buying any speaker thing that has a dock because every so often Apple changes the connector. Bluetooth works reliably enough and I can always use a mini cord out of the iPhone. When I Bluetooth works reliably enough it depends on the gadget; my Big Jambox works very well and has good range, the Samsung sound bar can lose the connection from 15′ away.

As Twitter buzzed with will-he-or-won’t-he speculation about the imminent release of Frank Ocean’s oft-delayed sophomore album, Blond -- an Apple Music exclusive, paired with pop-up shops in four cities, that officially dropped that Saturday -- the British executive could take little comfort in a UMG act headed straight for the top of the Billboard 200 on the strength of 225,000 to 250,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending Aug. 25. That’s because Ocean -- signed to Def Jam for his previous Grammy-nominated album, 2012’s Channel Orange -- was no longer on the label, having maneuvered out of his contract by reimbursing the company for the $2 million-plus spent on Blond and releasing it to iTunes via his own Boys Don’t Cry imprint. All Def Jam got for its trouble after an anxious four-year wait? A streaming-only “visual album” called Endless, released the day before, that is ineligible for the Billboard 200. But it will fulfill Ocean’s contractual obligation to the label, multiple sources confirm, with one insider asserting that the label had not known about the existence of Blond. Marvels an insider: “He is emancipated, and all proceeds and kudos go directly to Frank. Pretty f---ing ballsy.” 'Bad for the Industry': Spotify's Artist Whisperer Troy Carter Slams Exclusives, Updates Company's Subscriber Total The Ocean salvo comes in the wake of several high-profile UMG artists who, in the last six months, have aligned with streaming services Tidal and Apple for the initial distribution of their music. Among them: Drake (for Views) and Kanye West (The Life of Pablo), and, slightly further back, Ariana Grande (Dangerous Woman), Rihanna (Anti) and U2 (Songs of Innocence). While not every rollout has been smooth (both West and Rihanna saw hiccups upon release -- the former self-inflicted by insisting the album wasn’t ready for consumption, the latter with an accidental leak hours before it officially dropped), it was Ocean’s album that signaled a last straw for Grainge, who in turn issued a corporate mandate to label heads that UMG would no longer allow album exclusives to one platform and on a global basis. Frustration for UMG, the world’s biggest music company, stems from the belief that exclusives inhibit maximum sales and revenue potential. For some artists and managers, however, taking advantage of the streaming companies’ high-stakes, high-spending battle for market share offers a portal into direct deals with retailers that could make an affiliation with labels look redundant. “Artist managers like exclusives because of all the marketing dollars that come with it, but they are being shortsighted and not realizing the opportunities they’re losing,” says one UMG insider, who notes that for Universal label contracts, it is at UMG’s discretion whether to allow an exclusive. (The mandate doesn't apply to distributed labels, who can still use the exclusive strategy, if they so choose.) Troy Carter, Spotify’s global head of creator services and former manager to Meghan Trainor and John Legend, agrees, telling Billboard in a recent interview: “Most labels are getting around to understanding that exclusives aren’t great for the business. As a manager, I would want my artists’ music to be everywhere. When you carve it out to one service, you miss out on fans.” Frank Ocean's Album Is the Straw That Broke Universal Music's Back (And It May Get Him Sued) But while streaming exclusives can hurt a record company’s bottom line, for certain artists -- chief among them Drake, who has the second-largest-selling album of 2016 in the United States, with 1.4 million (only Adele’s 25, with 1.5 million sold this year, is ahead of Views) -- the success of such a campaign is evident. Still, there are those like Russ Crupnick, managing partner of MusicWatch, who question the logic on a more macro level. “There’s been too much conversation about exclusives,” he says. “What is the real core benefit of Tidal? It’s not having a Kanye or Beyoncé exclusive; it’s the fact that I can use it to listen to any kind of music that I want, on demand, in any order. That’s the reason why people sign up for subscriptions.” “It’s the Wild West,” adds one manager of top-tier stars. “Some artists have had great results -- like Beyoncé, Chance the Rapper, Future and Drake -- but they are few and far between. It’s a strange environment right now for most acts, who have to hear, ‘Give us an exclusive even though we’re not going to give you much.’ ” So what do you get when you partner with Apple Music, which boasts 15 million paid subscribers? A hefty advance, a dedicated marketing spend, premium placement atop the iTunes store, maybe a TV commercial and a Beats Radio show in addition to the less immediately tangible bonuses like additional paid media connected to the release, global exposure and barters that might incorporate social media campaigns. Says one insider familiar with Apple’s positioning: “They’ll literally throw everything they can at it. You can’t get to No. 1 on Spotify alone.” Tidal, on the other hand, whose exclusives are limited to equity partner artists like founder Jay Z and wife Beyonce, Kanye West and Rihanna, offers a media buy valued at as much as $4 million. Witness the slew of outdoor billboard ads for Rihanna’s latest album Anti. Spotify with its 35 million subscribers (more than 70 million of them using the service for free) has not yet engaged in the exclusivity war, opting to wait out windowing with a one-and-all ethos. But aligning with the Swedes has its perks: optimal placement near or on popular playlists, promotion and marketing support -- initiatives you can attach a dollar amount to. “Rather than saying, ‘We want your music exclusively, they’ll say, ‘We want you to get behind the platform and we’ll give you X amount of money to promote on the platform or to use for video content and so on,’” a source explains, adding that if Spotify does get shut out by an exclusive, they might “bury” your act or “not promote your artist and that can be extremely damaging.” Apple Music Signs Deal With Birdman, Cash Money Records So far, reaction to UMG’s edict has been one of support, as the UK’s Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA), representing digital music services and music retailers, stated on Aug. 24. “We have long believed that a level playing field is the key to healthy competition in the entertainment market,” said CEO Kim Bayley, adding that ERA’s members believe that exclusivity deals are “confusing for consumers, potentially threaten the growth of the music streaming market and disadvantage physical retailers.” French-owned streamer Deezer, which recently launched in the U.S., had a similar take. "We want to offer our users the best possible experience, and support artists by providing a fair and legal streaming service," the company said in a statement on Aug. 25. "We believe exclusives often compromise both of these by encouraging piracy and locking users into services they don’t want. While exclusives provide a short term benefit to the service, they ultimately pose more limitations on musicians creating a barrier between artists and their fans.” Indeed, some critics of the exclusivity model contend that such practices could be viewed as anti-trust with Apple at the head of the potential-monopoly leaderboard. “There’s a need for a level playing-ground,” says one such detractor. “Overweighted positioning hurts non-exclusive acts, of which every major has many." But it remains to be seen whether other releases upcoming for Universal might become a point of contention as new albums are lined up for the fourth quarter -- one to watch: Interscope artist Lady Gaga -- or whether competitors Sony, which has seen successful launches with exclusives by Future and DJ Khaled, and Warner Music Group (which, on a group level, doesn't have a unified stance on streaming) will follow along. “It’s a pivotal time for all labels again,” says a high-ranking executive. “Maybe the most important sea-change since Napster.” With reporting by Dan Rys and Ed Christman A version of this article was first published in the Sept. 3 issue of Billboard.

Human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor alerted Citizen Lab to the spyware. Photo: Jon Gambrell, Associated Press Apple boosts iPhone security after Mideast spyware discovery 1 / 1 Back to Gallery PARIS — A botched attempt to break into the iPhone of an Arab human rights defender using hitherto unknown espionage software has led to a global upgrade of Apple’s mobile operating system, researchers said Thursday. The spyware took advantage of three previously undisclosed weaknesses in Apple’s mobile operating system to take control of iPhone devices, according to reports published Thursday by San Francisco’s Lookout smartphone security company and Internet watchdog group Citizen Lab. Both reports fingered the NSO Group, an Israeli company with a reputation for flying under the radar, as the author of the spyware. “The threat actor has never been caught before,” said Mike Murray, a researcher with Lookout, describing the program as “the most sophisticated spyware package we have seen in the market.” The reports issued by Lookout and Citizen Lab outlined how an iPhone could be completely compromised with the tap of a finger, a trick so coveted in the world of cyberespionage that in November, a spyware broker said it had paid a $1 million dollar bounty to programmers who’d found a way to do it. Such a compromise would give hackers full control over the phone, allowing them to eavesdrop on calls, harvest messages, activate cameras and microphones and drain the device of its personal data. Arie van Deursen, a professor of software engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, said both reports are credible and disturbing. Forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski described the malicious program as a “serious piece of spyware.” In response, Apple released a patched version of its mobile software, iOS 9.3.5. Users can get the patch through a normal software update. But the security hole may have gone unpatched had it not been for the wariness of an embattled campaigner for human rights in the United Arab Emirates. Ahmed Mansoor, a well-known human rights defender, alerted Citizen Lab to the spyware after receiving an unusual text message on Aug. 10. Promising to reveal details about torture in the United Arab Emirates’ prisons, the unknown sender included a suspicious-looking link. Mansoor wasn’t convinced. Not only had he been imprisoned, beaten, robbed and had his passport confiscated by the authorities over the years, Mansoor had also repeatedly found himself in the crosshairs of electronic eavesdropping operations. In fact, Mansoor already had the dubious distinction of having weathered attacks from two separate brands of commercial spyware. And when he shared the suspicious text with Citizen Lab researcher Bill Marczak, they realized he’d been hit by a third. Marczak, who’d already been looking into the NSO Group, said he and fellow researcher John Scott-Railton turned to Lookout for help picking apart the malicious program, a process which Murray compared to “defusing a bomb.” “It is amazing the level they’ve gone through to avoid detection,” he said of the software’s makers. “They have a hair-trigger self-destruct.” Working feverishly over a two-week period, the researchers found that Mansoor’s phone had been infected by an unusually sophisticated piece of software which probably cost a small fortune to arm. “Ahmed Mansoor is a million-dollar human rights defender,” Scott-Railton said. In a statement that stopped short of acknowledging that the spyware was its own, the NSO Group said its mission was to provide “authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime.” The company said it had no knowledge of any particular incidents. It said it would not make any further comment. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

This particular board was not part of a known production run, and was never sold to the public. The Apple-1 is the very first Apple computer, the first personal computer marketed to consumers, and the first Apple product in history. To build it, Steve Jobs sold his only means of getting around, a Volkswagen Microbus, and Steve Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator. Related: How Steve Jobs changed everything, and what we’ll miss without him The auction, held on CharityBuzz, was for the computer and a variety of accessories. They include: Apple-1 4K Byte RAM Expansion Memory (total of 8K). Apple-1 Cassette Interface Daughter Board (4 by 2 inches). Apple-1 BASIC Program Cassette Tape (4 by 2.5 inches). Apple-1 Star Trek and Blackjack Program Cassette Tape (4″ by 2.5 inches). All original manuals and fliers. Sales receipt from previous owner to current owner. Notarized condition summary report for “Celebration” Apple-1 board by Corey Cohen (31-page written and photo authentication documentation of the system). Video record of Corey performing the authentication and evaluation of the “Celebration” Apple-1. Professional detailed images of the “Celebration” Apple-1. Back in 1976, the Apple-1 sold for $666.66 at The Byte Shop in Mountain View, California. This particular Apple-1 is not currently in working condition, but it could be restored with a few tweaks. Cohen recommends against making those tweaks, however, as that would change what makes this board unique. This “Celebration” model doesn’t seem to be part of any production run, and seems likely to be an experimental build by Wozniak to test the manufacturing process. It’s heatsink is smaller than that used on other Apple-1 boards, so Wozniak may have added a bigger heatsink after testing this board. It’s unclear. Whatever the story is, this is a rare bit of Apple history, not to mention computing history. We hope the new owners will let us check it out some time.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Former students fondly remember popular Apple Valley High teacher Robert Brimhall Thursday Aug 25, 2016 at 3:55 PM Aug 25, 2016 at 4:54 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — A former English teacher who impacted the lives of many students and forged the beginning of one local high school is being remembered. Former student and current college professor Ruth Nolan said many are mourning the passing of Robert Brimhall, a longtime teacher who taught at Apple Valley High School for the first 29 years of its existence. “He was such an important part of the history of Apple Valley High School, from its opening years until he retired from teaching,” Nolan said. “Many valley locals were influenced by his teaching over the years in the High Desert.” Poet-artist Celeste Goyer, a 1979 AVHS alumnus, told the Daily Press that her "partner and fellow creative collaborator" of 25 years died in a Morro Bay hospital on Aug. 10, just four days after his 76th birthday. “He was a well-loved teacher who inspired students with his enthusiasm for literature and zest for adventure,” Goyer said. “Mr. Brimhall inspired many of his students to go on to their own teaching careers or pursue writing as a profession.” Apple Valley Unified School District Assistant Superintendent, Educational Services Pat Schlosser, who graduated from AVHS in 1990, said he has fond memories of Brimhall, who was his 11th grade English teacher. "He helped inspire in me an appreciation of literature, critical thinking and taking a different view," Schlosser said. "I can remember several of his lessons to this day." Nolan said her brother, John, who was good friends with Brimhall, was with him until the end. The former AVHS teacher was hospitalized after he collapsed due to a heart attack. “Bob was a great teacher and I have great gratitude for being in some of the amazing classes he taught at AVHS,” said John Nolan, who graduated in 1979. “He really brought out the best in everyone. He was one of the all time great conversationalists and I was lucky to have him for a mentor and friend.” Former AVHS journalism teacher Diane Peterson, who taught at AVHS in the ‘70s and ‘80s, also spent time with Brimhall while he was the hospital, John Nolan said. According to several of Brimhall’s former students, who later became friends, the popular English teacher also played tuba and baritone in symphonies, wrote poems and “drove the hell out of anything with two wheels or four, and could explain the life cycle of any landform.” In 1976, Brimhall helped organize an in-service workshop where more than 75 teachers from six schools gathered at AVHS to focus on methods of teaching the subjects of reading, writing, science, math, social studies and other subjects. One panel speaker’s central theme was dubbed "Teach a Child to Read and Save His Life." Goyer said the former teacher was the classic “leather-jacket 1950's juvenile delinquent as a teenager,” who attended San Diego State University and graduated with degrees in literature and geography. During the summers, Brimhall dug ditches for the gas company, then moved into the drafting office. In college, he pledged Kappa Sigma fraternity, Epsilon Iota chapter. He played baritone and tuba in his high school marching band, and was a member of the youth symphony and the brass choir at San Diego State. After graduation, Brimhall was hired at Victor Valley Senior High in 1966. When the AVHS campus was completed in 1967, he moved to the new school where he taught grammar and composition, creative writing, advanced composition, American literature and other English classes until his retirement in 1996. He was also the ski club adviser for many years. Goyer said Brimhall's passions were travel, motorcycles, sports cars, target shooting, correspondence and conversation. "After the last class in June, he prided himself on being the first dust cloud out of town as he headed out on his famous summer trips around the West, usually with a trailer full of motorcycles pulled by a classic 1960 or 1961 Corvette convertible," Goyer said. Brimhall. who was born in La Mesa, was married to former wife, Lucille Ebel. During his life, he resided in Lucerne Valley, Big Bear, Bishop and Cambria. His final years were spent in Grover Beach, on the Central Coast, where he enjoyed riding his motorcycle, writing poetry and corresponding with friends. He is survived by his brother Richard Brimhall, of Payson, Utah, his nephew William Brimhall and many cousins. There was no memorial service held for Brimhall by his request. His ashes will be scattered in Apple Valley, according to Goyer. Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at 760-951-6227, RDeLa Cruz@VVDailyPress.com or on Twitter @DP_ReneDeLaCruz.

 A report says it found routine abuse of overtime rules at one of Apple’s suppliers in China Steve Kovach Aug. 25, 2016, 6:29 PM 1,522 facebook linkedin twitter email print Pegatron facilities in China.AP A new report from watchdog group China Labor Watch (CLW) says Apple's overtime policies are routinely violated at one of the third-party factories where iPhones are made. The CLW report says many workers at Pegatron, which is based in China, are working more hours than Apple allows. Apple's policy says supply chain workers can't work more than 60 hours per week and should have at least one day per week off. CLW found several instances where workers clocked more than 80 hours of work per week and some cases where interns were able to get overtime pay even though they aren't allowed to. According to CLW, Pegatron workers feel forced to go for overtime because base wages are low and they need the overtime pay to get by. CLW says it interviewed approximately 100 Pegatron workers in 2015 and 2016 for the report and reviewed their pay stubs. In April, Bloomberg reporter Shai Oster visited Pegatron and wrote that the factory now institutes ID checks to make sure workers don't take too much overtime. CLW's report claims Oster's visit was carefully crafted and didn't allow access to areas where workers abused the overtime system. Apple and Pegatron did not immediately respond to requests for comment. You can read the full CLW report here.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple is still damned if it does and damned if it doesn’t Yoni Heisler •August 25, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share For years, Apple has been held to a completely different standard than the rest of the tech industry. Whereas a company like Google can pursue and then shutter any number of ambitious “moonshots” and ultimately be applauded for their efforts, Apple is routinely criticized for not coming up with a device as revolutionary as the iPhone every 5 years. In a broad sense, Apple is forced to endure a level of criticism that no other tech company on the planet has to deal with. DON'T MISS: New video goes behind the scenes of an iPhone 7 leak for the first time ever To be fair, a good deal of the attention and scrutiny directed at Apple is not undeserved. After all, the company over the past few decades helped transform not one but three separate industries. That being the case, it’s only natural for expectations surrounding Apple to be a little bit higher than it is for others. But sometimes the critiques flowing in Apple’s direction become so ludicrous that we have to pause, take a step back, and point out just how absurd the tech press can become. Recently, Apple executives, along with two Siri scientists, sat down for a fascinating interview with Steven Levy of Backchannel. The piece provided an incredible glimpse into some of the work Apple is doing in the field of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. For a company as notoriously secretive as Apple, the informative expose was a must-read for anyone who follows the company in particular or the tech industry at large. Not only was the piece informative from a technical perspective, it provided no shortage of details explaining how Apple's ongoing work in AI has helped improve the overall iPhone user experience. But in quick order, it didn’t take long for critics to start taking jabs at Apple for an ostensible PR piece that tech companies all across Silicon Valley routinely engage in. From Amazon and Microsoft to Google and Facebook, every major tech company you can think often make its top executives available for what are effectively “let us brag about our technology” features. And that’s all great and entertaining, but when Apple does it, it’s because there’s a problem. In fact, in the wake of the aforementioned Backchannel piece, some people went so far as to either imply or outright state that Apple never engaged in this type of desperate PR when Steve Jobs was around. Yes, it’s 2016 and some people still can’t help but compare everything Apple does to what they think Apple would have done if Steve Jobs was still alive. It’s pure nonsense, but Apple today still finds itself stuck in a “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” predicament. To wit, here's Owen Williams' take. https://twitter.com/ow/status/768459027865034752 It was actually one of the more substantive looks inside Apple we've seen in a long time. And here, Om Malik yearns for the Apple of yore. https://twitter.com/om/status/768542066955554816 Curiously, Malik just a few weeks ago had this to say: I was on Leo Laporte’s TWIT show yesterday and ended up going on a bit of a rant about Apple and “Planet of the Apps.” My view on “content” efforts like this is pretty simple. It is distracting, non-core to Apple and basically avoids the bigger challenges: how to add data and Internet DNA into a company that has managed to struggle with services. The App Store needs more smarts and better search, and it needs to take a contemporary, data-centric approach to surfacing apps. “Planet of the Apps” is just an old media-like thinking applied to “apps.” I might be the only one who feels that way, but the reality is that these kinds of efforts are really not good for Apple at a time when it is competing with Google, Amazon and Facebook. So Apple comes in with a math-heavy piece where they detail some of the advanced AI things they're implementing across the entirety of their software suite and Malik has a problem with that too? One rebuttal to Malik's tweet worth mentioning reads: https://twitter.com/roo_44/status/768633953141952512 For years we heard complaints that Apple was too secretive, that we didn’t really get a sense of who ran the company, save of course for Steve Jobs. With Tim Cook at the helm, Apple has done an impressive job of becoming more open, transparent and even friendly with the press. Still, the criticisms come in from all angles. As another illustrative example, consider this: Mashable earlier this summer criticized Apple for improving the Apple Watch UI, essentially arguing that there wouldn't have even been a problem to fix if Steve Jobs was still around. So it goes in Apple-land.

LEGAL ISSUES Apple Could Be Facing a $19 Billion Tax Bill From the European Commission The U.S. Treasury Department defended the tech giant and other American companies under investigation for their tax deals. By Kif Leswing Business Insider WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The European Commission is expected to levy a judgment against Apple in the next few months that could total in the billions of euros. JPMorgan has estimated that Apple could be on the hook for as much as $19 billion--or about 17 billion euros--the Financial Times reports. The commission is accusing Apple of striking a sweetheart tax deal with Ireland, in which the iPhone maker would move its profits to wholly owned Irish subsidiaries to reduce its corporate taxes. Apple has one major defender in its corner, though: the US Treasury Department and, by extension, the Obama administration. The Treasury released a white paper on Wednesday, commissioned by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, that did not mince words while defending American companies, including Apple, Starbucks, and Amazon. It says that the Brussels-based investigation of Apple is "supranational" and essentially accused the European Commission of executing a power grab and unfairly targeting American companies. Here's the money quote from the paper (emphasis added): "The U.S. Treasury Department continues to consider potential responses should the Commission continue its present course. A strongly preferred and mutually beneficial outcome would be a return to the system and practice of international tax cooperation that has long fostered cross-border investment between the United States and EU Member States." Tax is one of the biggest and most touchy policy issues for Apple. Congress investigated Apple's tax arrangements in 2013, which led to CEO Tim Cook testifying before a US Senate subcommittee. Apple has billions of dollars held offshore that it would love to bring back to the US, but Cook has said that he thinks the system is unfair. "The money that's in Ireland that he's probably referring to is money that is subject to U.S. taxes. The tax law right now says we can keep that in Ireland or we can bring it back," Cook told The Washington Post. "We've said at 40 percent, we're not going to bring it back until there's a fair rate. There's no debate about it. Is that legal to do or not legal to do? It is legal to do. It is the current tax law." "It's important for everyone to understand that the allegation made in the E.U. is that Ireland gave us a special deal. Ireland denies that," Cook said. Based on the release of Wednesday's paper, it sounds as if Apple can continue to rely on the Treasury's support while navigating this multibillion transatlantic spat.

Apple today issued a critical update to iOS, version 9.3.5, which patches three zero-day exploits that were first discovered in the wild in an attack against human rights advocate Ahmed Mansoor. Apple patched CVE-2016-4655, a kernel memory disclosure issue with the iOS kernel; CVE-2016-4656, a memory corruption vulnerability in the iOS kernel; and CVE-2016-4657, a memory corruption issue in the WebKit browser rendering engine. Apple credits security research organization Citizen Lab and security firm Lookout with reporting the issue. Citizen Lab, a research group within the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, has a history of helping to identify attacks against human rights advocates. Mansoor, who is based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), contacted Citizen Lab after receiving a pair of messages he thought were suspicious. "On August 10 and 11, 2016, Mansoor received SMS text messages on his iPhone promising 'new secrets' about detainees tortured in UAE jails if he clicked on an included link," Citizen Lab wrote in a report. "Instead of clicking, Mansoor sent the messages to Citizen Lab researchers.  We recognized the links as belonging to an exploit infrastructure connected to NSO Group, an Israel-based 'cyber war' company that sells Pegasus, a government-exclusive 'lawful intercept' spyware product. " Citizen Lab then collaborated with Lookout to investigate the actual attack, which is how the three zero-day flaws in iOS were unraveled. The three vulnerabilities combine to enable an exploit chain that Citizen Lab is now calling Trident. The Trident attack would have enabled the attackers to spy on Mansoor's phone and gain access to the device's camera and microphone as well as its location. "The high cost of iPhone zero-days, the apparent use of NSO Group's government-exclusive Pegasus product, and prior known targeting of Mansoor by the UAE government provide indicators that point to the UAE government as the likely operator behind the targeting," Citizen Lab stated. Lookout has published a comprehensive technical analysis of the Pegasus spyware package that the NSO Group sells, which includes the Trident vulnerabilities. "The espionage software contains malicious code, processes, and apps that are used to spy, collect data, and report back what the user does on the device," Lookout's analysis explains. The new iOS flaws come at a particularly interesting time, as Apple announced a bug bounty program at the Black Hat USA conference on Aug. 4. Third-party firms including Zerodium and Exodus Intelligence also offer bounties for iOS, with Zerodium reportedly paying out $1 million for an iOS zero-day exploit. The FBI reportedly paid $1.3 million for help from a third-party security firm in unlocking an iPhone earlier this year. Given the high value of iOS vulnerabilities, Lookout believes the Trident attack and use of Pegasus is very targeted. "We believe this kind of software is very targeted, meaning the purchaser is likely to be both well-funded and specifically motivated," Mike Murray, vice president of Security Research & Response at Lookout, wrote. "The going price for Pegasus was roughly $8 million for 300 licenses, so it's not likely to be used against an average mobile device user, only targets that can be considered of high value."

Billy Steele , @wmsteele 08.25.16 in AV Comments 554 Shares Share Tweet Share Save REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni Apple Music and Tidal have tapped into exclusive releases to gain the upper hand on Spotify over the last year, but it appears one major record label may have had enough. Frank Ocean released his long-awaited follow-up to 2012's Channel Orange on Apple Music over the weekend, an album that should top the charts this week. However, Blond has apparently caused quite a stir with Ocean's label Def Jam and its parent company Universal Music Group. In fact, Billboard reports that UMG CEO Lucian Grainge has informed the heads of Universal's labels that streaming service exclusives are a thing of the past for their artists. This report comes after Ocean released his visual album Endless with Def Jam as an Apple Music exclusive the day before the full-length Blond debuted. That visual album isn't for sale, but Blond is and it was released independently of Def Jam/Universal on Frank Ocean's own Boys Don't Cry imprint. Billboard says it's unclear if the release of Ocean's latest record directly influenced the change in policy or if it was simply one of many factors for the revised strategy. What's more, Billboard reports that Ocean paid a $2 million advance back to the label that essentially bought the 17-song album back and allowed him to fulfill his contractual obligations to Universal with what is basically an extended music video. We reached out to Universal Music Group for a comment on the matter and we'll update this article when/if we hear back. The 24-hour turnaround is certainly cause for question, but Billboard's sources indicate that Universal Music Group isn't currently seeking any legal action against Ocean or members of his team. Of course, by releasing the album independently through Apple, he stands to get a bigger piece of the revenues from it. A figure Billboard says increased from 17 to 40 percent when he decided to make the move. Def Jam is also home to Jay Z, Kanye West and Rihanna, the latter two having released exclusive albums on Tidal that hit the top spot on the Billboard 200 chart. Drake's Views from the 6 was a timed exclusive on Apple Music for Universal through the Cash Money/Young Money label and it too hit number 1 on Billboard's album chart. Perhaps what's more interesting than a major record label potentially refusing to offer new releases as timed exclusives is how Apple Music is essentially functioning as a record label. Two of Apple's latest high-profile exclusives, Chance the Rapper's Coloring Book and Ocean's Blond, were both released independent of a regular record label. Don't forget: Apple's Jimmy Iovine came over in the Beats deal and he was the co-founder of Interscope Records. Thanks to some tweaks to Billboard's charts that count a certain number of streams as an album sale, Coloring Book was the first streaming-only album to make the Billboard 200 chart. It will be interesting to see if other artists take a similar route or if labels are indeed fed up with the notion of exclusive releases all together.

For years, this cash has been building up due to the company’s massive success in global sales,” Kumquat Research writes for Seeking Alpha. “However, U.S. tax law states that profits American-based corporations earn beyond the country’s borders are to be taxed at the U.S. corporate tax rate of 35% when those profits are brought back to the states, or repatriated.” “Many companies think this is a unfair tax policy and so it has become common practice for large corporations to keep cash earned overseas ‘indefinitely reinvested’ to avoid paying the 35% tax. Apple’s cash pile accounts for close to 10% of the more than $2 trillion in profits U.S. corporations currently hold offshore, so repatriation tax reform that allows Apple to bring its cash home should be seen as a huge positive catalyst for AAPL shares should reform actually come to pass,” Kumquat Research writes. “Is this likely to happen anytime soon? I think it will.” “Both presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have proposed massive infrastructure spending on a scale that candidates haven’t proposed in a long while. Infrastructure has never been sexy, but now it has come into the spotlight as the crumbling nature of America’s roads, bridges, tunnels and other structures have become abundantly clear,” Kumquat Research writes. “Clinton has proposed $275 billion in infrastructure spending and Trump has proposed more than double that. How do they propose to pay for this spending? Trump has explicitly mentioned repatriation while Clinton has discussed business tax reform, likely an implicit reference to repatriation.” It is the best interest of “both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, to get repatriation reform done as quickly as possible so that other countries cannot make claims to the overseas cash of corporations that would pay U.S. taxes if they weren’t so high,” Kumquat Research writes. “With this catalyst and the need for funds to spend on infrastructure, repatriation reform seems imminent. Once it happens, the influx of cash for Apple will be a huge boon for the company and stock as well.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Again, if the EU demands so-called “back taxes” from Apple, it’ll be based invisible legal grounds since the company simply followed the law when paying their taxes: There was no special deal that we cut with Ireland. We simply followed the laws in the country over the 35 years that we have been in Ireland. If the question is, was there ever a ‘quid pro quo’ that we were trying to strike with the Irish government – that was never the case. We’ve always been very transparent with the Irish government that we wanted to be a good corporate citizen… If countries change the tax laws, we will abide by the new laws and we will pay taxes according to those laws. – Apple CFO Luca Maestri As we wrote back in April: Apple has repeatedly and confidently stated that they didn’t do anything that was against the law. Therefore, unless the EC tries to change the law retroactively, if that’s even possible, or tries to collect taxes retroactively in some other fashion, Apple is in the clear.

Canadian Observer Saturday, August 27, 2016 - 1:56 pm · Reply I really wanted Bernie to win. He was too clean and honest for the job, apparently. Despite decades of trying, nobody has brought any charges up against Hillary. Her sin is that she’s been effective in playing the political games just as any slimy politician does. But nothing worse than hypocritical pathological liars like the GOP leadership, and certainly nothing as tacky and immature as the crap Trump spouts daily. I know, everything is the fault of the leader. We should all personally blame Cook for the dumb ass mistake that one of Ive’s designers made when he moved the power button on the iPhone from the top to the side directly across from the volume buttons. We should all curse Cook personally for that. So it goes with all presidents and presidential candidates. Just as partisan assholes personally blamed FDR for Pearl Harbor, the same lunatic fringe assumes Clinton was personally involved in Libya. Do you really think any leader has that close attention to detail with real time impact? Not a chance. GWB was too stunned during story time to do ANYTHING at the time of the 9/11/2001 tragedy. Mid-level response was instant, but the president was mentally AWOL. The right wing was silent. Later GWB sends >5000 Americans to their death in an offensive retaliatory invasion of Iraq, and the right wing cheers. Under the Obama administration, Sasam Hussein is captured, the troops are mostly returned home, but 4 people die in an embassy due to lack of communication on the part of a mid-level bureaucrat, and the right wingers bring out he pitchforks for Hillary and Obama. Consistency? No, what we hear instead from paid partisan hacks like botvinnick and First-whatever is brainless attacks without any evidence of legal wrongdoing. Quick to judge the other side, zero admittance of failures for the home team. You may not like Hillary, but if you can’t bring evidence of lawbreaking, then STFU. Same goes for Trump critics.

JimBob Thursday, August 25, 2016 - 8:50 pm · Reply The sooner the better, too. I am sick of paying the real costs of coal. The market price of coal is cheap, but the societal cost is higher than any form of energy. Start with the miners who suffer from black lung disease – not only have the coal companies systematically used doctors on their payroll to avoid paying claims (see https://www.publicintegrity.org/2013/10/29/13585/coal-industrys-go-law-firm-withheld-evidence-black-lung-expense-sick-miners ), think about what a black lung disease payment is – you get money that corresponds to the years of your life lost because of your (preventable) exposure to coal dust in the mines and processing facilities. And while you only get the benefit if you are totally disabled from your employment in the coal industry, you do are not eligible for any disability payments, long-term care etc. and every dollar you do get paid offsets your other federal benefits such as Social Security. Black lung disease has has been a cause or contributing factor in the death of more than 76,000 miners since 1968. Add in hundreds of electrocutions, crush injuries, mechanical entanglements, rollovers and whatnot to that total. At the mine site itself, there’s all kinds of environmental mayhem going on – streams being filled in and poisoned, entire mountaintops blasted off, strip mining, etc. and the supposed “reclamation” of the land leaves behind land completely unsuitable for any activity or ecosystem. They tried building a federal prison on one of these mountaintop removal sites (Big Sandy) – The $2 million project went over budget by close $40 million because the fill they built it on was so unstable, it caused all kinds of cracks and foundation problems. Our taxpayer dollars at work. Further, coal trucks routinely travel state and federal highways grossly overloaded, adding millions of dollars of road maintenance fees and expenses that the taxpayer picks up. And on the way to their delivery point, these poorly maintained and overweight trucks have killed hundreds of average folks who happened to be traveling on the same road. Their shattered lives, disabilities and whatever are all picked up by someone else. Coal-fired power plants are the most polluting energy source on the planet. The CO2 issue (anthropogenic climate change is settled science; dont even start) alone would be bad enough, but the average coal plant emits more radioactivity than a comparable nuclear plant, and spews mercury into the environment where it bioaccumulates. The air pollution alone causes or exacerbates hundreds of thousands of asthma cases each year and contributes annually to up 15,000 premature deaths in the US alone. All at no charge to the coal or power company who can freely pollute. Once you’re done burning the coal, you’re left with fly ash. Which by any definition of the term is hazardous waste but, thanks to coal company lobbyists, is exempt from those regulations. It’s dumped anywhere and everywhere – and every year or two a giant slurry pond wipes out another town or ecosystem with taxpayers or ratepayers picking up the tab. Uncovered piles of coal ash laden with heavy metals run off into our ecosystem, or just fly on the winds. Any number of towns, prisons, and more are on or adjacent to these piles with predictable health consequences, all picked up, again, by the taxpayer. If coal were taxed to cover the full societal impact it would more expensive than all other forms of energy by an order of magnitude. All that said, we do need a very small amount of anthracite coal for steel making and related activities, but using this stuff to supply energy is just a horrid and immoral choice. botvinnik✓ᵀᴿᵁᴹᴾ Thursday, August 25, 2016 - 9:20 pm · Reply “In 2015, the United States generated about 4 trillion kilowatthours of electricity.

JimBob Friday, August 26, 2016 - 11:03 am · Reply Ah, yes, once again, you are unable to provide a cogent response or rebuttal so you respond with name calling. Most of us figured out by fourth grade that means you have nothing valid to say. As to the first paragraph of your response, I never said get rid of fossil fuels – I said get rid of coal. As you repeatedly do on this forum, you are rebutting words that the previous commenter never said. To use the words of your idol, it’s sad, really sad. The US can easily dump coal today with a mix of natural gas, nuclear as well as renewables. Our reliance on coal has dropped to record-low levels in just a few years and all from market forces. In fact, the solar energy sector currently employs more people than coal, without endangering the public health in the process: http://fortune.com/2015/01/16/solar-jobs-report-2014/ Solar energy has tremendous potential to supply a large fraction of our energy needs, but, of course, it needs to be part of a broad-based strategy that provides full-time demand and a diversified supply structure. My solar system draws from the grid at night (when natural gas and nuclear provide power), but during the day, I supply the grid with excess production. botvinnik✓ᵀᴿᵁᴹᴾ Friday, August 26, 2016 - 11:05 am · Reply JimBob, here’s what I want you to do…go to your breaker box in your house, turn off everything for a week.

One mine. It’s going to take time to break this addiction. JimBob Friday, August 26, 2016 - 11:22 am · Reply Yes it will take time, but solar alone is already producing energy equivalent to dozens of conventional power plants. There are now at least six states with more than 1 GW of installed solar capacity. While most people think of Arizona, California and other sunny states as prime locations, even states like New Jersey have gotten in on this action – NJ has over 1.7 GW of capacity (approximately equal to 3-4 conventional plants and enough to supply well over 250,000 homes) and will double that within five years. That’s twice the install rate over the previous five year period. NJ currently is targeting to meet 24.5% of their electric energy needs with renewables by 2020 and many other states have similarly ambitious goals: http://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/renewable-portfolio-standards.aspx See also http://www.seia.org/research-resources/top-10-solar-states Obviously, renewables are not the only answer, but they can easily put coal to bed.

With time and priper cleanup West Virginia could become a very attractive place for recreation, second homes and such. Colorado was once dependent upon mining but has transitioned away from it. Renewables are now as inexpensive as fossil fuels without subsidy. That said, the bigger challenge will be energy efficiency as the smount of natural resources needed and build rate for solar and wind with storage show it mistly a pipe dream.

The first budget Obama signed had an obscene $1.7 trillion deficit — four times as big as the previously biggest budget deficit.

Like it or not, GWB’s legacy will be one of permanent war and the debt that came with it.

Wrong Again Friday, August 26, 2016 - 10:33 am · Reply I believe you’ll find that’s the way it was. A long time ago, companies that were making most of their money in the US were being taxed US rates plus whatever the other country was charging. Those companies lobbied to have the laws changed so they were only taxed on that money IF they brought it back to the US. Shortsighted, yes, but the law we have now is the one US companies wanted. They didn’t foresee a time when they’d make THAT much more over operating costs overseas. I actually wonder why congress in it’s current state wouldn’t be able to pass another bill, like the Jobs creation bill in 2004 to lower the repatriation rate below the 5.25% it is now?

Initial estimates pegged a value of over $1 million for the computer, but the auction today came to a close with a final selling price of $815,000. 10 percent of the proceeds from the Charitybuzz auction will benefit the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Near the end of the auction, the Apple I reached a peak of $1.2 million, but the final bid was apparently cancelled at the very last second, giving the device a final sale price of $815,000 with 39 bids. The “Celebration” Apple I model was unique in that it featured a blank “green” PCB board, suggesting that it was not part of the two known production runs of the Apple I. This means that it was potentially built before the production runs, perhaps part of a pre-production test. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak confirmed himself that Apple never sold an Apple I with a blank PCB board, while historian Corey Cohen called this Apple I one of the “most unique” units he’d ever seen. This particular Apple I is believed to have been manufactured sometime during the summer of 1976. Apple-related auctions have long garnered huge amounts on Charitybuzz. Earlier this year, an auction for lunch with Tim Cook raised $515,000. Previously, Cook auctions have pulled in $200,000 in 2015, $330,001 in 2014, and $610,000 in 2013. Other Apple executives have also offered up lunch meetings, including Eddy Cue, Apple Music exec Bozoma Saint John, and Beats Music’s Ian Rogers. Apple also offered up a campus tour last year. 10 percent of the auction price from the Apple I listing will benefit The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society to help support LLS research, patient services, advocacy, public and professional education, and community services.

And while the vast majority of iPhone owners are probably on iOS 9 right now — and should install that version right away — the sudden release left some uncertainty around iOS 10. Are developers and public beta testers running the preview version of Apple's next big software release at risk? Not at all, according to the company, so long as you've got the latest beta installed. "The exploits are addressed in the latest iOS 10 seed," an Apple spokesperson told The Verge. That's either beta 7 if you're a developer or beta 6 if you're in the public test. Definitely update to that if you're running a previous iOS 10 beta seed. The malware in question, which was detailed in a report from Citizen Lab and Lookout security, is a serious compromise that’s never been observed against iOS devices before. But you can guard your devices and your personal data against the latest security threat simply by heading to settings and hitting the update button. iOS 10 public beta first look Source: Apple Next Up In Circuit Breaker These stickers have a unique fingerprint, so you can unlock your phone with your gloves on Spinn coffee thinks it’s better than pods, but who is really above pods?

This system was detailed in a new patent application published today and suggests Apple may incorporate some version of the technology into future iPhones and iPads. The company imagines a system by which a "trigger condition" would result in the collection of biometric information on whomever is holding the iPhone. These trigger conditions could be unauthorized access from a third-party device or the detection of an unauthorized user attempting to bypass the security features of the phone. This biometric information "may be one or more fingerprints, one or more images of a current user of the computing device, video of the current user, audio of the environment of the computing device, forensic interface use information, and so on," the patent abstract details. "The computing device may then provide the stored biometric information for identification of one or more unauthorized users." Capturing a phone thief's photo and fingerprint contains some legal and technical hurdles There are some technical hurdles here. As it stands today, Apple’s TouchID fingerprint-reading technology requires users to hold down their finger numerous times in a variety of different angles to accurately capture the print. It’s unlikely the company would devise a system that depended entirely on a thief inadvertently pressing their thumb on the home button repeatedly. However, future versions of Touch ID and Apple's fingerprint scanners may be able to collect fingerprints in a more efficient manner. Apps have tried these anti-theft measures before More likely, at least in the near term, is a way to covertly capture photos, video, and audio at a system level, which would allow a stolen iPhone to more easily log who was trying to access its contents and let authorities ID the suspect. Other apps and services have tried this before. For instance, Lookout is an iOS and Android app that automatically snaps photos using a device’s front-facing camera if it detects any suspicious behavior, like any tampering with the device's security settings. Apple could be thinking about implementing something similar in future versions of iOS. The patent also outlines way to both store this information and cross-check it with online databases. While just an application, these types of security features raise some privacy and legal red flags. If Apple has a way to covertly capture and store biometric information, even if it’s an opt-in feature designed to protect consumers, it could tarnish the company’s reputation with regards to user security. CEO Tim Cook has routinely used his company’s record on privacy — and its decision not to store any unencrypted information — as a tool to tout Apple hardware and software, even in the face of FBI investigations. So we may not see any unprecedented anti-theft measures like this in consumer products any time soon.

CDT August 25, 2016 Human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor shows Associated Press journalists a screenshot of a spoof text message he received in Ajman, United Arab Emirates, on Thursday, Aug. 25, 2016.   (Photo: AP Photo/Jon Gambrell) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SAN FRANCISCO — Apple issued a security update to prevent attacks by rare, powerful and highly expensive spyware that exploits flaws in the mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads, after security researchers said it was used to target a Middle Eastern dissident's phone. In a statement to USA TODAY, Apple said it immediately fixed the vulnerability upon learning of it. It advises customers to download the latest version of its iOS, version 9.3.5, for security protection. The Associated Press, which first reported on the patch, said powerful espionage software was found targeting Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent United Arab Emirates dissident. Mansoor received a text message on his iPhone 6 that invited him to click on a web link, and forwarded the message to researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. Researchers there worked with San Francisco-based Lookout. In a blog post Thursday on that mobile security company's website, researchers said they found a “sophisticated, targeted, and persistent mobile attack on iOS using three zero-day vulnerabilities we call ‘Trident.’” Citizen Lab traced the link to NSO Group, which it calls a “cyberwar” company in Israel that sells a spyware product called Pegasus, said John Scott-Railton, one of the Citizen Lab report's authors. The cost of such sophisticated and powerful spyware is very high. A set of similar digital tools recently sold for $1 million, Citizen Lab's Scott-Railton and his co-author, Bill Marczak, wrote in an online report posted Thursday. The flaw lets the hacker break into an iOS device and spy on information gleaned from the victims' apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp, FaceTime, Gmail and Calendar, the post said. "As security breaches go, this is fairly serious, considering how fast Apple addressed it," says Andrew Blaich, a staff researcher at Lookout. Internet watchdog group Citizen Lab discovered the security hole a few weeks ago and immediately notified Apple, Blaich said. The Citizen Lab does not know what organization or government was behind the attempted hack of Mansoor’s iPhone, but Scott-Railton did note that a likely suspect would be the United Arab Emirates. Mansoor has been unable to leave the country since 2011 after his passport was taken. The disclosure offers fresh evidence that mobile platforms are “fertile ground for gathering sensitive information,” the post said. How widespread use of the malware is, is not clear, said Scott-Railton. The Citizen Lab believes that similar software from the NPO Group was used to target a Mexican journalism, Rafael Cabrera, who was reporting on a scandal involving Mexico’s president. Apple strengthens security Apple is clearly aware of the threat. Earlier this month, it beefed up security efforts with its first bug bounty program, with awards up to $200,000 for security researchers for each software bug they find that compromises Apple products. It debuted the program at Black Hat, an influential computer security conference in Las Vegas. Many companies already offer such programs. The announcement came on the heels of a showdown between Apple and the FBI over the feds’ demand that Apple help in its attempts to crack an iPhone 5C used by San Bernardino, Calif., shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. The FBI ditched its legal fight against Apple after it hired an unnamed firm to break into the iPhone without Apple's help. Follow USA TODAY San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz @jswartz on Twitter.

The app takes a page from both social networks, as it allows users to record and edit video, apply filters, draw on media and share in under one minute. Sources told Bloomberg that the app is ‘in the preliminary development stages’ and Apple is working to release it in 2017.  Scroll down for video  Apple is reportedly testing a new video sharing and editing application for its iPhone and iPad operating systems. The app takes a page for both social networks, as it would allow users to record and edit video, apply filters, draw on media and share in under one minute WHAT WOULD APPLE'S NEW APP DO?  Apple is said to have a new video sharing and editing application for its iPhone and iPad operating system, reports Bloomberg.  Apple’s secret application would let users record video, apply filters and draw on the media, similar to Snapchat, and they can send their creations to contacts or share to other existing social networks such as Twitter, according to the people familiar with its development. And since most people live an ‘on-the-go’ lifestyle, the software is designed to be used with mostly one hand and ‘with the intention that video could be shot, edited and uploaded in less than one minute. This latest development is part of Apple’s newly directed focus to fuse its products with social media applications, which is in ‘response to the success of social media-focused companies such as Facebook Inc. and Snapchat Inc’, people familiar with Apple’s strategy told Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. DailyMail.com has contacted Apple for comment and has yet to hear a response. Apple has dipped its toes in the social media industry before, but came out with little success. In 2010, the Cupertino company released an iTunes focused social network and recommender system called Ping. It was announced by Steve Job as being ‘sort of like Facebook and Twitter meet iTunes’, however the service was shut down in 2012 after its two million subscribers labeled it a flop.

APPLE URGES USERS TO DOWNLOAD THE NEW IOS IN WAKE OT 'TRIDENT' BUG Apple says it is issuing a security update after powerful espionage software was found targeting an activist's iPhone in the Middle East. Computer forensics experts say the spyware takes advantage of three previously undisclosed weaknesses in Apple's mobile operating system to take complete control of iPhone handsets. They worked with Apple to fix the bugs, known as Trident - and Apple today issued its fix. The firm urges all users to update their devices with the latest version of iOS immediately. If you're unsure what version you're running, you can check Settings > General > About > Version. The latest, safe, version is called 9.3.5. Trident is used in a spyware product called Pegasus, which according to an investigation by Citizen Lab, is developed by an organization called NSO Group.  The idea behind this new focus is to give the generation of Snapchatters simple tools to edit and share videos, the people explained, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. The app is reportedly being developed in the same Apple department that created Final cut Pro and iMovie software. And Joe Weil, the former president of a New York-based video sharing firm, was specifically hired to oversee and lead the vision of this project, the people said. since most people live an ‘on-the-go’ lifestyle, the software is designed to be used with mostly one hand and ‘with the intention that video could be shot, edited and uploaded in less than one minute. At least one of the prototype designs for the app would shoot video in an Instagram-like square shape It is also said that the video sharing app is ‘in the preliminary development stages’ and Apple is working to release it in 2017. Separate from the new app, the tech giant has been testing and developing other social media related features for its operating systems over the past few years, according to people familiar with the matter. These new features would help users stay more connected with their contacts, as Apple strives to make sharing and connectivity with contacts a system-wide feature. .   Read more: Apple Weighs iPhone Video Editing App in Renewed Push on Social - Bloomberg Share or comment on this article e-mail 25 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Tidal surge filmed on Sunaoshi River in Tagajo, Japan 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

(Photo: KEN OSBURN) 28 CONNECTTWEET 16 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Lisa Garland was living in Hickory, North Carolina, about 15 years ago when she came across an advertisement for the North Carolina Apple Festival, the annual celebration over Labor Day weekend that draws hundreds of thousands of people to its small, charming city about 100 miles to her west. “I had not even heard of Hendersonville,” Garland said. “I went up there and just fell in love with it. Now that I’m in Greer, Hendersonville is even closer, and now that I have an awareness of all that town has to offer, when we want to do something different, we go.” Mission accomplished. From Fall for Greenville and Bacon Labor Day in Simpsonville to Family Fest and the new Railfest in Greer, festival organizers strive for impact that lasts beyond their events, and they’re reporting success. Nearly 300,000 attended the Apple Festival last year, according to David Nicholson, executive director of the nonprofit organization that runs the event. More than 250 vendors and 15 local apple growers will line Hendersonville’s streets Sept. 2-5, as food, souvenirs, arts and crafts, and free entertainment fill the cooling mountain air. The festival celebrates its 70th anniversary this year. A study of its economic impact two years ago found that it generated about $12 million, Nicholson said, and that measured only that weekend’s business. “Clearly we are a major economic driver both for the community and what is spent by the people who come to our community but also for the apple industry itself,” Nicholson said. “We have a huge draw of course from western North Carolina but also the upstate of South Carolina and even greater Charlotte.” RELATED: Apple Festival brings tasty fun On a smaller scale, in the city of Simpsonville, Bacon Labor Day enters its third year Sept. 4-5, with some similar fair fare but focus on its cured and cherished namesake. More than 40 vendors – each with at least one special bacon item – will set up in Simpsonville City Park. Unlike the Apple Festival and Fall for Greenville, which are run by nonprofit organizations, Bacon Labor Day is run privately by founder Mark Rodeffer, who led the effort to restart a Labor Day festival in Simpsonville after the city’s chamber of commerce announced the Labor Day celebration held there for 40 years would be discontinued. About 8,000 attended Bacon Labor Day last year after it more than doubled in size over its first two years. Rodeffer said last year’s event had an impact of about $135,000 on the economy in southern Greenville County. The celebration itself is profitable, though Rodeffer declined to disclose specific information on finances, and that’s enabled the event to support local charities. “We’re always going to support those who save our bacon – police, fire, military, EMS,” Rodefffer said. “To date the festival has given back about $8,000. We couldn’t have done that had we not been in a healthy financial situation.” Organizers of the much larger Fall for Greenville celebration donate at least $35,000 annually to local charities, according to Lindsey Young, chairman of the festival’s board of directors. That amount fluctuates as an annual budget of around $1 million is managed to turn no profit but reserve funds in case inclement weather hurts attendance and therefore income. Nearly 200,000 attended last year and purchased about 1.2 million tickets for food, drinks and children’s amusement rides. It’s a showcase for restaurants in a city with a growing reputation as a culinary destination, coming Oct. 14-16 this year. Organizers have not estimated economic impact, which measures event-related spending at area businesses, but hotel occupancy during the weekend has grown by about 10-percent in the last five years, according to the local visitors’ bureau. The economic impact of the growing slate of festivals in Greer has been recently measured, by Clemson University’s Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management department. The largest, Greer Family Fest, draws nearly 25,000 over a weekend in May. It’s run by the nonprofit Greater Greer Chamber of Commerce, costs about $158,000, and last year it brought an economic impact of more than $1 million. The city’s midsummer Freedom Blast, which draws about 20,000 over a day, had an impact of more than $447,000. The afternoon International Festival in April, which doubled attendance over the last two years to about 3,000, had an impact of about $104,000 in its third year. The city, itself, holds those events while partnering with the chamber to hold Family Fest and Greer Station Oktoberfest. Oktoberfest was rained out last year – the fear for all outdoor events, organizers and sponsors who’ve invested time and money – but it’s set to return Oct. 1, drawing more than 10,000 to a German-styled celebration in the American manufacturing home of German automaker BMW. It was one visit for that event that ultimately lured Matt Bowes to locate his family business, the Southern Growl, in town. A new Railfest to celebrate railroad heritage will be added to Greer’s lineup on Sept. 10 at Greer City Park. “The goal really is to utilize special events to showcase the community, to get people out and about who maybe didn’t realize that there are new restaurants in downtown or that the park is so great,” said Greer chamber president Mark Owens. “Once you get people out there to see it, hopefully they’re going to come back. That helps the county and the city and our businesses.” The Saturday of Family Fest this year brought the highest sales day, yet, for Stomping Grounds on Trade Street, said Garland, who owns the coffeehouse and wine bar with her husband, Grey. She considers that evidence that city festivals are hitting their marks, just as Hendersonville’s Apple Festival did for her years ago. “People come from all parts and all different areas that may not come to Greer otherwise,” Garland said. “We get a lot of folks in who actually say, ‘I came down for the festival, and we thought this was a neat little town, so we’re back.’ It helps tremendously to raise awareness of the commerce aspect of the town.” - Follow Michael Burns on Twitter @MikeNearGreer Fall festivals Upcoming festivals across the area include: ► North Carolina Apple Festival Sept. 2-5 in Hendersonville ► Bacon Labor Day Sept. 4-5 in Simpsonville ► South Carolina Apple Festival Sept. 9-10 in Westminster ► Uniquely Union Festival Sept. 9-10 in Union ► Homesteading Festival Sept. 10 in Williamston ► Railfest Sept. 10 in Greer ► SpartOberfest Sept. 16-17 in Spartanburg ► Anderson Greek Festival Sept. 16-18 in Anderson ► Euphoria Sept. 22-25 in Greenville ► Spartanburg Greek Festival Sept. 22-25 in Spartanburg ► Mauldin BBQ Cook-Off Sept. 23-24 in Mauldin ► Carolina Brew HaHa Sept. 24 in Anderson ► Squealin’ on the Square Sept. 30-Oct. 1 in Laurens ► Greer Station Oktoberfest Oct. 1 in Greer ► Aunt Het Family Festival Oct. 1 in Fountain Inn ► Founders Day Music Festival Oct. 1 in Pickens ► Belton Standpipe Heritage and Arts Festival Oct. 1 in Belton ► Albino Skunk Music Festival Oct. 6-8 in Greer ► Pumpkin Festival Oct. 8 in Pumpkintown ► Fall for Greenville Oct. 14-16 in Greenville ► Honea Path Sugarfoot Festival Oct. 21-22 in Honea Path ► Walhalla Oktoberfest Oct. 21-22 in Walhalla ► Art on the Trail Oct. 22 in Travelers Rest ► Fall Harvest Festival Oct. 22 in Pendleton ► Euro Auto Festival Oct. 22 in Greenville 28 CONNECTTWEET 16 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/2bZUeNj TOP VIDEOS Who is Nikki Haley? 1:30 Beads of Courage remind teen of what he went through 1:10 911 call: I'm being attacked by bear; I'm going to die 1:05 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Man explains why he is poll watching at a Greenville County Precinct 0:42 Church Burned and Vandalized in Greenville 2:17 Todd Kohlhepp's neighbors relieved he's in custody 1:17 Family dog euthanized during search 1:58 Dad builds phenomenal costumes for his son 0:49

When Cook took the helm in 2011, he was granted 1 million shares. Originally, 50 per cent of those were scheduled to vest on his five-year anniversary, with the rest coming due after a decade with the company. That changed in 2013, when Cook voluntarily tied one-third of the award to outperforming the S&P 500 Index and the shares began vesting annually. That hasn't slowed him down much. He's received 98.6 per cent of the units available to him in his first five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Those were valued at $373 million at Wednesday's close - and he can still earn the same number of shares over the next half decade. Cook's payout is based on Apple returning 61 per cent during the past three years, placing it in the top-performing third of the S&P index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Cook would get all of his shares for 2016 under those terms. He's earned 3.45 million shares under the plan when accounting for a 7-for-1 stock split in 2014.

In a white paper, the US Treasury said the EC probe into alleged special tax treatment that certain EU countries gave Apple, Amazon, Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler “undermines the international tax system.” With potentially billions of dollars in tax levies at stake, the Treasury also reiterated its view that the investigations “disproportionately” target US companies and would prevent Washington from recovering taxes that it is eying from the companies’ offshore earnings. “These investigations have major implications for the United States. In particular, recoveries imposed by the Commission would have an outsized impact on US companies,” said Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Tax Affairs Robert Stack in a statement. “US taxpayers could wind up eventually footing the bill” if the commission forces the companies into tax settlements, he said. The US acknowledged the problems around the issue of multinational firms obtaining state aid, in the form of secret and extremely lucrative tax breaks, from Ireland, Belgium and Luxembourg for setting up business in those countries. But it said those deals were made under international treaties and accepted tax practices. The Treasury accused the EC in the white paper of taking a “new approach” to established European Union tax law in challenging EU member states’ legal tax breaks offered to multinational firms. In addition, the Treasury said the European Commission is effectively changing the tax rules now, but planning to apply them retroactively to the companies, which the US said was inconsistent with EU law and international practice. “The Commission should not seek retroactive recoveries under its new approach,” the white paper said. Moreover, the white paper said the commission was acting as “a supra-national tax authority” that oversteps its powers in EU challenging member state tax policies. In a statement, an EC spokesperson denied it was targeting US companies in particular and said that EU rules do not allow national tax authorities to give tax breaks to some companies that are not available to others. If such breaks are ruled illegal, the benefits from them have to be repaid. “This is a standard feature of EU state aid rules,” the spokesperson said.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Celebrity Fashion Beauty Royals Beauty Gwyneth Paltrow’s Daughter Apple Put the Kardashian Touch On the Juice Beauty Makeup Line Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Beauty Gwyneth Paltrow’s Daughter Apple Put the Kardashian Touch On the Juice Beauty Makeup Line Kitchen table focus groups prove fruitful in the Paltrow household. by Kenzie BryantAugust 25, 2016 5:45 pm Email Facebook Twitter By Clint Brewer/Splash News. At just 12 years old, Apple Martin is advising her mother Gwyneth Paltrow on her work at Juice Beauty, the more organic than your average organic cosmetics line for which Gwyn is the creative director. Savvy lifestyle gurus know that focus groups are an essential part of any corporate endeavor, and it’s super handy to have one that must be home for dinner by 6 p.m. sharp. “Apple was very concerned about us not having contouring kits,” Paltrow said, as the New York Post reported from an unnamed event. “So we made them. The latest thing that she’s asked me is, ‘Can we please make a lip kit that stays on all day long?’ Good luck with that!” Apple, then, is hip to the Kardashian-Jenner thing. To be clear, Kim Kardashian did not invent contouring. Kylie Jenner did not invent lip kits. But the family did cannibalize the styles of makeup merchandising, run them through the giant marketing engine that runs on belfies and Snapchat filters, and spit it back out into the world. The Kardashians are maybe, definitely why lip kits and contouring are so important to the middle schooler, and now Juice Beauty customers as well. Even the paraben-free among us deserve cute contouring. As Apple enters her teen years and ends up yelling “You never listen to me!!!!” before slamming a door, Gwyneth can counter, “Not true, sweetie. Remember the contouring kits?” Full ScreenPhotos: 1/21Gwyneth in V.F. Gwyneth Paltrow and Blythe Danner, photographed by David Seidner for the April 1996 issue.

News Sports Things to Do Life Obituaries e-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Apple boosts iPhone security after Mideast spyware discovery Thursday Aug 25, 2016 at 5:40 PM PARIS — A botched attempt to break into the iPhone of an Arab activist using hitherto unknown espionage software has trigged a global upgrade of Apple's mobile operating system, researchers said Thursday. Associated Press PARIS — A botched attempt to break into the iPhone of an Arab activist using hitherto unknown espionage software has trigged a global upgrade of Apple's mobile operating system, researchers said Thursday. The spyware took advantage of three previously undisclosed weaknesses in Apple's mobile operating system to take complete control of iPhone devices, according to reports published Thursday by the San Francisco-based Lookout smartphone security company and internet watchdog group Citizen Lab. Both reports fingered the NSO Group, an Israeli company with a reputation for flying under the radar, as the author of the spyware. "The threat actor has never been caught before," said Mike Murray, a researcher with Lookout, describing the program as "the most sophisticated spyware package we have seen in the market." The reports issued by Lookout and Citizen Lab — based at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs — outlined how an iPhone could be completely compromised with the tap of a finger, a trick so coveted in the world of cyberespionage that in November a spyware broker said it had paid a $1 million dollar bounty to programmers who'd found a way to do it. Such a compromise would give hackers full control over the phone, allowing them to eavesdrop on calls, harvest messages, activate cameras and microphones and drain the device of its personal data. Arie van Deursen, a professor of software engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, said both reports were credible and disturbing. Forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski described the malicious program as a "serious piece of spyware." Apple said in a statement that it fixed the vulnerability immediately after learning about it, but the security hole may have gone unpatched had it not been for the wariness of an embattled human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates. Ahmed Mansoor, a well-known human rights defender, first alerted Citizen Lab to the spyware after receiving an unusual text message on Aug. 10. Promising to reveal details about torture in the United Arab Emirates' prisons, the unknown sender included a suspicious-looking link at the bottom of the message. Mansoor wasn't convinced. Not only had he been imprisoned, beaten, robbed and had his passport confiscated by the authorities over the years, Mansoor had also repeatedly found himself in the crosshairs of electronic eavesdropping operations. In fact Mansoor already had the dubious distinction of having weathered attacks from two separate brands of commercial spyware. And when he shared the suspicious text with Citizen Lab researcher Bill Marczak, they realized he'd been targeted by a third. Marczak, who'd already been looking into the NSO Group, said he and fellow-researcher John Scott-Railton turned to Lookout for help picking apart the malicious program, a process which Murray compared to "defusing a bomb." "It is amazing the level they've gone through to avoid detection," he said of the software's makers. "They have a hair-trigger self-destruct." Working feverishly over a two-week period, the researchers found that Mansoor had been targeted by an unusually sophisticated piece of software which likely cost a small fortune to arm. "Ahmed Mansoor is a million-dollar human rights defender," Scott-Railton said. In a statement which stopped short of acknowledging that the spyware was its own, the NSO Group said its mission was to provide "authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime." The company said it had no knowledge of any particular incidents. It said it would not make any further comment. The apparent discovery of Israeli-made spyware being used to target a dissident in the United Arab Emirates raises awkward questions for both countries. The use of Israeli technology to police its own citizens is an uncomfortable strategy for an Arab country with no formal diplomatic ties to the Jewish state. And Israeli complicity in a cyberattack on an Arab dissident would seem to run counter to the country's self-description as a bastion of democracy in the Middle East. Authorities in both countries did not return calls seeking comment. Attorney Eitay Mack, who advocates for more transparency in Israeli arms exports, said his country's exports of surveillance software were not closely policed. "Surveillance is not considered a lethal weapon," Mack said. And Israeli regulations "don't take into consideration human rights or that it would be used by a government to oppress dissidents." He noted that Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cultivated ties with Arab Gulf states. Netanyahu in 2014 urged Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to join him in the war on terrorism. "Israel is looking for allies," Mack said. "And when Israel finds allies, it does not ask too many questions."

Photo: EPA/MONICA M. DAVEY WASHINGTON – US technology corporation Apple has issued a global security update to address a vulnerability in its mobile operating system following the attempted breach into an iPhone belonging to Arab activist Ahmed Mansoor, cybersecurity company Lookout said in a news release on Thursday. The security flaw left iPhone users vulnerable to a sophisticated espionage product called Trident. “[Two research firms] worked directly with Apple to fix the vulnerabilities,” the release stated.  “Apple was very responsive and patched Trident in its update. All iOS users should update to this version immediately.” Lookout explained that the malware allowed hackers to spy on users by collecting personal information through popular apps such as Skype, Gmail, FaceTime and Mail.Ru. Earlier this month, Mansoor reported a data breach of his device to US cybersecurity companies, the release said. Mansoor had reportedly received a text message promising “new secrets” about prisoners allegedly tortured in the United Arab Emirates. Lookout said its researchers discovered that the link was sent by NSO Group, an Israel-based firm that sells a government-exclusive intercept spyware product called Pegasus.

If exploited correctly, those flaws allow an intruder unprecedented access to an iPhone. They allow attackers to read every email, text message, calendar item and file saved on the device; peruse photos and videos; listen in on phone calls; track the device’s location; and remotely turn on its microphone and camera. The phone’s owner would have no idea anything out of the ordinary was going on. The vulnerability was discovered by security researchers at Lookout, a mobile software security company, and Citizen Lab, a technology-focused academic research center at the University of Toronto. The researchers there were tipped off by a human-rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who forwarded a pair of suspicious-looking text messages he received earlier this month from an unknown number. When they examined the link included in the text, they found it led to a site designed to infect phones with a very advanced virus. The discovery was first reported by Motherboard and The New York Times. “We realized that we were looking at something that no one had ever seen in the wild before,” Mike Murray, Lookout’s vice president for research, told Motherboard. “One of the most sophisticated pieces of cyber-espionage software we’ve ever seen.” Documentation that describes how the malware works indicates it can “self-destruct” if it’s in danger of being found, silently erasing itself off the phone. The security researchers reverse-engineered the malware in order to find out who had created it. The signs they found pointed to NRO, a shadowy Israeli cyberspying company. The researchers also found references to versions of Apple’s mobile operating system as old as iOS 7, which was first released in 2013, suggesting the vulnerability has existed for years. Ahmed Mansoor, the UAE-based activist, first received the shady text messages Aug. 10. After the security researchers he shared dissected the code, they shared their findings with Apple. It took the company 10 days to develop and release a fix. (It’s unclear whether installing the iOS update will remove the malware if it’s already been downloaded and activated.) To download the software update on an iPhone, open the Settings app, tap General, and then tap Software Update. Do it now.

The delay follows a decision back in December to expand the scope of the investigation. But while the wheels of EU tax investigations may grind exceedingly slowly, I’d be willing to wager quite large sums of money on the final outcome. It looks to me increasingly clear that Apple’s tax arrangements with the Irish government are going to be declared illegal, and that Apple is going to be faced with a significant bill for unpaid tax … Let’s start with the basics of how the whole situation arose in the first place. You can skip this section if you’re already up to speed on the background. In a simple world, one of two things would happen when I buy an iPhone in the UK. Either the Apple Store in London sends the money back to Cupertino, and Apple pays U.S. tax on it there, or the money is paid into an Apple UK bank account, and Apple pays tax on it in Britain. In reality, however, neither of these things happens – and there are two reasons for that. First, every country in the world sets its own corporate tax rates – the percentage tax a company pays on its profits. In the USA, the federal corporate tax rate is 35%. In the UK, it’s 20%, so Apple would already be better off paying UK tax on British sales. But it realized it could do better than that if it shopped around. Ireland has one of the lowest rates of corporate tax in Europe, at 12.5%. By establishing a European headquarters in Ireland, and sending all the money from sales across Europe there, it could pay a lot less tax. But it doesn’t end there. Ireland sets its corporate tax so low because it wants global companies to establish their European headquarters there. That creates jobs, and pumps money into the local economy. The bigger the company, the greater the benefit to the economy. So for very large companies – like Apple and Google – Ireland offered them a special deal (reportedly brokered by Steve Jobs). ‘Choose Ireland for your European HQ,’ it said, ‘and you only have to pay 2.5% tax.’ That’s five times lower than the rate paid by most companies. So rather than pay 35% for sending the money back to the USA, or 20% for keeping it in the UK, Apple funnels all sales from European countries into Ireland – and pays just 2.5% tax on the lot. I should stress that all this is perfectly legal … for Apple. Apple’s legal obligation is to pay the tax each country demands from it. If Ireland demands only 2.5%, Apple’s only duty in law is to smile broadly and write the check. (Ok, it isn’t actually legally required to grin as it does so, but it would be hard not to, right?) This was what allowed Tim Cook to truthfully tell a Congressional hearing into Apple’s tax affairs that “we pay every dollar that we owe.” Apple does indeed pay every dollar, or Euro, it is required to. The company has broken no laws. But the same is probably not true of the Irish government. Ireland is a member of the European Union, and there are laws determining what member states can and cannot do where corporate taxes are concerned. Precisely because the EU knows countries might be tempted to offer special deals to large companies, and because it doesn’t want a race to the bottom where those companies end up paying next to nothing in tax, it specifically outlaws them. Special deals offered only to certain companies are known as state aid, and that’s illegal. State aid is any advantage granted by public authorities through state resources on a selective basis to any organisations that could potentially distort competition and trade in the European Union (EU). While we’ll need to await the outcome of the investigation before we know whether Ireland’s deal with Apple is formally found to be illegal state aid, it’s hard to see how it could not be. ‘Any advantage’ – check. A tax rate of 2.5% instead of 12.5% is one hell of an advantage. ‘through state resources’ – check. The deal was struck with the Irish tax authorities. ‘on a selective basis’ – check. Apple got a deal, as did other large companies like Google and Microsoft. Mama and Papa’s Pizza Place, not so much. ‘distort competition and trade’ – check. When one company pays one fifth of the tax rate paid by competitors, that massively distorts competition. And similar deals in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have already been declared illegal. So the case that Ireland broke the law seems to me cut-and-dried: it did. I said earlier that Apple hasn’t broken the law, which means it’s not on the hook for penalties or charges. But it is on the hook for the difference between the tax it actually paid and the tax it should have paid. Which is the difference between 2.5% and 12.5%. On all of the revenue Apple funnelled through Ireland from the whole of Europe. For ten years. That’s a lot of money. Apple last year told shareholders that it was unable to say just how much money that would amount to, only that it would be a ‘material’ amount – where ‘material’ is finance-speak for ‘a shedload.’ If the European Commission were to conclude against Ireland, the European Commission could require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid. While such amount could be material, as of March 28, 2015 the Company is unable to estimate the impact. But that hasn’t stopped others doing the sums. Bloomberg estimated the total tax liability at more than $8B. But Apple’s potential European tax liabilities don’t necessarily end there. A number of European countries have questioned the legality of Apple funneling profits from sales in their country back to Ireland. Those countries believe Apple should be paying tax in the country where the sales were made. Some European countries have done more than question the arrangements: they have flat out rejected them. Italy, for example, last year accused Apple of failing to declare more than $1.3B of income earned from 16 Italian Apple Stores, and presented the company with an additional tax bill for €318M ($347M). Apple paid up. If other European countries do the same, it could face similar bills from countries across Europe, with the total potentially running into more than a billion dollars, taking that $8B estimate to upwards of $9B. In comments on past pieces on this topic, some have questioned the fairness of Apple being asked to pay more tax than was demanded at the time. If Apple paid what was asked of it, they argued, surely it’s unfair to come asking for more later? But the position for Apple is no different to that of you or I. If the IRS or HMRC makes a mistake in calculating our personal taxes, it doesn’t let us off when that error comes to light. It might offer us an apology and time to pay, but we’d still have to fork over the cash. The same is true of Apple. Finally, if you’re in any doubt about the eventual outcome of the investigation, you need to consider the politics. At a time when European economies are – like the U.S. one – still struggling, there is enormous public anger at the idea of large companies being able to get away with paying less than their fair share of tax. A deal struck between Google and the British government, where the company paid just £130M ($185M) for back taxes covering ten years was roundly condemned not just by the public but by Britain’s own public spending watchdog – and is itself likely to be investigated by the European Commission. Starbucks had to change its own accounting system so that it stopped funneling most of the profits from its UK coffee shops back to offshore accounts after being faced by customer boycotts. Amazon too had to agree to pay UK tax on sales to UK customers in the face of public anger. So my view is that both the law and the public mood is clear. Apple is likely on the hook to hand over more than $9B in back taxes – or around three times the amount it paid for its largest ever acquisition, Beats. That’s got to sting. But with cash reserves of around $200B in the bank, perhaps not too much.

Even Sony’s best products back in the day felt like toys compared to Apple devices. But I think we can all agree Apple is greedy, more than any other company. Not talking about this tax thing but the fact they see every loophole to save money (not sure if saving that money in Ireland was/is illegal) but I do know thy break the law quite often to save money. Just to give you people an example, in Belgium, companies are required to give consumers a minimum of 2 years warranty on electronics and such. Apple at first was not only advertising their products to have 1 year warranty but they also refused to fix devices that were returned if they exceeded the warranty period of 1 year. That was and still is illegal. Today, Apple in Belgium agrees to fix your Apple device withing the minimum warranty period of 2 years, but they still advertise their products having 1 year warranty. Why? To sell more Apple Care packages. 2 years added warranty sounds more interesting than just 1 year added warranty period. This is disgusting I feel and I think Apple should be punished for this. 8b$ is a lot, but they should respect the law. A loophole is ok, breaking the law is not.

The bigger question is why politicians around the world haven’t come up with a global and uniform business tax so that businesses cannot shop around for the lowest taxes and the best special treatment – businesses aren’t your friend and they’re more than happy to throw you under the bus if it means that they can shave a few dollars off their tax bill. Until politicians realise that they need to work together to counter balance corporate interests then these sorts of tax arrangements will keep flourishing. Btw, when I mean a uniform system – if the net result is that all OECD countries end up standardising at 12.5% then I’d sooner that than the status quo that exists today where businesses pay 0% because they paying accounting tricks with the books.

LikeLiked by 1 person chasinvictoria - 9 months ago Reply It seems to me that the article is conflating two distinct issues (forgivable, though, since everyone else has done so as well): there is the matter the EU is *actually* investigating — which is whether **IRELAND** (ie the government) gave companies illegal tax breaks, and then there is some looking into whether the individual companies got “special deals” not available to Irish companies. While I’m not an expert on this at all, it seems to me that the way this *ought* to work, presuming Ireland did something illegal, is that **IRELAND** pays any penalty the EU imposes, and it may then in turn try to claw that back from the companies in the form of “corrected” tax assessments. You may think this is a minor difference, but it isn’t: it’s the difference between blame being placed where it may properly belong (Ireland broke the law) or (if this is the finding, which I doubt will be the case) that individual multi-nationals like Apple, Amazon, et al broke the law by demanding special deals. I suspect Apple (et al) did, as they claim, nothing wrong, and that the government of Ireland is at fault. Maybe that won’t matter in terms of the money paid out, but there’s a huge legal and moral difference between “we took advantage of the government’s rules to our benefit legally” and then have to pay some “back tax,” and “we forced the government to break the EU laws by demanding special deals nobody else got,” which means they are the guilty party. LikeLike Ben Lovejoy - 9 months ago Reply The article is very clear that Ireland (almost certainly) broke the law, and that Apple didn’t. If Apple had broken the law, it would be subject to penalties as well as back-tax, but that’s not the case. It’s perfectly reasonable that a company that enters into a deal that due diligence would tell it is illegal would have to repay the tax.

They did what and paid what they were told. This isn’t like the IRS or Canada Revenue miscalculating what you or I owe and then admitting the mistake and coming back to collect the difference. This is them changing the rules retroactively and then arbitrarily saying Apple owes more. The rate changed from 2.5% to 12.5%, hell why not say it should have been 30%, or 50%, or 100%. If you’re going to retroactively change the rules to fill your coffers why not go all the way. I have no problem with Apple paying a higher rate from now on. I don’t even have a problem with Italy trying to get back taxes on sales in their country that were routed through Ireland. That was always questionable in my mind. But for the EU to tell Apple that a legal agreement for a tax rate that the government of Ireland offered them is retroactively illegal is just wrong.

And even in an opinion piece, you should be careful about making statements such as how what Apple did was “perfectly legal” and “the company has broken no laws”, but that Ireland did. As you yourself pointed out, “Special deals offered only to certain companies are known as state aid, and that’s illegal.” And that’s not just illegal for the government of Ireland — agreeing with another party to violate the law is known as conspiracy, and abetting and being an accessory to a crime is illegal too. By your own description, Apple appears to have conspired with the government of Ireland to violate EU tax law, and its lawyers undoubtedly knew or should have known that conspiring with, abetting, and being an accessory to Ireland’s commission of a crime would have legal implications for Apple itself. To blithely say that Apple didn’t commit a crime by soliciting and receiving illegal state aid is akin to saying that soliciting a bribe is not illegal because you’re not the one who *paid* the bribe, or that receiving stolen goods is not a crime because you didn’t steal them. Both sides of an illegal transaction are illegal. Luckily for you, being a fanboy is not. (Yet.)

It’s only like if i buy something overseas and have it shipped – on certain products i will still have to pay custom fees on bringing that item into the country. plus – if i buy online from an international store i pay that countries tax amount on goods… Large companies shouldnt be any different — if you are opening up shop in the UK, and people are buying from your store, then the company should be paying the tax for that item in the UK… if it’s online – then they can have it based in Ireland BUT the item should be shipped from Ireland and the customer pay custom fees… Apple made an offer with Ireland knowing full well they were avoiding paying tax to the correct countries — plus, Ireland do not speak for the EU and therefore should also be held responsible for tax evasions (after all, they technically benefit off the sales in other countries too)… But if this case is a success and Apple are made to pay, then then will lead things forwards and make google, amazon, starbucks etc pay… If they don’t want to pay – don’t sell in that country… simple LikeLike Josh (@joshstwit) - 9 months ago Reply This has shady written all over it, Apple had to know that this would catch up to them.

The EU wants all the local tax money but now it wants money from Apple cause Ireland is collecting tax from Apple for existing there and suddenly it wants more than its been getting. Lets go back in time, change the rules, and collect lots and lots of money…. How does a company exist if countries can change the rules in the past for payment now????? That sounds like pure EU greed and theft. You even said that Apple pays Ireland the money Ireland charges it. Maybe the next stop is the cayman Islands. We are not talking about taxes on product (where did you report how much that huge amount is???) but rather corporate tax. So, follow the law and get punished. Sounds like a plan. Maybe Britain is on to something there when they left the EU. Just saying.

Everyone owning an Apple handset has been urged to update their phone to get the latest version of iOS, which has the patch. Every device that hasn’t yet received that update could be liable to the attack. Updates can be requested by heading to the iPhone’s setting app, clicking general and choosing security update. The phone will then retrieve and download the update itself. Protected phones should be running iOS 9.3.5, the latest version of the software. Apple said that it had issued the patch as soon as the security problem was discovered. The problem took advantage of three different weaknesses in Apple’s operating system, which together allowed people to take complete control of iOS devices, according to reports published Thursday by the San Francisco-based Lookout smartphone security company and internet watchdog group Citizen Lab. Both of the reports pointed to the NSO Group, a secretive Israeli firm, as the origin of the spyware. "The threat actor has never been caught before," said Mike Murray, a researcher with Lookout, describing the program as "the most sophisticated spyware package we have seen in the market." The reports issued by Lookout and Citizen Lab — based at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs — outlined how an iPhone could be completely compromised with the tap of a finger, a trick so coveted in the world of cyberespionage that in November a spyware broker said it had paid a $1 million dollar bounty to programmers who'd found a way to do it. Such a compromise would give hackers full control over the phone, allowing them to eavesdrop on calls, harvest messages, activate cameras and microphones and drain the device of its personal data. Arie van Deursen, a professor of software engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, said both reports were credible and disturbing. Forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski described the malicious program as a "serious piece of spyware." Apple said in a statement that it fixed the vulnerability immediately after learning about it, but the security hole may have gone unpatched had it not been for the wariness of an embattled human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates.  Ahmed Mansoor, a well-known human rights defender, first alerted Citizen Lab to the spyware after receiving an unusual text message on Aug. 10. Promising to reveal details about torture in the United Arab Emirates' prisons, the unknown sender included a suspicious-looking link at the bottom of the message. Mansoor wasn't convinced. Not only had he been imprisoned, beaten, robbed and had his passport confiscated by the authorities over the years, Mansoor had also repeatedly found himself in the crosshairs of electronic eavesdropping operations. In fact Mansoor already had the dubious distinction of having weathered attacks from two separate brands of commercial spyware. And when he shared the suspicious text with Citizen Lab researcher Bill Marczak, they realised he'd been targeted by a third. Marczak, who'd already been looking into the NSO Group, said he and fellow-researcher John Scott-Railton turned to Lookout for help picking apart the malicious program, a process which Murray compared to "defusing a bomb." "It is amazing the level they've gone through to avoid detection," he said of the software's makers. "They have a hair-trigger self-destruct."

Facebook’s video editor is embarrassingly old, and Apple is creeping Posted Aug 25, 2016 by Josh Constine (@joshconstine) 0 SHARES Next Story Songkick raises new $15M round from Access Industries, expands US operations Advertisement You know you screwed up if Apple is about to one-up you on social.  Facebook hasn’t upgraded its video editor in well over three years. Lagging far behind Snapchat, YouTube and even Instagram, it’s a stretch to even call the featureless artifact a video editor. All you can do with an uploaded video is trim the ends and toggle the sound on or off. That’s a glaring failure considering Mark Zuckerberg wants “video at the heart of all our apps and services.” And now, Apple is plotting to seize the opportunity Facebook has left vacant. Bloomberg reports Apple is building a lightweight mobile video editor designed for one-minute, one-handed use. That’s exactly what Facebook should have built years ago. Facebook’s outdated video uploader has almost no features Facebook cut pro? No. Since late 2013, Facebook has poured resources into improving video consumption while neglecting how users record and share. It launched auto-play video in the feed, prompting an explosion in viewership. Better analytics taught creators what works. Those advances took it from hardly any video views to 1 billion per day in September 2014, to 8 billion in November 2015, to likely many more today. It’s not like Facebook couldn’t build an editor. It developed the video sharing app Poke in 12 days, launched Slingshot, which offered solid video editing and has watched its acquisition Instagram build a modern video editor. Meanwhile, Facebook Live has become the company darling. After launching last August, it’s already added filters and is working on a drawing tool. Perhaps the closest thing Facebook has to a video editor is its Moments photo-sharing app’s automatic slideshow movie maker. It stitches your photos and videos together with themed transitions and music to create a more interesting mini-film. It’s supposed to be rolling out to the main app, but I don’t see it and it still lacks most basic editing tools. So here we are, three years after I wrote that “right now Facebook’s video creation tool is painfully outdated,” and nothing has changed. That’s shameful for a company that claims to “move fast.” What should Facebook’s video uploader be able to do? At the very least, it should let you: Combine multiple clips into one video Add color filters That would at least bring it up to 2014 standards. To be considered passable in the modern age, it should also let you: Stabilize shaky video Add overlaid text, drawings, emoji and stickers Manually combine videos and photos into Stories For comparison, Snapchat’s video editor includes all sorts of expression tools And if Facebook wanted to actually get its shit together, it’d create a best-in-class video recorder and uploader with some of these features that let you: Add geofilters representing nearby neighborhoods, events, landmarks or businesses (Snapchat) Create split-screen collages with multiple videos and/or photos shown at once (Editing apps) Add video effects like slow-mo, fast-forward or reverse (Snapchat) Select a soundtrack (Vine, YouTube) Reorder clips (Editing apps) Choose transitions between clips (iMovie) Record video while your device is playing audio (Snapchat) Zoom by scrolling one finger up and down instead of spreading and pinching with two fingers Do lipsyncing (Musical.ly, Dubsmash) Sync-to-beat for creating audio loops (Vine) Ghost outlines of your previous clip to line up shots (Vine) Plus, I’m sure Facebook’s team could come up with some cool other features. These wouldn’t have to overcomplicate the video uploader. They could be tucked in an editing options drawer so people who just want to add a clip, filter the color, slap some text on and post it could do that without getting confused. Unlocking self-expression Facebook needs a way to reverse the trend of declining original content sharing, which The Information reports was down 15 percent year over year as of February. Yet it’s not giving people the tools they need to create unique, compelling content. Instead, big publishers with their professional editing teams are filling the feed with social-optimized video that looks pretty but feels generic and impersonal. At least Facebook’s app has started to integrate its acquisition of animated selfie maker MSQRD into a new camerafeed design. But that focuses on enhancing clips shot in the app, not editing existing clips. If Facebook doesn’t make a move, Apple and others will, and those videos won’t necessarily end up on Facebook. Building a great editor gives Facebook leverage to choose whether those videos should just live on its social network, be downloadable or even be easily shared to other apps. I’ve been blogging about Facebook for six years. For the last half of that, I’ve secretly hoped that every time the company wanted to brief me, it’d show off some slick new video editing interface. But I’ve been disappointed time and time again, and saddened by the missed chance to empower 1.71 billion people to become creators.

The report, which analyzed pay stubs of employees at the Shanghai-based facilities, notes that Pegatron is one of Apple’s largest iPhone suppliers and currently manufacturing Apple’s next-generation iPhone 7 expected to arrive next month. Apple’s other main supplier, Foxconn, has long been a source of controversies regarding similar workers’ rights issues and today’s report is a follow up to investigations China Labor Watch has been conducting since 2013.  Among the issues the report found with labor conditions at Pegatron were illegal and forced overtime hours, including wages too low for employees to live on without working overtime.  It also discovered interns working excessive overtime hours– something it notes is not allowed by Chinese law– and found employees on production lines who were required to arrive early were unpaid for the extra time.  Below is a summary from the report of the main issues China Labor Watch found: In 2015, workers’ hourly wage was $1.85 USD. In 2016, workers’ hourly wage increased to $2.00 USD. After deductions, this amounts to only $1.60 USD. Of the 2015 paystubs, 62% had over 82 hours of overtime work per month. One worker put in 109 hours of overtime work per month, working 293 hours in total. Chinese law forbids companies from asking interns to work overtime, however, interns at Pegatron had overtime work amounting to 80 hours per month on average. This is roughly the same amount as full-time employees. Workers must rely on overtime pay to support themselves as the base wage is too low. Workers who don’t work overtime only earn around $213 USD after deducting expenses. Workers in most production lines must arrive at work 10 minutes earlier than the regular schedule, but the 10 minutes are unpaid. Workers spend about 60 minutes each day, passing through the security procedures and ID Checks before entering the workshop. This encroached on workers’ rest time. The factory forces workers to work overtime. Asking for leave during peak season is usually not approved. Workers are exposed to potential occupational injuries without proper protection. Apple responded to the data last month before it was published, according to China Labor Watch, and “admitted that in some production departments of Pegatron, excessive overtime did exist,” but said that the percentage was lower than found in the investigation. “Apple did not provide details about their sample size and how they calculated overtime hours,” the report adds. China Labor Watch ends with a statement from its Executive Director Li Qiang urging Apple to make investments to improve labor conditions in China. “Currently, Apple is hindering the improvement of labor conditions within the whole smartphone industry.  Apple alone claimed more than 90% of the smartphone industry’s aggregate profits, while a majority of other firms were operating at a loss. If Apple does not take on responsibility commensurate with its status, other companies will not have the ability to make improvements either.” The investigation follows a separate report from earlier this month that claimed suppliers including both Foxconn and Pegatron have been facing pressure from Apple to reduce costs.

The apparent discovery of Israeli-made spyware being used to target a dissident in the United Arab Emirates raises awkward questions for both countries. The use of Israeli technology to police its own citizens is an uncomfortable strategy for an Arab country with no formal diplomatic ties to the Jewish state. And Israeli complicity in a cyberattack on an Arab dissident would seem to run counter to the country's self-description as a bastion of democracy in the Middle East. Authorities in both countries did not return calls seeking comment. Attorney Eitay Mack, who advocates for more transparency in Israeli arms exports, said his country's exports of surveillance software were not closely policed. "Surveillance is not considered a lethal weapon," Mack said. And Israeli regulations "don't take into consideration human rights or that it would be used by a government to oppress dissidents." He noted that Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cultivated ties with Arab Gulf states. Netanyahu in 2014 urged Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to join him in the war on terrorism. "Israel is looking for allies," Mack said. "And when Israel finds allies, it does not ask too many questions." -- The Associated Press Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Advertise with us Contact the newsroom Frequently Asked Questions Join our team Our Journalists Contact Subscriber Services Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Travel Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Clark County Gresham Portland Washington County More Local News Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Forums Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

Remember Ping inside iTunes? How about Connect within Apple Music? Nonetheless, Cupertino is reportedly trying again with a Snapchat-like video-recording app we could see as early as next year, according to Bloomberg. Citing "people familiar with Apple's strategy," Bloomberg says Apple is testing a standalone app that would let users record video and add things like filters and drawings before sending them to friends or posting to social networks like Twitter. //Related Articles 14 Ways to Step Up Your Snapchat Game At this point, it's conceived as an app one would download from the App Store, but there's also a chance it could be integrated into the iOS Camera app, Bloomberg says. It's under the control of the team that created Final Cut Pro and iMovie. The news comes shortly after Instagram added the Snapchat-like "Stories" to its app, which lets users post quick videos that disappear after 24 hours. Social networks far and wide have been cribbing from Snapchat much more lately, as the teen favorite branches out and picks up more users who spend quite a bit of time within the app. A July report from comScore said Snapchat has been "rapidly growing its user base" among older millennials (that would be 25- to 34-year-olds), and even the over-35 set, as of late. Case in point: Three years ago, just 5 percent of smartphone users between 25 and 34 used Snapchat, and just 2 percent of those 35 and older did. Now, penetration among these age demographics has grown to 38 percent and 14 percent, respectively.

Featured Story: 5 Things You Didn't Know Your iPhone's Home Button Could Do iOS Gadget Hacks: Unchaining iPhone & iPad to get tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo News: Huge iPhone Security Flaw Reveals One Big Benefit iOS Has Over Android Dallas Thomas 2 months ago Huge iPhone Security Flaw Reveals One Big Benefit iOS Has Over Android A human rights activist from the United Arab Emirates recently stumbled upon three gaping security loopholes in iOS that work by enticing you to tap a link sent to your iPhone. Ahmed Mansoor received a text message from an unknown number roughly two weeks ago, but instead of following the link it included, he sent the message over to a security researcher at Citizen Lab. After investigating the link contained in the message, the researcher found that it was using three different zero-day attacks to gain complete control over the victim's iPhone. These attacks were previously unknown to security personnel around the world, and they would essentially jailbreak the device, then install deep-level spyware without the user knowing anything had happened. Don't Miss: How to Increase Security on Your iPhone's Lock Screen Once they got a chance to look into the hack a bit further, Citizen Lab and mobile security company Lookout determined that the attack was created by an Israeli surveillance company named NSO Group, who is known to work with government intelligence agencies. However, by the time media outlets even got wind of this issue, Apple had already created a security fix to go along with the iOS 9.3.5 update, effectively closing this loophole for good. The update began rolling out Thursday, so to make sure you're not vulnerable, head to Settings -> General -> Software Update, then update your iPhone to apply the fixes. Security on Apple vs. Android Don't Miss: Bug Bounties from Big Companies That Hackers Can Collect The fact that Apple worked closely with both security firms involved here means that they had a chance to keep this major vulnerability under wraps with an NDA, so that would explain why we didn't hear anything about it until after a fix had already been issued. Plus, publicly outing such a huge exploit has the potential to do some serious damage when no fix is available, so Citizen Lab and Lookout were on morally sound ground when they didn't report this loophole right off the bat. But the hack itself was only discovered a mere two weeks before the iOS 9.3.5 update was issued, so Apple worked incredibly fast to ensure that their devices couldn't be vulnerable anymore. Don't Miss: How to Tell if Your Android Has Been Hacked Android, on the other hand, is maintained by Google, who has similar clout when it comes to keeping things under wraps. Yet millions of Android devices are currently vulnerable to the QuadRooter hack that was first reported at roughly the same time this iOS hack was discovered, and presumably known to Google before the public got wind of it. Most of the delays with Android security fixes can be blamed on manufacturers or cell carriers, as both entities slow down the update process by adding their own customizations to Android. But Google's own Nexus devices don't have to deal with these slowdowns, yet because of Google's staged rollout system, the vast majority of Nexus devices still haven't been updated to Android Nougat, which contains fixes for the QuadRooter bug. Don't Miss: How to Update Your Nexus Device to Android Nougat Right Now So it's likely that even the most promptly-updated Android devices will have to wait more than a month before receiving this security fix, which may not sound that bad. But when you consider that Apple had a similar security loophole closed within two weeks, monthly security updates simply aren't fast enough.

Mansoor had reportedly received a text message promising “new secrets” about prisoners allegedly tortured in the United Arab Emirates.

Jon Swartz, USA TODAY , KPNX 5:05 PM. MST August 26, 2016 (Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SAN FRANCISCO — Apple has issued a security update to prevent spyware that exploits flaws in the company's mobile operating system that could give hackers control of iPhones. In a statement to USA TODAY, Apple said it immediately fixed the vulnerability upon learning of it. It advises customers to download the latest version of its iOS, version 9.3.5, for security protection. MORE: Info from Apple about the security content of iOS 9.3.5 The Associated Press, citing computer forensics experts, said powerful espionage software was found targeting an activist's iPhone in the Middle East. Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent United Arab Emirates dissident, received a text message that invited him to click on a web link. He forwarded the message to researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. In a blog post Thursday on Lookout’s website, the companies said they found a “sophisticated, targeted, and persistent mobile attack on iOS using three zero-day vulnerabilities we call ‘Trident.’” The flaw lets the hacker break into an iOS device and spy on information gleaned from the victims' apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp, FaceTime, Gmail and Calendar, the post said. "As security breaches go, this is fairly serious, considering how fast Apple addressed it," says Andrew Blaich, a staff researcher at Lookout. Internet watchdog group Citizen Lab discovered the security hole a few weeks ago and immediately notified Apple, Blaich said. The disclosure offers fresh evidence that mobile platforms are “fertile ground for gathering sensitive information,” the post said. Apple is clearly aware of the threat. Earlier this month, it beefed up security efforts with its first bug bounty program, with awards up to $200,000 for security researchers for each software bug they find that compromises Apple products. It debuted the program at Black Hat, an influential computer security conference in Las Vegas. Many companies already offer such programs. The announcement, to loud applause, came on the heels of a showdown between Apple and the FBI over the feds’ demand that Apple help in its attempts to crack an iPhone 5 used by San Bernardino, Calif., shooter Syed Rizwan Farook.

Computer forensics experts tell The Associated Press the spyware takes advantage of three previously undisclosed weaknesses in Apple's mobile operating system to take complete control of iPhone handsets. Two reports published Thursday by the San Francisco-based Lookout and internet watchdog group Citizen Lab outline how the spyware could compromise an iPhone with the tap of a finger, a trick so coveted in the world of cyberespionage that one spyware broker said last year that it had paid a $1 million dollar bounty to programmers who'd found a way to do it.

During the final minutes of the auction, bids reached $1.2 million, but it appears the last bid was pulled just seconds before the auction ended. The "Celebration" Apple-1, so named by computer historian Corey Cohen, features a blank "green" PCB board that was never sold to the public and was not a part of a known production run. The auction included an original Apple-1 ACI cassette board, pre-NTI, with Robinson Nugent sockets, a period correct power supply, an early Apple-1 BASIC cassette labeled and authenticated by original Apple employee Daniel Kottke, Apple-1 manuals, marketing materials, and Cassette Board schematics. Unlike other Apple-1 computers that have fetched lower prices, the Celebration Apple-1 is not in working condition but could be restored to full functionality with minor tweaks. Cohen recommended against such restoration to preserve the board's uniqueness. "The Apple-1 board is a not just a piece of history, but a piece of art," he said. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak originally created and sold 175 Apple-1 computers during the summer of 1976, marking the launch of Apple computer, a company that's grown to be one of the largest and most influential in the world. Of those 175 machines, only 60 or so are still in existence, making them quite valuable to collectors. Several Apple-1 computers have surfaced at auction over the past few years, selling for prices between and $365,000 and $905,000. 10 percent of the proceeds from the CharityBuzz auction will benefit the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.

(AP Photo/Tony Avelar) Tony Avelar Copyright Associated Press Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next PARIS (AP) — A botched attempt to break into the iPhone of an Arab activist using hitherto unknown espionage software has trigged a global upgrade of Apple's mobile operating system, researchers said Thursday. The spyware took advantage of three previously undisclosed weaknesses in Apple's mobile operating system to take complete control of iPhone devices, according to reports published Thursday by the San Francisco-based Lookout smartphone security company and internet watchdog group Citizen Lab. Both reports fingered the NSO Group, an Israeli company with a reputation for flying under the radar, as the author of the spyware. "The threat actor has never been caught before," said Mike Murray, a researcher with Lookout, describing the program as "the most sophisticated spyware package we have seen in the market." The reports issued by Lookout and Citizen Lab — based at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs — outlined how an iPhone could be completely compromised with the tap of a finger, a trick so coveted in the world of cyberespionage that in November a spyware broker said it had paid a $1 million dollar bounty to programmers who'd found a way to do it. Such a compromise would give hackers full control over the phone, allowing them to eavesdrop on calls, harvest messages, activate cameras and microphones and drain the device of its personal data. Arie van Deursen, a professor of software engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, said both reports were credible and disturbing. Forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski described the malicious program as a "serious piece of spyware." Apple said in a statement that it fixed the vulnerability immediately after learning about it, but the security hole may have gone unpatched had it not been for the wariness of an embattled human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates. Ahmed Mansoor, a well-known human rights defender, first alerted Citizen Lab to the spyware after receiving an unusual text message on Aug. 10. Promising to reveal details about torture in the United Arab Emirates' prisons, the unknown sender included a suspicious-looking link at the bottom of the message. Mansoor wasn't convinced. Not only had he been imprisoned, beaten, robbed and had his passport confiscated by the authorities over the years, Mansoor had also repeatedly found himself in the crosshairs of electronic eavesdropping operations. In fact Mansoor already had the dubious distinction of having weathered attacks from two separate brands of commercial spyware. And when he shared the suspicious text with Citizen Lab researcher Bill Marczak, they realized he'd been targeted by a third. Marczak, who'd already been looking into the NSO Group, said he and fellow-researcher John Scott-Railton turned to Lookout for help picking apart the malicious program, a process which Murray compared to "defusing a bomb." "It is amazing the level they've gone through to avoid detection," he said of the software's makers. "They have a hair-trigger self-destruct." Working feverishly over a two-week period, the researchers found that Mansoor had been targeted by an unusually sophisticated piece of software which likely cost a small fortune to arm. "Ahmed Mansoor is a million-dollar human rights defender," Scott-Railton said. In a statement which stopped short of acknowledging that the spyware was its own, the NSO Group said its mission was to provide "authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime." The company said it had no knowledge of any particular incidents. It said it would not make any further comment. The apparent discovery of Israeli-made spyware being used to target a dissident in the United Arab Emirates raises awkward questions for both countries. The use of Israeli technology to police its own citizens is an uncomfortable strategy for an Arab country with no formal diplomatic ties to the Jewish state. And Israeli complicity in a cyberattack on an Arab dissident would seem to run counter to the country's self-description as a bastion of democracy in the Middle East. Authorities in both countries did not return calls seeking comment. Attorney Eitay Mack, who advocates for more transparency in Israeli arms exports, said his country's exports of surveillance software were not closely policed. "Surveillance is not considered a lethal weapon," Mack said. And Israeli regulations "don't take into consideration human rights or that it would be used by a government to oppress dissidents." He noted that Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cultivated ties with Arab Gulf states. Netanyahu in 2014 urged Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to join him in the war on terrorism. "Israel is looking for allies," Mack said. "And when Israel finds allies, it does not ask too many questions." Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Specifically, the “Touch Disease” is an iPhone 6 Plus condition that affects the phone’s TouchID sensor and the screen. Users report a flickering gray bar along the top of the screen and a faulty TouchID sensor. Apple doesn’t have a repair plan for the issue, which seems to be widespread and affecting mostly 5.5-inch devices. But third-party repair shops can fix the problem, and a report explains why it all happened. It appears that Bendgate problem Apple had to deal with soon after the iPhone 6 launched is back. DON’T MISS: iPhone 7: New leak may have just solved the only mystery left This “Touchgate” is related to Bendgate according to iPad Rehab’s Jessa Jones, who told Cult of Mac that the problem might be caused by the fact that bigger iPhone 6 units do tend to bend when a certain force is applied. “Nearly 90 percent of devices with Touch IC Disease are iPhone 6 Pluses,” Jones said. And it’s all because of Apple’s design choices. In the iPhone 6, instead of using a metal shield to protect the board like on the iPhone 5s, Apple reverted to a sticker shield. The sticker doesn’t protect the chips as good when the board bends and the Touch IC chip is especially susceptible to damage when the phone bends. “This is a signature failure,” said Jones. “Every phone has one, but this one is a signature failure that got to epic proportions.” The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are unaffected by the issue, as the touch chips were moved to the display to power the 3D Touch screen, the blog notes. Not to mention that the iPhone 6s units do not bend. Meanwhile, to prevent Touch Disease, you should use a case for your phone, and prevent any bending. For many users, that might be too late.

So why do we keep buying them? Every year, around this time, the Internet becomes a hotbed of rumors, reports, and leaked images of the latest iPhone. And with the next iPhone come the same perennial questions. Will you dump your old iPhone and upgrade to the new? Will you snub Apple entirely and stick with a smartphone from a less-hyped competitor such as Samsung, LG, or HTC? The question that's rarely asked, however, is whether you should own a smartphone of any kind, from any manufacturer. Few categories of consumer electronics have become as ubiquitous, and as quickly, as the smartphone. According to the Pew Research Center, 35 percent of American adults reported owning a smartphone in 2011. By last year, that number had reached 64 percent, and a second survey by Pew in 2015 showed that within the space of a few months, ownership had already leaped to 72 percent. That's an astounding rate of adoption. By comparison, over that same period (2011 to 2015), computer ownership declined from 76 to 73 percent, and while tablet ownership rose from 10 to 45 percent, purchases of new tablets have all but flattened out. Smartphones, meanwhile, are still rocketing up the y-axis of every sales graph available. TECH: 7 New Tricks We Expect to Find on the iPhone 7 This is a major success story for the people who make smartphones. But for the general public, it’s also evidence of one of the greatest scams of the digital age. Consider, first of all, how strangely expensive smartphones are. Most consumer electronics drop in price over time. Not so for the iPhone. When it was first introduced in 2007, the 4GB iPhone cost $499, and the 8GB was $599. Sales were brisk, but not as brisk as Cupertino wanted, so Apple ditched the 4GB model later that year, and dropped the 8GB — which became the base model — to $399. Nine years later, the default iPhone model, the 6s with 16GB of memory, starts at $649. That's a price increase of $250. And though Apple is often defined by its premium pricing, the competition isn't doing much to undercut them. The Samsung Galaxy S7 starts at $695 when bought through AT&T. Even a supposedly cheap smartphone, such as Google's Nexus 5X, costs $349, or around $50 less than the default iPhone at the end of its debut year. RELATED: The Best Contract-Free Smartphones On the whole, smartphones are bucking a long-standing trend in electronics, becoming more expensive over time, despite also being more common, and more technologically mature. Compare that escalation in cost to the steep year-to-year drop in price for flat-screen TVs. In 2007, a premium 46-inch LCD TV from Sony cost roughly $3,200. Today, a 48-inch from Sony with equivalent features runs $480. And though the newest iPhone is clearly thinner, lighter, and more powerful than the original, the current iPod Touch is $100 less than its 2007 counterpart, despite also being a vastly updated device. Discounted smartphones aren't hard to find, including some iPhone models introduced by Apple, such as the 5c. But the devices introduced every year drive the overall market, and new smartphones shrug off the price drops that are expected among other consumer electronics. No matter how expensive these things remain, or how much more expensive they get, the public's appetite for them is more ravenous than ever. RELATED: How to Choose the Right Laptop But for a scam to properly land, it needs to find a mark. In this case, the grift has found hundreds of millions of them. Since the introduction of the BlackBerry, and then the iPhone, consumers have steadily convinced themselves cellphones are sub-standard, and that smartphones are the baseline, default class of mobile device. What was once a high-priced gadget for early adopters, captains of industry, and the generally wealthy is now considered a kind of utility, a necessity for nearly every American adult. Whip out a feature phone — the ironic term that phone-makers use for non-smartphones — and brace for stares or outright ridicule. If you don't carry around a device in your pocket or bag that costs about the same as a mid-range laptop, you're wandering around the fringes of society. That's a lot of peer pressure to make a genuinely large purchase, and possibly the biggest electronics purchase you'll make in a few years. Read More But the ubiquity of smartphones has introduced other seemingly default costs, such as data plans. Snapchat clips and Netflix streams have replaced the low-data text exchanges and occasional Web surfing of five years ago. This shift isn't surprising. The main purpose of a smartphone is to transmit and receive more data than a standard handset. What's shocking is the ease with which Americans accepted the additional cost of $20, $30, or more per month for a cellular data plan. This isn't a cost that replaces some existing monthly expenditure. People aren't going to fewer movies in the theater because they can squint at Amazon Video while on the bus. It's simply more money, on top of the higher cost of a smartphone compared to a feature phone. Without any actual collusion or conspiracy, the phone makers, app developers, and carriers of the world have managed to turn cellphones into a laughingstock, and smartphones into a must-have.  That's despite the fact that roughly three quarters of American adults have at least one device that's perfectly capable of sending and receiving digital content, such as a computer or tablet. And whatever fantasies most have of putting those smartphones to work, and conducting urgent business throughout the day while proudly on the go, let's face facts: We're posting musings about the weather to Facebook, mugging with digital makeup on Snapchat, and fussing over photo filters for throwaway snapshots in Instagram. Some amount of data transfer and display is a clear benefit, but with the exception of a tiny portion of power users, smartphone hardware and data plans are overkill. RELATED: The Best Laptops Under $500 Admittedly, there are some people for whom smartphones function as something like a utility. Some 10 percent of American adults have a smartphone, and no broadband access at home. Fifteen percent report that their smartphone is their only regular means of getting online. For these consumers, a smartphone isn't a redundant luxury, but a stand-in for a computer and a broadband connection. Just as cellphones have been revolutionary for the developing world, granting financial freedom and opening up educational resources to the deeply impoverished, smartphones can be a lifeline for poor Americans. But despite how hard these power users are putting their handsets to work, they still don't require the most feature-packed, exorbitantly priced phones, or the biggest data plans.  When the iPhone 7 comes out, it will be considered the new normal in smartphones, with anything less representing a bargain-bin consolation prize. That's a market turned upside-down. The iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 and even the Nexus 5X should be seen for the luxury products that they are, the Acuras and BMWs of consumer electronics. Maybe it's time for a shift in perspective, and to stop assuming that everyone needs the best possible smartphone. Just as no one sneers at the existence of a Toyota Corolla, there's no need to laugh at a feature phone, or take pity on the low-cost workhorses of mobile computing. Chances are, it's the average iPhone 7 owner who's a certified sucker, and more deserving of your sympathy.

Related News/Archive Apple unveils iPhone 7 with better camera, no headphone jack 2 Months Ago Apple iPhone, once a status symbol in China, loses its luster 7 Months Ago St. Petersburg's Jabil looks to fresh markets as demand slows for Apple's iPhone 5 Months Ago The spyware took advantage of three previously undisclosed weaknesses in Apple's mobile operating system to take complete control of iPhone devices, according to reports published Thursday by the San Francisco-based Lookout smartphone security company and internet watchdog group Citizen Lab. Both reports fingered the NSO Group, an Israeli company with a reputation for flying under the radar, as the author of the spyware. "The threat actor has never been caught before," said Mike Murray, a researcher with Lookout, describing the program as "the most sophisticated spyware package we have seen in the market." The reports issued by Lookout and Citizen Lab — based at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs — outlined how an iPhone could be completely compromised with the tap of a finger, a trick so coveted in the world of cyberespionage that in November a spyware broker said it had paid a $1 million dollar bounty to programmers who'd found a way to do it. Such a compromise would give hackers full control over the phone, allowing them to eavesdrop on calls, harvest messages, activate cameras and microphones and drain the device of its personal data. Arie van Deursen, a professor of software engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, said both reports were credible and disturbing. Forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski described the malicious program as a "serious piece of spyware." Apple said in a statement that it fixed the vulnerability immediately after learning about it, but the security hole may have gone unpatched had it not been for the wariness of an embattled human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates. Ahmed Mansoor, a well-known human rights defender, first alerted Citizen Lab to the spyware after receiving an unusual text message on Aug. 10. Promising to reveal details about torture in the United Arab Emirates' prisons, the unknown sender included a suspicious-looking link at the bottom of the message. Mansoor wasn't convinced. Not only had he been imprisoned, beaten, robbed and had his passport confiscated by the authorities over the years, Mansoor had also repeatedly found himself in the crosshairs of electronic eavesdropping operations. In fact Mansoor already had the dubious distinction of having weathered attacks from two separate brands of commercial spyware. And when he shared the suspicious text with Citizen Lab researcher Bill Marczak, they realized he'd been targeted by a third. Marczak, who'd already been looking into the NSO Group, said he and fellow-researcher John Scott-Railton turned to Lookout for help picking apart the malicious program, a process which Murray compared to "defusing a bomb." "It is amazing the level they've gone through to avoid detection," he said of the software's makers. "They have a hair-trigger self-destruct." Working feverishly over a two-week period, the researchers found that Mansoor had been targeted by an unusually sophisticated piece of software which likely cost a small fortune to arm. "Ahmed Mansoor is a million-dollar human rights defender," Scott-Railton said. In a statement which stopped short of acknowledging that the spyware was its own, the NSO Group said its mission was to provide "authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime." The company said it had no knowledge of any particular incidents. It said it would not make any further comment. The apparent discovery of Israeli-made spyware being used to target a dissident in the United Arab Emirates raises awkward questions for both countries. The use of Israeli technology to police its own citizens is an uncomfortable strategy for an Arab country with no formal diplomatic ties to the Jewish state. And Israeli complicity in a cyberattack on an Arab dissident would seem to run counter to the country's self-description as a bastion of democracy in the Middle East. Authorities in both countries did not return calls seeking comment. Attorney Eitay Mack, who advocates for more transparency in Israeli arms exports, said his country's exports of surveillance software were not closely policed. "Surveillance is not considered a lethal weapon," Mack said. And Israeli regulations "don't take into consideration human rights or that it would be used by a government to oppress dissidents." He noted that Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cultivated ties with Arab Gulf states. Netanyahu in 2014 urged Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to join him in the war on terrorism. "Israel is looking for allies," Mack said. "And when Israel finds allies, it does not ask too many questions."

Human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor shows Associated Press journalists a screenshot of a spoof text message he received in Ajman, United Arab Emirates, on Thursday, Aug. 25, 2016. (Photo: (AP Photo/Jon Gambrell)) SAN FRANCISCO — Apple issued a security update to prevent attacks by rare, highly expensive spyware that exploits flaws in the mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads, after security researchers said it was used to target a Middle Eastern dissident's phone. In a statement to USA TODAY Thursday, Apple said it immediately fixed the vulnerability upon learning of it. It advises customers to download the latest version of its iOS, version 9.3.5, for security protection. The Associated Press first reported on the patch. The espionage software was discovered because it had been targeted at Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent United Arab Emirates dissident. Mansoor received a text message on his iPhone 6 that invited him to click on a web link. He had been the victim of spyware in the past and so forwarded the message to researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. Researchers there worked with San Francisco-based mobile security firm Lookout. In a blog post Thursday on its website, Lookout researchers said they found a “sophisticated, targeted, and persistent mobile attack on iOS using three zero-day vulnerabilities we call ‘Trident.’” The flaw lets the hacker break into an iOS device and spy on information gleaned from the victims' apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp, FaceTime, Gmail and Calendar, the post said. "As security breaches go, this is fairly serious, considering how fast Apple addressed it," says Andrew Blaich, a staff researcher at Lookout. Citizen Lab traced the link to NSO Group, which it calls a “cyberwar” company in Israel that sells a spyware product called Pegasus, said John Scott-Railton, one of the Citizen Lab report's authors. NSO would not comment on whether it had sold the software. “NSO’s mission is to help make the world a safer place, by providing authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime,” said Zamir Dahbash, NSO spokesman, in a statement to USA TODAY. The company only sells its software to authorized governmental agencies and requires customers to sign an agreement that its products will only be used in a lawful manner, specifically “the prevention and investigation of crimes,” he said. NSO Group is reportedly owned by an American venture capital firm, Francisco Partners Management, according to Citizen Lab. A call to FPM was not immediately returned. COSTLY GEAR The cost of such sophisticated spyware is very high. A set of similar digital tools recently sold for $1 million, Citizen Lab's Scott-Railton and his co-author, Bill Marczak, wrote in an online report posted Thursday. The Internet watchdog group discovered the security hole a few weeks ago and immediately notified Apple, Lookout's Blaich said. Human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor shows Associated Press journalists a screenshot of a spoof text message he received in Ajman, United Arab Emirates, on Thursday, Aug. 25, 2016. Mansoor was recently targeted by spyware that can hack into Apple's iPhone handset. The company said Thursday it was updated its security. The text message reads: "New secrets on the torture of Emirati citizens in jail."  (Photo: AP Photo/Jon Gambrell) The researchers don't know what organization or government was behind the attempted hack of Mansoor’s iPhone, but Scott-Railton noted a likely suspect would be the United Arab Emirates, where Mansoor is seen as a dissident. He has been unable to leave the country since 2011 after his passport was taken. A representative for the UAE's embassy in Washington, D.C. did not respond to a request for comment. Once installed on an iPhone, the malware in question could rifle through contacts, photos, notes and other items stored on the phone or download the user's calendar. It could even surreptitiously turn on the phone’s microphone, recording conversations and then sending them to the owners of the malware, Scott-Railton said. The disclosure offers fresh evidence that mobile platforms are “fertile ground for gathering sensitive information,” the post said. How widespread use of the malware is, is not clear, said Scott-Railton. The Citizen Lab believes that similar software from the NSO Group was used to target a Mexican journalism, Rafael Cabrera, who was reporting on a scandal involving Mexico’s president. Apple strengthens security The breach is potentially very bad because the security flaws appear to have been available for at least three years, said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist with the Center for Democracy & Technology in Washington D.C. “In which case, any iOS device could have been remotely hacked with this trio of flaws,” he said. Discovery of such sophisticated software being used to spy on individuals should not be surprising, said Herb Lin, a senior research scholar for cyber policy and security at Stanford University. “There are many groups out there that operate in the shadows,” he said. Apple is clearly aware of the threat. Earlier this month, it beefed up security efforts with its first bug bounty program, with awards up to $200,000 for security researchers for each software bug they find that compromises Apple products. It debuted the program at Black Hat, an influential computer security conference in Las Vegas. Many companies already offer such programs. The announcement came on the heels of a showdown between Apple and the FBI over the feds’ demand that Apple help in its attempts to crack an iPhone 5C used by San Bernardino, Calif., shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. The FBI ditched its legal fight against Apple after it hired an unnamed firm to break into the iPhone without Apple's help. USA TODAY Does the FBI's move mean iPhones are hackable?

And the town is ready to entertain them with four days of music, arts and crafts, family-friendly merry-making and of course, apples. "It gives us the opportunity to put on the best show we can," said Hendersonville City Councilman Jeff Miller, also a downtown merchant. "It just shows our culture. From what I understand, the hotel rooms are full. A lot of people come and stay for for the whole event." The festival has a $12 million impact on the Hendersonville economy, executive director David Nicholson said. The Apple Festival has become the region's biggest family festival, Nicholson said. Turnout comes from both Western North Carolina and from Upstate South Carolina, with an impressive number making the trip from Charlotte, he said. There's plenty to enjoy, not the least being apples grown by Henderson County orchards. The festival will have 15 booths with fresh apples. And there are more treats: caramel apples, apple slushies, fried apple pies, etc. The festival also includes the 35th Annual Henderson County Gem and Mineral Show at the Whitmire Activity Center at 310 Lily Pond Road, Friday's Kiwanis pancake breakfast at First Baptist Church at 4th Avenue and & Washington Street, a Friday apple recipe contest in the First Citizens Bank Plaza at the corner of Main Street and 6th Avenue, a street fair with 200 vendors, a children's carnival at the Wells Fargo Bank and the Visitor Center parking lots, Saturday's Hendersonville Lions Club Big Apple Breakfast, a Saturday tour of local orchards, a quilt show, Saturday rides in vintage aircraft at the WNC Air Museum and much more. The whole schedule can be found at www.ncapplefestival.org/ The big event is the annual King Apple Parade at 2:30 p.m. Monday along Main Street downtown, with about 70 units. The festival goes on rain or shine. As for parking, it will be busy especially on Saturday and Monday, Nicholson said, but there are plenty of private pay lots around downtown, many of them operated by area non-profit organization. The festival is alcohol free but you can find hard apple cider, beers and other adult beverages in restaurants and pubs around town. If you are coming for a particular event, allow travel time for possible traffic delays heading into downtown Hendersonville off Intestate 26. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/2bZzPb2 TOP VIDEOS Who is Nikki Haley? 1:30 Beads of Courage remind teen of what he went through 1:10 911 call: I'm being attacked by bear; I'm going to die 1:05 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Man explains why he is poll watching at a Greenville County Precinct 0:42 Church Burned and Vandalized in Greenville 2:17 Todd Kohlhepp's neighbors relieved he's in custody 1:17 Family dog euthanized during search 1:58 Dad builds phenomenal costumes for his son 0:49

Four years after bungling on maps, Apple is caught on a wrong foot over the malfunctioning of touchscreens and a flickering gray bar at the top of the display. According to ifixit.org, many iPhone users are reporting the loss of touch combined with a flickering gray bar. “This issue is widespread enough that I feel like almost every iPhone 6/6+ has a touch of it (no pun intended) and are like ticking bombs just waiting to act up,” Jason Villmer, owner of Misso-uri based repair shop STS Telecom, was quote as telling ifixit.org. While the touch problem has been around since the launch of the phone, experts say it was not manifested widely until recently. Several iPhone users have complained against touch problem on Apple’s online support forum, without being successful in getting the mobile maker resolve the problem. The portal, which coined a new phrase “Touch Disease” for this problem, believes that the malfunctioning of the screen stems from Apple’s design of its logic board. Replacing the touchscreen doesn’t fix the problem, experts feel. “The gray bar eventually shows up on the new screen, too. Because, according to repair pros, the problem isn’t the screen at all. It’s the two touchscreen controller chips, or Touch IC chips, on the logic board inside the phone.” “These two chips translate your finger mashing on the display into information your phone can actually use. When the Touch IC chips go bad, you can jab, tap, and poke the screen all you want — your phone can’t correctly process the information. At least, not until these chips are replaced with new ones,” the tech portal explained.

Resend activation e-mail Risk Assessment / Security & Hacktivism Actively exploited iOS flaws that hijack iPhones patched by Apple Jailbreak vulnerabilities allowed attackers to tap encrypted chat messages. by Dan Goodin - Aug 25, 2016 7:10 pm UTC Login to bookmark 133 iPhone Spyware known as Pegasus intercepts confidential data. Lookout Apple has patched three high-severity iOS vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited to infect iPhones so attackers can steal confidential messages from a large number of apps, including Gmail, Facebook, and WhatsApp, security researchers said Thursday. The spyware has been dubbed Pegasus by researchers from mobile security provider Lookout; they believe it has been circulating in the wild for a significant amount of time. Working with researchers from University of Toronto-based Citizen Lab, they have determined that the spyware targeted a political dissident located in the United Arab Emirates and was launched by an US-owned company specializing in computer-based exploits. Based on the price of the attack kit—about $8 million for 300 licenses—the researchers believe it's being actively used against other iPhone users throughout the world. "Pegasus is the most sophisticated attack we’ve seen on any endpoint because it takes advantage of how integrated mobile devices are in our lives and the combination of features only available on mobile—always connected (WiFi, 3G/4G), voice communications, camera, email, messaging, GPS, passwords, and contact lists," Lookout and Citizen Lab researchers wrote in a blog post. "It is modular to allow for customization and uses strong encryption to evade detection." After the exploits surreptitiously jailbreak a target's iPhone, Pegasus immediately starts trawling through a wealth of its resources. It copies call histories, text messages, calendar entries, and contacts. It's capable of activating the cameras and microphones of compromised phones to eavesdrop on nearby activities. It can also track a target's movements and steal messages from end-to-end encrypted chat apps. As Ars has reported, Apple has already issued updates that patch the three vulnerabilities that make the infections possible. While such attacks are likely to target only the most high-value targets—say, Fortune 500 executives and high-profile dissidents—all iOS users should install the fixes as soon as possible. The researchers have dubbed the exploit Trident because it relies on three separate vulnerabilities, indexed as CVE-2016-4654, CVE-2016-4655, and CVE-2016-4656. The exploit targeting UAE dissident Ahmed Mansoor arrived in a text message two weeks ago that promised secret information about detainees tortured in UAE jails. Mansoor forwarded the messages to Citizen Lab researchers who determined that the linked webpages led to a chain of exploits that would have jailbroken his iPhone and installed the Pegasus spyware. "In this case, the software is highly configurable," Thursday's blog post continued. "Depending on the country of use and feature sets purchased by the user, the spyware capabilities include accessing messages, calls, emails, logs, and more from apps including Gmail, Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, Viber, FaceTime, Calendar, Line, Mail.Ru, WeChat, SS, Tango, and others. The kit appears to persist even when the device software is updated and can update itself to easily replace exploits if they become obsolete." Analysis of the underlying code indicates that it dates back 2013, when iOS version 7 was still in use. In addition to targeting Mansoor, the researchers believe that other high-value people are also being targeted for purposes of corporate espionage. The spyware was developed by NSO Group, an Israeli-based division of US-headquartered company Francisco Partners Management. According to an article published last November by Reuters, Francisco Partners paid $120 million in 2014 to acquire a majority stake in NSO and was exploring a sale that could value the division at $1 billion. NSO Group is so secretive that it has regularly changed its name, Reuters also reported. It had earnings of about $75 million. The sophisticated attack chaining together three separate iOS vulnerabilities is a testament to both the security of Apple's mobile operating system and the skill of outside attackers at bypassing those considerable protections. Last year, a software broker calling itself Zerodium offered $1 million for iOS exploits that gave attackers complete control of underlying iPhones. The company pledged to pay a total of $3 million. Apple, meanwhile, pays a maximum of $200,000 for comparable exploits. The prices mean that attacks are likely to target only the highest value people as opposed to more opportunistic mass campaigns. The Trident/Pegasus attacks mark the third time Mansoor has been targeted by so-called "legal intercept" malware. Citizen Lab has uncovered evidence that he was targeted by exploit software known as FinFisher in 2011 and by similar spyware from Italy-based Hacking Team in 2012. Citizen Lab has also found evidence that NSO Group's exploit infrastructure was used against a Mexican journalist after reporting on corruption by the country's head of state. NSO Group has used fake domains that impersonate the Red Cross, the UK government's visa application processing website, news organizations, and major technology companies. Lookout and Citizen Lab have published additional reports here, here and here that among other things detail the exploits and a list of behavioral anomalies more advanced iPhone users can use to identify infected devices.

Quote: It can also track a target's movements and steal messages from end-to-end encrypted chat apps. I'm not sure why "jailbreak" or "encrypted" were in the subhead or the quoted sentence. These exploits were not used in jailbreaking. They were used against dissidents and human rights activists. Edit: To be clear, I dislike "jailbreak" being used like this because people that think they know better will publicly rally against installing iOS 9.3.5 because they incorrectly believe they will lose something important. And encryption is moot here as the exploits injected code directly into the target app's address space. This means they could access anything and do anything the target app could do, including reading transcripts. Quote: iPhone Spyware known as Pegasus intercepts confidential data before it reaches the iOS kernel. I'm unsure what you mean by this. Userspace App data doesn't tend to be handled by the kernel (in kernelspace) directly. Can you elaborate? I think it was fair using the "jailbrake vulnerabilty" wording in the article. It says that using the vulnerability on a specially crafted web site, the iphone gets automatically jailbroken and the malware gets installed. Without the vulnerability the malware could not be installed so jailbraking is a prerequisite. Original poster seems to equate "jailbreak" with user originated defeat of sand boxing protection. Not sure that is commonly held. Jailbreaking as I've heard it used in the Dev community simply means defeating the sandbox protection and gaining root access, particularly in a persistent manner. Given the confusion, it might be better described as "gaining root access in order to perform a custom invisible persistent jailbreak". But that's a mouthful. I think the use of jail breaking vulnerability is fine to describe a vulnerability that can be used in a jailbreak regardless of who's doing it. If you MUST distinguish then maybe the slang "rooting" will do (though it doesn't imply persistence the way jailbreak does. I think the sensitivity comes from people who want to pretend that jail breaking is safe and virtuous. 41 posts | registered 9/4/2007 uhuznaa Ars Praefectus jump to post To all those who think security is binary (either you're totally secure or else): An attack kit that costs $8 million for 300 licenses won't be used nilly-willy. The rarer exploits are, the higher the stakes and attackers will try to make sure to keep it secret so that they can use it as long as possible (since the next set of usable exploits may be hard to get or at least even more expensive). The way to have more secure devices goes exactly this direction. 3073 posts | registered 7/23/2007 Reader comments 133 You must login or create an account to comment.

Mansoor was recently targeted by spyware that can hack into Apple's iPhone handset. The company said Thursday it was updated its security. The text message reads: "New secrets on the torture of Emirati citizens in jail." (AP Photo/Jon Gambrell) PARIS • A botched attempt to break into the iPhone of an Arab activist using hitherto unknown espionage software has trigged a global upgrade of Apple's mobile operating system, researchers said Thursday. The spyware took advantage of three previously undisclosed weaknesses in Apple's mobile operating system to take complete control of iPhone devices, according to reports published Thursday by the San Francisco-based Lookout smartphone security company and internet watchdog group Citizen Lab. Both reports fingered the NSO Group, an Israeli company with a reputation for flying under the radar, as the author of the spyware. "The threat actor has never been caught before," said Mike Murray, a researcher with Lookout, describing the program as "the most sophisticated spyware package we have seen in the market." The reports issued by Lookout and Citizen Lab — based at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs — outlined how an iPhone could be completely compromised with the tap of a finger, a trick so coveted in the world of cyberespionage that in November a spyware broker said it had paid a $1 million dollar bounty to programmers who'd found a way to do it. Such a compromise would give hackers full control over the phone, allowing them to eavesdrop on calls, harvest messages, activate cameras and microphones and drain the device of its personal data. Arie van Deursen, a professor of software engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, said both reports were credible and disturbing. Forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski described the malicious program as a "serious piece of spyware." Apple said in a statement that it fixed the vulnerability immediately after learning about it, but the security hole may have gone unpatched had it not been for the wariness of an embattled human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates. Ahmed Mansoor, a well-known human rights defender, first alerted Citizen Lab to the spyware after receiving an unusual text message on Aug. 10. Promising to reveal details about torture in the United Arab Emirates' prisons, the unknown sender included a suspicious-looking link at the bottom of the message. Mansoor wasn't convinced. Not only had he been imprisoned, beaten, robbed and had his passport confiscated by the authorities over the years, Mansoor had also repeatedly found himself in the crosshairs of electronic eavesdropping operations. In fact Mansoor already had the dubious distinction of having weathered attacks from two separate brands of commercial spyware. And when he shared the suspicious text with Citizen Lab researcher Bill Marczak, they realized he'd been targeted by a third. Marczak, who'd already been looking into the NSO Group, said he and fellow-researcher John Scott-Railton turned to Lookout for help picking apart the malicious program, a process which Murray compared to "defusing a bomb." "It is amazing the level they've gone through to avoid detection," he said of the software's makers. "They have a hair-trigger self-destruct." Working feverishly over a two-week period, the researchers found that Mansoor had been targeted by an unusually sophisticated piece of software which likely cost a small fortune to arm. "Ahmed Mansoor is a million-dollar human rights defender," Scott-Railton said. In a statement which stopped short of acknowledging that the spyware was its own, the NSO Group said its mission was to provide "authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime." The company said it had no knowledge of any particular incidents. It said it would not make any further comment. Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis How do they stack up? Compare pay of top St. Louis executives Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Who's hired? Check our People in Business The apparent discovery of Israeli-made spyware being used to target a dissident in the United Arab Emirates raises awkward questions for both countries. The use of Israeli technology to police its own citizens is an uncomfortable strategy for an Arab country with no formal diplomatic ties to the Jewish state. And Israeli complicity in a cyberattack on an Arab dissident would seem to run counter to the country's self-description as a bastion of democracy in the Middle East. Authorities in both countries did not return calls seeking comment. Attorney Eitay Mack, who advocates for more transparency in Israeli arms exports, said his country's exports of surveillance software were not closely policed. "Surveillance is not considered a lethal weapon," Mack said. And Israeli regulations "don't take into consideration human rights or that it would be used by a government to oppress dissidents." He noted that Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cultivated ties with Arab Gulf states. Netanyahu in 2014 urged Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to join him in the war on terrorism. "Israel is looking for allies," Mack said. "And when Israel finds allies, it does not ask too many questions." Cheslow reported from Herzliya, Israel. Jon Gambrell and Fay Abuelgasim in Ajman contributed to this report.
