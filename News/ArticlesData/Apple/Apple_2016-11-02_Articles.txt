But the accessory is on track to ship before the year's end.  ( Stephen Lam | Getty Images ) Advertisement The svelte-looking AirPods, unveiled at the Apple keynote in September, got most people talking for all sorts of reasons. Now, these overly hyped earbuds have been delayed, although they will ship within this year. AirPods, the wireless earphones from Apple, quickly made it to the wishlist of iDevice lovers, especially those who were looking to buy the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. However, the accessory is yet to make its way to consumers. Despite the hiccups, whatever they might be, Apple fans will be pleased to learn that the AirPods — which Tim Cook claims do not fall off even when dancing — will reach device owners this year and not by January 2017. The news is courtesy of insiders, cited by AppleInsider, who affirm that Apple is on course to launch the much-awaited wireless earphones within 2016. "Sources familiar with the company's plans indicated that internally, there is no official delay until January for shipment of the wireless earbuds," shared the publication. "One person briefed on the matter said plainly that there was 'no way that these are getting pushed to January.'" At the time of launch, Apple did not give an exact date when the AirPods would be made available, merely stating that the accessory would hit the shelves sometime in late October. However, the product release was delayed as confirmed by the company: "we don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers." A rumor courtesy of supply chain sources in China purports that the AirPods would not make its way to retail shelves before January 2017, which hinted at Apple encountering problems with the peripherals. But the latest tip off from industry insiders would be welcomed by consumers as they might soon be able to lay their hands on the $159 AirPods, which can reportedly last 5 hours on a single charge. The fact that retail sources have affirmed that they have a few demo pairs for customers and are "ready to go any time," simply awaiting the green light from Apple, is a positive sign. This suggests that the launch of the AirPods might be sooner than we estimate. An educated guess is that Apple might launch the wireless AirPods ahead of the holiday shopping season for people looking to buy the earbuds as a gift. However, we need to wait and watch when the AirPods, featuring the W1 chip, will finally be made available. TAG Apple, AirPods, Earbuds © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Related 'Google Pixel XL' review: A fresh take on Android 'OnePlus 3' review: Value-for-price flagship device with a fingerprint scanner This year, we’ve seen camera phones improve a great deal, thanks to larger sensors with larger pixels, wider apertures, dual lens systems, hybrid autofocus and even detachable camera mods. Karan Bajaj & Hitesh Raj Bhagat rank the top camera phones to help you choose the best one: Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 Edge While it’s hard to pick an absolute winner when you’re comparing these flagships, the Galaxy S7 has a lot going for it because of the reduced prices. You can snag a new S7 for about `43,000 at the time of writing which is great value for the kind of performance it delivers. The S7 camera is so good that the company left it as is, even in the ill-fated Note 7, which was supposed to be this year’s flagship. The f1.7 aperture combined with Samsung’s dual pixel autofocus delivers fantastic results irrespective of the scenario and lighting conditions. Moreover, the camera UI is loaded with tweaks and shooting modes. The f1.7 aperture combined with Samsung’s dual pixel autofocus in the Galaxy S7 delivers fantastic results. (Image: AFP) Apple iPhone 7 Plus/Google Pixel/Pixel XL We could not decide on a winner between these two phones for the second position. The iPhone 7 Plus is certainly one of the best in every aspect and has the best implementation of a dual lens system we have seen so far (that Portrait mode with super-shallow depth of field will blow you away every time). The issue is Apple still does not offer as much control over the camera as compared to Android. Google’s Pixel delivers fantastic details, the fastest autofocus around (beating even the mighty iPhone 7 Plus), super-stable 4K video and amazing low light capability thanks to some software magic. However, the pixel loses a point because it skips OIS — this is a vital spec in flagships now. The super-stable 4K video and amazing low light capability of the Google Pixel are a dream come true for any photographer. (Image: Reuters) LG G5/HTC 10/ Apple iPhone 7 The LG and HTC cameras deliver great results on their own, but in comparison to the phones on the top, they lose out. Both LG and HTC suffer from more visible noise when compared to our first and second position winners. Moreover, the dynamic range, colours and details in low light images are the common areas where both these phones loose out in comparison. The iPhone 7 has OIS compared to its predecessor and works as a great all-rounder phone like the LG and HTC. However, in a head-to-head comparison the Samsung, iPhone 7 Plus and Pixel, these phones feel lacking in results. OnePlus 3/Moto Z Both these phones tied for the fourth position for all-round performance. Both deliver fantastic images in day light but lost the top three ranks due to performance in low light. OnePlus 3 proved it mettle with great results in auto HDR mode and fantastic image stabilization (optical + electronic). Moto Z delivered better results with its f1.8 lens in low light compared to OnePlus but still was not up to the mark in comparison to the winners. What sets it apart is the option of the Hasselblad MotoMod. Using this snap on Moto Mod tuned by Hasselblad (a `20k option), you get a 10x optical zoom, support for RAW image capture and a xenon flash. Moto Z delivers great results with its f1.8 lens in low light. (Image: ​ www.motorola.in) Sony Xperia XZ/ Honor 8 The XZ has a 5-axis stabilization system for video recording and the phone manages to deliver top-notch stabilized 4k video. Its focusing system is fantastic with the combination of phase detection, contrast detection and laser autofocus. However, still photos are where it skips a beat — the lack of OIS leads to poor performance in low light images. The Honor 8 stands neck and neck with the Xperia XZ with its dual lens camera. While the shallow depth of field is not as good as the iPhone 7 plus, the Honor 8 captures good details. Low light images are great when viewed on the phone – look closely and you can see a lot of noise in darker areas. One letdown on Honor 8 is the lack of 4k video recording. Special Mentions Asus Zenfone 3 — Asus has focused a lot on camera quality with the Zenfone 3 range. It takes sharp images with minimal noise and has a great OIS system. The only reason it did not make it to the top 5 was that its performance indoors and in low light is lacking in comparison. Xiaomi Mi5 — Mi5 was amongst the best camera phones when it launched earlier this year. The 16MP camera combined with 4-axis OIS delivers good results in daylight but it’s not an all-rounder. In direct comparison, it fails to match up to the image quality delivered by our top 5 ranked phones. Nubia Z11 Mini — Nubia is still a less known brand when it comes to India (especially after separation from ZTE). However, the recently launched Z11 Mini’s camera shocked us with excellent dynamic range, natural colours and fast performance. If it included OIS and 4k video recording capability, it could have been in the top 5. Want stories like this in your inbox? Sign up for the weekly ET Panache newsletter.

[Photo: courtesy of Nintendo] Jared Newman 11.03.16 1:00 PM To see what the future holds for the Nintendo Switch game console, it might help to look at the iPad. Six years ago, Apple's then-novel tablet was weaker than the cheapest PC. It couldn't even handle two apps running side by side, and even some web pages would grind the device to a halt. Using one in place of a laptop was an extreme act of minimalism. But over the last year, the iPad has reached a performance turning point. Phil Schiller, Apple's head of worldwide marketing, claimed last fall that the 12.9-inch iPad Pro was faster than 80% of all portable PCs. As performance improves and the software becomes more PC-like, it's not hard to imagine the iPad becoming good enough to replace a lot more laptops. There are some parallels between the iPad and the Nintendo Switch, the portable game console set to be released in March 2017. Like the iPad, the Switch will use an ARM-based processor, the same energy-efficient architecture that powers the vast majority of smartphones. This allows Nintendo to cram the Switch's computing power inside a portable display, which attaches to a pair of controllers for handheld gaming. But that portability does come with a trade-off: The Switch probably won't be as powerful as Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4, whose x86-based processors share the same architecture as pretty much every laptop and desktop PC. That doesn't mean Nintendo's bet on ARM won't prove smarter in the long run. Just as the iPad's performance is catching up to the needs of most PC users, Nintendo could narrow the performance gap with its rivals over time while reaping major advantages from its portability. Necessary Investments Nintendo won't be the first company to build an ARM-based game console. A few years ago, "microconsoles" such as Ouya attempted to bring Android games to the living room, and Roku, Amazon, and Apple have all dabbled in gaming on their own ARM-based streaming video boxes. Still, none of these efforts have managed to draw significant crowds away from traditional consoles. The difference with Nintendo, aside from its brand power, is that it's not merely recycling smartphone or tablet components. Instead, the company has hired Nvidia to make a custom ARM chip that emphasizes gaming performance. (An Nvidia blog post about the collaboration boasts of the "500 man-years" that went into meeting Nintendo's precise needs.) Custom chips are standard practice in the game console business, but they're an expensive endeavor, so it helps to have existing technology to build from, says Patrick Moorhead, an industry analyst and head of Moor Insights and Strategy. With Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4, for instance, both companies used custom chips from AMD that built upon the company's existing PC technology. "There was a base to go off of," Moorhead says. "AMD already had a very high-performance CPU and a very high-performance GPU, and a lot of video IP." ARM generally hasn't seen much investment in high-performance graphics, as chip makers have focused on mainstream smartphone and tablet use. Earlier this year, however, Nvidia started wooing the auto industry with its new Parker mobile processor, which emphasizes processing power and graphics performance. Although Parker is ostensibly built to handle complex self-driving algorithms and fancy dashboard displays, Moorhead suspects some shared lineage between it and the custom chip inside the Nintendo Switch. "I doubt that Nvidia would have been motivated to [work with Nintendo] had it not shared similar technology in other places," he says. Those investments matter because they likely give Nintendo a base to work with over multiple hardware generations. Microsoft and Sony are already moving toward PC-like ecosystems, where users keep their existing game libraries as the upgrade to new consoles; Nintendo could come up with a similar system based on ARM as Nvidia keeps investing in high-performance ARM chips. "They would need the commitment from Nvidia to do that," Moorhead says. "But I believe Nvidia's going to be very successful in the automotive space—particularly given the recent announcement of Tesla—and I think they've been waiting for this moment." [Photo: courtesy of Nvidia] Into The Future Granted, the Nintendo Switch's performance will always be limited by the portable nature of the console. A battery-powered system must consume less power than a hardwired one, and the handheld display creates space constraints. (Moorhead floats the idea of a docking system that keeps the processor cool while running it at a faster speed, boosting the potential resolution while the user plays on a TV, but even this system would have its limits.) That said, it may not be long before traditional consoles start to see diminishing returns on their performance investments. The difference between 1080p and 4K resolution, for instance, is already tough to discern, yet that resolution boost is a major selling point in upcoming console revisions from Sony and Microsoft. Over time, Nintendo's performance disadvantages could become less noticeable. Meanwhile, the Switch's portable nature could prove advantageous for virtual reality, since it can operate untethered from a television. It's not hard to imagine the Switch docking into a VR headset, similar to Samsung's Gear VR and Google's Daydream. (Nintendo president Tatsumi Kimishima recently told Bloomberg that the company is "interested in VR.") If virtual reality takes off, Nintendo's bet on ARM could look especially wise compared to its console rivals, who are now fully invested in PC-like architecture. Just as Microsoft's Windows was ill-prepared for the rise of ARM-based phones and tablets, both the Xbox and PlayStation could have trouble adapting as VR goes mobile. Looking further into the future, Nintendo may even have a better chance at wooing new game developers who've cut their teeth on ARM-based phones and tablets. As Moorhead notes, writing a mobile game can be an art in terms of balancing performance and battery life, but it's becoming the norm as mobile gaming overtakes traditional consoles. "It gives them a hell of a lot more people who understand how to program for mobile," Moorhead says. "The number of hardware and software engineers who would understand how to work on this and make it successful is a lot higher." None of this is to say that Nintendo's strategy is foolproof. If we're drawing parallels to the iPad, it's worth noting that Apple's sales and the tablet market as a whole have collapsed over the last few years. That explains why Apple is now making a bigger push for the still-sizable PC market, but the iPad's ability to win those users over is still uncertain. The reality may be that people still use PCs for work, and rely on their smartphones for practically everything else, with ARM-based tablets occupying a muddy middle ground. In the gaming world, the risk with the Nintendo Switch is precisely the same. Power-Up: The Bleeping Amazing History Of Nintendo In 4 Minutes Never miss a story.

Conventional wisdom dictated that operating across industries and business lines meant that slowdowns in one area could be compensated for in another. This is particularly true in emerging markets, where ups and downs tend to be greater and access to valuable resources including financing more difficult. This enables big companies to leverage their access over a range of industries. Tata is involved in everything from chemicals, steel, cars and business consulting to telecommunications, and hotels. The Wanda group is in everything from property to cinemas and tourism. In developed economies, the benefits of diversification are much smaller and conglomerates have been disappearing. Sometimes, subtracting rather than adding is a better strategy for innovative companies to capture the consumer’s attention Spreading out can also cause challenges, especially for technology companies. Digitalisation carries the promise of value creation through integration of everything from gaming, entertainment and communication to refrigeration and heating. But instead of being valuable you can end up being a bit of everything to everybody, meaning nothing to nobody, as Sony learned. Sony has only recently started reaping the benefits of an ambitious turnaround effort to offset a long decline in consumer popularity and brand value. Technology analysts say Sony essentially squandered an opportunity to harmonise the valuable, but growing assets in its portfolio, such as consumer electronics, its recording label and movie studio to take on the likes of Apple, which came to dominate entertainment through its iPhone and other devices with music and movies or Samsung, which came to dominate hardware component industries. For the complexity that the expansion into different businesses brings, challenges not only management; it also carries the risk of overwhelming customers. Sony is now focused on entertainment and rightfully so. Its games division under PlayStation recently helped the company to post an expectations-beating quarterly profit, led by successful monetisation of gaming, including through its “network”. It’s also shedding assets such as its batteries business, as well as slimming down its phone business. Sometimes, subtracting rather than adding is a better strategy for innovative companies to capture the consumer’s attention. Innovations do not automatically create conditions for their adoption but the behaviour of the customer must be managed for it to succeed. Apple has led the way in this regard. Its product portfolio is very focused. An Apple store today probably has fewer Apple stock-keeping units (SKUs) or items than Samsung has phone and tablet models. Apple has also been at the forefront of simplifying the customer experience as shown again with its recent decision to remove the 3.5mm audio jack from its iPhone, a 138-year old technology that allows users to connect any type of wired headphones to their iPhone to listen to their music. The alternative will be the AirPods, wireless headphones that will connect seamlessly with the device. While this has led to conspiracy theories saying that a world without wires is actually an attempt by Apple to tether us closer to its technology and products, I would posit that the removal of the audio jack is also a lesson in making innovations succeed by changing the market, instead of trying to responding to it, as Sony tried to do. Apple has been at the forefront of removing old technologies to simplify its offerings before. It was the first computer maker to take out the compact disc (CD) drive from its MacBook computers, making the MacBook Air the thinnest laptop on the market, while Sony was trying to move into traditional laptops with the Vaio, which was later discontinued. Meanwhile, Apple stripped things down even further. Later it killed the 30-pin connector USB cable in favour of Lightning. At each stage it helped customers make the transition to its new technologies and managed the change, rather than responded to it, with adaptors and flashy new products they couldn’t resist. Human beings are naturally loss averse. When comfortable with a technology, they don’t like to give it up. But as we’ve seen before, Apple is good at changing behaviours because it knows how to simplify life. Yes, AirPods last longer and are easier to charge than other wireless headphones. But the bigger innovation is the simplification of the pairing with the phone. They connect automatically to the phone when they are out of the pouch and the phone recognises when you wear them in your ears to send the sound to right output. Still, this time could take a bit longer, especially if customers fear losing one of the AirPods. One big change in the strategy is that the customer won’t be getting these headphones for free with their new phones. They’ll get an adaptor to help them make the transition instead. This might make the transition a longer one, but it seems likely to happen in the end. Apple’s transition to wireless music started with its acquisition of Beats and its range of Bluetooth headsets, which make travel and running a breeze. The AirPods are a way to mainstream this technology and behaviour, increasing the useability and comfort of using Apple devices, especially when exercising. The company’s interest in health and wellness is well-known. The Apple Watch carries a heart-rate monitor as well as step and sleep tracking. It is highly likely that the AirPods plus the Apple Watch will become the only companions a jogger needs, leaving the phone for other functions, especially since the Apple Watch can hold a music library of its own as well as carry out GPS tracking in the new Apple Watch Nike + version. One could argue that Apple is trying to offset declining sales of its iPhone and the AirPods will prop up sales of its “other” category, which includes the Watch and iPod. Either way, the company is leading the way yet again – not with breakthrough technology, but with a solution that is user friendly and intuitive. It’s thus safe to assume that Apple’s customers are likely to get on board with it, especially those increasingly interested in health and wellness. Meanwhile, Sony is beginning to corner its market in games, but it will have to continue to look for ways to integrate many of its rich offerings to add customer value.

Local Flavor | Baked apple dish a family favorite Sheri Trusty, Correspondent 6:11 p.m. EDT November 3, 2016 Baked Apple French Toast makes an easy, make-ahead breakfast for everyday or holiday mornings. (Photo: Sheri Trust/Correspondent) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE OAK HARBOR - About 20 years ago, Candy Bensch tried Baked Apple French Toast at a ladies’ Advent brunch at St. John’s Lutheran Church in Rocky Ridge. She liked it so much, she requested the recipe and then made it for her own family. “My children fell in love with it, and it’s been in our church cookbook. We even served it at my son’s wedding brunch,” Bensch said. “Now when my children come back to visit I make it for them.” Because the dish is assembled the night before and refrigerated overnight, it has long been an easy Christmas morning tradition in the Bensch house. “We pop it in the oven in the morning,” Bensch said. Not only is the dish delicious and easy, it is also versatile. Bensch has made it with white, cinnamon and cinnamon raisin bread. When she was visiting her son in Chicago, a neighbor brought over croissants from his bakery. Bensch turned them into Baked Apple French Toast. “I used more of them than I do regular bread, because they are light and airy and soak up more. It was very good,” she said. The original recipe calls for 8 ounces of cream cheese, but Bensch said her family prefers it with just 3 ounces. She uses any kind of pie apple she has around, such as Macintosh, and sometimes she substitutes blueberries for the apples and uses cinnamon bread without raisins. “It’s like most recipes — you can do it the way you like,” she said. Bensch learned to cook from her frugal mother and grandmother, who made most things from scratch, and she often visited her grandmother on Saturdays, which was baking day for her. “She did all the baking for the week that day – all the cookies and all the bread,” Bensch said. “I was raised in a family that had lived through the Depression, so we canned everything. We canned peaches when they were ready and tomatoes when they were ready.” Bensch said her family wasn’t rich when she was growing up, at least not according to their bank statements. But when she grew up and had to do her own shopping, she learned just how rich they were. She was shocked the first time she bought commercially canned fruit, first by the high price and then by the inferior taste. “It was nothing when I was growing up to pull a can of peaches off the shelf to eat as a snack. I couldn’t do that when they cost $4 a can, and they didn’t taste as good,” she said. Now that her children are grown, Bensch doesn’t can much, but she inherited the family pickle recipe and began canning them when it became too difficult for her mom to do it anymore. “My family always looks for them on the Thanksgiving and Christmas tables,” she said.

So did his mother, Annie Apple, who has become very entertaining. When the Giants situation with Josh Brown unraveled, Annie spoke out against Giants owner John Mara, providing some heat on Twitter in his direction. Apple, herself a domestic violence survivor, said she didn't condone the decision to keep Brown on the roster. As a domestic violence survivor, reading these Mara comments makes me sad, angry and completely baffled. He just doesn't get it. This is sad— Annie Apple (@SurvivinAmerica) October 20, 2016 In a follow-up piece, Apple wrote for Sports Illustrated that even though her son plays for the Giants, when she flew to London, she wasn't able to root for the team because of how the situation impacted her. "I flew to London last Wednesday to watch a game that by Sunday no longer mattered to me. We went overseas to watch Black Eli back on the field as the Giants faced the Rams. But I never made it to Wembley," Annie Apple wrote. "At that moment I just couldn't cheer for a team I felt had turned its back on what was right to protect an image. It was difficult because I love my son and I've always been in his corner at every game, but for me, this was bigger than a game." She later added that she believed the Giants organization was "leaning heavily" on her son in order to have him restrict her public comments. "But I was livid with the Giants, not just because of John Mara's comments but I was disappointed in the organization because I felt they were leaning heavily on a 21-year-old kid in an effort to control what his mother says. That's not fair," Apple wrote. "Did I rob a liquor store in the middle of the night rocking a NY Giants Apple jersey? No. I merely shared my disappointment and sadness in the team's callous response to domestic violence because I am a survivor and it impacted me in a deep way." On Thursday, Eli was asked about the comments from his mother and called them "false." "She was a little bit upset and I didn't have a chance to really talk to her, and I guess throughout that whole thing that's just how she felt, but I never had a chance to talk to her or anything, so maybe that's just an assumption of hers that she just felt in her gut," Eli Apple said Thursday. "But it's definitely false. Nobody's leaning on me or anything telling me things to tell her. It's not like that at all. I think the Giants are a class organization, and I'm just happy to be here." Obviously the Giants don't want players' mothers talking about their issues on or off the field. It's not a good look when the mother of their first-round pick is blasting the team. But this would have been easily solved if the Giants simply did the right thing in the first place and never brought back Josh Brown after he admitted to domestic violence.

Adam Christianson’s Maccast TMO Daily Observations Twitter feed Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit 2 Comments Add a comment CudaBoy November 3, 2016 The current rumor I can’t confirn nor deny is the Apple version of the Bendy Phone which Samsung and especially Moxi Group have demonstrated. Wrap that Moxi right around your wrist. Now that Apple’s patent for carbon nano-tube technology has surfaced today with implications of a flexible screen my prediction is (check my record) not just a bendy phone but the wristband I let out of the bag with future flexi-retina strip-bar UI. November 3, 2016 at 5:18 EST PM BradMacPro November 3, 2016 I have to agree about the transitional nature of the new MacBook Pro models. I think the Touch Bar will be a standard feature across the board in the future. We have to wait a while for new upgrades of other Mac models to see where Apple sees the Mac interface morphing, to show clear differences with Windows 10, to move forward in general and to borrow a bit of iOS interface elements, to make the Mac more like the iPad and iPhone. Having a multi-touch trackpad without a display under it, separates the user experience. On the other hand, the MacOS is not optimized for a touch screen, unlike Windows which is. I’m sure someone will argue how well, but that’s another story. I think the timing was unfortunate. The very fast storage recently became available, just before Optane is available, and that brings up the price. Apple also went with top speed memory, which is unusual for them. That also brings up the price. The Touch Pad uses watchOS and other parts gleaned from a iPhone and Apple Watch, and this first generation’s costs have to be paid for. The price of these elements will drop, and the premium over the previous generation will be trimmed in the coming months. And of course, with iPhone and iPad sales disappointing, Apple sees the Mac, at about 11% of revenue, able to prop up their profit margins. I’m sure they figure the Mac buying public will grumble but buy them anyway. Apple surely won’t announce price drops in the future and kill present sales. At least now the MacBook Pro and the iMac line are both equipped with Skylake generation CPUs. The plus here is Apple has used Polaris 11 series GPU in the 15″ models, and that is a nice little step up, but considering as we must, the power limits of last years CPU and GPU, compared to the available this year’s, its really no surprise they went for this series chips. Kaby Lake won’t be much faster, maybe 10% but the battery life should jump up, so early next year, we could see Apple move back up to 12 hours instead of 10 now. The move to 4 Thunderbolt 3 ports that incorporate USB-C connections is entirely analogous to the original Thunderbolt 1 port that supersedes the Mini DisplayPort while keeping the same physical connector, which helps a bit, even while confusing people. Apple’s Intel chip they use to control the ports make it not compatible with some other Thunderbolt 3 devices made by others, so a bit more confusion will be out there. As usual, you have to look for compatibility. I find it frustrating that Apple talks about the wider color range on the displays, but they don’t say it’s P3 color gamut like the iMac now has. The new LG Ultrafine displays finally get the public Retina quality external monitors. No mention that they have onboard GPU, but the 5K monitor does use the Thunderbolt 3 connection to pass all that data. I certainly hope the GPU doesn’t overheat trying to drive it or two of them.

Strategy Analytics estimates that over the third quarter of 2016, Android handsets claimed precisely 87.5 per cent of all shipments, the highest market share ever for the Google-backed operating system. Apple was second, with iOS staking a 12.1 per cent cut of the market. All other platforms combined to account for the remaining 0.3 per cent. "Android's gain came at the expense of every major rival platform. Apple iOS lost ground to Android and dipped to 12 percent share worldwide in Q3 2016, due to a lackluster performance in China and Africa," said Strategy Analytics executive director Neil Mawston. "BlackBerry and Microsoft Windows Phone have all but disappeared due to strategic shifts, while Tizen and other emerging platforms softened as a result of limited product portfolios and modest developer support." The huge market share was the result of Android being the only smartphone OS to see its shipments grow over Q3 2016, ballooning from 298 million to 328.6 million – a 10.3 per cent gain. Apple, meanwhile, saw shipments of 45.5 million iPhones last quarter, down 5.5 per cent from 48 million last year. This, in turn, shrank the iOS market share from 13.6 to 12.1 per cent. Also losing ground was the "other" category, which comprises Tizen, Windows Phone, and the doomed brand of Blackberry. The category has been reduced to the right side of the decimal point, as it fell from 2.3 per cent in 2015 to 0.3 per cent this year. It's worth noting that the Strategy Analytics report tracked only the market share of the operating systems run by the 375 million smartphones shipped, not the companies making the hardware. While iOS as a platform may only account for 12 per cent of the market, Apple's total control of that platform means it's still the second-largest smartphone vendor in the world, trailing only Samsung (which shipped 75 million handsets last quarter), while other Android vendors lag behind Cupertino. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 30 Comments More from The Register Green shoot at Imation as Nexsan revenues revive Loss-making company continues to be, well, loss-making Dear Imation.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search iPhone 8’s “one more thing” may be a 3rd phone Eric Abent - Nov 3, 2016 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple is said to be planning something big for the release of iPhone 8, and one possibility is the addition of a third phone to the lineup. For a few years now, Apple has released two new iPhones each year (ignoring the one-off release of the iPhone SE), but that could change next year. In addition to the 4.7 and 5.5-inch models we’ve had since the iPhone 6, Apple may be looking to release a 5-inch iPhone 8. So says a report from Nikkei Asian Review, which spoke to an unnamed industry source close to the production of the iPhone 8. This source was actually speaking Nikkei about the possibility of the iPhone 8 having a glass back when it mentioned that there are three iPhone 8 models on deck for reveal. The glass backs are supposedly being made by Biel Crystal Manufactory and Lens Technology, both factories in China. To hear that Apple is plotting to release a 5-inch iPhone is a little strange. If anything, it seems like Apple would go the opposite direction, offering a 4-inch iPhone or at least something closer in size to the iPhone 5s. With a display size of 5-inches, that doesn’t make the size of this third iPhone 8 much different from the standard 4.7-inch model we currently have. In any case, the report that Apple will opt for a glass back on the iPhone 8 is also an interesting one. We haven’t seen a glass back on an iPhone since the days of the iPhone 4s. Since then, Apple has opted for a metal rear housing for the iPhone, leaving the more fragile glass back out of the equation. Next year will be the tenth anniversary of the launch of the original iPhone. As such, the rumors thus far has claimed that Apple will be pulling out all the stops in an effort to wow the iPhone faithful. Launching a third model might be one way to do that, but considering the iPhone 7 has only been around for a little over a month, it’ll be quite some time before we discover what Apple has up its sleeve.

Bring Touch ID to Mac Desktops Next? Make desktop Macs great again. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Nov 3, 2016 at 2:59PM The new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and Touch ID. Image source: Apple. It's no secret that Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) cares a lot more about its laptops than it does its desktops. The company consciously focuses its development efforts and innovation on MacBooks over iMacs, Mac Minis, or Mac Pros. New features and technologies almost always start in Apple's laptops, before often making their way to the desktop. For example, Apple introduced its desktop trackpad after adding more and more gestures to macOS as it focused on touch-based interactions. Considering the dominance of laptops in Apple's unit volumes, this is entirely expected and rational. Apple stopped breaking down its Mac units by category a few years ago starting in fiscal 2013. But up until fiscal 2012, it was pretty clear what category was driving sales: Laptop sales outnumbered desktop sales by 4-to-1 in Q4 2012. Data source: SEC filings. Fiscal quarters shown. Chart by author. This trend has likely continued in the years since. So yeah, Apple puts a lot more emphasis on MacBook innovation. With that in mind, how will Apple bring its new Touch Bar and Touch ID to desktop Macs? It won't be easy It goes without saying that if Apple wants to bring Touch Bar and Touch ID to desktops, it will need to integrate the OLED panel into its own keyboard accessories. A stand-alone bar without the keyboard would just be ridiculous and hard to use. But there are some technical considerations to acknowledge when adding a display. Apple can't just slap a display on an existing keyboard and call it a day. Since the Touch Bar is a display that dynamically changes based on context, it would be tricky to implement on a wireless keyboard because of potential latency issues associated with trying to transfer data wirelessly to the display. While the Touch Bar uses OLED technology, which is more power-efficient than LCDs since no backlight is required, displays still use quite a bit of energy. A wireless keyboard with a Touch Bar would need to be charged more frequently due to increased power consumption. Additionally, Apple is using a new custom-designed T1 chip to power the Touch Bar as well as to securely store Touch ID fingerprint data. That requires even more power. Adding an OLED display and the extra processing power would also jack up the price in a big way. The seemingly obvious solution here is to make a wired keyboard, which would address all of these challenges. But Apple has been touting a wireless future across its lineup for years, most prominently with the removal of the iPhone 7 headphone jack. Introducing a wired keyboard with Touch Bar and Touch ID could be perceived as a philosophical step backwards. Where there's a will there's a way Do you remember when Apple first introduced Touch ID in the iPhone 5s in 2013? It was an inevitable addition following Apple's 2012 acquisition of AuthenTec for its fingerprint sensor technology. Initially, there weren't many uses for Touch ID, but in the years since, users have grown accustomed to the added convenience and security. We arguably take for granted how easy it is to unlock our phones or pay for things now. Touch ID can't entirely replace alphanumeric passwords yet, but Apple has been trying to kill the password for years. The new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and Touch ID. Image source: Apple. More broadly, the tech industry has been pushing for a transition away from passwords as well. The Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance was created for precisely that purpose. FIDO helps develop technical specifications that are open and scalable with the goal of improving online security, and its member list is a who's who of technology, finance, and payments companies. Apple is not a member, and it's not clear why, since it would be an influential addition. Fast-forward, and imagine a future where all websites and apps adopt standardized protocols to login and pay using secure biometric fingerprint data, which was once only available in enterprise applications that were willing to pay for added security. This has yet to be done on a consumer level at scale, but it's clearly where we're headed. Nothing will ever be 100% secure, but the potential upside in convenience and security relative to the status quo is enormous. To get there, Touch ID must be available on both laptops and desktops. Eventually, Apple will need to figure out a way to bring Touch ID to desktop Macs, despite the technical challenges it needs to solve first. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

(Alyssa Schukar | AP Photo) Print Email James Kratch | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By James Kratch | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 03, 2016 at 3:33 PM, updated November 04, 2016 at 10:35 AM comments EAST RUTHERFORD — Rookie cornerback Eli Apple denied Thursday the Giants tried to pressure Annie Apple, his mother, through him, calling her assertion the team "leaned heavily" on him in the wake of her critical public comments in light of the Josh Brown domestic violence scandal "definitely false." Giants' CB Eli Apple covers Victor Cruz "She was a little bit upset, and I didn't really have a chance to talk to her. I guess throughout that whole thing, that's just how she felt," Apple said. "But I never had any chance to talk to her or anything. Maybe that's just an assumption of hers, that she just felt in her gut, but it's definitely false. "Nobody's leaning on me or anything, telling me things to tell her. It's not like that at all. I think the Giants are a classy organization. I'm just happy to be here." Annie Apple, who has a journalism background and writes a weekly column for SI.com, blasted co-owner John Mara and the team in a piece published Wednesday, seeming to accuse the team of trying to silence her after earlier comments ripping the team's handling of the Brown debacle through her son.  "I was livid with the Giants, not just because of John Mara's comments," she wrote, "but I was disappointed in the organization because I felt they were leaning heavily on a 21-year-old kid in an effort to control what his mother says. That's not fair." The Giants declined to comment on Apple's assertion through a team spokesman. Annie Apple did not respond to a message left by NJ Advance Media. Annie Apple's initial criticism was centered on an interview Mara did with WFAN on Oct. 20 when he revealed Brown, since cut by the team, had "admitted to us he's abused his wife in the past, but what I think is a little unclear is the extent of that." A domestic violence survivor, Annie Apple responded by detailing her painful past in an SI.com column on Oct. 23. She also ripped Mara for his comments. That column was published minutes before the Giants played the Rams in London. Annie Apple traveled to England for the game. But in her most recent column, she revealed she did not attend the game because she did not feel comfortable supporting the Giants at that time.  Eli Apple said he would tell his mother the Giants are not pressuring him. "That's my mom. I can't really try to come at her at all. She's going to check me, big time," he said, adding that, "I know how to talk to her a little bit. My mom and I have been going at it for a while, of course. I'm going to come correct, of course, as a child, and go from there." Apple spoke to team officials after Apple's initial criticism, and he said he spoke to them again Thursday. The team informed him of his mother's latest column, Apple said. Apple said he doesn't know if head coach Ben McAdoo will want to speak to him about the situation, but Apple is glad to speak with him if need be. "They understand," Apple said. "They've been supportive. ... But we're focused on the Eagles, and that's the main focus. So we can get past this and I'm going to try my best to be focused on the Eagles." What if? Giants-Eagles coaching intrigue Eli Apple is from Voorhees, N.J., and his parents still reside there. Given his hometown's proximity to Philadelphia, Giants-Eagles was always set to be a big game for him. But Apple said he does not know if Annie Apple will attend Sunday's home game at MetLife Stadium. Annie Apple's absence in London "definitely hurt a little bit," Eli Apple said. It was a sign to him she was very upset about the situation. "It might have been the first game (she's missed) since high school, probably." Annie Apple's comments have undoubtedly pulled Eli Apple into an awkward middle position, and he said he is not sure how aware she is of that. "Honestly, I don't really know how understanding she is," he said. "She's just doing her thing right now. I don't really know. I can't really speak on that one." But when she became a celebrity after he was drafted by the Giants, landing media gigs with ESPN and SI.com, Apple knew something like this could happen. And it has. But Apple says he's OK with that.  "I knew there were going to be some things that come with it, because I knew how she is," he said. "She loves to be vocal on certain things. She has a big voice and she definitely gets out to a lot of people. I just expected things like this a little bit. It's all good."

November 3 AAPL: 109.83 -1.19 Review: Pad & Quill Valet Luxury Bag for MacBook Pro Jordan Kahn - 2 weeks ago @JordanKahn Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit With Apple announcing new MacBook Pros last week, Pad & Quill’s latest bag for MacBooks arriving at my office was perfect timing. The company makes three sizes of the Valet Luxury Laptop Bag, one that fits 11- to 13-inch MacBook Air & Pro models, one for 15-inch models, and one that offers a custom fit for Apple’s smallest notebook, the 12-inch MacBook. The bags will fit Apple’s newest MacBook Pro models as well as older models of the same size. I reviewed the 15-inch version. The front closes with a strap made of the same full-grain leather as the rest of the bag that runs under another to keep the top flap closed and secure, both of which are attached to the bag with hand-pounded copper rivets. The idea is that it makes for quick access without any zippers or buttons, and it does. Even with no zipper or button, the strap holds secure enough that the weight of my 4.5-pound MacBook Pro (original 2012 Retina model) didn’t push it open if I held it upside down. Personally I appreciated the quick access when traveling recently and having to remove my MacBook for airport security checks. The 15-inch Valet Luxury Bag I was sent fits the old Retina MacBook Pro very snuggly, so the new MacBook Pro 15-inch, which shaves off half an inch from the width of the old design, should sit quite comfortably in the bag’s main opening. It will alternatively accommodate an iPad up to the largest 12.9-inch iPad (the 12-inch version up to 9.7-inch). Also included is a secondary pocket in front that offers room for an iPad (9.7-inch or smaller) or your MacBook’s cables, adapters, or other accessories. A third pocket will fit an iPhone, spare battery or similarly sized products, and two pockets next to it to hold pens, an Apple Pencil, or stylus. The back of the bag includes a thick and sturdy carrying strap made of the same full-grain leather as the rest of the bag: The bag didn’t disappoint when it came to living up to the usual Pad & Quill craftsmanship. The company uses incredibly soft to the touch full-grain leather that has a distinct matte black look, parachute-grade nylon stitching, and the hand-pounded copper rivets mentioned above. It’s confident enough in the durability to give all bags a 25-Year warranty. The images throughout were taken after a few weeks of regular use and a couple flights.  The fit and finish definitely feel worth the price tag with many comparable high-end leather brands often charging a premium over Pad & Quill’s prices… All models are available from Pad & Quill’s website: $169 for the 15-inch version, and $139 for the 11- to 13-inch and the 12-inch versions. It also comes in a few other color options including dark chocolate and chestnut in addition to the galloper black color I reviewed. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

So says the son of Annie Apple. “Maybe that’s just an assumption of hers, that she just felt in her gut, but it’s definitely false,’’ Eli Apple said Thursday after practice. Eli Apple admits this is awkward, him playing for the Giants and his mother attacking his employer and accusing the team of pressuring her son to control what she says and writes. “Yeah, because like that’s my mom, so I can’t really try to come at her at all, she’s going to check me big-time,’’ Eli Apple said. “Oh man, honestly I don’t really know how understanding she is. She’s doing her thing right now.’’ Annie Apple is disgusted with the Giants and co-owner John Mara for their response to Josh Brown’s domestic violence issues, She traveled to London for the game against the Rams but could not bring herself to attend the game. “At that moment I just couldn’t cheer for a team I felt had turned its back on what was right to protect an image,” Apple wrote on SI.com. “It was difficult because I love my son and I’ve always been in his corner at every game, but for me, this was bigger than a game.’’ Eli Apple said “It definitely hurt a little bit’’ that his mother did not attend the game. He has no idea if she will show up Sunday at MetLife Stadium for the showdown against the Eagles. Asked if he knew the last time his mother did not attend a game he was playing in, Eli Apple said, “It might be the first game since high school, probably.’’ After Eli Apple was taken in the first round of the NFL draft, Annie Apple was hired by ESPN and also by SI.com to share her opinions and commentary. She wrote a compelling piece about being the victim of domestic violence and lambasted the Giants for keeping Brown on the roster and for Mara saying the team knew about Brown’s history of domestic abuse against his wife, but did not know the extent of the abuse. Her latest salvo stated she was “livid’’ at the Giants because “I felt they were leaning heavily on a 21-year-old kid in an effort to control what his mother says.” SEE ALSO 'Livid' Annie Apple blasts Giants: They wanted Eli 'to control me' :0 Eli Apple is in the midst of a fine rookie... 'Livid' Annie Apple blasts Giants: They wanted Eli 'to control me' Eli Apple, thrust into the middle of this mess, said it simply is not true he has been pressured by the Giants to keep his mother quiet. “She was a little bit upset, and I didn’t really have a chance to talk to her,’’ he said. “I guess throughout that whole thing, that’s just how she felt. “Nobody’s leaning on me or anything, telling me things to tell her. It’s not like that at all. I think the Giants are a classy organization. I’m just happy to be here.” The Giants have had to sidestep plenty of distractions this season and Apple talking about comments his mother made days before a key game against the Eagles is not ideal. “It’s definitely a weird position, of course,’’ he said. “You want to just focus on football and have football be your main focus. Sometimes when things like this come up it definitely makes it a little bit hard, because you’re thinking about it a little bit. Just got to move on from it, talk to her a little bit and just try to speak your mind a little bit and move forward.’’ Talking to his mother is not as simple as it seems, Eli Apple said. “Well, when she was going through her little thing with the whole situation I didn’t have a chance to really talk to her, so she was kinda going off just her feelings and things like that,’’ he said. “I never had a direct conversation about what’s going on.’’ Knowing his mother’s proclivity on social media and for speaking her mind, Apple said a firestorm or two was not unexpected. “I knew there was going to be some things that come in it because I know how she is,’’ he said. “She loves to be vocal on certain things and she has a big voice and she definitely gets out to a lot of people. I just expected things like this a little bit.

But an iPhone that folds in half? Now you’re talking. Apple has just received a patent for exactly that. The actual title is “electronic devices with carbon nanotube printed circuits,” but that image at the top makes it pretty clear what Apple thinks those carbon nanotube PCBs might enable them to build. And yes, it does look an awful lot like the Microsoft Courier concept that you never had a chance to buy. It also looks like a scaled-down version of the recently-released Lenovo Yoga Book, which you can actually buy right now. Lenovo’s slick dual-touchscreen Yoga Book Based on the language in the patent, it doesn’t sound like Apple is specifically talking about a device that has a fully bendable display. It mentions one that can bend “along edges of touch sensors or displays.” The carbon nanotube PCBs provide flexibility for some of the phone’s internals, but not all of them. Those other parts will likely be covered by other patents if Apple is genuinely working on a seamless foldable device. The usual caveats apply here. For now, this is simply yet another patent padding Apple’s already massive portfolio. Could they be planning to release an iPhone that folds in half? Definitely. Will it be the iPhone 8, like Newsweek asks? That depends on whether or not carbon nanotube PCBs and reliable, flexible displays are a real, mass-produced thing in just two more releases. Right now it doesn’t seem like a strong possibility, especially not from a company that many believe is playing it safe right now.   Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin Pinterest Reddit Apple iphone patents Smartphones Speak Your Mind More in Tech 11.14.2016 :: 2:15PM EST :: Lee Mathews Tech Take A Peek Inside a Robot Pizza Factory Tech 11.14.2016 :: 12:00PM EST :: Ryan Whitwam Tech Apple May Be Planning a Bigger iPhone 8 Tech 11.12.2016 :: 11:32AM EST :: Lee Mathews Tech Facebook Apologizes For Killing Everyone Tech 11.11.2016 :: 3:00PM EST :: Ryan Whitwam Tech iFixit Tears down the PlayStation 4 pro, Deems It Highly Repairable Tech 11.11.2016 :: 11:15AM EST :: Lee Mathews Tech An Electric Vespa Is Finally In The Works Tech More subscribe to our newsletter: Subscribing to a newsletter indicates your consent to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

David Grissam Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email This is part of CNET’s “Tech Enabled” series about the role technology plays in helping the disability community. David Grissam was worried he’d have to quit his job. Grissam had steadily been losing his hearing, which was a serious problem for the 911 dispatcher based in Norman, Oklahoma. It had gotten to the point where normal hearing aids didn’t work anymore. But then Grissam — who has been deaf since the age of six — got the Cochlear Baha 5 Sound Processor, a hearing device that’s implanted in his skull. Connecting the Baha to his iPhone via Bluetooth lets the 44-year-old stream emergency calls directly to his ears, cutting out background noise and giving him crystal-clear sound. “With me missing the audio coming in, I was really concerned I was going to miss one of my friends screaming for help because he was shot,” Grissam said. But now, “I’m able to hear more than others in the room because of that direct link.” The Baha is one of a crop of hearing devices that follow Apple’s “Made for iPhone” program, which employ Bluetooth and a special protocol technology from Apple to better connect to iPhones and iPads. That lets users stream audio directly to their ears, much as you would with regular wireless Bluetooth headphones such as Apple’s AirPods. Users pair one of 44 compatible, audiologist-issued hearing aids with their iPhones, allowing them to take phone calls or listen to apps like YouTube or Pandora. For people like Grissam, these hearing aids are the difference between adequately doing a job and not Grissam certainly isn’t alone. More than 360 million people, or about 5 percent of the world’s population, have disabling hearing loss, according to the World Health Organization. In the US alone, one in six Americans experience hearing issues, but about 80 percent do nothing about it, according to hearing aid maker Starkey. As the US baby boomer population ages, hearing loss will become an even bigger issue in the country. The Made for iPhone-compatible hearing aids cut out the need for intermediary devices called streamers that connect hearing aids to phones. And it makes the use of hearing aids less obvious, helping remove the social stigma associated with them. “When people think about hearing technology, they don’t think about small and stylish and wireless and superhigh quality audio,” said Chris McCormick, Starkey’s marketing chief. “When they hear about this tech, they say, ‘I wish I’d done this five years ago.’” Crystal clear Apple’s push into making its devices more accessible to the hearing impaired began with 2013’s launch of iOS 7, which also introduced the Made for iPhone hearing aid program. They started working with 2011’s iPhone 4S, 2012’s fourth-generation iPad and 2013’s fifth-generation iPod. Users can also control their hearing aids through an Apple Watch connected to an iPhone. It’s part of a broader initiative by Apple, which kicked off last week’s MacBook Pro event with a video on accessibility and the launch of a new site dedicated to the issue. Apple’s Made for iPhone technology lets people control hearing aids through an iOS device. Apple “When we created the Made for iPhone hearing aid program, the key question was ‘how do we improve the ability for someone with hearing loss to use an iOS device to do all the things everyone else does, from making phone calls to FaceTime to listening to music and watching movies?’” said Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s senior manager for global accessibility policy and initiatives. For now, audio streaming to hearing aids is something that works only with iPhones. Android device users can get alerts to their hearing aids or adjust the volume via their phones, but they can’t stream sound directly to their ears. Google wouldn’t say when its version would be available. “It is important for Google products to be universally accessible and useful, and we are working closely with our partners to add hearing aid support,” the company said in a statement. A smarter hearing aid Along with streaming sound from an iOS device, users can track the battery life of a hearing aid on an iPhone. They can adjust settings and volume through the iPhone instead of tapping the hearing aid, making the process more discreet. Audiologists help program presets for different sound situations, like restaurants and concerts, and users can switch to the appropriate setting with a triple click on the iPhone home button. Geotagging automatically switches settings based on where the hearing aid users are. If someone walks into Starbucks, for instance, it will turn on the restaurant or coffee shop setting. There’s also a “find my hearing aid” feature on the phone. Another capability of Made for iPhone hearing aids is Live Listen. This lets the iPhone act like a remote microphone so they can hear people on the other side of a crowded room or conference table — wherever they place the iPhone. Some hearing aid companies like Starkey enable the microphone feature to record conversations. Win Whittaker, a 50-year-old mountain guide at Mt. Rainier National Park in Washington, got used to not hearing the students in his climbing school. They’d gather around him for important safety instructions, but he had trouble understanding what they asked him. “The questions were starting to get lost,” he said. Win Whittaker uses Made for iPhone hearing aids in his work as a mountain guide. Win Whittaker Whittaker knew years of playing in a band had damaged his hearing, but he resisted getting hearing aids. The closest audiologist was a 90-minute drive away, and as a musician, he was picky about audio. Then he heard about Made for iPhone hearing aids. The next day, he called an audiologist for an appointment and got fitted for ReSound LiNX2 hearing aids. “They’re not just hearing aids,” Whittaker said. “I was like, ‘Wow, this is cool.’ If that had not come out...I definitely would have held off [on getting hearing aids].” When he’s on a climb, Whittaker uses his Apple Watch to adjust his hearing aids to dampen the sound of wind while still hearing his client struggling 25 feet behind him. “I guide on Mt. Rainier, so I’m at 13,000 feet, dealing with 30 to 40 mph winds,” he said. “That program is a life saver.” Just like everyone else The hearing aids aren’t perfect. Batteries drain quicker on Made for iPhone hearing aids than other models. Users can get frustrated when they want to do more tweaking of their hearing aids beyond what audiologists let them do, said Dr. Chelsea Jividen, an audiologist at the Callier Center for Communication Disorders at the University of Texas at Dallas. “They want to be able to adjust the things we’re adjusting, which we’ve went through extensive training to [learn],” she said. Hearing aids typically aren’t covered by insurance in the U.S., and cost $1,200 to $3,000 per ear. The Made for iPhone hearing aids typically land near the top of that price range because of the Bluetooth chip, Jividen said. Bluetooth chips also limit how small hearing aids can be. Starkey’s smallest hearing aid line, for instance, can’t fit the bigger processors. But with Bluetooth chips shrinking, the company plans a smaller version in January. The industry expects all hearing aids will eventually connect to mobile devices. Daymond John, an investor on the show “Shark Tank,” wears Made for iPhone hearing aids. Daymond John “That will happen for sure,” said Mats Dotevall, Cochlear’s director of design and development. Bluetooth-connected hearing aids also can be too complicated for the elderly. People in their 70s and 80s are much less likely to have smartphones than younger hearing aid users. Just learning how to use a hearing aid can be complicated enough. But for anyone who has felt a stigma for having hearing aids, Made for iPhone takes that worry away. Daymond John, the 47-year-old co-founder of the FUBU clothing line and a judge on ABC’s “Shark Tank” is one of those people. He realized about five years ago that he had hearing loss from a lifetime spent at loud concerts. John uses the Starkey Halo 2 hearing aids, especially at night when he wants to listen to music when falling asleep without bothering his fiancee or daughter. “I use them when I’m home all the time, because I have a 7-month-old,” John said. “The last thing I want to do is wake her.” John also uses the hearing aid recording feature to document meetings. In busy restaurants, he can focus on the person he’s talking to and cut out the background noise. One time he doesn’t wear the hearing aids is at work filming his show. “I don’t wear them on purpose,” John said. “I’m sitting in between [Mark] Cuban and Kevin O’Leary...The last thing I want to do is enhance those other sharks I’m sitting next to.” This article originally appeared on CNET.com.  © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The best MacBook Pro alternatives now that Apple ruined everything Chris Mills BGR NewsNovember 3, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share The new MacBooks that Apple announced leave a lot to be desired for the supposed "Pro." There's no SD card slot, no discrete graphics, and a dongle-fuelled hell if you want to connect to an external screen. But hard as this might be to believe, companies not named Apple do make computers, and some of them are even good. Here's the best alternatives to this year's MacBook Pro. All of them have real USB ports. DON'T MISS: iPhone 7 vs. Google Pixel: The ultimate comparison We're talking about replacements for the 13-inch MacBook Pro here. 15-inch laptops are more of a niche market, and since you're already handing off most of the portability, you've got far more choice in Windows laptops for systems with massive graphics cards, multiple hard drives or even (gasp!) an optical drive. So what we're focusing on is laptops that fit serious power -- enough for gaming, video editing, photographer or hardcore Powerpoint users -- into a format that's still thin and light enough to carry around. Good battery life and a respectable physical design are also necessities. With all that said, let's dive into the list. surface-bookMore Surface Book The most obvious competitor to the MacBook Pro is Microsoft's flagship laptop, the Surface Book. In many respects, they're similar: your choice of Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, plenty of RAM, all-day battery life, head-turning metallic design and some kind of gimmicky touch input. The Surface Book is technically a convertible rather than a laptop, however, since the screen can detach from the base and work as a standalone tablet. In my experience using a Surface Book as my daily computer, it's more of a gimmick than an actual feature. The battery life is minutes or hours using the tablet, and no-one really wants to one-handedly wield a 13-inch tablet anyway. But it's as a performance laptop that the Surface Book really shines. If you go for one of the more expensive models with the Performance Base, you get a discrete graphics card that really shines for mid-range gaming and Photoshop. The port selection is just good enough, with two USB ports, an SD card, and a Mini DisplayPort in the base. There's even a MagSafe knockoff that I happen to prefer to Apple's version. Sure, the Surface Book is a little heavier than Apple's new MacBook Pro, but you do get a touchscreen, a keyboard with a little more travel and much more processing power for that. As a machine to take everywhere with you that can handle 99 percent of your computing needs, it's much more qualified than the Pro. dell-xps-13More Dell XPS 13 If you want to go a little thinner and a lot cheaper than the new Pro, Dell's XPS 13 is king. For $1,300, you can get a laptop that's lighter than the Pro, but with a Core i7 instead of Core i5, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It's also got a great selection of ports, with two USB-A, one USB-C port, and an SD card reader. So for less money than the Pro, you get a smaller and lighter computer with just about equal performance and a lot more usable ports. For a little more money, you can upgrade the 1080p panel to a QHD touchscreen, but at the cost of more weight and less battery life. If you're mostly concerned about portability, battery life and price, this laptop is a strong contender. It's also worth mentioning that Dell sells a battery pack for the XPS 13 with USB ports and the option to charge your laptop on the fly. If you already carry around a battery pack for your phone, it gives you the option to stretch your laptop's battery life to a genuine 16 hours. That's a long time away from a wall socket. Read More rzrblade12_02More Razer Blade Stealth Razer is a company best known for its gaming laptops, but its more recent machines look exactly like a blacked-out MacBook Pro. The new Razer Blade Stealth is a 13-inch laptop that comes in at a half-inch thick and a shade under three pounds. The version I'd buy costs $1,250, and comes with a QHD display, 256GB SSD, 16GB of RAM and a Core i7 processor. Those specs blow the cheapest MacBook Pro -- which costs $250 more! -- out of the water. Oh, and did I mention, you also get two USB 3 ports, one Thunderbolt 3 and an HDMI out? With the extra money that you're not spending on a MacBook Pro, you can invest in Razer's headline feature, the Razer Core. It's an external docking station that can house a desktop-quality graphics card. The idea is you hook up your laptop to the Core, it uses desktop graphics (which are an order of magnitude better than anything you can fit in a thin laptop) to power the big monitor you have plugged into your graphics card. It's a smooth system, and if you shuffle between travel and a fixed desk, it's a pretty killer option. Old MacBook Pro Look, I'm not telling you what to do. But the slightly older MacBook Pro can be had for $200 under list price on eBay right now, and it has an HDMI port, an SD card, and regular USB ports. The processor, SSD and RAM are very close in performance to Apple's newer laptops, and they're barely any thicker. Courage isn't for everyone.

DreamHost.com Domains Web Hosting WordPress Hosting Cloud Hosting Twitter Facebook Instagram Google+ RSS Feed DreamHost.com Domains Web Hosting WordPress Hosting Cloud Hosting Tutorials How to Vertically Integrate Yourself (and Why You Should) November 3, 2016 Written by Guest Author Are you a professional with an incredibly diversified skill set? (Or do you want to be?) Do you wish your boss or client would sidle up to you and say, “You know, I recognize that you are, quite simply, a unicorn. So here’s a cover-all job description. Go play on your strengths in any department you think could benefit from your magic!” Well, here’s a tip for all you aspiring unicorns: vertical integration. Learning to vertically integrate yourself means that you’ll strategically stack your skills in order to design the most lucrative and fulfilling career path you could possibly have. What is Vertical Integration? Vertical integration is what happens when an entity owns or functions at every level of the supply chain. Ikea, Apple, and ExxonMobil are powerful, large-scale examples of vertical integration. Apple designs, develops, manufactures, and distributes its own device software and hardware. Ikea designs, manufactures, and distributes its own furniture. Exxon sources, refines, and sells its own energy products. Note: Don’t confuse vertical with horizontal integration. Horizontal integration basically means buying out or merging with competitors. What Does That Mean for Individuals? To be vertically integrated as an individual means that you become an intellectual supply chain for yourself. Identify your signature intellectual product—Books? Design?—and figure out what your intellectual supply chain looks like. For example: Self-published authors like this guy write, edit, and promote their own eBooks. YouTubers like this woman write, film, and edit their own vlogs. Full-stack designer/developers like this guy host, design, buildout, and optimize websites. In each of these examples, the verbs (Write! Edit! Promote!) are the components of the intellectual supply chain. Each of these content creators combines and focuses their skillsets to produce a finished, deeply considered product that they themselves handled from conception through execution. Not a content creator? That’s okay! You can fall anywhere on that intellectual supply chain, so long as you know what you want your final intellectual property (or IP) to be. (Hint: to find your ideal IP, ask yourself a simple question: what am I best at?) Developers have built out enough comps to know the basic aesthetic flow of a good website. In fact, you’ve likely dabbled in them from time to time. Photographers or Editors: you don’t have to star in your own video for it to remain your finished product. Marketers: You’ve probably created and collected enough public-facing content to write a book on the stuff! Go find it and extract an outline from it. Once you identify your IP, then it’s time to discern what direction you’re integrating in. Companies can integrate forward or backward. Forward integration refers to a place in the supply chain that precedes the final product. For example, Microsoft launched the Surface line of products a few years ago, and is now forward integrating, meaning Windows and the flagship personal devices are now operating in much the same way Apple is. Backward integration refers to adopting a supply chain component that precedes the consumer-facing end product. If your favorite restaurant, after years of success, starting running its own farm to supply food for all of its menu items, that would be an example of backward integration. When a digital copywriter creates her own IP, she has integrated forward from a step in the advertising supply chain to a finished product. When a graphic designer learns to code and begins hand coding comps for his own tumblr-esque blog platform, he has integrated backward. Okay, I’m Inspired. But How Do I Begin? If you feel like your current job undervalues your unicorn status, or constrains your workflow in such a way that you’re always yearning to pitch in across the hall, then perhaps it’s time to vertically integrate yourself by creating your own intellectual supply chain. Here are a couple of deceptively simple approaches: Keep a Journal: Every time you think something along the lines of, “Copywriting is cool, but I wish I could go play with the design computer and whip up a Photoshop comp,” or otherwise fantasize about temporarily assuming some other role, jot it down. Eventually, your journal will help you to spot trends in your yearning. (This is especially useful since not every career fantasy should necessarily be pursued. We’ve all had that moment where we thought, “I could definitely make it on Broadway with zero training.”) Hold Stand-Up Meetings with Yourself: If you’ve worked in an Agile Project Management environment before, you know about stand-up meetings. If not, our guide will help. When you can personify each of the diverse skills in your set as a virtual “team member,” you’ll start to notice your weakness and strengths in a big way. Find your mentors: Look for some notable vertically-integrated people in addition to those mentioned above. Based on the analogy I used, what makes them vertically integrated? If not, what would make them vertically integrated? Can you guess what their intellectual supply chain is? Where are the gaps in it? Then turn the questions on yourself: Can you identify what finished products you contribute to at work or in contracts? What gaps are in your intellectual supply chain? Maybe you see how your career is plateauing at your current company, despite the dozens of hats you wear daily that should make you indispensable. Maybe you’re trying to transition into tech but feel like everyone will reject you because of your prior experience in other industries. Maybe you’re haunted by a hundred and one other doubts. Giving vertical integration a shot—becoming your own supply chain—is a bold move, but an exciting way to become both a jack of all trades and a master of one.

For the iPhone 7, Apple ditched one cable you used to plug into your phone by eliminating the headphone jack. But according to the latest rumor overseas, Apple could soon get rid of iPhone cables altogether — by introducing wireless charging. Wireless charging is basically the unicorn of iPhone rumors, bubbling up just about every year but never actually coming to fruition. While the iPhone currently still gets charged via its Lightning connector, other phones, including the Samsung Galaxy S7, already have wireless charging built in. But next year's iPhone may finally, truly get wireless charging. Or, at the least, the Nikkei Asian Review says that Foxconn is testing out wireless charging modules for Apple. Whether they're actually included in the upcoming handset depends on how production goes. Apple needs a high, cost-effective yield rate (the number of units that pass inspection after being produced) to consider including it in their handsets. Still, if the next iPhone (or the one after it) does include wireless charging, your iPhone would most likely still have its Lightning port. Sometimes you do still need it to plug into your computer — like if you want to back up your phone to iTunes; plus, if you don't want to wear wireless headphones, you can still plug your earbuds into this port. But it could mean you don't need to carry an iPhone charging cable in your purse anymore — and that would be excellent.

While Apple's offerings are true laptops with a few mobile-inspired perks, Microsoft bills the Surface Pro 4 as a tablet that can replace your laptop. For the purpose of this comparison, we're focusing on the two current 13-inch MacBook Pros and the varying configurations of the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. The Surface Pro is sold as a tablet, but it gains much of its laptop-esque functionality from the add-on (but essential) Type Cover, a detachable keyboard and trackpad extension that's sold separately. Size Apple's laptops are relatively thin for their size. Meanwhile, the Surface Pro 4 (sans keyboard) is one capacious and hefty tablet – at least compared to mobile-only tablets like the iPad. Keep in mind that the Surface's keyboard adds some extra total depth (not factored into this measurement) when it's folded shut over the screen. Weight The 13-inch MacBook Pros weigh 1.37 kilograms, or about 3 pounds. The Surface Pro's weight depends on what configuration you're using. The lightest tablet plus keyboard combination possible is 1.06 kilograms. If you upgrade to an i5 or i7 processor (see below) the set-up will weigh 20 grams more. That would still be about 25-percent lighter than a MacBook Pro. Build MacBooks are still rocking their characteristic aluminum unibody. Microsoft uses a magnesium alloy for the Surface Pro build. The Type Cover is made from a soft, fabric-like material. Colors MacBook Pros are available in two neutral metallic tones. The Surface Pro tablet is only available in silver, but the Type Cover is available in black, blue, bright blue, red or teal. Display size The MacBook Pro display is an inch larger across the diagonal. That gives it an 11-percent area advantage over the Surface Pro 4. Display resolution The Surface Pro's pixels are 16-percent more dense, which may be especially noticeable when viewing it closely in tablet mode. Still, there is more to display quality than resolution alone, and we don't have any complaints about the new MacBook Pros. Touchscreen Apple has reiterated that there are no intentions of creating a touchscreen MacBook, but Microsoft isn't afraid to create machines with several input options. The Surface Pro 4 has a full-fledged touchscreen. Tablet mode No surprises here – the Surface Pro is a tablet first, and you don't need to buy the Type Cover to use it as such (though it wouldn't make for much of a product without its transforming 2-in-1 nature). Trackpad This year's MacBook Pros have huge glass solid-state trackpads. The trackpad doesn't actually move but instead has click-mimicking haptic feedback. It's also Force Touch-equipped, which means it differentiates between a light touch and a more forceful press. Apple has been playing up this pressure-sensitivity as a big efficiency measure, but we sometimes find it a little too touchy. You'll need a Type Cover to get trackpad functionality with the Surface Pro. The Type Cover has a traditional glass trackpad (similar to pre-Force Touch trackpads on the MacBook). Touch Bar 13-inch MacBook Pros are available with or without a Touch Bar. The Touch Bar replaces the row of Fn keys at the top of the keyboard with a dynamic app-specific shortcut bar that you can control with a fingertip. Stylus Every device in the Surface Pro line comes with a pressure-sensitive Surface Pen stylus for drawing, writing and mousing on-screen. Fingerprint sensor Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pros have built-in Touch ID. The versions with traditional Fn keys do not have a fingerprint sensor. There's no fingerprint sensor on the Surface Pro or on the base model Type Cover. For an additional US$30, however, you can spring for a Type Cover with integrated fingerprint sensor for additional security. Processor MacBook Pros have an Intel Core i5 (Skylark) processor. The Touch Bar version reaches higher speeds than the base model. The entry level Surface Pro has a relatively weak Intel Core m3 processor, but there are options to upgrade to the much better i5 or i7 chips instead. Microsoft hasn't published clock speeds. One bonus of going with the entry-level SP4 is that it's fanless and silent as the grave. Graphics These machines have integrated Intel GPUs. With the Surface Pro, each processor has a different pairing. All MacBook Pros have a generation-newer Intel GPU. Storage MacBook Pros are ready-built with either 256 or 512 GB. You can also special order 1 TB versions directly from Apple. Storage options for the Surface Pro vary depending on which processor you choose, but there are several options. The smallest 128 GB option is only available with the m3 processor; the 1 TB storage option is only possible with the top-shelf i7. USB ports MacBook Pro ports are exclusively Thunderbolt 3/USB-C. There are two on the base model and four on the Touch Bar variant. The Surface Pro has one full-size USB port. Either way, you'll probably need an adapter or two to meet your various needs. SD card reader The MacBook Pro does not have an SD card reader, an omission that's sparked the ire of some power users. The Surface Pro has a microSD slot. Charging port To charge a MacBook Pro, you'll occupy one of the aforementioned Thunderbolt ports. The Surface Pro has a separate, dedicated port that holds the charge cable in place magnetically. Headphone jack The good news: Both of these have a dedicated headphone jack. The bad news: iPhone 7 or 7 Plus owners won't have a place to plug in their Lightning-port headphones. Battery Microsoft hasn't published the Surface Pro's battery size(s), but battery life estimates indicate you'll get a little more time with the full-size MacBook Pro. Camera Neither of these devices are touted for their photography power, but the built-in cameras work for applications like video conferencing. MacBook Pros have one 720p webcam, but like most tablets, the Surface Pro has both a front and rear camera. Facial recognition login That front camera on the Surface recognizes your face for another layer of security. Software Both machines run full desktop software. MacBook Pros ship with MacOS Sierra and Surface Book has Windows 10 Pro. Release The non-Touch Bar versions of the MacBook are shipping now, while the Touch Bar models are available for pre-order and ship within 1-2 weeks. The Surface Pro 4 has been around for a year. Starting price The entry level MacBooks start at US$1,499; the Touch Bar models will set you back at least $1,799. Full retail price for the Surface Pro 4 starts at $899 for the tablet only, though it's fairly easy to find this year-old device at a discount. The Pro 4 Type Cover starts at $130. MacBook Pros are more expensive, but then again, they're a generation newer and are made of metal all around, including on the base. But depending on how you want to use it, it may make sense to cut costs – and size – and opt for the more adaptable Windows tablet. Operating system preferences will doubtlessly play into this decision, so it's wise to consider the differences between MacOS Sierra and Windows 10 as well. We will post a full-length review on a Touch Bar MacBook Pro in the near future, so stay tuned. So far, even the base model 2016 MacBook Pro looks and feels promising, and the Surface Pro 4 is an excellent choice for those who favor 2-in-1s – despite growing a little long in the tooth.

Before iOS 10, Smart Lock was just as compatible with Apple’s smart home framework as any other HomeKit-enabled device. It worked with Siri voice control, you could set up automation, and it worked with app control from third-party HomeKit apps. Then iOS 10 added a built-in Home app for managing and controlling HomeKit, and Control Center access for quickly interacting with scenes and accessories. August Smart Lock required a firmware update for these features to work due to chip certifications and Apple’s strict security approach. Home app support means you can lock or unlock August Smart Lock with a tap inside the main app for managing HomeKit, and Control Center access (when among first nine favorites) makes locking or unlocking the August Smart Lock as easy as swiping up from the Lock screen (and authenticating Touch ID). You can also receive alerts from the Home app when the August Smart Lock is engaged (although I’ve turned these off [Home → Lock tile → Details → Status and Notifications → Allow Notifications] considering how many times my lock is used in a day). August Smart Lock can also be controlled using the built-in Home app on watchOS 3 for Apple Watch following the latest firmware update. Updating to the new firmware update requires launching the August Home iOS app, then following the prompts to install the newly available update. (You may need to force quit and relaunch the August app to enable the prompt.) The update takes a few minute to complete two steps and makes no mention of improved HomeKit support. Instead it specifies that the update ‘will improve connection speed and motor operation.’ A separate firmware update is available for paired Smart Keypads, although it has no HomeKit connection. August’s other product, Doorbell Cam (reviewed), is still awaiting HomeKit compatibility through a future firmware update. Guides HomeKit HomeKit is Apple's home automation framework that lets you control connected accessories from your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and even Siri.

(Photo: Apple Inc. http://www.apple.com/pr/) 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Apple finally circled back to the Mac. Focused instead on top mobile products, like iPhone and iPad, Apple has given its computer line little attention in recent years. Aside from the 12-inch MacBook, which refreshed in April, Apple has mostly ignored the Mac. The MacRumors Buyer’s Guide, an invaluable tool for casual Apple followers in the market for a new machine, considers long upgrade cycles a reason to mark most Macs a “don’t buy.” The Mac Pro is the worst offender, having not seen an upgrade since 2013. This year Apple returned to the MacBook Pro, one of its core macOS products. Here’s how the new laptops shake out: MacBook Pro MacBook Pro has traditionally been a utilitarian device with enough specs and options to appeal to both casual prosumers and multimedia professionals. The new models are the thinnest and lightest MacBook Pros ever, which should appeal to users wanting a MacBook Air upgrade. There are both 13- and 15-inch models available. However, there are fewer ports. The laptop features a headphone port, but the usual array of USB, card reader and power ports has been cut. Now, either two or four Thunderbolt 3 ports are available. Apple sees the port consolidation as a helpful feature; one port can handle charging, data transfer and other functions. All I see in the short term is a future filled with dongles and adapters. Any potential purchase of a minimalist-port Mac machine will be prefaced with imagining how I’d connect my flash drives, SD cards and accessories without spending a fortune on compatible technology. The new MacBook Pro internals are sufficient for most users, though some professionals are complaining about the inability to stuff the laptop with more than 16GB RAM. Mainstream users shouldn’t have a problem doing what they want to do. Along with the choice of monitor size, users interested in the 13-inch model can choose between a laptop with traditional function keys or Apple’s new Touch Bar. Animated gif excerpt of Touch Bar functionality from Apple's MacBook design video. Touch Bar The idea that touch-enabled computer screens could change inputs, options and features for different applications helped Apple revolutionize input with the original iPhone. Apple hasn’t yet committed to a laptop with a full touch display. It is opting to position the iPad Pro as its touch-input flagship. It is dipping its toes into the touch-laptop water, however, with Touch Bar. Touch Bar is a touch-sensitive display strip that replaces the top row of function keys on the keyboard of compatible MacBook Pros. The display strip can can show buttons and features for opened apps, changing and updating when a new app is shown. For example, users can scroll through photos by flicking the Touch Bar in the Photos app or scrub a timeline of multimedia in a video editing app. While the ability to provide dynamic functionality is interesting and potentially useful, I’m not sure the Touch Bar will be a productivity boost for power users who already know their programs and shortcuts. ST. CLOUD TIMES Surface line now has a desktop Escalating prices Apple is selling two versions of the new MacBook Pro: one with a the Touch Bar and another without. The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar starts at $1,499, while one at the same size with an upgraded processor and Touch Bar costs $1,799. The 15-inch model is only available with a Touch Bar and starts at $2,399. MacBook Air has been reduced to a single model, with the 13-inch size left standing. It’s the only Mac laptop under $1,000. Apple isn’t the only company with an expensive flagship laptop. Microsoft’s original Surface Book starts at $1,499, while the Razer Blade laptop, which is admittedly geared more toward gamers, sports an entry level price of $1,799. Don’t be surprised if prices for laptops like this stay in the $1,500 range. Laptop/tablet hybrids are being positioned as the chosen solution in the $800-$1,000 space. The new MacBooks are available for pre-order now, with the Touch Bar versions shipping in four to five weeks. The non-Touch Bar 13-inch model is available now.

Kohl’s is reportedly going to start selling the Apple Watch in select stores starting later this month. The smartwatch will be stocked in the retailer’s activewear and wellness sections. Apple Watch is without a doubt one of the best selling smartwatches on the market. It might be partly due to the entire Apple ecosystem that millions of people rely on every single day, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that the Apple Watch is a great smartwatch. Fortune reports that Kohl’s will start selling the Apple Watch in 400 stores across the United States from November 15th. It won’t be launching the Apple Watch as an electronics partner, though, the wearable device will be stocked in its wellness and activewear sections.

The Apple Watch 2 comes at a time when the wearables market itself is booming, but smartwatches -- particularly from Apple -- are dwindling. This Apple Watch 2 review gives some insight into what this updated version could mean for total sales. Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Nov 3, 2016 at 1:58PM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) newest version of its original smartwatch is here. The Apple Watch Series 2 came available in September, followed by the Nike (NYSE:NKE)-branded edition, which shipped in late October. This upgrade from Apple's first smartwatch iteration has been met with anticipation about whether it would be enough to turn Apple's dwindling watch sales around. So let's review the Apple Watch Series 2 and consider how much it could really help Apple sales going forward.  Image source: Apple Apple Watch 2: a review After spending some time testing out the new Apple Watch Series 2, I'm impressed, even though it has only incremental changes from the first version. Two of the most important new features include the stand-alone GPS, which makes it possible to run without having to be tethered to a phone, as well as being waterproof enough for a swim or other water sports, including those in saltwater. Together, these make the watch a much better and more versatile fitness-tracking device than its older sibling. Other than fitness-specific upgrades, the watch's brighter screen, faster loading times, improved speaker, and longer battery life make the whole experience of using the watch better than the Series 1. Apple has made a few other big upgrades in the new operating software, watchOS, such as changing the use of the button below the digital crown to now bring up a dock of apps that users can scroll through, instead of just bringing up contacts, as in the earlier version. Siri also now has voice recognition, so that you can raise your wrist and say "Hey Siri" to begin commanding your watch without ever touching it.  But while the Apple Watch Series 2 has made some nice upgrades and has so far been receiving mostly solid reviews, it isn't much of an overhaul from the first series. Without some major new additions, such as a camera or stand-alone 3G allowing the watch to be used in place of a phone, Apple will be relying on sales from brand loyalists who are going to upgrade from a Series 1 watch, or else a base of consumers who didn't see the need for a Series 1 watch and will buy this version just based on these minor changes. Could this boost Apple watch sales? The broader wearables market that includes basic wearables -- names such as Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) and the like, which don't support third-party apps on their devices -- seems to be growing nicely. From Q2 2015 to Q2 2016, the most recent data that includes the entire market, grew to 22.5 million, up 26% from a year ago. Fitbit itself gained slightly to now hold over a 25% global market share again, compared with Apple, which controls just 7% of the broader wearables market and saw its share dwindle.   Company Global Wearables Market Share (by units sold, as of Q2 2016) Units-Sold Growth (Year Over Year) Fitbit 25% 28% Xiaomi 14% 2.5% Garmin 7% 106% Apple 7% (56%) Data sources: IDC While the broader wearables market is performing well, smartwatch sales have declined drastically. During Q3 2016, for which slightly more recent numbers are available for just the smartwatch segment of the wearables market, around 2.7 million units were shipped -- less than half the amount a year ago. Apple had the largest share of the smartwatch market, with about 41%, though that's down from 70% market share this time last year, and its estimated 1.1 million units sold is down 72%. These numbers don't include the full rollout of the Apple Watch Series 2, so Q4 and Q1 numbers from the IDC will be telling, in terms of how much this new version helps Apple regain a foothold in this market. Based on Fitbit's recent questionable Q4 forecast, there seems to be plenty of opportunity for Apple to grow.   The Nike+ version is the same watch technology, just with a different band and some featured Nike-branded watch faces. Image source: Apple. It's been a long time since any analysts seriously considered an Apple Watch to be the future of Apple sales and really move the needle up in a time when iPhone sales, which make up 60% of total sales, have been pressured. Apple doesn't give exact Apple Watch sales but instead lumps them into the "other products" category, which, along with the Apple TV, Beats products, the iPod, and Apple-branded/third-party accessories, together make up about 5% of total sales.  IDC predicts the wearable markets to finish at about 110 million in 2016, and nearly double that figure by 2019. The fact that non-smart wearables have done so well shows that fitness tracking is important to consumers of this trend, and with the new Apple Watch, with its GPS, water-resistant casing, and ratings as one of the most accurate heart-rate monitors, there's a good chance for Apple to gain on this market. Still, while this new Apple Watch is a nice upgrade over the first version and could very well improve Apple's standing in the wearables market, even a nice bump in sales isn't likely to move the needle for Apple's total sales anytime soon.

By Steve Ranger | November 3, 2016 -- 18:07 GMT (11:07 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Apple's Watch accounts for nearly half of the smartwatch market. Apple shipped 2.8 million of its Apple Watch wearables in the third quarter of this year, accounting for nearly half the total market for smartwatches. Analyst group Canalys calculated that total smartwatch shipments stood at 6.1 million for the quarter - an increase of 60 percent on last year. These new figures are a very different to those published by IDC last month which said that total smartwatch shipments for the third quart of 2016 only reached 2.7 million units - down 51.6 percent from the 5.6 million units shipped in the same quarter in 2015. In contrast IDC said Apple only managed to ship 1.1 million smartwatches in the quarter, a big drop from the 3.9 million shipped in the year-ago quarter. But Canalys said "despite reports to the contrary" Apple Watch shipments compared favourably to those in the third quarter of 2015, the first full quarter after the original Apple Watch's launch. However, it's not all good news for Apple: while the new models are selling well, there are still unsold first-generation Apple Watches in the channel, according to Canalys analyst Daniel Matte, and much will depend on how sales go in the fourth quarter. "Apple needs to make a strong marketing push during the holiday shopping season, especially to highlight new and compelling apps for its platform," he said. Apple's renewed focus on fitness functionality puts it in more direct competition with Fitbit, while the addition of GPS by Apple and other vendors now poses a big threat to traditional GPS watches and fitness trackers, the researchers said. But Canalys also warned that slowing iPhone momentum has affected consumer interest in Apple's smartwatch, and the company needs to boost sales of the device outside of the US, especially in China, where smartwatch sales grew 42 percent year on year. Image: Canalys The delays to Android Wear 2.0 and Samsung's Gear S3 have hit 2016 smartwatch shipments, and resulted in lower growth in smartwatch sales. Before the Apple Watch: A history of smartwatches,... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 21 NEXT PREV According to Canalys, Samsung shipped over 1.1 million smartwatches, and Fitbit was still the world's number three smartwatch vendor, shipping one million units. Garmin rose to fourth place, shipping 200,000 vívoactive smartwatches. Pebble rounded out the top five, shipping over 130,000 units. Shipments from Huawei, Lenovo and LG all fell, due to a lack of product refreshes, the analysts said. Canalys defines smartwatches as multi-purpose electronics that serve as accessories to smart devices, are designed to be worn on the body and not carried, run an operating system and are capable of running third-party computing applications. That's in contrast to what it defines as 'basic bands', which cannot run third-party computing applications. The researchers said the basic band market grew 18 percent to 11.5 million devices.

Send her to Cambridge Apple’s plan to make Siri sound more human? Send her to Cambridge by Chris Smith 03 November 2016 0 shares Read Comments Mastering natural speech appears to be the next great frontier for vocal personal assistants, so it’s little surprise Apple has reportedly sent Siri to the UK to brush up on her communication skills. BusinessInsider reports Apple has a secret office in Cambridge, where it is teaching Siri to ‘talk more naturally.’ The office apparently houses employees of the VocalIQ company Apple purchased back in October 2015 for an undisclosed fee. Rumours suggest Apple paid up to £80 million. Related: iOS 10 review The start-up's software was designed for this very purpose; to improve the vocal communication between human and computer intelligence. It’s unclear whether VocalIQ tech has already been integrated into Siri and Apple has not commented. A source told Business Insider: "It’s still unclear when Apple plans to implement more of VocalIQ’s capabilities into Siri. One source speculated that it may happen slowly over time, so as not to throw off users with a radical change. But it sounds like Apple is arming itself for a significant shift in how Siri works." Apple seems to be giving Siri more and more of a role as time goes on and it will be central to the firm’s smart home additions. Google, Amazon and Microsoft are all battling hard in this space so it’ll be interesting to see how Apple’s new Cambridge office rises to the challenge. Right now Apple is thought to be a little behind its rivals.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Walmart Black Friday 2016 IPad Mini 2 Deal Released Posted: Nov 3 2016, 10:01am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 3 2016, 12:10pm CDT, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links.   The iPad mini 2 is now $49 off in the early Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale. Walmart has launched the early Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale on November 1. Initially the retailer offered the Apple iPad mini 2 32GB Wi-Fi for $249.99, which is only $10 off the price this iPad sells from Apple directly. Now Walmart reduced the price to $219.99. With a price of $49 less than what Apple charges for the iPad mini 2, this is now a tempting deal. How To: Find Nintendo NES Classic In Stock The iPad mini is a favorite item for Walmart to offer as a deal. The past two years, Walmart offered the iPad mini at a low price. Now the iPad mini 2 is Walmart's choice.  The Apple iPad mini 2is still in the official iPad line-up that Apple is offering. With a 7.9" Retina display, A7 chip with M7 motion coprocessor, Front and Back cameras, the iPad mini 2 is still a valid choice. It is ideal for casual use and as second screen while watching TV. It is also great for young kids. Walmart offers the iPad mini 2 32GB in white and space gray online at walmart.com for $219.99. Walmart's habbit using the original sales price of the iPad mini 2 as reference for calculating the savings is confusing. Apple has reduced the price of the iPad mini 2, at the time of the launch of the iPad mini 4. Walmart's stated $95.63 savings are not real. It's $49 compared to the current regular price of the iPad mini 2. At this point it is hard to predict if Walmart is cutting the price of the iPad mini 2 further closer to Black Friday. We have to wait for the highly anticipated Walmart Black Friday 2016 ad to find out. As many other retailers are releasing their Black Friday 2016 ad this week, there is a chance that Walmart is also releasing their ad before the Presidential election. Our initial release date prediction is November 11, based on past years. Find the best Walmart Black Friday 2016 deals on sale today in our Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals list. The Kohl's Black Friday 2016 Ad has been officially released today and the JC Penney ad will be released tomorrow. The Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 ad has arrived earlier this week.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Android closes in on 90% market share Eric Abent - Nov 3, 2016 11 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit As the battle between iOS and Android rages on, we’re seeing Android pick up some market share in quarter three 2016. Strategy Analytics has published a new report for the quarter that shows Android making some gains while iOS loses a little ground. On top of that, the smartphone market as a whole showed some modest year-over-year growth. In Q3 2016, Strategy Analytics says that Android shipments grew 10.3% over the same quarter a year ago. That translates to 328.6 million devices shipped as compared to the year-ago quarter’s 298 million. That gives Android a record 87.5% market share for the quarter. Android’s success is compared to Apple’s 12.1% market share for the quarter, which is down from 13.6% a year ago. Total iOS shipments came to 45.5 million, which is again down from Q3 2015’s 48 million. So, not huge losses for Apple, but enough to give Android a boost that brings it dangerously close to 90% market share. It’s worth pointing out that Apple’s new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus launched in September, which was the final month of the quarter. That means we should see sales for Apple rise sequentially in Q4 2016, but Q3 also saw the introduction of Google’s new Pixel phones. While those may provide Android with another boost, Strategy Analytics warns that they may actually hurt Android’s market share in the long run. READ MORE: Google Pixel first impressions and hands-onThat’s because, as Strategy Analytics director Woody Oh points out, Android has managed to snatch up this much market share because of the sheer number of manufacturers using Google’s OS on their phones. By launching the Pixel, Google is placing itself in competition with hardware partners that helped make the platform a success in the first place. When you couple that with the fact that many Android device makers don’t pull in a ton of money, some of these manufacturers may decide to leave the OS for greener pastures. Still, even with concerns over the Pixel phones and an overcrowded market, Android finds itself in a good spot as we work our way deeper into Q4 2016. It’ll be interesting to see how these shares shift in this final quarter of 2016, which holds the largest shopping season of the year.

Follow TechnoBuffalo We published our Google Home review earlier this morning. It sounds awesome, but I can’t buy one. It’s not that I have anything against Google’s technology, it’s that I’m already invested in the Amazon Echo. I wonder how many households this will affect. I’ve talked about this at length in posts and on the TechnoBuffalo show, but the growing ecosystems offered by manufacturers, including Apple, Google, Amazon and others, is starting to make it incredibly difficult to stick with just one. You’re better off buying an Apple TV if you also own an iPhone, for example. And an Apple Watch and HomeKit-enabled devices. You’re also probably better off with an Android TV if you use Android. And Android Wear and, now, Google Home. If you’re like me, you have an empty wallet and an assortment of gadgets around the house that makes a Jackson Pollock painting look organized. I have an iPhone, an Apple TV, an Android TV, an Android smartphone, Philips Hue connected bulbs that talk with Apple HomeKit, three Amazon Echo units that work with the light bulbs.  Sometimes I think about switching from an Apple Watch to something else but then I remember I won’t be able to control my lights from my wrist. And I need my Apple TV plugged in since that serves as the smart hub for the lights throughout my house. What a waste of money. Enter the Google Home. I’m compelled to pick one up because I think Google has the capability to execute better than Alexa over the long run. Google has more data on me than Amazon — though I’m sure I’d be surprised how much the latter knows, given my shopping habits. The problem is, I’ve already invested in three Amazon Echo units and, in some ways, have picked the Apple ecosystem over Android (for whatever reason, I still buy all of my movies on Google Play.) My Echo devices work well enough, and I can’t think of a good reason to spend $390 on three Google Home units to replace what I already own. In other words, I’d have to think about switching ecosystems that I’ve already invested in. Google Home would make the most sense with Android TV and Chromecast, and down the line, if you also own an Android smartphone. When the next generation of Android Wear watches ship, my guess is they’ll have some sort of tie-in as well. We need to make ecosystem choices, whether we want to or not It’s not that I don’t use Android. I use it on a daily basis. But choosing just iOS or Android and investing in an entire ecosystem are totally different things. I can’t use both an Apple ecosystem and a Google ecosystem in my house at the same time. And since the Echo supports HomeKit devices, I’m going to stick with that for now. I fear my decision, though. Are my Amazon Echo units going to be useless in a few years if Google pulls ahead? Is Apple going to launch its own home device and make my choices even harder? The ecosystem starts with the phone. How many people have already started to invest beyond that, and what does this mean for the future of smart products like Google Home?

Fortune reports that the retailer will have the Apple Watch at 400 of its retail locations. That’s just a slice of its 1,100 locations across the country, but the report says that it’s better than Macy’s effort thus far. As of September, Macy’s started selling the Apple Watch at only 180 retail locations. Kohl’s has had a good relationship with Apple as it’s one of the company’s Apple Pay partners. In fact, Kohl’s was an early adopter for accepting Apple Pay at its stores and was the first retailer to make its store branded credit card available on Apple’s Wallet app. Tags: Apple Watch About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple has no idea what it’s doing in the TV space, and it’s embarassing Yoni Heisler BGR NewsNovember 3, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Aimless. Backwards. Confused. These are just a few adjectives which, to a frustrating extent, seem to perfectly encapsulate Apple's glaring lack of vision in the TV space. Apple certainly understands that TV (and by extension, the living room) is important, but the more I see what Apple is doing with the Apple TV, and the more I hear Apple executives excitedly drone on about their comically boring TV strategy, the more I become convinced that the company has absolutely no idea what it's doing. Broadly speaking, I don't believe that the higher-ups at Apple grasp, on an even basic level, what makes for a compelling TV viewing experience. And while the company, in my view, wasted its time exploring the feasibility of developing and manufacturing a car, it completely ignored the growing strategic importance of TV in the process. This oversight -- whether the cause be a lack of vision or a lack of execution -- is particularly ironic given that it was Apple's keen appreciation of the strategic importance of music in the early 2000s that led to the iPod, the iTunes Music Store and, in turn, Apple's ascension back to the top of the tech heap. These days, however, power and leverage within the TV space is quickly being usurped by players like Netflix while Apple remains embarrassingly stuck on the sidelines. DON'T MISS: We finally figured out why Google’s Pixel looks so much like an iPhone It's not about the interface Two weeks ago, Apple's iTunes head Eddy Cue sat down for a joint interview with HBO CEO Richard Plepler as part of Vanity Fair's New Establishment Summit in San Francisco. During the course of the interview, Cue made a point to critique the current state of TV by focusing on, of all things, TV interfaces. "I do think television needs to be reinvented. Cue said. "Today, you live with a glorified VCR and the problem is the interface. It’s really hard to use [a cable box or satellite TV]. Setting something to record, if you didn’t watch something last night, if you didn’t set it to record, it’s hard to find, it may not be available. There may be some rights issues." "It's great to be able to tell your device, 'I wanna watch the Duke basketball game, I don’t care what channel it’s on,'" Cue continued. "I just want to watch the Duke basketball game. Today you got to bring in the TV, go through the guide, find which sports programs or whatever — it’s just hard to do." If Apple thinks coming up with some sort of next-gen interface is the solution to our TV woes, it's sorely mistaken. For starters, cable interfaces have improved by leaps and bounds over the past few years. The idea that we're now living in a world where cable provides us with hundreds of channels that are impossible to sift through is embarrassingly outdated. While some cable providers have a ways to go, DirecTV and Comcast, as two quick examples, have solid user interfaces that make searching for content a breeze. Bolstered by show recommendations and solid on-demand options, the scenario Cue describes is plainly incongruent with the reality that most cable viewers live with. And yet, what did we witness last week at Apple's special media event? A whole lot of nothing. Just an app called TV that lets users browse through third-party apps from the likes of HBO, FX and others. Yawn. This is not the future of TV. apple-tv-appMore To this point, Joe Steel takes Apple to task for their underwhelming showing, which doesn't even include Netflix at this point: So what is TV the app? It’s a row of what you were watching, called Up Next, and then a series of recommendations based on the apps you have installed on your device. If that sounds familiar to you, it’s because you might have used an Amazon Fire TV in the last few months when Amazon rolled out the ability to see content from Netflix and HBO listed in recommendations. So Apple made the Fire TV home screen, as an app, except they couldn’t get Netflix onboard, while Amazon could. Read More And oh yes, Apple's single sign-on service where users can enter in their cable subscription credentials just once and receive "immediate access to all the apps in your pay TV package that support single sign-on" has been "Coming Soon" for months now. Apple hasn't released a TV streaming service Apple wants to get into the TV game, but it's still not quite sure how. For a while, it seemed that Apple was aiming to release a lightweight TV subscription service but those plans have reportedly been put on hold due to disputes over pricing and disagreements over what channels would be included in the bundle. Meanwhile, AT&T beat Apple to the punch, recently announcing an internet-only TV service that boasts more than 100 channels for just $35. Not to be outdone, Hulu earlier this week announced that its impending TV streaming service will include channels such as ABC, ESPN, the Disney Channel, Fox Sports, Fox News, National Geographic, FX, TNT, TBC, CNN the Cartoon Network and more. In today's world, content is king while interfaces, truth be told, simply need to be good enough. Apple's TV strategy is focused on the wrong end-game and the company is completely letting other competitors pass them by. Netflix's interface could stand to be a bit better, but it's a point you never hear anyone make because the content is absolutely stellar. All the while, Apple is seemingly taking its sweet, sweet time getting into the original content business. Sure, Apple has rolled out some exclusive content for Apple Music already, but all of those offerings have been decidedly music-oriented. Apple does have some content in the works, one of which is a reality show about -- wait for it -- the app economy. There's also Vital Signs, an original drama starring Dr. Dre that genuinely seems intriguing. But even so, it's just one show, with no release date just yet, whose primary purpose is to advertise Apple Music. To this point, Peter Kafka of Re/Code wrote the following earlier this year: So, again: Is Apple really getting into the TV business? Yes. But also, not really. The real answer is more modest: Apple has already been financing video content it uses to market Apple Music -- "to extend Apple Music," in the words of an insider. And it's doing that with the Dre show. Full stop. That's much less exciting than "Apple Is Getting Into TV," but it's more accurate. Original content is king and Apple is laughably behind The reality is that it's becoming increasingly harder to compete in the TV space without original content. How is it that Amazon, with roots as an online retailer, was able to grasp the strategic importance of original content while Apple has remained completely oblivious, focusing on interface redesigns instead? If you tally up how many original programs that Amazon has either aired or is planning to air, the count checks in at over 50. All the while, Apple is slowly slogging along hoping that it can make a splash with Planet of the Apps and Vital Signs. Does Apple appreciate that the TV landscape today was forever changed by Netflix's obsession with churning out original content? It sure doesn't seem like it. Part of the reason why Apple bought Beats was for its talent. From Jimmy Iovine to Trent Reznor, Apple was able to bring on board music bigwigs who truly understood the music industry from the inside out. Apple lacks the same type of expertise with respect to TV and it shows. All the more perplexing is that Apple has, as of yesterday, more than $237 billion in the bank. It has more than enough money to bankroll a few quality TV programs. As an illustrative example, it would cost Apple $538 million to cumulatively produce one season of the following shows. Game of Thrones Breaking Bad House of Cards Orange is the new Black Arrested Development Mad Men Marco Polo The Wire The Big Bang Theory Sons of Anarchy Even if Apple started out small with just two shows, an ambitious project like Game of Thrones costs $60 million per season while House of Cards costs $50 million. If Apple wants to get serious about TV, it doesn't necessarily need to purchase Netflix outright as some have suggested; it can go it alone as well. But instead, we can sit back and enjoy Planet of the Apps and be lured into an Apple Music subscription in the process. The crazy thing is that it doesn't even take long to roll out original content and become a major player in the TV space. Netflix seemingly did it in a blink of an eye, with hits like House of Cards and Orange is the new Black not even debuting until 2013. The Siri Remote is a joke Content aside, the shamelessly horrible design of the Apple TV 4 remote is even more proof that the higher-ups at Apple simply don't get TV. Are we really supposed to believe that Apple understands the TV viewing experience when its remote is nothing short of a case study in backwards non-functional design? Making an iPhone extremely thin might make for a good design, but the same doesn't apply for a TV remote. A good TV remote needs a little bit of heft and it needs to be ergonomically friendly. Say what you will about Comcast, but their standard X1 remote is extremely well designed to fit an actual human's hand. Additionally, given that a lot of TV is watched on couches, the Apple TV remote is frustratingly prone to getting misplaced or even lost. What's more, there's no backlighting on the Apple TV remote, making it downright frustrating to use in the dark. Compounding the problem is that its backwards industrial design all but makes it impossible, upon picking it up, to immediately discern which part of the remote is the top and which is the bottom simply by picking it up. To this point, former Apple ad guru Ken Segall writes: The Siri Remote is a gorgeously designed object — it’s just a terribly designed remote. It’s a thin slab that feels like, well, a thin slab. Its shape doesn’t contribute one iota to ease of use. There are a number of remotes out there that fit the human hand nicely, and put the most-used buttons at one’s fingertips. Lapses of this type make it difficult to defend Apple when it is accused of favoring design over function. It’s hard to think of the Siri Remote as anything but design run amok. It’s beautifully annoying. It's bad design through and through, especially given Jony Ive's penchant of repeating Steve Jobs' famous quote that "design is not just what it looks like and feels like, design is how it works." Apple's TV strategy, on the whole, is a muddled mess All of this taken together, it's hard to have faith in any TV-oriented initiative from Apple. Almost depressingly, we haven't even covered everything that's amiss with Apple's TV strategy, a list which includes the Apple TV not supporting 4K video and Apple's seeming belief that people want to watch big sporting events with a scrolling Twitter feed on the side. Joe Steel nails it when he writes: Apple’s incoherent strategy on the Apple TV, and tvOS as a platform, needs a dire revamp. Even the revamping they are trying to graft on to the products in the form of TV the app is so poorly integrated, and partnered, that it raises questions about why people would even open the software feature that they bill as a primary reason to get an Apple TV in their very own marketing materials. There’s a total lack of understanding about TV in homes, which has plagued the product since it shipped last year, and seems guaranteed to persist another year. This is spot-on, but there's sadly no indication that Apple even has the right people to help bring about a revamp that would actually make the Apple TV compelling.

Mobile apps are a $51 billion dollar industry and 79% of U.S. companies say mobile apps are a factor in their success. Yet the distribution model for mobile apps is frozen in the era of software-in-a-box, completely out of the creator's control once it is on a user's device. As more companies rely on mobile as a critical business driver, it is not only frustrating but costly if your app experiences a bug or hiccup. Waiting hours, let alone days, can bleed revenue or customer trust from a business. Rollout has changed that by creating the first and only product for modifying live, native iOS apps. As an Apple-compliant solution with bank-level security, Rollout is becoming a go-to for app makers on a global scale. Rollout is already being used by thousands of app developers and is installed on more than 50 million devices, with companies like Yahoo! Japan, Musical.ly, and Bumble making it a core piece of their app deployment process. Now, at the request of its developer community, Rollout is bringing that functionality to a completely new arena, Apple's fast-growing native app language Swift. For the first time, Swift developers will have the ability to make critical updates to their live apps via Rollout without the hurdle of going through the App Store review process. The technology behind Rollout's Swift implementation involved building runtime method replacement for Swift, which was difficult to create because of Swift's lack of dynamic capabilities compared to Objective-C. As a result, app makers will now be able to patch code at runtime with Swift, something that was impossible to do before. "It boggles my mind how far behind mobile development is at app updates when you consider that website are often pushing dozens of releases every day," said Erez Rusovsky, CEO at Rollout. "No matter how much Apple compacts its App Store approval process, there's an urgent business need to control the day-to-day app modifications that determine customer experience and key revenue generators like subscriptions and in-app purchases. Our vision is to give control over the app deployment process back to developers." "Mobile is a critical piece of Upwork's ecosystem, and the quality of our apps is important to our business. That's why Rollout has become a must-have tool for our iOS team," said Bittu Ahlawat, head of mobile engineering at global freelancing platform Upwork. "Rollout gives us more control over our apps and significantly minimizes the impact of issues on our users. Once we have the fix ready, we can push it to them in a matter of minutes, a process that used to take days." "Details matter in a luxury mobile experience," said Yacine Salhi, head of mobile at leading resale luxury platform Vestiaire Collective. "We were one of the first luxury marketplaces to have our own app, as mobile is a key piece of our e-commerce strategy. We continually release new features in order to improve the mobile experience. Prior to Rollout, the entire team would be stressed about each and every release. Even with our extensive QA, issues still appeared in the wild. Rollout not only helps us release new features faster and fix bugs without waiting for App Store approval, it gave us back the reigns to keep our customers happy." About Rollout.io, Inc. Rollout is an industry-first control center for mobile developers to modify their live, native iOS apps. Using Rollout, mobile developers can instantly push code-level changes to live apps without the need to release a new version through Apple's App Store or wait for end users to update their app. Rollout is used by thousands of app developers and is installed on on more than 50 million devices, with companies like Yahoo! Japan, Musical.ly, Upwork and Bumble making it a core piece of their app deployment process. The company is headquartered in San Francisco, CA.

By Benjamin Glaser, Dealnews.com November 3, 2016 Save for later Saved People shop during Black Friday at a Target store in Colma, Calif. Jeff Chiu/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of November is the ultimate month for deal hunters. Not only will you find above-average sales most weeks, but this month you also get to shop Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday — and price lows you simply don't see throughout the rest of the year. However, not every sale you come across in November will offer true price lows. We're here to tell you what you should buy this month, what will be cheaper next month, and what you should avoid at all costs. Need more shopping tips? Make sure you check out our  Black Friday predictions and  timely features, and consider subscribing to our  DealNews Select Newsletter so the best deals of the day are delivered to your inbox. Recommended: Black Friday trivia quiz The Best of Black Friday Large Home Appliances From Dyson vacuums to washer and dryer units, November is the month you want to make your  major appliance purchases. Black Friday week in particular will offer an abundance of deals on laundry units, vacuums, dishwashers, and refrigerators. Our research shows that 35% of these deals will hit their best-of-the-year prices, compared with 25% otherwise. Test your knowledge Black Friday trivia quiz Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/14 The best deals will come from  Home Depot,  Target, and Sears. Keep an eye out for additional coupon savings, and free sitewide shipping. Apple Devices Everything from  iPads to Apple Watches can be a great buy during Black Friday, with two big qualifiers: Buy one generation behind, and don't buy from the Apple Store. Brand new devices don't see as significant discounts, and the Apple Store is always undercut by resellers like  Best Buy and  Micro Center. That said, you can grab an iPhone 6s (with new and improved memory) for $349, or $200 off — or for free with a 2-year contract. The iPad Air 2 will drop to $350, and even though they are the same price, the iPad mini 4 will drop to $300. Apple Watch pricing gets a little confusing, because there are now three distinct models. The Series 2 is the newest, and the Series 1 is the same as the original Apple Watch, but with a better processor. The original Apple Watch was discontinued by Apple, but will still be available in some stores. The original will see the best prices, as low as $150; just be aware of what you're getting, because stores might be vague about which model they're selling. Android and Windows Tablets If you don't want to invest a lot of money on a slate, November is an ideal time to buy a  budget tablet. We expect to see an 8" 16GB quad-core Android tablet for $40, a 10" 32GB quad-core Android tablet for $60, and a 10" 32GB quad-core Windows 2-in-1 tablet for $75. If you want to spend even less, you could opt for refurbished units, which we expect to sell for $15 and $30, respectively. However, for a better tablet experience, it will be hard to top Amazon's Fire tablets. Their entry-level 7" one was discounted from $50 to $35 on Thanksgiving last year. Their latest, an 8" HD version, costs $90, so it could be available for $60 around Black Friday. Check out A4C and  Newegg for other tablets under $100. Clothing November  apparel sales are easy to predict because retailers tend to offer similar deals to the ones they had the previous year. That means you can expect the average apparel deal to shave 54% off, whereas the best sales will take up to 80% off. Coupons, of which there will be many, can take as much as 60% off. However, stackable coupons will be a little more moderate, taking between 20% to 30% off. One thing to keep in mind is that the best shopping day for clothing this season isn't Black Friday, and isn't even Thanksgiving: It's Cyber Monday. Be sure to check this day for the best deals on apparel, shoes, and also beauty items. 4K TVs (and Budget TVs) Month after month we've warned shoppers to stay away from  TV deals. Well, now is the time to upgrade, and for the first time ever, we're saying 4K is a great buy for Black Friday. We expect to see prices on these TVs drop to lows that would have been unthinkable just a year ago. Expect to see 4K doorbusters for as low as $230, with midsize UHD sets for less than $500 readily available. But the really in-demand sets (with a better price/performance balance) will still be 1080p sets. Those around 42" could go for $120. Mainstream and Budget Laptops In addition to TVs, Black Friday is also traditionally the best time of the year to make a  laptop purchase. As usual, 15" laptops with current-generation processors will provide the best value: A 15" Windows laptop with an i5 Skylake chip should drop to $300. If you want a faster i7, expect to pay $450. Bargain bin laptops will also see incredible lows, dropping below last year's doorbuster price of $149 to the $110 range. That's for a 15" laptop with less memory and a weaker processor. Extreme budget laptops, however, may once again drop as low as $99, but keep in mind these machines will offer inferior hardware usually consisting of an 11" screen, Celeron or Atom processor, and just 2GB of RAM. They're fine for simple tasks like Web browsing and social media, but can struggle with more powerful tasks like streaming HD video or multitasking. Laptop deals are plentiful at  Amazon, Newegg, and Best Buy, which are also three of our top overall stores for Black Friday. But also keep an eye on  Dell Home, Adorama, and the Microsoft Store. Kitchen Appliances Whether you're a casual cook or an actual chef, November is the absolute best time to buy  kitchen goods and appliances. Even high-end devices like KitchenAid mixers and essential Pyrex container sets will see extraordinary deals. Our 2016 Black Friday Home Goods Guide anticipates around 50% of this year's small appliance offers will earn the Editors' Choice nod, in comparison with a typical 19% from the rest of the year. Look for deals from stores like  Kohl's, Kmart, and  Bon-Ton. Low-End MacBooks and iMacs Apple computer deals are easier to come by for their smaller and less powerful models. For laptops, that's the 11" MacBook Air; for desktops it's the 21" iMac. Expect low-end 11" Airs at $700 and base model 21" iMacs at $900. Mid-Generation Game Consoles The Xbox One S and the PS4 Slim are new, but the next generation  video game consoles for both companies have already been announced (and the PlayStation Pro is already available for pre-order). That means you'll be able to get a great deal on what is essentially still a current-gen console. Used versions of the Xbox One and PS4 will be super affordable, but still won't be much cheaper than new consoles. Look for bundles that include top-rated games and a controller. Wait Until Later Winter Apparel If you need a new parka or wool scarf, you'll see better prices during mid-season sales in January, when discounts will top 50%. High-End Computers Intel's new Kaby Lake processor is still mostly available in ultralight gaming laptops. It won't see major discounts, but most consumers don't need these specs anyway. Apple also doesn't see big discounts for its more powerful laptops, even following an update like the ones announced last week. Back in 2012, the last time MacBooks got a significant upgrade, we didn't see any deals on older models during Black Friday. ! Gift Cards These handy stocking stuffers practically rain from the sky in December, when you can easily score $100 of iTunes credit for $80 or even $70. Exercise Equipment Stores like to take advantage of all those New Years' resolutions, so wait until early January to pick up weights or an exercise bike. Toys Sorry, but if you're looking for the hottest toys of the season, Black Friday deals will be few and far between. Whatever is the "Frozen" or "Star Wars" toy of this season will be so in-demand that it won't be discounted often. The truly dedicated can find deals of up to 60% off on items from Toys "R" Us' Fabulous 15 list, but these offers will sell out almost immediately. It might be better to take your chances finding a deal during December. Excited for Black Friday deals?

CLOSE Home Latest News Pakistan World Technology Sports Style Amazing Blogs Urdu Videos Home Latest News Pakistan World Technology Sports Style Amazing Blogs Urdu Videos Home Technology Gadgets Huawei launches Mate 9 with artificial intelligence Technology Gadgets Latest News Top Stories Huawei launches Mate 9 with artificial intelligence By Web Desk - November 3, 2016 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter LONDON: Huawei Technologies come up with new premium phone, Mate 9 on Thursday, adding a new artificial intelligence feature it hopes will help it close the gap with Apple and market leader Samsung, which is reeling from scrapping its flagship phone.The Mate 9 is aimed squarely at the top end of the $400 billion global smartphone market, where professional users are looking for fast phones with long battery life. It includes a feature that enables the device to learn about the habits of its user and automatically put the most frequently used apps in easy reach – unlike, for example, Apple’s iPhone, where icons that may occupy many screens apart from the start screen have to be manually ordered.  “It learns how you use your phone,” said Arne Herkelmann, Huawei’s European head of handset portfolio and planning.The launch comes just three weeks after Samsung scrapped its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, dealing a huge blow to its reputation and outlook. With smartphone sales growth expected to slow in the coming years, device manufacturers are focusing on new ways to stand out from the crowd.  “Just the device is no longer enough,” said Roberta Cozza, an analyst at research firm Gartner. “AI and voice control will be main features on smartphones in the coming years.” Alphabet’s Google last month launched the Pixel smartphone which has Google Assistant, the company’s voice-activated artificial intelligence (AI) system and its answer to Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. In another AI push, Samsung said last month it would buy Viv, which is run by the co-creator of Apple’s Siri and said it wanted to integrate the platform in its Galaxy smartphones and expand its voice-assistant services to home appliances and wearable technology devices. The Mate 9, introduced in Munich, is a 5.9-inch (15 cm)large-screen handset that boasts cameras with autofocus, directional microphones with noise cancellation and an improved user interface. The algorithm puts the user’s favorite apps first, which makes the phones easier to use and also more energy-efficient. The phone’s battery lasts for almost two days of heavy usage and can fully recharge in 90 minutes, Huawei said. Gartner expects smartphone sales to grow 4.5 percent to 1.5billion devices this year.

Trending in Apple Poll: What is your view of the all-USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro? November 3 AAPL: 109.83 -1.19 Opinion: How long before an iPhone completely replaces standalone cameras? Ben Lovejoy - 2 weeks ago @benlovejoy Feature Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit There’s a photographer’s saying that the best camera is the one you have on you at the time. It’s no use having the best pro DSLR in the world if it’s sitting at home when you spot a photo opp. The camera most people have on them at the time is … the iPhone. Apple has stated on more than one occasion that the iPhone is the world’s most popular camera, and the evidence supports this claim. A year ago, for example, Flickr shared the top 20 cameras used by its members, and not only did the iPhone 6 top the list, but various iPhones took eight of the 20 slots. For many, an iPhone is their only camera. But there are still many others who have one or more standalone cameras – myself among them. What is it those cameras can do that the iPhone can’t, and how long before an iPhone is the only camera we’ll ever need … ? Shallow depth of field Until recently, there was one immediate answer: only a standalone camera could offer shallow depth of field. The iPhone could do this in very limited circumstances, but for the most part if you wanted what is colloquially known as bokeh effect, you needed to use a camera with a larger sensor. With the iPhone 7 Plus, of course, Apple introduced Portrait mode, which offers a shallow depth of field effect on photos taken with the 2x lens. The effect is artificial, and in beta form it’s far from perfect. If you compare these two photos taken by my friend Julian Perry, you’ll see exactly what I mean. This is a normal shot, with the blur created naturally by the lens as per my earlier demonstration). If we zoom in on the left-hand edge of the cup, the background blur is limited, but all is fine. Here’s the same shot with the beta Portrait mode: Much more background blur, but if you look closely at the left hand edge of the coffee cup in the Portrait mode shot, there’s a very obviously artificial break. The software copes much better in some shots, but there’s still quite an artificial look to the bokeh at present. While it tries to make the focus fall off gradually, as with the real thing, it’s so far pretty crude. But that’s why Apple labels it a beta. It will improve, and it will – at some point within the next few years – reach the point where the artificial effect is completely indistinguishable from the natural one. Here’s an example of the real thing, with graduated focus fall-off over quite a short distance: Now sure, professional photographers will point out that different lenses have different bokeh, and you may sometimes choose a lens for the quality of the bokeh. But there’s also no reason why Apple can’t emulate different lens effects in software. So this argument for a standalone camera will, in time, disappear. Macro shots Extreme close-up shots require a macro lens: a lens which not only has an extremely shallow depth of field, but can also focus at extremely short distances. In this shot, for example, I had the lens literally a couple of centimetres away from the surface of the eye. This isn’t something current-generation iPhone cameras can do, but they can focus at about twice that distance, and Apple could apply a more extreme artificial bokeh effect to get the extremely shallow DOF. Again, then, Apple isn’t there yet, but I don’t see this as an enormous challenge. Long exposure (static shots) Sometimes, for creative reasons, you’ll want to have a long exposure – where the shutter remains open longer than usual, like this 30-second exposure on a bridge over a road. A 30-second exposure is also my default setting for ‘blue hour’ shots – the time around 30-40 minutes after sunset when the sky takes on a blue glow. Only a long exposure can capture this. I adore the blue hour, especially if I can get up high, so I take a lot of these. On a standard camera, these type of shots are taken by leaving the sensitivity of the sensor* at 100iso – the sensitivity normally used for a shot taken in bright light – and leaving the mechanical shutter open a long time to acquire the amount of light needed. This is not something the iPhone – with its purely electronic shutter – can do. *Just to avoid a bunch of comments correcting me, yes, technically a sensor only has one sensitivity and all you can do in low light is amplify the signal from it. There are apps which take multiple exposures and stack them. I’ve tried a bunch of these and not found anything that can properly capture the blue hour. If you know of one that can, do please let me know in the comments. But again, this is solvable by software. The iPhone can’t do it today, but there’s no reason a future one couldn’t do it via stacked shots if the demand is there and Apple throws enough effort at it. Long exposure (panning shots) But there’s a second situation where you may want a long exposure – when you want to give a sense of movement. Here, you will track the moving subject with the lens – like this motorcycle – and use a long exposure to create motion-blur in the background. This is known as panning, and typically these exposures will be in the 1/4 second to 1/30th second range. This was a sunny day, so to avoid the long exposure letting in too much light I had to reduce the aperture. This is something a fixed-aperture lens like the iPhone can’t do. In principle, this one too could be handled by software, taking rapidly-stacked exposures and then using Portrait-style processing to separate subject from background to artificially add motion-blur to the background. It is, though, a whole different order of complexity! I can’t see this one happening anytime soon. Low light The final major photographic challenge is low light photos in general. The iPhone has better low-light performance than almost any other smartphone camera on the market, but it’s still leagues away from a professional DSLR. I mentioned above that a camera sensor has a fixed level of sensitivity, and if you want to capture more light for any given shutter speed and aperture, you have to amplify the signal from that sensor. But amplifying the signal has a major downside: you also amplify all the ‘noise’ in the image. Here’s an iPhone shot taken in low light: It looks kind of ok when viewed in a very small size like that, but if we take a closer look at the sky, we can see that the noise is horrendous. For static photos, we can use the stacked shot approach described above, but that isn’t any use for a shot like this, where we’re moving. It’s also no use for the most common requirement of a low-light shot: photographing people at parties, concerts, bars and so on. People are not very good at remaining perfectly still for 30 seconds, even without any alcohol involved … One of the key features that distinguishes a professional DSLR from a cheaper camera is the low-light performance offered. As I say, you have to amplify the signal from the sensor to achieve high ISO settings, but a pro camera copes with this well. This was a shot taken in dark conditions at 6400iso (amplified x64) on a Nikon D3, a pro body: If we go in as close as I did on the shot from the plane, you can see there is some noise, but it’s in a completely different league. (The focus looks a little soft as I’ve left the RAW shot unsharpened to avoid adding any sharpening artifacts. If you shoot in JPEG, sharpening is added in-camera.) This is actually the toughest challenge for Apple to solve. For any given level of technical know-how applied by a manufacturer, the larger the sensor, the lower the noise level. In the better DSLRs, known as full-frame cameras, there’s room for a large sensor – the same size as a 35mm negative. You only find these in pro bodies like the Nikon D5 and Canon 1DX, plus prosumer bodies like the Nikon D750 and Canon 6D. More portable mirrorless cameras, like the Sony a6000 and its more expensive 4K-shooting brother the a6300, have smaller but still decent-sized APS-C sensors. I’m happy enough with the performance of my Sony a6000 that I use it as my standard travel camera these days, leaving my Nikon D3 at home. But an iPhone has a tiny sensor compared to any standalone camera. I think it could be a very long time indeed before technology has advanced sufficiently to allow DSLR levels of low-light photography in a smartphone. Other factors Professional photographers and real enthusiasts would, of course, raise a whole bunch of additional differences between a cameraphone and a DSLR – not least among them removable, high-capacity storage. But for the vast majority of amateur shooters, I think these five factors are the ones that count. I could see Apple solving the first three. The fourth and fifth, though, I think may take very much longer. Do you still have a standalone camera? If you do, how much usage does it get?

November 3 AAPL: 109.83 -1.19 Kohl’s to start selling Apple Watch in 400 stores on November 15 ahead of Black Friday deal Zac Hall - 2 weeks ago @apollozac Apple Watch View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Department store Kohl’s is the latest retailer to begin carrying the Apple Watch just in time for the holiday shopping season. Fortune reports that Kohl’s will offer the Apple Watch at 400 of its retail locations starting November 15. That’s just a fraction of its 1,100 locations across the country, but the report notes that it tops rival Macy’s effort. We learned back in September that Macy’s is selling the Apple Watch at 180 of its stores with mini Apple boutiques for its shoppers. Apple Watch Nike+ has also expanded retail availability for the product with Nike stores and Dick’s Sporting Goods carrying it for the first time this year. As for Kohl’s, the retailer has been a close partner with Apple in supporting the mobile payment service Apple Pay. For example, Kohl’s was an early adopter for accepting Apple Pay at its stores and was the first retailer to make its store credit card compatible with Apple’s Wallet app. Kohl’s has since made its rewards card also compatible with Apple Pay. If you’re looking for a deal on buying the Apple Watch during the holiday season, stay tuned to our sister site 9to5Toys. Earlier today, 9to5Toys published a sneak peek at the Kohl’s Black Friday ad for later this month which includes a pretty compelling promotion when you buy an Apple Watch from the Kohl’s on the day after Thanksgiving. Overall, it should be a decent quarter for the Apple Watch as new models were just released along the iPhone 7. Apple Watch Series 1 matches the features of the first-generation model but with a faster processor, and Apple Watch Series 2 adds built-in GPS for athletes and stronger waterproofing for swimmers.

Since then, we’ve received a lot of requests for more information on HomeKit and home automation, so in this series, I’ll explain what HomeKit is, how it works, and how to use it. I’ll also look at some of the home automation devices that work with HomeKit. But first, let’s talk about why you might want to use home automation in the first place. Why Home Automation? -- If you’ve never used home automation before, it can seem like a gimmick at best and a potential nightmare at worst. Untold movies and TV shows have explored the potential horrors of home automation. Most recently, in an episode of “Mr. Robot,” a woman is driven from her home after hackers make her apartment go haywire. Even if complete takeover of your home by revolutionary hackers is far-fetched, problems could be annoying. By definition, home automation takes place in your personal space, and buggy code or simple human error, even in Apple’s somewhat simplified offering, could have a real impact on your life. Think carefully before diving in. But once you begin to use home automation, you start to see the everyday problems it can solve. Home automation may not change your world, but it can remove friction from your daily existence. Think about how many times a day you turn lights on and off, set your thermostat, adjust a ceiling fan, or check door locks. Even if it’s just a matter of making sure everything is as you want before bed, that’s a win. It can also compensate for the thoughtlessness of others — those people in your household who forget to turn off lights or check that the fridge is closed. When you set home automation up intelligently, you’ll feel empowered, not overwhelmed. For Apple users, HomeKit offers the easiest, most secure way to achieve that goal. This series will unfold over the next few weeks, but if you’re in a hurry to learn more, check out my book, “iOS 10: A Take Control Crash Course,” which has an entire chapter dedicated to HomeKit and iOS 10’s new Home app. Why HomeKit? -- Apple’s HomeKit home automation framework gives hardware manufacturers and software developers a unified way to interact with home automation devices on iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Home automation isn’t new — the X10 home automation protocol has existed since 1975, and I’ve heard from readers who controlled home automation setups with Apple II computers! By comparison, HomeKit is a baby. It debuted with iOS 8, although HomeKit-compatible devices didn’t start hitting the market until iOS 9. Even then, HomeKit control was rudimentary, relying on third-party apps. iOS 10 and watchOS 3 introduced Apple’s Home app, which offers a standardized way to manage and control HomeKit devices. Standard is good, but HomeKit is far from a complete home automation solution. Every home automation vendor provides its own software, and some of those solutions offer capabilities beyond what HomeKit provides. Some systems, such as the Philips Hue, provide a complete developer API, which makes possible apps like Light DJ, which syncs your lights with music, something HomeKit can’t do. That’s just one example — an entire ecosystem has grown up around the Hue lights. The other downside of HomeKit is that it can’t control just any device — manufacturers must work with Apple to have their devices certified for HomeKit. Based on my discussions with vendors, that’s challenging and expensive, though as I’ll explain, there are good reasons for that. As a result, the HomeKit ecosystem doesn’t offer as many options as more established and more open standards like X10. So why use HomeKit at all? There are several excellent reasons: Security: Apple has arguably the best security of any large consumer-oriented tech company. Remote access to HomeKit devices is disabled by default and can’t even be turned on unless you’ve enabled two-factor authentication on your Apple ID. You’d be hard-pressed to find a more secure home automation system that’s this easy to use. This advantage came into sharp focus recently with the DDoS attack that interrupted Internet service in the United States (see “Massive DDoS Attack Blocks Access to U.S. Web Sites,” 24 October 2016). That attack was made possible thanks to a plethora of insecure Internet of Things devices like DVRs and IP cameras. Last year, Forbes reported on the pains hardware vendors were experiencing making HomeKit devices to Apple’s exacting standards, especially when it comes to security. However, after seeing the destructive potential of insecure Internet-connected devices, I think we can better appreciate Apple’s rigorous approval process. Integration: HomeKit devices work with the built-in Home app in iOS 10, and your favorite Accessories and Scenes automatically appear in the third pane of Control Center. Also, you can control your devices using Siri in iOS 10, tvOS 10, and watchOS 3. Sharing: The Home app makes it easy to manage shared access to HomeKit devices. You can add and remove people, and decide whether or not they can edit your configurations. Also, changes you make to your HomeKit setup are automatically made available to everyone with whom you’re sharing. Interoperability: The Philips Hue app is pretty good, but it can’t control my iHome iSP5 or Elgato Eve Energy smart plugs. With HomeKit, I can set up a Scene to turn all of those devices off at once. HomeKit’s goal is to let you forget about vendors and focus on functionality. Also, since HomeKit is an open framework, developers can create HomeKit control apps, some of which are more capable than Apple’s Home app. Ease of Use: Home automation is complicated, but HomeKit offers the simplest, most unified home automation experience on the market. Apple’s Home app may not be the most powerful home automation app, but it won’t intimidate the casual user. Most HomeKit devices are plug-and-play. As simple as HomeKit is to use, you need to understand its core concepts to feel in control and to know what I’m talking about in future HomeKit articles. The HomeKit Hierarchy -- First, let’s go over a bit of necessary terminology, but don’t worry, it’s relatively straightforward. Apple organized HomeKit into a hierarchy, which gives you various levels of control over your devices. The highest level is a Home. A Home could be your residence, but it could also be an outbuilding, an office, a vacation home, or some other multi-room structure In the next level down, you have Rooms. A Room is, as you’d guess, a section of a Home. You can set up your living room, bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen as Rooms in your Home. (Technically speaking, there’s another level of HomeKit hierarchy above Rooms: Zones, which are collections of Rooms. For instance, all the rooms downstairs in your house could be a Zone. However, Apple’s Home app doesn’t yet support Zones, so I won’t discuss them much in this series.) Next in the hierarchy are Accessories, which are the home automation devices in your Home, like smart bulbs, wall plugs, locks, thermostats, ceiling fans, etc. Accessories offer Services, which are the functions of the Accessory. For most devices, the Accessory and Service are indistinguishable, but some Accessories offer multiple Services. For example, my Elgato Eve Room sensor provides four Services: Current Temperature, Current Relative Humidity, Air Quality, and Battery Level. However, Apple’s Home app blurs the line between Accessories and Services, listing Services as Accessories. It also doesn’t display the Eve Room’s Battery Level Service. If you find the difference between Accessories and Services confusing, don’t worry about it. At the moment, it’s trivia. You can also group Accessories to make operation simpler. For instance, I’ve grouped my two Hue-powered living room lamps, so I can adjust their color and brightness together. However, if I dig a little deeper into the Home app, I can still manipulate each one separately. The HomeKit hierarchy is a bit of a pain, but it’s essential to a smooth HomeKit experience, especially when you use Siri. I can tell Siri to turn on the laundry room light or make my living room blue, and it understands my commands perfectly. (Well, most of the time. It’s still Siri.) The last two terms you need to know are the most important: Scenes and Automations. A Scene is a collection of actions; for instance, my Good Night scene turns off the lamps in our laundry and music rooms, and dims the lights in the living room to zero (just enough light to see at night, without actually being off). Scenes are one of the most important concepts in home automation, and I’ll cover them extensively. As the name suggests, Automations invoke Scenes automatically according to a user-specified schedule. I’ll cover these more in a future installment. When set up carefully, Automations can remove even more friction from your life. For instance, on weekdays my wife usually wakes up earlier than I do. At 5:30 AM, my Good Morning scene turns on the lights in the laundry, music, and living rooms, so she doesn’t have to stumble through a dark house (our laundry room doubles as her closet, and the music room — a converted garage — adjoins the laundry room). At 8:30 AM, the Good Night scene turns off all those lights because by that time, she’s usually long gone from the house. At 3:00 PM, about the time she usually gets home from work, the Good Morning scene comes on again, so those areas of the house are well lit when she walks in and wants to change her clothes or prep for a music lesson. At night, we activate the Good Night scene manually, because we don’t all go to bed at a fixed time. I’ve put a lot of thought into these Automations, so no one’s surprised by a light suddenly turning on or off. When my wife gets up, the lights she needs are on. They turn off after she leaves, and they’re back on when she gets home. And that’s with only two Scenes! With careful planning, your automated home can be just as seamless. Planning Your HomeKit Home -- If you’re intrigued by the promise of HomeKit and want to start playing with home automation, I have a few recommendations. First, communication is essential. Discuss your plans before you start buying stuff so everyone in the house has input. If your partner or roommate isn’t technical or might be bothered by the inevitable learning pains, consider starting with a single device. In the most extreme case, you might learn that home automation isn’t worth the conflict it may cause. If you’re planning to set up automated lights and smart plugs, it’s important to discuss our habit of using physical switches. For instance, if I turn off a switch that controls a lamp with Hue bulbs, my HomeKit Scene can’t turn them back on automatically, which could leave my wife fumbling in the early morning darkness. The solution to this problem is to install smart switches that can work with your home automation system and be activated manually (which is also helpful for guests). Elgato just released the first HomeKit-enabled wall switch, the Eve Light Switch. Philips makes a couple for use with the Hue bulbs — the Philips Hue Dimmer Switch and the Philips Hue Tap Switch. iDevices announced a couple of HomeKit wall switches months ago, but they have yet to appear on the market. At first, you’ll probably have to get used to using your iPhone or Apple Watch to control lights. I haven’t personally used any of these smart switches yet, so I can’t currently offer a recommendation. (If you have, let us know in the comments!) When the decision makers in your home understand and agree to home automation, the next step is figuring out where to begin. I recommend starting small with some sort of light control, either the Philips Hue system or a smart plug like the iHome SmartPlug or Elgato Eve Energy. Everyone I know who has tried Hue loves it (including our own Jeff Carlson, who regularly curses me for hooking him on home automation), but with starter kits ranging between $80 and $200, it’s an investment. However, if you want to start with a simple smart plug to control a lamp, the iHome iSP5 costs only about $30, while the Elgato Eve Energy goes for about $50. The benefit of these smart plugs is that you can use them with any appliance that plugs into a standard power outlet, so they give you a lot of room to experiment. Once you decide on your initial HomeKit investment, the next step is figuring out where to use it. Again, take it easy at the start so you and your family can get a feel for the experience. There are so many possibilities that it can be tempting to jump in with both feet. Fight that temptation. Before I got my Hue bulbs, I didn’t think there was any point in having just a handful of automated bulbs. After I started playing with them, I realized that I didn’t need many to have a functional setup, since our most-used lights are the two floor lamps in our living room. So think about where automation could have the most impact in your home. If you go for the Hue bulbs, the living room is an obvious place to start. But maybe there’s a certain light that your family members always forget to turn off, or a basement light that you’d prefer to turn on before you venture down the stairs. If you have a smart plug, you might even want to use it to turn a space heater or fan on and off at certain times. The keys to an intelligent smart home are communication and thoughtful planning. Nail those, and you’ll find that home automation makes your home a more pleasant, comfortable place that doesn’t require you to run around changing settings and turning things on and off. The tips, techniques, and products that I’ll discuss in the rest of this series are just means to that end.

It has phase couplers for both legs of the incoming power and signal amplifiers for large homes. I use a plug-in controller that is connected to and programmed by an old iMac running OS 9.2. The only thing lacking is decent control software that is up to date. I am interested in HomeKit but, from what I see, it is still 35 years behind in capabilities. I will watch HomeKit development but, for now, I will stick to the MUCH less expensive X-10 system and just hope someone will produce control software for it. Reply Chuck Shotton  2016-11-03 13:47 There's a cool open source alternative to a hardware hub. You can get an application called HAP-NodeJS that will run on just about any flavor of computer (Macs for sure) that makes the Mac, itself, into a HomeKit hub. Then you can configure it to act as a bridge to all sorts of HomeKit-unaware things (like WeMO for example). It can also react to Siri commands to interact with virtual devices that can be hooked up to AppleScripts or other programs. You have to be a bit of a hacker to make it go, but you can find it at https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS Reply David Redfearn   2016-11-03 16:04 I have to laugh at this stuff - I don't see the value at all. >>Think about how many times a day you turn lights on and off (twice a day) set your thermostat (once a month - they are already programmed via my electrical utility) adjust a ceiling fan (twice a day in the summer, not at all in the winter) or check door locks (a couple times a day). I tried the colored light bulbs, and they didn't work well and returned them. I agree that Apple's HomeKit is the most secure way to control these things, but no-way would I trust _any_ internet connected door locks to provide real security. These are great for those who like to play around with technology - not so much for the rest of us. David Reply Joe Carl White  2016-11-03 22:24 "Elgato just released the first HomeKit-enabled wall switch, the Eve Light Switch." Lutron Caseta dimmer switches are HomeKit enabled (in conjunction with the SmartHub); I installed my first one at the beginning of the year, and just added a second. http://www.casetawireless.com/pages/applehomekit.aspx Reply Yorick  2016-11-04 18:58 I started playing with HomeKit Devices (EcoBee Thermostat, iHomeControl and iDevices power sockets). I use the Apple Home app and also the Wink App. I wanted the light in my living room to turn on automatically when I arrived home if it was dark so that I didn't walk into an empty house. Then I set the lights to turn on at dusk and off at random late times when I'm away. Plus the lights all turn off at a set time after I've gone to bed in case I forget. If I remember I can always say "Hey Siri, turn off all the lights". Plus my girlfriend who is 5,000 miles away can turn them off if she knows I forgot. I can check the temperature in the house if I am away and the thermostat will warn me if it is too hot or cold. On the way home from work (a 25 minute drive) I can turn the heating on to arrive home to a warm house. I've played with X.10 since '98 but HomeKit and the like take it to a new level. Reply JohnB (SciFiOne)   2016-11-09 12:24 Good article. I enjoyed it. As someone in my 70th year, I have no plans to use home automation (In fact I hope to actively evade it) but it is interesting to read about. Reply CJ Pitt  2016-11-13 12:42 Thanks for this article...and any additional in the series. These are the types of articles I enjoy. They give you ideas on how to use all this technology Apple is providing...albeit without much useful documentation. I think we could also use a similar series of articles on HealthKit and the other assorted Apple Kits.

Google's efforts in some way mirror those of arch-rival Apple, which revamped its App Store this year with quicker review times for new apps and an increase in the cut of revenue that goes to developers. Alphabet Inc's Google is revamping the Google Play Store to help developers build their businesses as concerns mount that the app economy has reached saturation. This overhauls includes Google Play store recommendations with artificial intelligence and support for various payment platforms WHAT IS THE OVERHAUL?  The Google Play store overhaul will focus on helping developers build their business. It includes recommendations with artificial intelligence and support for various payment platforms.  The store is also expanding to new platforms, including wearable devices, virtual reality headsets and Google's Chromebook laptops.  Both Google and Apple have faced a chorus of complaints from developers who say they are struggling to stand out in a jam-packed field. Many smartphone users, meanwhile, appear to have tired of downloading apps altogether, especially as messaging services like Snapchat perform more of the functions that once required a separate app. Games remain a focus of the Google Play store, and Nintendo Co Ltd is building a version of its popular Super Mario Run game for Android, said Sameer Samat, who leads product management for the Google Play store. The store is also expanding to new platforms, including wearable devices, virtual reality headsets and Google's Chromebook laptops.

Share this article Share 14 shares 'What we are excited about is giving developers that single entry point for more and more of the computing ecosystem,' said Samat. Google has eased the once-complicated process of developing apps for the Play store, said James Knight, a former Google employee who launched Pembroke, a consultancy that helps developers convert Apple-compatible iOS apps to the Android operating system. 'The App Store has historically been a little more straightforward, and Android has been a bit more like the Wild West,' he said. To improve app recommendations for users, the Play store has also made extensive use of machine learning. The store is also expanding to new platforms, including wearable devices, virtual reality headsets and Google's Chromebook laptops. Mirroring the larger smartphone market, the Google Play store sees far more activity by virtue of its placement on the wide range of devices running the Android operating system - but Apple claims more of the profits. The Google Play store accounted for 70 percent of app downloads in the third quarter of this year, but Apple's App Store logged 65 percent of the revenue, according to App Annie, a mobile analytics firm. A big part of Google's new effort involves emerging markets, where Android is stronger relative to the iPhone.  The company has steadily expanded its support of direct carrier billing, a popular payment method in emerging markets where consumers often do not have credit cards.  A big part of Google's new effort involves emerging markets, where Android is stronger relative to the iPhone.  The company has steadily expanded its support of direct carrier billing and now offers the payment method in 47 markets Google now offers the payment method in 47 markets. To improve app recommendations for users, the Play store has also made extensive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that gleans insights from vast troves of data.  Google's Play store and machine learning teams began collaborating three years ago, and a partnership was struck last year with Google Brain, a cutting-edge research project. The jolt of artificial intelligence is welcome as developers hunt for an audience for their apps, said Greg Cohn, chief executive of Burner, which makes an app that provides temporary phone numbers. 'The harsh reality is that there are a few apps that get the vast majority of people's time and attention,' he said.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Nov 3, 2016 at 10:00AM In business and investing, size matters. When looking at the most valuable companies in the U.S. stock market as measured by market capitalization, the top five are technology names. Specifically, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are the most valuable listed companies in the world. The tech sector is fertile ground for innovative growth businesses, and companies with solid competitive strengths in a growing market can create tremendous value for investors in a relatively short time. The rise of the tech giants That the five most valuable companies in the stock market are technology businesses says a lot about the kind of opportunities available to investors in top-quality companies operating in growing industries. Considering theyre young companies, these businesses have created enormous value for shareholders over a relatively short period.  Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet's Google business was created in 1998, and it's now the second most valuable company in the world behind Apple, created in 1976. Even more impressive, Facebook is only 12 years old, having been founded in 2004. That Alphabet and Facebook are more valuable than old names such as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) -- founded in 1886 and 1892 -- respectively, is downright amazing. Company Market Capitalization Year Founded Apple $625.9 billion 1976 Alphabet $553.9 billion 1998 Microsoft  $468.7 billion 1975 Amazon.com $380.2 billion 1994 Facebook $379.8 billion 2004 Johnson & Johnson $315.7 billion 1886 Coca-Cola $182.2 billion 1892 Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, corporate websites. Market leaders in industries such as pharmaceuticals and soft drinks can be remarkably profitable investments, and names such as Johnson & Johnson and Coca-Cola have, in fact, delivered attractive returns for investors over the years. Nevertheless, the tech sector is one of a kind when it comes to opportunities for innovation and value creation. Alphabet and Facebook are the top dogs in online advertising, an industry benefiting from explosive growth. Similarly, Apple has revolutionized the mobile computing industry with products such as the iPhone, Microsoft is a world leader in productivity software and operating systems, while Amazon is the industry king of online retail. Demand in these areas has grown exponentially over the past several years, and that demand has been enormously beneficial for investors the five technology juggernauts. Innovation comes in all shapes and sizes, and many companies in traditional sectors of the economy can benefit customers and shareholders with smart innovations. Nevertheless, opportunities for growth are especially attractive for companies operating at the forefront of technological innovation, and the biggest companies in the world are positioned in the right industries. Competitive strengths It all starts with successful innovation and growth opportunities, but it doesn't end there. Success attracts competition, and winning technologies tend to be replicated by other industry players over time. For this reason, the best tech companies need to have enough competitive strengths to keep the competition at bay and consistently translate innovative power into growing earnings and cash flows for investors. Apple is the most valuable brand in the world, and the company has a unique ecosystem of services and applications that generates unparalleled customer loyalty. When considering brand differentiation, customer experience, and cultural footprint, Apple is one of a kind.  Alphabet's Google brand is so powerful that it's even considered a synonym for online search, as many consumers use the expression "googling" for information, as opposed to just "online searching." The company owns seven services and applications with over 1 billion users each: Google Search, Android, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Chrome, and Google Play. No company comes close to Alphabet in terms of scale and popularity in the online world. Image source: Getty Images. Microsoft is facing considerable challenges because of emerging technology trends in the computing industry, such as the rise of mobile computing, but the company is one of the most trusted and respected brands among its core clientele, especially in the corporate sector. Relying on Microsoft's software and services is a safe bet, and corporate customers are notoriously risk-averse when making purchase decisions in this area. Amazon has built tremendous scale over the years, allowing the company to obtain conveniently low prices from suppliers and spread fixed costs across a massive amount of items. Cost competitiveness is a key success factor in discount retail, and Amazon knows how to leverage its strengths to delight its customers with aggressively low prices. Size is of the utmost importance in the social-media industry, since users attract each other to the most relevant platforms. As of the end the second quarter of 2016, Facebook had 1.71 billion monthly active users, growing by 15% year over year. If everyone else is on Facebook, then you need to be on the platform, too, and this dynamic creates a self-sustaining growth cycle for the company. Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook are different businesses with their own weaknesses and strengths. However, the five tech giants operate in attractive markets, and their profits are protected by rock-solid competitive strengths. This is arguably the main reason they're the most valuable companies in the U.S. stock market. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Kohl's Kohl’s will now sell the Apple Watch in select stores Posted Nov 3, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story ObEN nabs $7.7M Series A as it looks to build a more human VR avatar In a bid to juice declining sales, department store Kohl’s will begin selling the Apple Watch in 400 of its stores starting on November 15th, according to a new report from Fortune. Unlike Macy’s, which also recently added the device to its in-store Apple boutiques, Kohl’s says it’s not launching Apple Watch as an electronics partner. Rather, it will sell the smartwatch in its activewear and wellness sections, the retailer said. The move follows other attempts by Kohl’s to establish its brand as a retailer focused on activewear, particularly for the female consumer. Earlier this year, for example, it added Under Armour apparel, accessories and footwear to all of its 1,160 stores. In the Kohl’s stores where the Apple Watch is sold, it will be placed on four-foot tall displays which will show off four different models. Ten different kinds of Apple Watches will be stocked, and Kohl’s employees will staff the Apple Watch section. The tie-up is hoped to attract more customers to the department store over the holiday shopping period, including those with more to spend – and who may not have otherwise frequented a Kohl’s. Meanwhile, for Apple, the partnership means it will gain access to a wider demographic for its smartwatch – including the discount shopper that a brand like Kohl’s attracts. Outside of Apple stores, several retailers today now carry Apple Watch, including Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Macy’s and Dick’s Sporting Goods, for example. Macy’s, which announced plans to sell the watch only weeks ago, will only feature Apple Watch in 180 stores. The Kohl’s Black Friday ad, out now, shows how it will use the Apple Watch to entice shoppers. The company is advertising the Apple Watch Series 2 as available for $369, earning $105 Kohl’s Cash, and the $269 Apple Watch Series 1 earns $75 in Kohl’s Cash. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Watch Description Apple's smart watch.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Beautiful concept envisions Apple extended keyboard with Touch Bar By Christian Zibreg, Nov 3, 2016 Tweet 21 Comments German magazine Curved.de and Dutch 3D artist Martin Hajek created plausible concept renderings of a future Magic Keyboard with a contextually aware OLED strip replacing the physical row of function keys, but that was months before Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Now that the new notebook has been formally announced, Reddit user “Hazza42” felt inspired to create his own mockups of what a standalone extended aluminum Apple keyboard with an integrated Touch Bar might look like. “I was inspired by the Touch Bar on the new MacBooks so I tried my hand at designing an updated Magic Keyboard,” the poster wrote. “Anyone else hoping something like this will be an optional extra when the new iMacs/Mac Pros are announced?” The concept envisions the same Touch Bar replacing the row of function keys with a contextual multi-touch OLED display strip like on the new Pro notebook. Unlike prior concepts, this one calls for a full-size keyboard complete with a number keypad to make the Touch Bar significantly longer than it is on the new MacBook Pro. BTW, am I the only wondering why on Earth Apple sells the compact wireless keyboard but refuses to update its wired full-size keyboard with wireless functionality? If Apple has something like this concept cooking in its labs, we might indeed see a Touch Bar-enhanced standalone keyboard released after the company updates its all-in-one iMac desktop and the Mac Pro. Of course, such a keyboard would have to integrate the Apple-designed P1 chip that handles the Touch Bar, Touch ID and camera on the new MacBook Pro without compromising your security and privacy. At any rate, the price of a Touch Bar-enhanced full-size keyboard would be a major factor in making an informed purchasing decision. I mean, as much as I think that Apple’s Magic accessories are cool, I just cannot bring myself to paying $99 for a Magic Keyboard, $79 for a Magic Mouse 2 and $129 for a Magic Trackpad 2. But an extended Apple aluminum keyboard with an OLED touch bar providing the same Touch Bar functionality as found on the latest MacBook Pro might make a believer. And if it came with low-energy Bluetooth, backlighting, an integrated lithium-ion battery, low-profile keys like on the new MacBook Pro and a Jet Black variant with white or gray keys, I think I’d pay north of $100 for it. How about you?

Aaron Hysell Why wouldn’t it? The Apple Watch has Apple Pay and it connects over bluetooth to a computer, your iPhone! It would still be your fingerprint and yours alone. And to go a step further, you use Touch ID on your iPhone currently to authenticate purchases on your Mac, so whats the difference Ángel Javier Esquivel TouchID is paired to the sensor at processor level that securely stores your biometric info. Same with the T1 chip found in the new MacBook Pro whodakat You know this isn’t an accurate mockup, because it includes the 10-key and Apple clearly hates those of us that need a 10-key… you know, us pesky professionals. Personally I won’t even touch a keyboard without one so they can put Touch ID and a Touch Bar in it all they want, but if they leave off that 10-key, its worthless. PhoneTechJay Those 10-keys was what the 17in MBP’s were missing. omakad Apple does sell keyboard with number pad. I think it’s like $50.00 so maybe this could be a reality. If they want this to catch on and become new inputting device they need to add it across their lines. whodakat I know, I’m typing on it right now. It didn’t get updated in the last peripheral update, and its still wired. As if they can’t make a wireless version. Yeah that 10 key just kills the battery. They clearly don’t think people use it. Kanex makes a wireless version that is clearly better, so I’ll take my business there I guess. But its pretty stupid that the biggest tech company in the world can’t make a wireless keyboard with a 10-key. omakad Yeah I hear ya. I used to use it, but I switched to Logitech K750 because it’s wireless and batery-less :). Harrison Smith Apple would charge at least 169. No way the Airpods are selling for more than this Alex Wilson More then that I think, the magic keyboard is $99 – I’m saying over $200. Aaron Hysell Well, we know this won’t happen because Apple doesn’t like to add number keys on keyboards for some odd reason Christian Zibreg This? http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MB110LL/B/apple-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-english-usa :D That keyboard’s really old – they haven’t released a wireless one yet. It’s why I bought a Logitech one instead. websyndicate I just use mechanial keyboards. I cant work without the F keys. Great concept but like others I need a 10 key. 60% keyboard are not worth it. Tim If they ever launch this. It’s gonna be $249. Alex Wilson Bingo! I completely agree. malhal Move the ` key down next to left shift (like UK layout) then put Esc in its place and it’s perfect! Alex Wilson North of $100? It’s Apple, it would be over $200 probably $250. Consider the track pad goes for $129 and the scrunched up “magic” keyboard goes for $99. For $100 yes I would buy one, but for $200 I’ll pass. I’ll happily stick with my Solar powered Logitech keyboard.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Nov 3, 2016 at 10:00AM In business and investing, size matters. When looking at the most valuable companies in the U.S. stock market as measured by market capitalization, the top five are technology names. Specifically, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are the most valuable listed companies in the world. The tech sector is fertile ground for innovative growth businesses, and companies with solid competitive strengths in a growing market can create tremendous value for investors in a relatively short time. The rise of the tech giants That the five most valuable companies in the stock market are technology businesses says a lot about the kind of opportunities available to investors in top-quality companies operating in growing industries. Considering theyre young companies, these businesses have created enormous value for shareholders over a relatively short period.  Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet's Google business was created in 1998, and it's now the second most valuable company in the world behind Apple, created in 1976. Even more impressive, Facebook is only 12 years old, having been founded in 2004. That Alphabet and Facebook are more valuable than old names such as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) -- founded in 1886 and 1892 -- respectively, is downright amazing. Company Market Capitalization Year Founded Apple $625.9 billion 1976 Alphabet $553.9 billion 1998 Microsoft  $468.7 billion 1975 Amazon.com $380.2 billion 1994 Facebook $379.8 billion 2004 Johnson & Johnson $315.7 billion 1886 Coca-Cola $182.2 billion 1892 Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, corporate websites. Market leaders in industries such as pharmaceuticals and soft drinks can be remarkably profitable investments, and names such as Johnson & Johnson and Coca-Cola have, in fact, delivered attractive returns for investors over the years. Nevertheless, the tech sector is one of a kind when it comes to opportunities for innovation and value creation. Alphabet and Facebook are the top dogs in online advertising, an industry benefiting from explosive growth. Similarly, Apple has revolutionized the mobile computing industry with products such as the iPhone, Microsoft is a world leader in productivity software and operating systems, while Amazon is the industry king of online retail. Demand in these areas has grown exponentially over the past several years, and that demand has been enormously beneficial for investors the five technology juggernauts. Innovation comes in all shapes and sizes, and many companies in traditional sectors of the economy can benefit customers and shareholders with smart innovations. Nevertheless, opportunities for growth are especially attractive for companies operating at the forefront of technological innovation, and the biggest companies in the world are positioned in the right industries. Competitive strengths It all starts with successful innovation and growth opportunities, but it doesn't end there. Success attracts competition, and winning technologies tend to be replicated by other industry players over time. For this reason, the best tech companies need to have enough competitive strengths to keep the competition at bay and consistently translate innovative power into growing earnings and cash flows for investors. Apple is the most valuable brand in the world, and the company has a unique ecosystem of services and applications that generates unparalleled customer loyalty. When considering brand differentiation, customer experience, and cultural footprint, Apple is one of a kind.  Alphabet's Google brand is so powerful that it's even considered a synonym for online search, as many consumers use the expression "googling" for information, as opposed to just "online searching." The company owns seven services and applications with over 1 billion users each: Google Search, Android, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Chrome, and Google Play. No company comes close to Alphabet in terms of scale and popularity in the online world. Image source: Getty Images. Microsoft is facing considerable challenges because of emerging technology trends in the computing industry, such as the rise of mobile computing, but the company is one of the most trusted and respected brands among its core clientele, especially in the corporate sector. Relying on Microsoft's software and services is a safe bet, and corporate customers are notoriously risk-averse when making purchase decisions in this area. Amazon has built tremendous scale over the years, allowing the company to obtain conveniently low prices from suppliers and spread fixed costs across a massive amount of items. Cost competitiveness is a key success factor in discount retail, and Amazon knows how to leverage its strengths to delight its customers with aggressively low prices. Size is of the utmost importance in the social-media industry, since users attract each other to the most relevant platforms. As of the end the second quarter of 2016, Facebook had 1.71 billion monthly active users, growing by 15% year over year. If everyone else is on Facebook, then you need to be on the platform, too, and this dynamic creates a self-sustaining growth cycle for the company. Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook are different businesses with their own weaknesses and strengths. However, the five tech giants operate in attractive markets, and their profits are protected by rock-solid competitive strengths. This is arguably the main reason they're the most valuable companies in the U.S. stock market. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

About Before You Comment Tickets WFNY Opportunities Skip to content Indians Browns Cavaliers Buckeyes Other Sports College Sports Minor League Baseball Other Sports Podcasts WWW Another Browns loss and iPhone 7’s Airbuds: While We’re Waiting September 12, 2016September 12, 2016 Scott Sargent Happy Monday, you guys. How’d Week 1 treat you? Lots of underdogs took home the prize money for their bettors—well, aside from one, but more on them later. The Buckeyes started out slow only to demolish Tulsa. The Indians look pretty decent while Corey Kluber is really, really vying for another AL Cy Young award. Oh, and the Cavs start practicing in about two weeks starting with Camp LeBron in L.A. But While We Wait… Sportsball: They Are Who We Thought They Were So it turns out that the Cleveland Browns are as bad as many were prognosticating, at least for one day. The game, at least from a narrative standpoint, was there for the having. Rookie quarterback facing his first bout of actual competition, coming off of a horrible preseason, running with a group of players with whom he was not accustomed to playing up until the last week. When all the cards were on the table, however, the Browns were the only team to play thus far in Week 1 to lose by more than nine points. Fourteen games, only one of which was decided by double figures, and the Cleveland Football Browns were the ones to falter by the widest margin. The Vikings lost their starting quarterback to a devastating knee injury, traded for the guy who the Browns were supposed to play against on Sunday, and they beat their opponent, on the road, with their second-stringer under center. Even the Dolphins, the largest underdogs of the afternoon with the Seahawks being 10.5-point favorites at home, managed to claw through the entire contest to only lose by two. I know a lot of folks think that the Browns’ offense will keep them in games, but until Josh Gordon returns to provide Robert Griffin III with a more reliable option, this team’s defense is so poor that any offense may not matter—be it in Cleveland or Mexico City. It’s only one of sixteen, but holy crap was it a bad one. Technobabble: Apple kills the headphone jack After being around for roughly 150 years, the headphone jack—that little hole on the bottom of your devices—will be no more, at least when it comes to Apple’s latest incarnation in the iPhone 7. Claiming that the future of audio is wireless (a technology that has been around for some years), iPhone headphones on a going forward basis will be adaptable through Bluetooth. This means abandoning your plug-in headphones that you’ve acquired over the years, making your mobile experience on par with that of many home set-ups now that use network-based Sonos or wireless surround sound systems. iPhone 7s will come with Earpods that are adaptable via the lightning (or “charging”) port, meaning that your noise cancelling headphones are not necessarily garbage bound for now. But there will also be the chance for users to purchase AirPods (get it?) that are the same size and scope as the Apple headphones you have come to know, but are connected through proprietary wireless means.1 The tradeoff? Increased battery life and the space for an improved camera—both items that have long been needed for power users. People thought Apple was being pompous and overly aggressive when it rolled out tablets and the concept of mobile computing. And while the laptop is by no means dead, it’s tough to argue that the company didn’t hit on more items than it has missed over the last decade or so. This is the same company that killed off floppy discs and CD-Rom/DVD drives in laptops—both methods of storage having moved to dinosaur status long ago. The whole aux jack will be a big change for a lot of people, but just like with corded phones and reel-based video, there are kids on this planet right now who will one day laugh at you for ever plugging headphones in in the first place. Culture for the Kids: Spoons out for Harambe The spirit of Harambe lives on, the latest of which comes in the form of the pre-game huddle for the abovementioned Vikings: #ActualSportswriting: Hot Takes Need Not Apply “The Drive That Never Ends” by Seth Wickersham (ESPN The Magazine): “Elway sits alone in his office. He won’t allow himself to get ’emotionally involved’ with players and even most staff, lest he end up cutting them one day. Of course, all GMs say that stuff. But the stakes are high with Elway and not just because he threatens his reputation as a player — ‘greatest locker room quarterback,’ in the words of his former coach Mike Shanahan — with every front office move. ”2 “Chip Kelly’s Second Act” by Chris Brown (The Ringer): “Kelly — stripped of any oversight over personnel — is in charge of a 49ers offense that boasts arguably the worst skill-position talent in the NFL and will be led at quarterback by Blaine Gabbert, whose 71.9 career passer rating puts him behind such exalted figures as Geno Smith and Brandon Weeden. While Kelly’s Oregon and early Eagles offenses broke records by weaving together multiple formations, adaptable running schemes, and multifaceted read-options, all powered by an ingenious spread offense philosophy and a frenetic, up-tempo pace, in the past two years those elements have been undermined or simply fallen away, and Kelly’s offense has become, in Evan Mathis’s words, the most ‘never-evolving, vanilla offense’ in the NFL. How did that happen?”3 “The Disappearance of Justin Blackmon” by Jordan Ritter Conn (The Ringer): “You don’t need much creativity to imagine this man, just a few years ago, setting fire to secondaries across college football. It’s easy to picture him sitting in the green room at Radio City Music Hall, waiting to be selected in the 2012 NFL draft. He’s still imprinted with the muscles of a former Heisman candidate. But in the past two years, Blackmon has appeared in this drafty room on the third floor of this rural Oklahoma building more often than he’s appeared on an NFL sideline.”4 “By staying silent, Roger Goodell and the NFL have come out on top” by Will Leitch (NY Mag): “The press can call out the NFL all it wants, but until people stop watching football, it won’t make a difference. It points to a disconcerting emergency PR strategy that seems more and more common, and effective far beyond the world of professional sports: Just pretend there is no emergency, rely on the public’s distrust of the press, and wait for the media to punch itself out.”5 Video: Are birds beautiful or are they disgusting sky mice? Here’s John Oliver to settle the debate: Have a great Monday, you guys. Regardless of what happened on Sunday afternoon, you’re all winners in my mind. They’re $159 and will be available next month. [↩] As with every Seth Wickersham piece, this one is extremely well-told while being extremely well-reported. [↩] I’m so glad to see Brown being absorbed by The Ringer. His analysis makes everyone else who does film studies have to be that much better. [↩] Yet another excellent Ringer story by a former Grantland scribe, this one on a player Browns fans should know an awful lot about.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Your first look at what it would be like if the iPhone 8 launched in three sizes Zach Epstein BGR NewsNovember 3, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Japanese news agency Nikkei is hit or miss when it comes to unannounced Apple plans. This is a problem among many Eastern news agencies, in fact, and it often stems from gathering data from supply chain sources far too early in the product cycle. Plans often change often before a consumer electronics product reaches the late stages of development, so details surrounding a device like the iPhone 8 might change several times before the new models are released next year. With that in mind, it's far too early to instill too much confidence in the recent Nikkei report that Apple plans to launch the iPhone 8 in not two but three different sizes. It is definitely not too early, however, to check out a mockup that shows how fantastic it would be if Apple actually did release three different versions of its next-generation iPhone 8. MUST SEE: We finally figured out why Google’s Pixel looks so much like an iPhone Earlier this week, we posted a beautiful mockup created by Latvian graphic designer and YouTuber Veniamin Geskin. The mockup showed what an all-screen iPhone 8 would look like if Apple could manage to ditch the home button and embed the fingerprint scanner, ear speaker and sensor beneath the display. The result is stunning, as you can see in this post, but unfortunately it's a bit ambitious for a 2017 smartphone. Apple's new iPhone 8 lineup is indeed expected to ditch the home button and embed a next-generation Touch ID module beneath the screen, but there will likely still be some space above and below the display. In fact, odds are pretty good that the actual iPhone 8 lineup will look more like a different set of mockups created by Geskin. He drew up the tenth-generation iPhone 8 in the three different sizes that Nikkei reported, and you can see them all in the image below. https://twitter.com/VenyaGeskin1/status/792909885520355328 Here's a close-up of the second image: screen-shot-2016-11-03-at-9-39-30-amMore We have already seen a few claims that the Nikkei report is off base and Apple's new iPhone models will only come in two sizes, as they do now. But one look at the image above is enough to realize that a 5-inch iPhone 8 might just be the perfect size for many users who find the Plus too large and the 4.7-inch version too small. If Apple doesn't end up releasing three models, let's just hope that the 5.5-inch iPhone 8 is more compact thanks to its new design, which will reportedly feature a screen with curved edges and less bezel on either side.

And like many, she voiced those concerns. The Giants don’t have the power to muzzle any of those voices, but she says team attempted to flex its muscles and pressure rookie cornerback Eli Apple into silencing his mother. On Thursday, the cornerback told reporters that his mom’s accusations weren’t accurate: “She was a little bit upset and I didn’t have a chance to really talk to her, and I guess throughout that whole thing that’s just how she felt, but I never had a chance to talk to her or anything, so maybe that’s just an assumption of hers that she just felt in her gut,” Eli Apple said, via the New York Daily News. “But it’s definitely false. Nobody’s leaning on me or anything telling me things to tell her. It’s not like that at all. I think the Giants are a class organization, and I’m just happy to be here.” Two weeks ago, Apple told reporters that he had a conversation with the Giants about his mother’s comments, although he didn’t say whether or not the team asked him to control her message. “I talked to them and let them know my mom’s reactions sometimes are like that. She’s her own person and she’s going to do that. I have no control, so I’ve just got to do my job and that’s just play football,” Eli Apple told NJ.com on Oct. 23, the same day his mom wrote a lengthy criticism of comments made by Giants owner John Mara. The Giants publicly backed Brown throughout accusations that he had abused his wife, and the team refused to part ways with the kicker. Even after court documents revealed Brown admitted to the abuse, Giants owner John Mara said the kicker previously told the team about his spousal abuse, but “what's a little unclear is the extent of that.” Five days later, the team finally released Brown. “One of the worst things you can do to a domestic violence victim or survivor is to defend the abuser,” Annie Apple wrote in a deeply personal column for Sports Illustrated that accounted her own experiences with domestic abuse. “These abusive men aren't abusing the women in their lives because they're sick. These abusers are not the victims. They're abusing women because they can. “Some have called me a distraction because speaking up for a cause the Giants have reportedly championed for years makes me a distraction. Others have called me a hero for speaking up. Honestly, I'm not a hero. I'm not special. I just know that in life, there are times when certain things are more important than your personal comfort or the game of football.” Apple has never been one to withhold her opinion — something the Giants should’ve been aware of before the team drafted her son, Eli, with the No. 10 overall selection in the 2016 NFL draft. On Wednesday, in another column for Sports Illustrated, Apple said she was livid with the Giants not only for Mara’s comments or for the team’s handling of Brown, but also because the team tried to get her son to quiet down his mother. “I felt they were leaning heavily on a 21-year-old kid in an effort to control what his mother says,” Apple wrote. “That’s not fair. I know the NFL is a business. I get it. But where in business school is showing basic human compassion and accountability not a good thing?” Eli Apple has been in a bit of a precarious position of juggling his rookie season along with what seems like a battle between the franchise and his mother. After botching the handling of Brown and receiving a tremendous amount of criticism as a consequence, the last thing the Giants should be doing is making an effort to silence a mother and domestic abuse victim from speaking out. But Eli Apple insists that’s not what is happening.

The move marks the first time a Canadian TV service provider has made their content available on Apple’s digital media player and microconsole. CraveTV, Bell’s over-the-top streaming service, is also available on Apple TV via a recently released app. Bell announced that CraveTV surpassed 1 million subscribers earlier today. Bell says features like the ability to pause and rewind Live TV will come to the Apple later this year. Related: Bell adds 107,265 postpaid subscribers in Q3 2016  SourceBell Mr Dog This is actually quiet impressive. You could technically get just a internet package and have access to live TV through Bell? Marc Palumbo No. You’ll need a TV package. This just eliminates the need for extra receivers. But you won’t have access to recordings either. This is great for Live TV. Dan Bratt Can I buy one for my mother which lives 4 hours away and use my Bell Fibe credentials? The Iceman Cometh I don’t see why not. Frank Absolutely. As long as you have bell fibeTV, you can use the web login from anywhere in canada. Marc Palumbo I believe the device limit is set to 4. So you can be burning 1 right there. Tim You can, however some shows can only be watched when connected to the account holders Bell Fibe internet connection. KB2755 “Bell Fibe TV customers”. I assume you have to log in using myBell credentials and it would determine if you have a TV cable package. Mr Dog Ahh, seemed to good to be true 😛 Marc Palumbo Not even on Windows 10 or Xbox One… The Iceman Cometh Well Marc you’ll have to wait for that. PS4 the same… Marc Palumbo There’s a better chance of the Cubs winning the World Series… Oh wait. The Iceman Cometh Its coming but probably not till early next year. Marc Palumbo Good. I thought my joke was funny. Possibly deserves a deletion then. cat lion Anyway, meanwhile they did it! LoL Riley Freeman umm I am pretty sure you can watch tv from your browser. maybe i am thinking of certain channels Brad Fortin But this is a good sign. It means apps for other platforms are likely on their way. Marc Palumbo It’s weird because there are a lot of people that use Windows PCs for TV. technically, to cover XBox One and Windows 10, they can just work on a single UWP app. Hopefully, this is coming. Shelly Although not a dedicated app, using via browser on Windows 10 works surprisingly well. It would be better if Bell had a dedicated app, and if it worked on Xbox One clee666 Nice! Does that mean I can return my 2nd receiver? Frank I sure hope so. Because i really dont need to pay another $7 per month to use my additional TVs Alex damn, i’m surprised to see someone even have a PVR, let alone a second receiver, haha but agreed, my parents have 4 wireless receivers, but what i’m hoping is that the app will be easier to use… i dont like Bell’s UI Riley Freeman i recently got the bell 4k pvr and wireless receiver. that wireless box is a true piece of junk. been meaning to call bell to tell them to take that crap back. I will stick to my old coaxil box Alex hm, strange. i dont have that issue, they all work. but you might have a bad one. We also done have 4k… but wired > wireless always, for sure. sucks though. wireless is handy in general. The Iceman Cometh Your second receiver probably yes, but you can’t use this service without a Fibe PVR according to their requirements Riley Freeman this is very good news. Pause and rewind will be huge when it launches. Wish you could access recording though. Shelly I was thinking the same thing … Bell seems to hint at this on their website as one of the pages says access recordings “coming soon” J18 Only 4th Gen AppleTV though… Is that really necessary? What does the 4th Gen have that the 3rd does not? DonatelloNinjaTurtle An app store and somewhat relevant internal hardware? The A5 from the previous Apple TV is 5.5 years old… The Iceman Cometh Yes but one has to wonder if they couldn’t have put an App store on the 3rd generation as well? Frankly I still stick to my Nvidia Shield and Android TV and should the day come its available either for PS4 or XBOX then I’ll try it. DonatelloNinjaTurtle The 4th gen Apple TV was a significant upgrade and change in the underlying OS. Would have been nice for the 3rd gen to get an app store, but it’s much older and they should have stopped selling it once the new one became available. J18 I was so excited to read this, until I realized my 3rd Gen was useless. I think for someone looking to get a second FIbe receiver, buying the 4th Gen AppleTV is definitely a better option than 7$ a month. Brad Fortin Probably not. With iOS 10 (and likely tvOS) they dropped support for devices with the A5 chip (iPhone 4S, iPad 2, iPod touch 5th gen, and AppleTV 3rd gen). DonatelloNinjaTurtle Honestly, nice to see some TV provider offering this. But, it’s too bad that you still need to get the ‘whole home PVR’ hardware as well as use their internet connection for it to be possible. I know they don’t want to give up control, but it would be nice to be able to subscribe to their TV service through an app. iSkippy227 The Whole Home PVR is a standard feature of Fibe TV. So long as you’re using this in your own home, you’re set. Myself, looking forward to having three receivers now. DonatelloNinjaTurtle Yeah, a feature that’s forced on you as a $20/month rental. I guess I have too much hope in one day seeing the service disconnected by this junk hardware they push. mola2alex I think you can buy it outright DonatelloNinjaTurtle The point would be to not have to use Bell’s overly expensive junk hardware. Mitchell Leitman And still nothing for Windows or Xbox Shelly Not sure what you are talking about. I have FibeTV and use my Windows 10 desktop and laptop to watch live streams / manage my PVR all the time. +1 for Xbox, this would be useful ….. cat lion Shelly please can you answer to Mitchell question? I am interested too. Tks willy And now we no why they sued V media to stop them from steaming to the Roku…. What a scum bag outfit Bell is…. I’ll never ever go back to this junk. The Iceman Cometh Yeah about sums it up. That’s why I have limited business relationships with these scumbags Poda So when atv 5 is released (supports 4K) does that mean those couple of bell’s 4K chanels would be available in 4K ? That and Kodi, and would be perfect tv box… Lulzon Now, just need it on Roku. tresfou hmm what if i have fibeTV via Bell Aliant? Would i be able to use it then? The MyBell portal is different from the Bell Aliant Portal 🙁 windsorsean I’ve been using the app and must say I am impressed, which I do not say lightly when it comes to Bell (or TV providers in general). I am actually quite shocked that Bell would provide this, as it virtually eliminates the need for any extra Bell provided receivers which kills a revenue stream for them. Once they add the ability to access recorded content, who needs another Bell box? Honestly I would strongly recommend any Bell whole home PVR subscribers should grab an Apple TV 4 just for this alone, it is such a better experience than their own boxes! Now they just need to offer this as a standalone service that users without Bell service can subscribe to. mola2alex Need Chromecast support, I’m pretty sure that might be more popular than Apple tv Get Updates Sign-up for MobileSyrup news sent straight to your inbox Categories News Reviews Features Resources Contests Contact About Us Advertise Jobs Social Twitter Pinterest Facebook RSS Google+ Instagram YouTube Search Get Updates © 2016 MobileSyrup.com.

Let's hear it for data over audio Kotkin: Why Trump won Comment Apple has ignored a page of very recent history by introducing its "Touch Bar", Lenovo reminded us on Thursday. Last week Apple replaced physical hardware function keys on its new laptops with a touch sensitive OLED strip, the "Touch Bar". This isn't an original idea, and it has failed spectacularly when introduced to the market. Just two years ago Lenovo tried this with its second generation Yoga. Users hated it, and the change wasn't repeated for 2015. "We'd been having the same thoughts," Senior Technologist at Lenovo Graham Thomas told us. "People use those function keys for different things or not at all." The Optimus OLED keyboard made a big splash, introducing adaptive concept in 2006... then didn't appear for two years. Apple had actually filed for a patent for 2007. However, the feedback from users was negative. The tech seemed flaky. Lenovo restored the traditional physical Fn keys for the third generation of Yoga (we'll have a review shortly). "You have to listen to your customers," Thomas told us. Lenovo is promoting its clever Yoga Book – a surprisingly useful idea at an even more surprisingly consumer price. But listening isn't something that's in Apple's DNA. This week, the changes seem to have gone too far. The professional users who kept Apple going through its darkest days of the mid to late 1990s are feeling very abandoned. ® PS: Here's a blistering roundup of the launch of the so-called state-of-the-art Macs: Apple removed USB 3.0 ports from its laptops, snuffed out the popular Air line, and hiked prices.

In Q3, we welcomed 183,000 new postpaid wireless, Fibe TV and broadband Internet customers and continued to build our leadership in Canadian media, resulting in our strongest increase in service revenue this year alongside ongoing growth in earnings and cash flow. In fact, Q3 was the 44th consecutive quarter in which Bell delivered year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth,” said George Cope, President and CEO of BCE and Bell Canada. “Bell’s investment and innovation leadership accelerated further in Q3, with our 4G LTE wireless network again rated Canada’s fastest by independent analysts; Canada’s first trial of 5G mobile service with our partner Nokia at Bell’s Wireless Innovation Centre; Bell becoming the first Canadian TV service provider to offer television service on Apple TV with Fibe TV; Bell Media’s CraveTV welcoming its one millionth customer; the announcement of fibre and wireless network support for Winnipeg’s unique Innovation Alley and other locations across Manitoba as part of Bell’s billion-dollar investment plan for the province; and the acquisition of Q9 Networks, creating an all-Canadian competitor to the largest international data centre operators. Respectful of our company’s long legacy of leadership in technology and service innovation, the Bell team is committed to delivering the best networks and communications products the world has to offer to Canadians everywhere,” said Mr. Cope. Bell is focused on achieving a clear goal – to be recognized by customers as Canada’s leading communications company – through the execution of 6 Strategic Imperatives: Invest in Broadband Networks & Services, Accelerate Wireless, Leverage Wireline Momentum, Expand Media Leadership, Improve Customer Service, and Achieve a Competitive Cost Structure. “We performed well across the business in Q3, posting another sound quarter of service revenue, adjusted EBITDA and margin growth, driven by exceptional wireless postpaid subscriber and financial results, a ninth consecutive quarter of positive wireline adjusted EBITDA growth, and a strong contribution to free cash flow from Bell Media,” said Glen LeBlanc, Chief Financial Officer of BCE and Bell Canada. “With a focus on profitable subscriber growth, we continued to leverage our advanced broadband networks and services to deliver strong wireless and residential wireline net customer additions in a financially disciplined manner, providing the foundation for sustained financial performance going forward. With strong year-to-date results, our 2016 financial plan remains on track as we today reconfirm all our guidance targets for the year.” BCE RESULTS BCE operating revenue in Q3 was up 1.2% to $5,407 million. Led by year-over-year increases at Bell Wireless and Bell Media and with higher residential Internet and TV revenues, total service revenue grew 1.8% to $5,024 million. Product revenue decreased 7.0% to$383 million due to aggressive competitor promotional wireless device discounting and reduced wireline data product sales to large business customers. Net earnings and net earnings attributable to common shareholders totalled $800 million and $752 million, up 1.1% and 1.8% respectively from $791 million and $739 million last year. These year-over-year increases were due to growth in operating revenue that drove higher adjusted EBITDA and lower severance, acquisition and other costs, partly offset by higher other expense. Despite increased net earnings attributable to common shareholders, net earnings per share (EPS) in Q3 was unchanged at $0.87year over year due to the higher average number of BCE common shares outstanding, mainly the result of a $863 million bought deal offering in December 2015. Excluding the impact of severance, acquisition and other costs, net gains or losses on investments, and early debt redemption costs, adjusted net earnings declined 0.8% to $784 million or $0.91 per common share, compared to $790 million or $0.93 per common share in Q3 2015. BCE’s adjusted EBITDA grew 2.2% to $2,236 million as a result of increases of 5.0% at Bell Wireless, 0.6% at Bell Wireline and 2.2% at Bell Media. This drove a 0.5 percentage-point improvement in consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin(2) to 41.4% from 40.9% in Q3 2015, reflecting continued strong wireless service revenue flow-through, steadily increasing Internet and IPTV scale that is driving growth in overall household revenue, lower total wireline operating costs, and improved business performance. BCE continued its strategic investments in broadband wireline and wireless infrastructure with capital expenditures of $976 million in Q3, an increase of 5.3% over last year. This result is consistent with our higher planned spending for 2016 and represented a capital intensity(4) ratio (capital expenditures as a percentage of total revenue) of 18.1%, compared to 17.3% in Q3 2015. Capital investment in the quarter was focused on expanding broadband fibre directly to more homes and businesses, including the buildout of Gigabit Fibe infrastructure in Toronto and other urban locations; continued investment in Bell’s leading 4G LTE and LTE Advanced (LTE-A) networks; and increased wireless and Internet network capacity to support subscriber growth and accelerating data usage. BCE cash flows from operating activities increased 3.5% in Q3 to $1,943 million, compared to $1,878 million last year, due to higher adjusted EBITDA and a positive change in working capital, partly offset by higher cash taxes paid. Free cash flow generated this quarter was $951 million, or 3.3% higher than last year, driven by an increase in cash flows from operating activities that was partly offset by higher capital expenditures. BCE gained 107,265 net new wireless postpaid customers and reported a net loss of 7,009 prepaid subscribers; 36,253 net new Fibe TV customers and a net loss of 40,976 satellite TV customers; and the addition of 39,375 new high-speed Internet customers. NAS line net losses totalled 118,321. At September 30, 2016, BCE served a total of 8,380,949 wireless customers, up 2.4% year over year (including 7,578,334 postpaid customers, an increase of 4.0%); total TV subscribers of 2,745,873, up 1.7% (including 1,302,039 Fibe TV customers, an increase of 17.4%); total high-speed Internet subscribers of 3,458,160, up 2.5%; and total NAS lines of 6,358,362, a decrease of 6.4%. CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS Fibe TV on Apple TV Bell today became the first Canadian TV service provider to offer television service on Apple TV. Currently available in Ontario and Québec, Fibe TV on Apple TV gives you access to up to 450 channels live or on demand and unique Fibe features like top trending shows, with recordings and pause and rewind live TV coming later this year. Apple TV 4th generation 32 GB is now available at Bell stores in both provinces and through 310-BELL and Bell.ca. CraveTV subscribers top 1 million Bell Media’s TV streaming video service CraveTV welcomed its one millionth customer in Q3. Featuring both original Canadian content and programming from the world’s leading names in television entertainment such as HBO and SHOWTIME, CraveTV has grown quickly since its launch in November 2014 and expanded availability to all Canadians with an Internet account earlier this year. In October, Bell Media announced that CraveTV is now available for in-app purchase on Apple TV, enabling customers to subscribe directly from their iTunes account; a new deal with MGM to license the Iconic James Bond Catalogue, spanning more than 50 years and every 007 actor; and, for the first time ever, that both new and returning SHOWTIME programs will debut on CraveTV at the same time as their US broadcast premieres, including returning series The Affair, Billions, Dice, Episodes, and Ray Donovan and new series Twin Peaks, I’m Dying Up Here, and Guerilla. Bell LTE again ranked as Canada’s fastest mobile network Bell Mobility’s LTE wireless network was again ranked as Canada’s fastest by 2 independent analysts this summer: PCMag, which found that Bell’s wireless network was #1 nationally and faster in more cities than any other competitor and called Bell LTE “truly a world-class 4G experience,” and twice as fast as the top-ranked US wireless carrier; and Speedtest by Ookla, which determined that Bell LTE delivered the fastest mobile data download speeds of any provider across Canada, nearly twice as fast in Toronto as the overall carrier average. On July 29, Bell and partner Nokia conducted the first trials of 5G mobile technology in Canada. Expected to be widely available within 5 to 7 years, 5G will provide enhanced data speeds and capacity to support broadcast video and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Bell fibre to the home leads in CRTC speed tests An Internet performance report commissioned by the CRTC and released in September found that Bell’s fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) Fibe Internet service exceeds advertised download speeds by a greater margin than any of the many Internet providers tested across Canada and offers the lowest levels of latency and packet loss. Based on data collected by an international broadband measurement company from more than 3,000 Canadian Internet users, the report was the second released by the CRTC in 2016 that highlights the outstanding performance of FTTH broadband networks like Bell Fibe versus connections offered by cable companies. In Q3, Bell completed deployment of its FTTH Fibe service in Trois-Rivières, Shawinigan and other locations, part of a planned $1 billioninvestment in 2016 to bring FTTH and Fibe Gigabit Internet to a total of approximately 3 million homes and businesses in Atlantic Canada, Ontario and Québec by the end of the year. Bell MTS infrastructure announcements BCE’s proposed acquisition of Manitoba Telecom Services Inc. (MTS) continues to move forward as the regulatory review process progresses with the Competition Bureau, ISED and the CRTC, following shareholder and court approval of the transaction in Q2. The two companies announced several Bell MTS communications infrastructure projects in Q3 as part of Bell’s plan to invest $1 billion over 5 years following the closing of the transaction, expected at the end of 2016 or early 2017. This includes expansion of Gigabit Fibe Internet, Fibe TV and broadband wireless to Churchill, the northern Manitoba port and ecotourism centre known as the Polar Bear Capital of the World; sponsorship of Winnipeg’s downtown “Innovation Alley” hub for innovators, entrepreneurs, students and artists, including Fibe and LTE-Advanced services; and the expansion of mobile and wireline broadband services in northern Manitoba, including in Thompson, Flin Flon and 5 indigenous communities and along the Highway 6 corridor. Bell and MTS earlier announced plans for continuous broadband wireless coverage along Highway 75 in southern Manitoba to the US border. Bell Media launches iHeartRadio in Canada On October 10, Bell Media launched North America’s fastest growing digital audio service, iHeartRadio, providing Canadians with access to all of Bell Media’s 105 radio stations across the country plus more than 100 additional exclusive, digital streaming channels featuring every musical genre as well as news, talk, sports and comedy. With the free iHeartRadio Canada app, users can listen to their favourite music and radio programs on iOS and Android devices, on the web at iHeartRadio.ca, or in their vehicles using Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Embedded apps for smart TVs and gaming consoles will also be available soon. Acquisition of Q9 Networks On August 8, BCE announced that it would acquire all the equity it did not already own in Toronto-based data centre operator Q9 Networks Inc. to enhance its competitiveness with domestic and international data services providers. Canada’s leading data centre operator, Bell provides business and government customers across the country with a range of data hosting and cloud solutions. Q9 was acquired in October 2012 by an investor group comprised of BCE, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Providence Equity Partners and funds managed by Madison Dearborn Partners. BCE held a 35.4% stake in Q9 and acquired the remaining equity in the company from its partners in a transaction valued at approximately $680 million, including Q9 debt, which closed October 3. New $1.5 billion public debt offering Bell Canada completed a public offering on August 12 of $1.5 billion of medium term notes (MTN) debentures: the $850 million Series M-42 MTN debentures, maturing on October 1, 2021 with an annual interest rate of 2.00%, and the $650 million Series M-43 MTN debentures, maturing on August 12, 2026 with an annual interest rate of 2.90%. Both fully guaranteed by BCE, these series represent the lowest coupon rates ever achieved by Bell, reducing our after-tax cost of outstanding public debenture debt to 3.33%. BCE OPERATING RESULTS BY SEGMENT Bell Wireless Bell Wireless delivered another exceptional quarter of financial results with Q3 operating revenues up 4.3% to $1,848 million from$1,772 million in Q3 2015. Service revenues increased 5.7% to $1,711 million, reflecting a larger postpaid subscriber base and strong growth in blended ARPU(4). Product revenues decreased 11.2% to $127 million due to lower average handset pricing, the result of seasonally high levels of competitive promotional market activity and fewer customer upgrades this year. Wireless adjusted EBITDA grew 5.0% to $796 million, from $758 million in Q3 2015, yielding a service revenue margin of 46.5%. This was achieved even with a $47 million year-over-year increase in total combined retention spending and subscriber acquisition costs, which contributed to operating cost growth of 3.7% this quarter. Postpaid gross additions totalled 381,630, up 7.9% over Q3 2015, reflecting Bell’s continued leadership in mobile network speed, the launch of high-profile new devices and strong sales execution. Postpaid net additions were up 38.1% to 107,265 from 77,655 in Q3 2015. This represents our best Q3 result since 2012, the result of higher gross additions and lower customer churn(4) compared to last year. Postpaid subscriber churn improved 0.05 percentage points to 1.26%, due to greater market activity last year as a result of the double cohort as well as the operational benefits of our ongoing investments in network quality, customer retention and service improvement. Bell Wireless postpaid customers totalled 7,578,334 at September 30, 2016, a 4.0% increase over last year. Total Bell Wireless customers grew 2.4% to 8,380,949. The percentage of postpaid subscribers with smartphones increased to 82% from 78% at Q3 last year, while the proportion of postpaid subscribers on LTE reached 78%, up from 63%. Blended ARPU increased 3.7% to $67.76, driven by a higher percentage of customers on 2-year plans, a greater mix of postpaid smartphone subscribers in the total subscriber base, and increased data usage on our 4G LTE and LTE-A mobile networks. Cost of acquisition (COA)(4) was up 2.9% to $459 per subscriber, reflecting a higher sales mix of premium smartphones, more postpaid gross additions compared to last year, higher handset prices due to a weak Canadian dollar, and increased marketing costs related to Olympics advertising. Retention spending increased to 12.7% of wireless service revenues from 11.7% in Q3 2015, despite fewer customer device upgrades compared to last year. This resulted from a higher sales mix of premium smartphone handsets and increased promotional market activity. Bell’s leading lineup of wireless devices expanded with the introduction of several new 4G LTE devices from leading handset manufacturers, including the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus from Apple, the Samsung Galaxy J3, the BlackBerry DTEK50, Alcatel’s Idol 4 smartphone and POP 7 tablet, and Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL. Bell Wireline Wireline service revenue decreased 0.3% to $2,747 million in Q3, a significant improvement compared to declines of 1.8% last quarter and 0.6% in Q3 2015, reflecting positive residential services revenue growth together with improved business and wholesale performance this quarter. Lower-margin product revenue was down 4.9% to $258 million, contributing to a 0.8% decrease in total Bell Wireline operating revenue of $3,005 million. Overall revenue performance in Q3 was impacted by the sale of a call centre subsidiary in September 2015, acquisition and retention discounts on residential services driven by aggressive competitor back-to-school promotional offers, and slow general economic growth and competitive pricing pressures that continued to moderate business demand for core connectivity services and data products. Excluding the revenue loss from the call centre sale, residential services revenue increased approximately 1% over last year, driven by a strong 6.1% increase in total Internet and TV revenues. Bell Wireline generated positive adjusted EBITDA growth for a ninth consecutive quarter in Q3, increasing 0.6% to $1,253 million. This yielded a 0.6 percentage-point improvement in margin to an industry-best 41.7%, driven by a 1.7% reduction in operating costs over last year from ongoing spending controls, fibre-related savings and continued service improvement. High-speed Internet net additions totalled 39,375, down from 57,888 last year. Despite a record quarter of customer activations in our FTTH footprint, total Internet net additions decreased year over year due to fewer wholesale subscriber net additions and higher deactivations reflecting aggressive student bundle offers from cable competitors. BCE’s high-speed Internet customer base totalled 3,458,160 at the end of Q3, up 2.5% compared to Q3 2015. Bell TV added 36,253 net new IPTV customers, compared to 67,908 in Q3 2015, which reflects minimal new footprint expansion and the increasing maturity of established Fibe TV markets, fewer satellite TV customer migrations, and acquisition and bundle offers that were generally less aggressive than last year. At the end of Q3 2016, BCE served 1,302,039 IPTV subscribers, up 17.4% over Q3 last year. Satellite TV net customer losses improved 2.4% to 40,976 compared to last year. The total number of Bell TV subscribers increased 1.7% to 2,745,873 at the end of Q3. Wireline data revenue increased 3.6% to $1,833 million, driven by combined Internet and TV revenue growth of 5.9%, higher IP broadband connectivity revenue, and an increase in business service solutions. This was moderated by lower data product sales to enterprise business customers due to the soft economy and ongoing decline in legacy data services as business customers migrate to IP-based services and reduce overall communications spending. Residential NAS net losses increased 2.8% to 80,587, from 78,354 in Q3 2015, due to reduced pull-through from fewer year-over-year Fibe TV activations and steadily increasing wireless and Internet-based technology substitution for local services. Business NAS net losses increased 27.0% to 37,734, from 29,722 last year, reflecting a greater number of deactivations attributable to increased business voice line conversions to IP-based services and higher demand for access lines in Q3 2015 due to the federal election. Total NAS access lines at the end of Q3 2016 totalled 6,358,362, representing a 6.4% year-over-year decline. Local and access revenue decreased 6.4% to $766 million while long distance revenue fell 8.7% to $189 million, mainly the result of continued reductions in NAS access lines. Bell Media Media revenue grew 3.5% to $716 million, up from $692 million in Q3 2015, due to higher subscriber revenues compared to last year. Strong subscriber revenue growth was driven by the national expansion of The Movie Network (TMN) in March and continued growth in CraveTV and TV Everywhere GO products. Advertising revenue in Q3 for conventional and specialty TV declined compared to last year due to a continuing soft advertising market that saw a shift in spending to the main broadcaster of the Rio 2016 Olympics and the non-recurrence of revenue generated in Q3 2015 from the federal election. Radio advertising also decreased, mainly as a result of a weaker economy in western Canada and a general decline in audience levels. Growth in outdoor advertising at Astral Out of Home from acquisitions and new contract wins in 2016 moderated the decline in total advertising revenues this quarter. Media adjusted EBITDA increased 2.2% to $187 million, from $183 million last year, on higher revenues and workforce restructuring savings that moderated overall operating cost growth this quarter. Media operating costs increased 3.9% to $529 million due to higher costs for sports broadcast rights, new sports programming, and the continued ramp-up in CraveTV content. CTV ended the summer season as the most-watched television network among total viewers with 11 of the top 20 programs, more than all other Canadian networks combined. CTV also aired 3 of the top 5 programs during Fall Premiere Week. Bell Media’s specialty and pay TV properties reached 84% of Canadian English specialty and pay TV viewers in the average week in Q3 and broadcast 14 of the top 20 programs among key adult viewers aged 18 to 49 and 25 to 54. Discovery was the top entertainment specialty station in primetime with viewers aged 25 to 54, while TMN, Space, Comedy and Bravo all ranked in the top 10. Bell Media maintained its leadership position in Québec’s French-language market with specialty TV reaching 76% of the French-speaking population in the average week. Half of the top 10 specialty channels in Québec are Bell Media properties. Bell Media continued to lead the Canadian digital landscape in Q3 with monthly unique visitors totalling 18.3 million, average monthly time spent of 778 million minutes, and 25.9 million average monthly videos served. Bell Media remained Canada’s top radio broadcaster in Q3, reaching 16.9 million listeners who spent 80 million hours tuned in each week. Astral Out of Home now offers more than 30,000 advertising faces nationally and a presence in 6 Canadian airports, including Toronto Pearson. COMMON SHARE DIVIDEND BCE’s Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.6825 per common share, payable on January 15, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 15, 2016. OUTLOOK FOR 2016 BCE confirmed its financial guidance targets for 2016, as provided on February 4, 2016, as follows:   February 4 Guidance November 3 Guidance Revenue growth 1% – 3% On track Adjusted EBITDA growth 2% – 4% On track Capital intensity approx. 17% On track Adjusted EPS $3.45 – $3.55 On track Free cash flow growth approx. 4% – 12% On track Annualized common dividend per share $2.73 $2.73 Dividend payout(4)  65% – 75% of free cash flow On track     NOTES The information contained in this news release is unaudited. (1)  The terms adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS. Therefore, they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. We define adjusted net earnings as net earnings attributable to common shareholders before severance, acquisition and other costs, net (gains) losses on investments, and early debt redemption costs. We define adjusted EPS as adjusted net earnings per BCE common share. We use adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS, and we believe that certain investors and analysts use these measures, among other ones, to assess the performance of our businesses without the effects of severance, acquisition and other costs, net (gains) losses on investments, and early debt redemption costs, net of tax and non-controlling interest. We exclude these items because they affect the comparability of our financial results and could potentially distort the analysis of trends in business performance. Excluding these items does not imply they are non-recurring. The most comparable IFRS financial measures are net earnings attributable to common shareholders and EPS. The following table is a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to common shareholders and EPS to adjusted net earnings on a consolidated basis and per BCE common share (adjusted EPS), respectively.   ($ millions except per share amounts) Q3 2016 Q3 2015 TOTAL PER SHARE TOTAL PER SHARE Net earnings attributable to common shareholders 752 0.87 739 0.87 Severance, acquisition and other costs 20 0.03 35 0.05 Net losses on investments 12 0.01 16 0.01 Adjusted net earnings 784 0.91 790 0.93   (2)  The terms adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS. Therefore, they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. We define adjusted EBITDA as operating revenues less operating costs, as shown in BCE’s consolidated income statements. Adjusted EBITDA for BCE’s segments is the same as segment profit as reported in Note 4 to BCE’s Q3 2016 Financial Statements. We define adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA divided by operating revenues. We use adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to evaluate the performance of our businesses as they reflect their ongoing profitability. We believe that certain investors and analysts use adjusted EBITDA to measure a company’s ability to service debt and to meet other payment obligations or as a common measurement to value companies in the telecommunications industry. We believe that certain investors and analysts also use adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to evaluate the performance of our businesses. Adjusted EBITDA is also one component in the determination of short-term incentive compensation for all management employees. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin have no directly comparable IFRS financial measure. Alternatively, the following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted EBITDA.   ($ millions) Q3 2016 Q3 2015 Net earnings 800 791 Severance, acquisition and other costs 25 46 Depreciation 706 727 Amortization 161 133 Finance costs Interest expense 227 227 Interest on post-employment benefit obligations 20 27 Other (expense) income 13 (35) Income taxes 284 271 Adjusted EBITDA 2,236 2,187 BCE operating revenues 5,407 5,345 Adjusted EBITDA margin 41.4% 40.9%   (3)  The term free cash flow does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS. Therefore, it is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. We define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities, excluding acquisition and other costs paid (which include significant litigation costs) and voluntary pension funding, less capital expenditures, preferred share dividends and dividends paid by subsidiaries to non-controlling interest. We consider free cash flow to be an important indicator of the financial strength and performance of our businesses because it shows how much cash is available to pay dividends, repay debt and reinvest in our company. We believe that certain investors and analysts use free cash flow to value a business and its underlying assets and to evaluate the financial strength and performance of our businesses. The most comparable IFRS financial measure is cash flows from operating activities. The following table is a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow on a consolidated basis.   ($ millions) Q3 2016 Q3 2015 Cash flows from operating activities 1,943 1,878 Capital expenditures (976) (927) Cash dividends paid on preferred shares (34) (37) Cash dividends paid by subsidiaries to non-controlling interest (13) (26) Acquisition and other costs paid 31 33 Free cash flow 951 921   (4)  We use ARPU, churn, COA, capital intensity and dividend payout to measure the success of our strategic imperatives. These key performance indicators are not accounting measures and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. See section 8.2, Non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators (KPIs) in BCE’s Q3 2016 MD&A for a definition of such KPIs.   Material Assumptions A number of economic, market, operational and financial assumptions were made by BCE in preparing its forward-looking statements contained in this news release, including, but not limited to: Canadian Economic and Market Assumptions Slow economic growth, given the Bank of Canada’s most recent estimated growth in Canadian gross domestic product of 1.1% in 2016, down 20 basis points from an earlier estimate of 1.3% Sustained weak employment growth, as the overall level of business investment is expected to remain soft Interest rates to remain relatively stable for the remainder of 2016 after declining in the first half of the year Strengthened Canadian dollar since the beginning of the year to remain at or around near current levels. Further movements may be impacted by the degree of strength of the U.S. dollar, interest rates and changes in commodity prices. A sustained level of wireline and wireless competition in both consumer and business markets Higher but slowing wireless industry penetration and smartphone adoption Wireless industry pricing discipline maintained Soft advertising market expected due to variable demand, and escalating costs to secure TV programming Assumptions Concerning our Bell Wireless Segment Maintain our market share of incumbent wireless postpaid subscriber activations Continued adoption of smartphone devices, tablets and data applications, as well as the introduction of more 4G LTE devices and new data services Earlier expiries under two-year contracts compared to three-year contracts, leading to an increase in the number of subscribers who are eligible for upgrades Higher subscriber acquisition and retention spending, driven by higher handset costs and more customer device upgrades, reflecting a higher number of off-contract subscribers due to earlier expiries under two-year contracts Higher blended ARPU, driven by a higher postpaid smartphone mix, increased data consumption on 4G LTE and LTE-A networks, and higher access rates from price increases Completion of the LTE network buildout to 98% of the Canadian population and expansion of the LTE-A network coverage to over 70% of the Canadian population Ability to monetize increasing data usage and customer subscriptions to new data services Ongoing technological improvements by handset manufacturers and from faster data network speeds that allow customers to optimize the use of our services No material financial, operational or competitive consequences of changes in regulations affecting our wireless business Assumptions Concerning our Bell Wireline Segment Positive full-year adjusted EBITDA growth Positive full-year 2016 residential TV and Internet net customer additions Increasing wireless and Internet-based technological substitution Residential services household ARPU growth from increased penetration of multi-product households, promotion expiries and price increases Aggressive residential service bundle offers from cable TV competitors in our local wireline areas Continued large business customer migration to IP-based systems Ongoing competitive repricing pressures in our business and wholesale markets Continued competitive intensity in our small and mid-sized business markets as cable operators and other telecom competitors continue to intensify their focus on business customers Growing consumption of OTT TV services and on-demand streaming video, projected growth in TV Everywhere services, as well as the proliferation of devices, such as tablets, that consume vast quantities of bandwidth, will require considerable ongoing capital investment Limited downsizing of current TV packages by customers as a result of the implementation of TV unbundling Realization of cost savings related to management workforce attrition and retirements, lower contracted rates from our suppliers and reduction of traffic that is not on our network No material financial, operational or competitive consequences of changes in regulations affecting our wireline business Assumptions Concerning our Bell Media Segment Positive full-year adjusted EBITDA growth driven by the national expansion of our TMN pay TV service, labour savings from workforce reductions in 2015, and CraveTV subscriber growth, more than offsetting higher TV programming and sports rights costs, continued CraveTV investment and the financial impact of TV unbundling Continued scaling of CraveTV, including a successful direct-to-consumer launch Ability to successfully acquire highly rated programming and differentiated content Building and maintaining strategic supply arrangements for content on all four screens TV unbundling and growth in OTT viewing expected to result in moderately lower subscriber levels for many Bell Media TV properties No material financial, operational or competitive consequences of changes in regulations affecting our media business Financial Assumptions Concerning BCE The following constitute BCE’s principal financial assumptions for 2016: total post-employment benefit plans cost to be approximately $300 million to $350 million, based on an estimated accounting discount rate of 4.2%, comprised of an estimated above adjusted EBITDA post-employment benefit plans service cost of approximately $230 million to $270 million and an estimated below adjusted EBITDA net post-employment benefit plans financing cost of approximately $70 million to $80 million depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $3,525 million to $3,575 million net interest expense of approximately $875 million to $925 million tax adjustments (per share) of approximately $0.05 an effective tax rate of approximately 26% non-controlling interest (NCI) of approximately $40 million to $60 million total pension plan cash funding of approximately $400 million to $450 million cash taxes of approximately $675 million to $725 million net interest payments of approximately $875 million to $925 million other free cash flow items, which include working capital changes, severance and other costs paid, preferred share dividends and NCI paid, of approximately ($50) million to $25 million average BCE common shares outstanding of approximately 870 million an annual common share dividend of $2.73 per share The foregoing assumptions, although considered reasonable by BCE on November 3, 2016, may prove to be inaccurate.

Apple iPhone tech helps reinvent the hearing aid 0 Share: Mobile by Shara Tibken November 3, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @sharatibken Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech Enlarge Image David Grissam's Made for iPhone hearing aids have made it possible to continue in his job as a 911 dispatcher. Photo by David Grissam This is part of CNET's "Tech Enabled" series about the role technology plays in helping the disability community. David Grissam was worried he'd have to quit his job. Grissam had steadily been losing his hearing, which was a serious problem for the 911 dispatcher based in Norman, Oklahoma. It had gotten to the point where normal hearing aids didn't work anymore. But then Grissam -- who has been legally deaf since the age of six -- got the Cochlear Baha 5 Sound Processor, a hearing device that's implanted in his skull. Connecting the Baha to his iPhone via Bluetooth lets the 44-year-old stream emergency calls directly to his ears, cutting out background noise and giving him crystal-clear sound. "With me missing the audio coming in, I was really concerned I was going to miss one of my friends screaming for help because he was shot," Grissam said. But now, "I'm able to hear more than others in the room because of that direct link." The Baha is one of a crop of hearing devices that follow Apple's "Made for iPhone" program, which employ Bluetooth and a special protocol technology from Apple to better connect to iPhones and iPads. That lets users stream audio directly to their ears, much as you would with regular wireless Bluetooth headphones such as Apple's AirPods. Users pair one of 44 compatible, audiologist-issued hearing aids with their iPhones, allowing them to take phone calls or listen to apps like YouTube or Pandora. For people like Grissam, these hearing aids are the difference between adequately doing a job and not. Grissam certainly isn't alone. More than 360 million people, or about 5 percent of the world's population, have disabling hearing loss, according to the World Health Organization. In the US alone, one in six Americans experience hearing issues, but about 80 percent do nothing about it, according to hearing aid maker Starkey. As the US baby boomer population ages, hearing loss will become an even bigger issue in the country. The Made for iPhone-compatible hearing aids cut out the need for intermediary devices called streamers that connect hearing aids to phones. And it makes the use of hearing aids less obvious, helping remove the social stigma associated with them. "When people think about hearing technology, they don't think about small and stylish and wireless and superhigh quality audio," said Chris McCormick, Starkey's marketing chief. "When they hear about this tech, they say, 'I wish I'd done this five years ago.'" Crystal clear Apple's push into making its devices more accessible to the hearing impaired began with 2013's launch of iOS 7, which also introduced the Made for iPhone hearing aid program. They started working with 2011's iPhone 4S, 2012's fourth-generation iPad and 2013's fifth-generation iPod. Users can also control their hearing aids through an Apple Watch connected to an iPhone. It's part of a broader initiative by Apple, which kicked off last week's MacBook Pro event with a video on accessibility and the launch of a new site dedicated to the issue. Apple's Made for iPhone technology lets people control hearing aids through an iOS device. Photo by Apple "When we created the Made for iPhone hearing aid program, the key question was 'how do we improve the ability for someone with hearing loss to use an iOS device to do all the things everyone else does, from making phone calls to FaceTime to listening to music and watching movies?'" said Sarah Herrlinger, Apple's senior manager for global accessibility policy and initiatives. For now, audio streaming to hearing aids is something that works only with iPhones. Android device users can get alerts to their hearing aids or adjust the volume via their phones, but they can't stream sound directly to their ears. Google wouldn't say when its version would be available. "It is important for Google products to be universally accessible and useful, and we are working closely with our partners to add hearing aid support," the company said in a statement. A smarter hearing aid Along with streaming sound from an iOS device, users can track the battery life of a hearing aid on an iPhone. They can adjust settings and volume through the iPhone instead of tapping the hearing aid, making the process more discreet. Audiologists help program presets for different sound situations, like restaurants and concerts, and users can switch to the appropriate setting with a triple click on the iPhone home button. Geotagging automatically switches settings based on where the hearing aid users are. If someone walks into Starbucks, for instance, it will turn on the restaurant or coffee shop setting. There's also a "find my hearing aid" feature on the phone. Another capability of Made for iPhone hearing aids is Live Listen. This lets the iPhone act like a remote microphone so they can hear people on the other side of a crowded room or conference table -- wherever they place the iPhone. Some hearing aid companies like Starkey enable the microphone feature to record conversations. Win Whittaker, a 50-year-old mountain guide at Mt. Rainier National Park in Washington, got used to not hearing the students in his climbing school. They'd gather around him for important safety instructions, but he had trouble understanding what they asked him. "The questions were starting to get lost," he said. Win Whittaker uses Made for iPhone hearing aids in his work as a mountain guide. Photo by Win Whittaker Whittaker knew years of playing in a band had damaged his hearing, but he resisted getting hearing aids. The closest audiologist was a 90-minute drive away, and as a musician, he was picky about audio. Then he heard about Made for iPhone hearing aids. The next day, he called an audiologist for an appointment and got fitted for ReSound LiNX2 hearing aids. See also Seeing eye phone means independence Tech is the great equalizer Apple stresses accessibility with new site "They're not just hearing aids," Whittaker said. "I was like, 'Wow, this is cool.' If that had not come out...I definitely would have held off [on getting hearing aids]." When he's on a climb, Whittaker uses his Apple Watch to adjust his hearing aids to dampen the sound of wind while still hearing his client struggling 25 feet behind him. "I guide on Mt. Rainier, so I'm at 13,000 feet, dealing with 30 to 40 mph winds," he said. "That program is a life saver." Just like everyone else The hearing aids aren't perfect. Batteries drain quicker on Made for iPhone hearing aids than other models. Users can get frustrated when they want to do more tweaking of their hearing aids beyond what audiologists let them do, said Dr. Chelsea Jividen, an audiologist at the Callier Center for Communication Disorders at the University of Texas at Dallas. "They want to be able to adjust the things we're adjusting, which we've went through extensive training to [learn]," she said. Hearing aids typically aren't covered by insurance in the US, and cost $1,200 to $3,000 per ear. The Made for iPhone hearing aids typically land near the top of that price range because of the Bluetooth chip, Jividen said. Daymond John, an investor on the show "Shark Tank," wears Made for iPhone hearing aids. Photo by Daymond John Bluetooth chips also limit how small hearing aids can be. Starkey's smallest hearing aid line, for instance, can't fit the bigger processors. But with Bluetooth chips shrinking, the company plans a smaller version in January. The industry expects all hearing aids will eventually connect to mobile devices. "That will happen for sure," said Mats Dotevall, Cochlear's director of design and development. Bluetooth-connected hearing aids also can be too complicated for the elderly. People in their 70s and 80s are much less likely to have smartphones than younger hearing aid users. Just learning how to use a hearing aid can be complicated enough. But for anyone who has felt a stigma for having hearing aids, Made for iPhone takes that worry away. Daymond John, the 47-year-old co-founder of the FUBU clothing line and a judge on ABC's "Shark Tank" is one of those people. He realized about five years ago that he had hearing loss from a lifetime spent at loud concerts. John uses the Starkey Halo 2 hearing aids, especially at night when he wants to listen to music when falling asleep without bothering his fiancee or daughter. "I use them when I'm home all the time, because I have a 7-month-old," John said. "The last thing I want to do is wake her." John also uses the hearing aid recording feature to document meetings. In busy restaurants, he can focus on the person he's talking to and cut out the background noise. One time he doesn't wear the hearing aids is at work filming his show. "I don't wear them on purpose," John said. "I'm sitting in between [Mark] Cuban and Kevin O'Leary...The last thing I want to do is enhance those other sharks I'm sitting next to." 54 iPhone 7 up close: Better camera, water-resistant -- and no headphone jack Tags Tech Enabled Apple Mobile Audio iOS 7 Related Stories You can now get rewards for using Samsung Pay Apple Pay taps into charitable donations Facebook wants to help improve Messenger bots Newegg's Black Friday deals start November 21 Close   Discuss: Apple iPhone tech helps reinvent the hearing...

[x] Win a Gigabyte GTX 1070 G1 Gaming Bundle [x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: Peripherals News 7 Huawei Mate 9 smartphone released by Tarinder Sandhu on 3 November 2016, 13:31 Tags: Huawei Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadaqc Add to My Vault: Huawei may not be the first name you think of when considering premium smartphones yet the Chinese goliath is on a mission to muscle in on the territory currently occupied by Apple and Samsung. And goliath is no hyperbole when describing the company. Headquartered out of Shenzhen, China, Huawei employs over 170,000 people, is employee-owned - 99 per cent of the private company is in the hands of the workers - and has revenue of over $60bn last year, of which around 40 per cent emanates from the Consumer Business Group (CBG) in charge of smartphones and tablets. Huawei's main smartphone strength rests with dominating the Chinese market, with over 20 per cent market share. Total global smartphone shipments hit 108m last year and are projected to surpass 140m this year, and the company sees significant growth opportunity in the premium handset space and non-Chinese market. This strategy makes sense if it is to become closer to Samsung (321m) and Apple (231m) in the overall annual smartphone shipping stakes. A key thrust for gaining high-end market- and mind-share is in releasing premium smartphones that rival what's available from the two bigger players. Until yesterday, Huawei's flagship phone was the P9 Plus - a big-screen, dual-camera offering. This, arguably, is changing today with the announcement and full reveal of the Huawei Mate 9 at a press conference in Munich, Germany. We managed to get some hands-on time at a pre-event briefing in London last week. In common with the industry, there's very little to differentiate the incumbent Mate 8 and the new head honcho. The Mate 9, available in five colours, carries the familiar look and feel of its predecessor and is about the same size, coming in at 156.9mm tall, 78.9mm wide, 7.9mm thick, and 190g in weight. This puts it in the same league as the iPhone 7 Plus and just a bit bigger than the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Build quality is excellent on this phablet. The full-metal unibody construction is suitably premium, and while the back has no obvious texture to aid grippiness, it feels good, albeit naturally big, in your hand. That size is put to good use with a near-edge-to-edge display that measures 5.9in and packs in a full-HD display that uses IPS technology rather than AMOLED. The sample model's screen was bright and easy to read. Did we wish for a higher-resolution panel? Yes, though it would likely push the price up from the estimated off-contract £429 or so - Huawei has yet to reveal the cost. In fact, you wouldn't know this was the all-new Mate 9 on first glance and that may not be a bad thing as keeping brand identity seems to be taking on more importance. Huawei keeps the familiar 'drain' on the bottom, sitting on either side of the USB Type-C charging inlet, and it's a necessary evil in order to keep the handset cool under peak load. Moving around, the dual-SIM-supporting Mate 9 continues to have a regular headphone jack and an 8MP front snapper, albeit slightly improved over its predecessor. Inside, Huawei uses the same 4,000mAh battery as the Mate 8 and that should mean class-leading longevity when running everyday applications. On the back, the Mate 9 houses a Leica 20MP monochrome and 12MP RGB camera, 4x optical zoom, though it is not clear whether Huawei is using telephoto to achieve this. There's additional support for 4K video, as well. In concert with the new release, Huawei is incorporating a new iteration of its Emotion UI, now version 5.0, interface that sits on top of Android 7.0. And carrying on familial design, the fingerprint scanner is situated just underneath. Getting juice quickly back into the battery is now a selling feature; the Mate 8 charges by using a 9V/2A technology that provides full charge in 2.5 hours. Mate 9 adds to this by bundling a special voltage-sensing (5V/4.5A) charger capable of dynamically adjusting its voltage for, well, safety reasons - Galaxy Note 7 poke, anyone? The result of more watts into the phone? Huawei says users can enjoy a 'full day's' charge in 20 minutes while just 10 minutes provides enough juice for watching two HD movies. As standard, the Mate 9 shoehorns in 64GB of storage and is supported by 4GB of LP-DDR4 memory. A microSD slot remains a welcome addition for those that need on-device space. The biggest change, as you might imagine, comes under the hood. Last year's Kirin 950 system-on-chip (SoC), made by Huawei subsidiary HiSilicon, has been improved with the Kirin 960. A numerical increase doesn't sound like much of an enhancement, yet as a certain fruity company likes to say, the only thing that has changed is everything. Kirin 960 - the new brains The SoC is the one of the first to use a quad-core Cortex-A73 CPU from ARM. Designed specifically to offer better sustained performance than its predecessor whilst also adding a little more punch, the frugal nature of the most potent ARM CPU core to date should allow HiSilicon to repurpose precious TDP savings elsewhere. The Cortex-A73 is augmented by a quad-core Cortex-A53 in a big.LITTLE configuration. What's more, the Mate 9 adds a low-power companion chip, identified as i6 (based on ARM Cortex-M7) for low-power, always-on features such as GPS and, dare we say, Pokemon hunting. Another key driver of the Kirin 960's performance is with the very first implementation of ARM's all-new Mali-G71 graphics core. Using a brand-new, grounds-up architecture and offering 20 per cent higher efficiency and up to 40 per cent better performance density than the Mate 8's Mali-T880, the eight-core graphics chip, which fully supports the Vulkan API, appears to at least match the very best on offer elsewhere, though we will know more once we have a handset in-house. We asked Huawei executives why the reliance on ARM when HiSilicon owns an architectural license and can therefore design its own CPU cores for better performance. Apple, as you will know, has gone down the custom CPU route for years and now incorporates a modified GPU to its own specifications. Huawei was keen to point out that off-the-shelf ARM IP is good enough for the CPU and GPU, particularly with the latter using the innovative Bifrost architecture, so it made sense for the engineering team behind the Kirin 960 to focus more on the value-adds such as improved image signal processor (ISP) and super-fast storage by way of Universal Flash Storage (UFS 2.1), replacing long-used eMMC. Huawei said that the speed increase for UFS 2.1 will be most keenly felt when recording or moving 4K video around. Mobile phone SoCs destined for premium phones need high-quality modems as standard. Kirin 960 employs an in-house LTE modem boasting Cat 12 download and Cat 13 upload, meaning that, on paper at least, it is a good match for the best that Qualcomm and Samsung have to offer. Remember we spoke about the Mate 9's new cameras? The ISP contained within the Kirin 960 now has a built-in sensor to aggregate more depth information than ever before. The key advantage to this is that pictures can be refocused after they have been taken - a neat trick that comes by way of having more scene depth - and better low-light performance. Stressing the last point, Huawei had a demo where it favourably compared the low-light credentials of the Mate 9 to an iPhone 7 Plus camera. Speed, too, should be improved as all computation is done on the SoC itself. There's also improved audio from a Hi6403 chip as well as better security, ostensibly aimed at the Chinese market. And while ARM is the go-to partner for the CPU and GPU, Huawei uses a custom encoding/decoding engine for processing at up to 4K30. Overall specifications suggest that the Kirin 960 SoC houses a thoroughly modern collection of technologies that put it at least on a par with premium, available offerings from Qualcomm and Samsung. The goalposts may shift a mite with the release of their next-generation SoCs soon, yet we feel confident that Huawei has a solid proposition from both hardware and software with the Mate 9. Check back for the full device and SoC review soon.

They have similar sized parts of stores dedicated to their product line as Samsung do and upon a bit of casual fondling, some of them seem to be excellent pieces of hardware. One thing I will say though (and this isnt specific to Huawei) its impossible to get to grips with the different number of models of phone over here. Its seriously bonkers how many varients the different manufacurers bring out in these parts, we only see a fraction of them.

(Image: YouTube / Huawei Mobile Deutschland) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A MUNICH, Germany: Huawei Technologies took the wraps of a new premium phone on Thursday, adding a new artificial intelligence feature it hopes will help it close the gap with Apple and market leader Samsung, which is reeling from scrapping its flagship phone. The Mate 9 is aimed squarely at the top end of the US$400 billion global smartphone market, where professional users are looking for fast phones with long battery life. It includes a feature that enables the device to learn about the habits of its user and automatically put the most frequently used apps in easy reach - unlike, for example, Apple's iPhone, where icons that may occupy many screens apart from the start screen have to be manually ordered. "It learns how you use your phone," said Arne Herkelmann, Huawei's European head of handset portfolio and planning. The launch comes just three weeks after Samsung scrapped its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, dealing a huge blow to its reputation and outlook. With smartphone sales growth expected to slow in the coming years, device manufacturers are focusing on new ways to standout from the crowd. "Just the device is no longer enough," said Roberta Cozza,an analyst at research firm Gartner. "AI and voice control will be main features on smartphones in the coming years." Alphabet's Google last month launched the Pixel smartphone which has Google Assistant, the company's voice-activated artificial intelligence (AI) system and its answer to Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. In another AI push, Samsung said last month it would buy Viv, which is run by the co-creator of Apple's Siri and said it wanted to integrate the platform in its Galaxy smartphones and expand its voice-assistant services to home appliances and wearable technology devices. The Mate 9, introduced in Munich, is a 5.9-inch (15 cm)large-screen handset that boasts cameras with autofocus, directional microphones with noise cancellation and an improved user interface. The algorithm puts the user's favourite apps first, which makes the phones easier to use and also more energy-efficient. The phone's battery lasts for almost two days of heavy usage and can fully recharge in 90 minutes, Huawei said. Gartner expects smartphone sales to grow 4.5 per cent to 1.5 billion devices this year.

So here are a few things that you should buy this month, and something you might wanna hold off on according to AOL. BUY: Apple devices The latest Apple products rarely ever go on sale, but you can find really great deals on Apple devices, like the iPad or the Apple Watch, that are a generation old. Just don’t buy it from the Apple store. BUY: Wedding dresses Brides-to-be should get their wedding dresses now. The holidays are a great time for getting engaged and the wedding industry has taken note. Many bridal shops get new wedding dresses this month, but before they can move in the new gowns they have to get rid of the old ones by slashing prices-- sometimes up to 70 percent! BUY: Tools  Many people don’t think about home improvement around winter time and because of this, many tools and hardware will actually go on sale. Get the man in your life a nice tool set for a fraction of the original pricing now. That’s just one less thing to cross off your Christmas list. BUY: Kitchen appliances and cookware If you like hosting holiday parties, kitchen appliances and cookware will go on sale this month. Black Friday will have an abundance of sales on cookware from Keurigs, to juicers, to Crock Pots. Bigger appliances like refrigerators, washers and dryers will also be on sale. DON'T BUY:  Plane tickets Something to be weary about if you're wanting to save money is plane tickets. If you haven’t booked your flights home for the holidays yet, you’re more than likely out of luck. A good rule of thumb for traveling, according to CheapAir, is to book flights 1 - 4 months out...except for holiday travel. If you didn’t book your flight home for Thanksgiving or Christmas at the beginning of this year, you might have to pay a lot more for it now.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Wins Patent for a Video Headset System that Supports Touch Controls & Prescription Lenses | Main | Apple Granted 46 Patents Today Covering Apple Pay UI, a Flagship Apple Store Building and More » November 01, 2016 Apple Wins Surprising Patent for a Future Bendable or Foldable iPhone using Advanced Carbon Nanotube Structures   In July Patently Apple posted two reports regarding Samsung's obsession with bendable smartphones and/or foldable smartphones. Samsung has so many patents on this future direction for smartphones that our other IP site Patently Mobile created a dedicated archive covering all of their concepts. Apple's first patent regarding foldable smartphone form factors was discovered by Patently Apple in a European patent filing in 2013. We discovered a second patent filing in Europe regarding a foldable smartphone in 2014. Today we were surprised to find that Apple was granted their first patent covering a foldable and/or bendable future iPhone that was never published before as a patent application under Apple's name. Apple must have kept it secret by filing it under their engineer's names and not under Apple to avoid detection. As another example of this tactic, here's an Apple engineer who filed a patent under his own name and Apple isn't yet shown on the filing publicly. When filed like this, no one can do a search on Apple patents and find it. It stays 'hidden' on purpose until it's granted because at that point Apple has to take possession of it. In this patent, Apple reveals the possible use of carbon nanotubes to facilitate their new smartphone form factor.   Apple's patent FIG. 2 noted above is a perspective view of an illustrative electronic device such as a future iPhone that bends along a flexible portion such as a flexible seam associated with a hinge.   Apple notes in their granted patent that one of the materials that could be used in this foldable/bendable iPhone form factor is ceramic. The first time that Apple considered this material for a future iPhone was discovered and published in our September 2016 patent report titled "Revealing Apple Patent Covers Ceramic Apple Watch and All-New Ceramic iPhone."   Apple notes in today's granted patent that "Electronic devices may be provided with carbon nanotube structures or other structures based on carbon (e.g., graphene structures, carbon-fiber structures having carbon fibers other than carbon nanotubes, etc.). Configurations in which the carbon-based structures are carbon nanotube structures are sometimes described herein as an example.   Carbon nanotube structures may include single-wall carbon nanotubes, multiple-wall carbon nanotubes, or mixtures of single-wall and multiple-wall carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes can form conductive paths for printed circuits or other flexible substrates such as substrates associated with touch sensors and displays and can form structural components in an electronic device.   Conductive carbon nanotube paths can form signal paths that are flexible and resistant to cracking.   The carbon nanotube structures may be incorporated into signal cables such as flexible printed circuit cables, rigid printed circuit boards, printed circuits that include rigid portions with flexible tails (sometimes referred to as "rigid flex"), portions of display structures, portions of touch sensors such as capacitive touch sensor arrays for displays or track pads, camera structures, antenna structures, housing structures, internal device structures, electrical components, substrates, brackets, housing walls, other structures, or combinations of these structures.   To help prevent cracks in the signal lines traversing bent portions of a flexible substrate from disrupting signal flow, some or all of these signal lines may include carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotubes may be patterned to form carbon nanotube traces 62' as described in connection with FIGS. 11 and 12. Carbon nanotubes may also be combined with metal lines. Consider, as an example, the configuration of FIG. 17. As shown in FIG. 17, flexible substrate 182 may have a bend where flexible substrate 182 traverses angled edge 174 of support structure 180 between planar upper surface 176 of support structure 180 and planar side surface 178 of support structure 180. Flexible substrate 182 may be a carbon nanotube flexible printed circuit, a flexible substrate in a display, a flexible touch sensor substrate, or other suitable flexible structure. Flexible substrate 182 may have signal paths formed on a flexible polymer layer such as polymer layer 186 (e.g., a polyimide layer, etc.). A dielectric cover layer may cover the surface of substrate 182.        As shown in patent FIG. 17 above, flexible substrate #182 may have a bend where flexible substrate #182 traverses angled edge #174 of support structure #180 between planar upper surface #176 of the support structure and planar side surface #178 of the support structure. The flexible substrate may be a carbon nanotube flexible printed circuit, a flexible substrate in a display, a flexible touch sensor substrate, or other suitable flexible structure. The flexible substrate may have signal paths formed on a flexible polymer layer such as polymer layer #186 (e.g., a polyimide layer, etc.). A dielectric cover layer may cover the surface of the flexible substrate.   In the example of FIG. 17, carbon nanotubes #172 form a line segment that covers metal signal line #170 in a portion of the line that crosses over bent edge #174 of the support structure and the corresponding bend in flexible polymer layer. Configurations of the type shown in FIG. 17 may be used to allow signal lines to traverse a hinge or other flexible joint as illustrated in patent FIG. 2 above.   Apple's patent FIG. 9 is a diagram of illustrative equipment involved in forming carbon nanotube structures for an electronic device; FIG. 10 is a diagram of illustrative operations and equipment involved in forming carbon nanotube structures for a flexible substrate such as a flexible printed circuit.   Apple's granted patent 9,485,862 was filed in Q3 2014 and published today by the US Patent and Trademark Office.   Patently Apple presents only a brief summary of granted patents with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each Granted Patent is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any Granted Patent should be read in its entirety for full details. About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.   II just wanted to take a moment to thank the many Twitter fans who supported this report. Clarification to a few who are very confused: A flip phone folds vertically. A notebook folds horizontally. Apple's patent is not for a flip phone.           Posted by Jack Purcher on November 01, 2016 at 05:56 AM in 2.

Those working inside are aiming to make Siri talk more naturally, according to a source that knows a number of Apple’s Cambridge employees […] Apple’s Cambridge office is home to less than 30 people, including many of the employees from VocalIQ — a voice recognition startup that was spun out from the university and acquired by Apple in 2015. VocalIQ is a tool specifically geared to allowing truly conversational queries … With a British team, perhaps Siri will be honing its skills in speaking the Queen’s English, where we walk on the pavement and wear our pants inside our trousers … The team may be a relatively small one, but BI’s source says that there is plenty of room for expansion within the center. Apple has a number of satellite R&D centers around the world, including another one focused on Siri across the Atlantic in Boston. That, too, was likely aimed at attracting academic expertise, from MIT. There’s of course intense competition in the field of intelligent assistants. Google upped the ante considerably with the launch of Google Assistant on the Pixel, though Siri does seem to hold its own in head-to-head tests. Much of the original team responsible for the development of Siri have left Apple to work on their own next-generation IA, Viv. Its creators recently gave an impressive demonstration of Viv’s capabilities, since acquired by Samsung – which adds to the pressure on Apple to improve Siri.

Follow Michael Babad and Globe top business news on Twitter The new billionaire One of the new additions to the celebrated Forbes list of billionaires is Canadian Lawrence Stroll, who owns more Ferraris than I own ties, and the racetrack to go with them. Labourers work on scaffolding at a residential construction site in Hefei, Anhui province March 6, 2012. JIANAN YU/Reuters Market View Video: Why worry about China? Couple at outdoor bazaar, Curacao, Caribbean (c) Jupiterimages Let's Talk Investing Video: Saving too little and spending too much Mr. Stroll, 52, who also owns Circuit Mont-Tremblant in the Laurentians, ranks 719 on the Forbes list released today. Mexico's Carlos Slim Helu tops the list, at $69-billion, followed by the ever-present Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Bernard Arnault of LVMH and Spain's Armancio Ortega, also a fashion mogul. Forbes lists what it said is a record 1,226 this year, from 58 countries, compared to 1,210 last year. Together, their total worth is $4.6-trillion, or an average $3.7-billion, up a shade from last year's $4.5-trillion. Late last year, Mr. Stroll and his Hong Kong colleague, Silas Chou, took fashion house Michael Kors public, and its stock has since surged by more than 75 per cent. That increase brought their combined holdings to almost $3-billion (U.S.), putting them both on the list. Mr. Stroll's wealth is pegged by Forbes at $1.8-billion (U.S.), and he's currently living in Switzerland. Mr. Stroll, a father of two and late of Montreal, has partnered with Mr. Chou for some time. Together they backed Tommy Hilfiger, among other ventures, and he has a long history with brand names. Here's how the Official Ferrari Magazine described him: "Following in his father’s footsteps, this highly respected Canadian launched Polo Ralph Lauren in Europe in the ’80s, later became closely linked with Tommy Hilfiger, and eventually built a company with worldwide sales in excess of $2-billion. Today, Lawrence Stroll is involved in a new challenge as one of the principal investors backing the expansion of the Michael Kors brand, which has gone from strength to strength since Kors unveiled his first womenswear line in New York back in 1981." Mr. Stroll originally acquired the licence for Pierre Cardin kids' wear in Canada, and then struck a similar deal for Polo Ralph Lauren. He then took the latter across Europe. Through Sportswear Holdings Ltd., which Mr. Stroll co-founded, he acquired the Tommy Hilfiger operation along with Mr. Hilfiger and others, according to a corporate posting on Forbes. The company then gobbled up Asprey and Garrard, later selling it, and then got into Michael Kors Corp. in 2003, it said. A racing and car enthusiast, who owned 25 Ferraris at the time of the interview, he told the Official Ferrari Magazine: "When I use my cars I’m tough: I exploit her 100 per cent in her performance, and if we are at a race meeting, I act tough by taking risks. I don’t think of it as a museum piece or about the value of what I’m driving. If I go on a trip, it’s only sensible that I don’t start racing along the road, but if conditions and laws permit, I try to feel the sensations that a Ferrari can give you both on and off the track." Among those cars is the Ferrari 330 P4, which Mr. Stroll had dreamed of owning since he was a kid. I don't know a lot about sports cars, but I think he has some that are to die for. "Before the P4, a more realizable dream occurred in 1980: the Daytona Spider," Mr. Stroll told the magazine. "I bought it while I was living in Paris, so it had glamour with a European flavour. Immediately afterwards there was an opportunity to acquire a 1985 288 GTO. The idea of possessing a Ferrari with that legendary name, of which just 272 were built … what that actually did was reinforce the desire to own and drive another GTO: the 1962 original ... In 1995 I managed to crown the dream, and yes it really is a dream, of becoming the owner of a 1962 250 GTO. I researched the market for years and became friendly with an owner quite separately from any negotiations."

Apple Inc. , which dominates the market, unveiled a new version of its popular tablet today in San Francisco. The new version boasts four times the number of pixels on the iPad 2. There's also a new chip, 4G capability and other features. Maybe if I can't convince my wife, I can convince The Globe. The new iPad will take dictation and convert it to text. So I could speak this column, rather than type it. It will be available March 16. New tech in latest iPad, but an old name Market jitters ease Global markets are calmer today after yesterday's rout, but it could be the briefest of respites. Investors fled stocks yesterday on concerns over the economic outlook and the looming deadline for a crucial bond swap in Greece. The deadline for bondholders to agree to that exchange is tomorrow, so it's a fairly safe bet that at least some volatility in financial markets will pick up again. "It appears that even now there are some optimists to be found in global markets, as the bulls poke their heads nervously above the parapet," said sales trader Ben Critchley of IG Index. "However, the issues that prompted yesterday’s selloff remain unresolved, most notably the Greek debt swap, which has yet to be completed. The deadline for this is Thursday, which provides a degree of scope for further jitters until the actual result is known." As The Globe and Mail's Eric Reguly writes in today's Report on Business, several institutions that hold the bonds, part of a creditor steering committee, have agreed to sign on to the so-called private sector involvement, or PSI, that's part of Greece's grand plan to ease its debt crisis. But it's far from clear whether Athens will get the number it wants, and further, whether it will trigger what are known as collective action clauses, or CACs, that retroactively change the terms of its debt. Also unknown is whether such a move would be deemed a default that would in turn trigger insurance payouts. All of this comes in the run-up to a March 20 bond redemption. And Greece's finance minister is playing hardball. "Following on from Monday’s announcement that the 12 members of the IMF Greece creditor’s steering committee, including BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank, would be participating in the Greece debt swap, all the remaining Greek banks followed suit," said senior market analyst Michael Hewson of CMC Markets. "In a surprise development at least four Greek pension funds have refused to take part in the bond swap, after coming under pressure from workers unions, worried about the effect on the viability of their funds. They obviously didn’t get the memo from Finance Minister Venizelos about holdouts not getting paid out in full, and CAC’s being triggered whether investors agreed or not." These developments played into yesterday's market angst, though there's a more optimistic mood today. "Various institutions have been publicly announcing their intention to take part in the Greek PSI swap (overnight it was Allianz, Unicredit and Generali) and rumours of deadlines being extended are all but dead," said currency strategist Elsa Lignos of RBC in London. "So some of the more negative perceptions have been priced out overnight but we think risk appetite will struggle to break higher. There is little incentive to leak any good news about PSI participation ahead of time as it reduces the incentives for others to sign up, so if anything the risks on leaks are skewed to the downside." (Germany's outspoken Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble went to visit the pope today, along with what the Vatican Information Service called his "entourage." Well, a little prayer couldn't hurt.) Stocks rebound but Greek debt in spotlight Greek bond swap sees more takers Greece confident bond-swap deal will be accepted Follow our Market Blog Whither the markets Yesterday's downdraft on the markets ended, at least temporarily, a rally that had generally been running since mid-December, fuelled by central bank action and brighter economic readings. Where do things stand now? "The best clues are likely to come from volatility across asset classes," said senior currency strategist Camilla Sutton of Scotia Capital. "One of the most important themes in 2012, has been the collapse in volatility as G4 central banks have removed tail risk through aggressive and alternative policy," she said in a research note today. "The second is the outlook for global growth, which improved materially in the first months of 2012. The combination of these two drivers spurred a significant risk rally in the first two months of 2012. The easiest way to follow the market’s pricing of these two themes is likely through volatility and copper (with the latter being a good proxy for global growth). Shifts in either of these are likely to be the clues that the environment is changing and a more material end to the risk rally is upon us." Global worries spark stock selloff Scotiabank acquires U.S. firm Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia has struck a deal to acquire Howard Weil Inc., a U.S. investment boutique with a sole focus on energy. Scotiabank didn't say how much it's paying. The combined group will now have research coverage on more than 220 energy companies. The bank already has a strong energy investment banking business through its Scotia Waterous division, The Globe and Mail's Tim Kiladze writes. Howard Weil is based in New Orleans and Houston, and dates back to 1946. “Our overall equities strategy continues to focus on global growth initiatives where we have deep sector expertise or can leverage Scotiabank’s organizational and geographic presence,” managing director Patrick Burke said in a statement. Scotiabank to buy U.S. investment boutique Tim Kiladze's Streetwise: NFL's Peyton Manning released, but Scotiabank drafts his brother Strike threatened at Air Canada The biggest union at Air Canada is threatening to strike just as many Canadian kids head off for what's known as March Break. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents mechanics, baggage handlers, cargo agents and other at Canada's largest carrier, set a deadline of just past midnight next Monday, The Globe and Mail's Brent Jang reports. Air Canada said it would "endeavour to minimize inconvenience to its customers" if a labour deal isn't reached in time, and Labour Minister Lisa Raitt urged the airline and the union to settle their differences. Ottawa 'concerned' about strike threat at Air Canada: Raitt Brian Milner's Economy Lab: Memo to Lisa Raitt - Stay out of Air Canada's business Housing cools, still near global top Canada's housing market has lost its "prior exuberance," but still remains among the top global markets, Bank of Nova Scotia says. That's a good thing, Scotiabank's Adrienne Warren said in a new report today, citing the slowing in home prices over the past six months because of high prices, mortgage restrictions and fewer jobs being created. "We expect sales and prices will be relatively flat in the year ahead," Ms. Warren said in her report. "Even with interest rates forecast to remain low well into next year, public sector restraint and a lack of pent-up demand will temper both first-time and move-up buyer activity. Regionally, relatively stronger job and income gains and more positive demographic trends favour Western Canadian housing markets over those in Central and Eastern Canada." This is an "important step" in rebalancing market valuations, she added, as, for example, income catches up to prices. Ms. Warren also still sees no meltdown on the horizon. She tracked global trends to find that markets have come under "increasing stress," but Canada still ranks well. "Pricing conditions in the majority of markets in our survey deteriorated in the final quarter of 2011," she said. "Sovereign debt concerns, high unemployment, weak consumer confidence and, in some cases, excess supply and tight credit, continue to stifle demand and depress prices." Home ownership becoming more affordable Building permits slip Construction plans in Canada slipped in January, largely on a pullback from condo developers in Ontario, but these numbers are notoriously volatile and it's just a one-month reading. The value of building permits issued in January in Canada fell 12.3 per cent to $6-billion, Statistics Canada said today. That followed a hefty gain of more than 10 per cent in December. Where residential construction is concerned, permits fell 6.6 per cent, after three months of gains, and largely related to multifamily units, such as condominiums, in Ontario. Over all in Canada, permits for such developments sank 12.4 per cent in January, after surging almost 31 per cent in December. Ontario led the drop, followed by Alberta, while gains were led by British Columbia and Quebec. "However, even with January’s loss, the level of overall residential permits remains above levels seen in 2011, suggesting that the low-rate environment continues to support home-building," CIBC World Markets economist Emanuella Enenajor said of the overall showing. Building permits drop in January Garda beefs up advisory board Canada's Garda World Security Corp. is really into macho. Today it added retired U.S. Navy Admiral Eric Olson, whose nickname is Bullfrog from his SEAL days, to the international advisory board of its GardaWorld subsidiary. The board already boasts the likes of the former Permanent Secretary of Britain's Civil Service and Intelligence, Security and Resilience Cabinet Office, and the former Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Here's how Garda described its newest recruit: "Admiral Olson led the United States Special Operations Command for four years prior to his retirement from active service in September 2011. The first Navy SEAL to be promoted to three-star (2003) and four-star rank (2007), Admiral Olson’s career was one of both personal valour and visionary leadership. He is credited as the officer most responsible for developing the special operations capabilities that have been so prominently displayed in several of the most notable operations of recent years, including the capture of Saddam Hussein and the death of Osama bin Laden."

Thu, 11/03/2016 - 6:00am | Rich Warren Brand names once represented the gold standard. When you bought an RCA, Zenith or Sony TV you owned the best. So much so that Korea's LG bought Zenith hoping to ride its reputation in the U.S. But by the time it owned Zenith, the company's declining popularity turned into an albatross, and LG mostly discarded the brand. A similar fate awaited RCA as it went through a variety of owners. Sony barely makes all of its own TVs any longer. Even the new prestige brand, Samsung, tarnishes as its phones ignite. Which brings us to a recommendation and a listener email concerning brand names. Smartphones are ridiculously overpriced. You pay as much for prestige as performance when you buy an Apple or Samsung. Now Google joins the crowd by abandoning its high-performance fairly priced Nexus phones for its new expensive Pixel line that competes head-on with Apple and Samsung. Boycott these premium phones. Spending $650 or more on an easily breakable product that will be obsolete in two years defies common sense. The chips that constitute nearly all smartphones come from the same small group of manufacturers. A plethora of new second-tier Chinese phones (remember that Apple may be designed in the U.S. but is manufactured in China) offer 95 percent of the performance for a fraction of the price if you're willing to use the Android operating system. Consider brands such as OnePlus, ZTE, Oppo, Xiaomi, Huawei-Honor, and yes, venerable Motorola, which is now part of the Chinese company Lenovo. OnePlus developed a bit of a swelled head. It introduced its highly regarded OnePlus 3 at about $350 and it now sells for $550. All of the above brands trail the big-name leaders in technology and features by about six months. That's not a bad sacrifice for saving $200 or more. Google boasted the new Pixels are the first phones to incorporate its newest Nougat Android operating system along with Google Assistant and free cloud storage for all of your photos and videos. If those attributes motivate you, then spend the extra $300-$450 for a Pixel. Nougat will be coming to the rest of the Android universe come January (assuming your phone is advanced enough to work with it). Thus, our reader question: "Yesterday I went TV shopping, the 4K price is now within my reach, but they have something called SUHD which I'm told has a 10 bit board to enhance the colors instead of a 6 bit or 8 bit board. The comparison between the two was remarkable, but it was meant to be. Also, the Vizios seem to be less expensive than the Samsungs. I was told Vizio was a value product which I finally was able to discern meant that they were good quality products, but unlike Samsung did no R&D and waited to adopt the new technology. Therefore, the Vizios would be a year or two behind the Samsungs. So I left with my head spinning not knowing whether to get the 4K Vizio now or pay up for the 4K SUHD Samsung." First, SUHD is a Samsung marketing gimmick. There is no standard named SUHD. Second, you are correct concerning Vizio, which simply waits to adopt new technology and then inexpensively markets it. However, Vizio is only about nine months behind. Current 8-bit models display 16,777,216 colors, which believe it or not are fewer than discernible to the human eye. New 10-bit, also known as High Dynamic Range (HDR), enables virtually all the colors you can see. However, the biggest HDR improvement is contrast. Right now, there's very little video source material that takes advantage of 10-bit. Further, an 8-bit set can "fake" quasi-10-bit quality. In a year, most sets will be 10-bit. Go buy the Vizio and enjoy it now rather than waiting. Rich Warren, who lives in the Champaign area, is a longtime reviewer of consumer electronics. He can be emailed at hifiguy@mchsi.com.

In fact, the mother of rookie cornerback Eli Apple is doubling down on her condemnation of the franchise. Annie Apple skewered the Giants as a whole and co-owner John Mara in particular two weeks ago for the franchise's handling of the Josh Brown domestic violence saga. Annie Apple had more criticism for the Giants in her latest SI.com column that was posted on Wednesday. Giants' GM Jerry Reese refuses to discuss Josh Brown "I was livid with the Giants, not just because of John Mara's comments but I was disappointed in the organization because I felt they were leaning heavily on a 21-year-old kid in an effort to control what his mother says," Annie Apple wrote. "That's not fair." Annie Apple's initial criticism was centered on an interview Mara did with WFAN on Oct. 20 when he made a dumbfounding statement that Brown had "admitted to us he's abused his wife in the past, but what I think is a little unclear is the extent of that." A domestic violence survivor, Annie Apple responded by detailing her painful past in an SI.com column on Oct. 23. She also ripped Mara for his comments. "The comments made by John Mara, owner of the New York Giants, were insensitive, dismissive and callous," Annie Apple wrote. "How are you a so-called champion of domestic violence but lack basic compassion for a victim? Yes, this man signs my son's checks as I've been reminded on Twitter. Mr. Mara owns the New York Giants. He doesn't own Annie Apple. Wrong is wrong. And Mr. Mara's comments were unapologetically wrong and hit at a raw place." Such strong criticism put Eli Apple in an awkward position. The 21-year-old did his best to navigate the controversy without picking sides between his mother and his boss. "I know she's very vocal about that type of situation and that topic is very important to her, so I can understand where she was coming from," he said after the Giants' 17-10 win over the Rams in London on Oct. 23. "At the same time, I know in my position I've just got to understand that I've just got to do my part and just play football and do what I can do." Eli Apple said he didn't think his mother's criticisms would have any negative repercussions on him. "I don't think so at all," he said. "I think we're good on that front. I talked to them and let them know my mom's reactions sometimes are like that. She's her own person and she's going to do that. I have no control, so I've just got to do my job and that's just play football ... I just made sure I talked to everybody and let them know; whoever was concerned." Eli on mom's criticism Annie Apple traveled to London for the Rams game, but said she didn't attend because "I just couldn't cheer for a team I felt had turned its back on what was right to protect an image." "When Black Eli got drafted, everyone raved about what a great organization the Giants are," Annie Apple wrote. "I was proud. I wanted my then 20-year-old son to go to a team that would help him grow not just his talents, but as a man and person. I believed the hype. I even drank the sugar-free blueberry Kool-Aid. By Friday in London, I was spitting it up." The Giants declined to comment on Annie Apple's criticism. She said they have not contacted her to address her concerns. "Even after my gut-wrenching column, I have yet to hear from anyone from the Giants," Annie Apple wrote. "Boy, what a great opportunity to show heart, but nope. It's business as usual. I'm not mad.

 Apple has a secret Siri lab in Cambridge Sam Shead Nov. 3, 2016, 7:58 AM 3,004 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple's office at 90 Hills Road in Cambridge.Business Insider/Sam Shead Apple has a secret office in Cambridge where it's working on Siri, the company's AI-powered personal assistant, according to multiple sources. Walking around Cambridge, you'll be hard pushed to find many people outside the tech community who know that the world's most valuable company is developing one of its most important products in their city. But that's exactly what Apple is doing in an unmarked office at 90 Hills Road, located approximately five minutes walk from the city's train station. Those working inside are aiming to make Siri talk more naturally, according to a source that knows a number of Apple's Cambridge employees. Two employees of a local company in an office less than 100 metres away had no idea that Apple had an office in Cambridge. However, an employee of the Cambridge University Botanic Garden, which is located next to the building, confirmed that Apple is indeed the tenant. Interestingly, the office doesn't show up in the right place on Google Maps. It can, however, be found on Apple Maps. Apple Maps/Skitch Apple's Cambridge office is home to less than 30 people, including many of the employees from VocalIQ — a voice recognition startup that was spun out from the university and acquired by Apple in 2015 for up to $100 million (£80 million) — according to a source that's familiar with Apple's operations in the city. Apple has a lot of room to hire more people at the office, the source added. Last month, Blaise Thomson, the cofounder of VocalIQ, told Business Insider by email: "We're unfortunately not allowed to talk to the press." In terms of why Apple chose to locate itself at 90 Hills Road, the source said that the property market is "tight" in Cambridge so it was "one of limited choices." They added that the office's close proximity to the train station makes it "commutable" for those that live in London, which can be reached in less than an hour by train. Apple's only other known office in the UK is located just off Regent Street, in London. However, the company plans to move 1,400 employees into a new office in Battersea Power Station in 2021. Apple also employs over 5,000 people in Ireland, where its European headquarters are located.  Apple is competing with companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google when it comes to creating AI-powered personal assistants. Despite a number of impressive hires, including Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU) Russ Salakhutdinov, one of the world’s leading talents in AI, Apple has been falling behind in the global AI race, according to several reports, including this one from Bloomberg. Apple is thought to employ less than 30 people in its Cambridge office but a source said there is a lot of room for expansion.Business Insider/Sam Shead The Apple office is located close to Cambridge University's Downing College.Business Insider/Sam Shead VocalIQ's software — designed to help computers and people speak to each other in a more natural dialogue — hasn't found its way into Siri yet, according to an artificial intelligence (AI) expert that Business Insider spoke to earlier this year with knowledge of voice recognition platforms. "I think it’s extremely unlikely that [VocalIQ] is in Siri now," the source said. "In fact, I’m pretty sure it isn’t. But obviously Apple have got it for a reason." The source said they could tell that VocalIQ's technology hadn't been integrated into Siri just by talking to the personal assistant. VocalIQ has a "a very particular style of dialogue ... and I haven’t seen that in Siri," they said. But one of VocalIQ's early investors told Business Insider that it was "hard to tell" whether VocalIQ was in Siri or not. Earlier this year Steve Kovach reported: "According to a source familiar with VocalIQ’s product, it’s much more robust and capable than Siri’s biggest competitors like Google Now, Amazon’s Alexa, and Microsoft’s Cortana. In fact, it was so impressive that Apple bought VocalIQ before the company could finish and release its smartphone app. After the acquisition, Apple kept most of the VocalIQ team and let them work out of their Cambridge office and integrate the product into Siri." He went on to write: "It’s still unclear when Apple plans to implement more of VocalIQ’s capabilities into Siri. One source speculated that it may happen slowly over time, so as not to throw off users with a radical change. But it sounds like Apple is arming itself for a significant shift in how Siri works." Apple declined to comment. NOW WATCH: Scientists have discovered why American honey bees are turning into zombies Loading video...

Here’s why it’s a terrible idea. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 3, 2016 at 7:30AM Goldman Sachs thinks Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) should counter AT&T's (NYSE:T) $85 billion bid for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), according to The New York Post. That suggestion might be in Goldman's own self-interest, since it didn't get to advise the AT&T bid, but Apple has expressed interest in acquiring Time Warner before.  Image source: Apple. However, people familiar with the matter recently told CNBC that Apple was no longer interested in buying the media giant. If that's true, I think Apple shareholders should breathe a sigh of relief. Apple might seem flush with cash, but most of that hoard remains overseas. On the domestic front, it had $21.6 billion in cash and equivalents and at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. This means that to top AT&T's half-cash and half-stock offer, Apple must drain its domestic cash reserves, use its own stock, or take on more debt. Why buying Time Warner would be a bad move Buying Time Warner would make some strategic sense for Apple. It might revive its streaming TV effort, which was suspended last December because of pricing conflicts with content providers. Time Warner's diverse portfolio of cable shows, films, and video games would also diversify Apple's top line away from the aging iPhone, which generated 60% of its sales last quarter. However, acquiring Time Warner would reduce Apple's margins. Over the past few years, Time Warner's net profit margin has remained consistently lower than Apple's, which has itself been weighed down by lower hardware margins. Source: YCharts Apple would also inherit Time Warner's cord cutting woes, which have cast a long shadow on its relationships with advertisers and pay-TV providers. To counter that shift, Time Warner launched its stand-alone streaming service, HBO Now. Many investors consider HBO to be Time Warner's crown jewel, but Apple has already integrated HBO Now into iTunes and Siri. Since Apple already reaps the benefits of streaming HBO shows, it seems silly to buy all of Time Warner and inherit its ongoing problems. Buying Time Warner also wouldn't give Apple digital exclusivity to its entire media library, since the company will remain bound to existing agreements with other pay TV providers. Smarter uses for its cash Instead of spending over $85 billion on Time Warner, Apple could make a lot of smaller acquisitions that come with a lot less baggage. If it's looking to expand its media portfolio, buying Lions Gate (NYSE:LGF), which has an enterprise value of just $4.4 billion, makes more sense. Lions Gate produces movies and network TV shows, and it will soon close its acquisition of pay TV network Starz. Its enterprise value-to-sales ratio of 1.8 is also much cheaper than Time Warner's 3.3. If Apple really wants to make a game-changing media acquisition, buying Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) would be smarter than buying Time Warner. As a streaming leader, Netflix doesn't suffer from any cord-cutting woes, and it owns a well-received portfolio of shows including House of Cards, Daredevil, and Stranger Things. Netflix's total paid memberships rose 26% annually to 83.3 million last quarter. Image source: Netflix. Netflix's two biggest headwinds are high content acquisition costs and pricing pressure from rivals such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Under Apple's wing, Netflix would probably gain more clout in licensing negotiations with media giants. To counter the cheaper competition, Apple could reduce Netflix's subscription fees to make it a "loss leader" to tether more users to its growing media ecosystem. It could also mimic Amazon and bundle free Netflix trials with hardware purchases. Netflix costs less than Time Warner, with an enterprise value of $55 billion, but it remains "pricier," with an EV-to-sales ratio of 6.7. The key takeaway Apple clearly needs to make some big moves to evolve its business away from the iPhone. However, I don't think it should listen to Goldman's advice and engage in a bidding war with AT&T. The disastrous AOL-Time Warner merger demonstrated that bigger isn't always better, and Apple may fall into the same trap if it believes that buying Time Warner can offset its slowing sales and lack of innovation.   Leo Sun owns shares of Amazon.com and AT and T.

The MacBook Air has been the go-to thin and light laptop for both Windows and Mac users for years now. However, with Apple not keen on keeping it updated with the latest tech, its crown has begun to slip. If you’re an Apple user happy to try an alternative, or you’ve always just installed Windows on your MacBook Air, then these five alternatives are the best place to start your search for a new laptop. All prices were correct at time of publication but are subject to change. Related: How to run Windows on a Mac 1) Dell XPS 13 Price: £1,099.99 | $1,074 Our Score: 9/10 Our Verdict: "The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best no-nonsense portable laptops around" The first Windows laptop ever to categorically wrestle the crown for best thin and light from the MacBook Air, the Dell XPS 13 is a superb little laptop. It all starts with a fantastic design that’s different but easily the equal of Apple’s laptop. It’s markedly smaller too, with the 13-inch screen fitting in the same footprint as most older 12-inch laptops. The screen itself is also great. Dell offers two versions – a 1,920 x 1,080-pixel non-touch model, and a 3,200 x 1,800-pixel touchscreen model. We’d recommend going for the non-touch version, as it still offers great quality, you get better battery life, and the extra resolution and touch features are of minimal benefit. When the Dell XPS 13 launched in 2015 it was available for just £800, making it a bona fide bargain. However, prices for certain configurations have since risen to more than £1,000 – but even at this level it's still a great option for those happy to pay MacBook Air prices. Buy Now: Dell XPS 13 at Amazon.com from $1,074 Best Deals for Dell XPS 13 9350 2) Lenovo Ideapad 710S Price: $825 Our Score: 9/10 Our Verdict: "A fantastic machine at a fantastic price. This is a great option for those seeking a top-notch lightweight laptop without breaking the bank." Taking over the XPS 13’s title of best-value ultrabook, the Lenovo 710S offers a fantastic combination of performance, screen quality, design and battery life for its (circa) £800 asking price. That said, the design is the main area where you’re compromising a bit. While you get the overall look and feel of a MacBook Air-alike, you’re not getting the same build quality. The Apple machine is made from solid blocks of aluminium milled down to form the various panels of its chassis, while Lenovo uses thin sheets of aluminium pressed into shape and attached to a plastic chassis. As a result it’s a little more flexible and lacks that reassuring heft that the Air possesses. This aside, though, you’re getting a heck of a lot for the money. For a start, the screen is excellent. The 13-inch IPS panel has a 1,920 x 1,080-pixel resolution and looks great – in fact, it absolutely wipes the floor with the Air. Inside you’ve got a nippy Intel Core i7-6560U, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, where most rivals at this price point offer only 128GB of storage. Connectivity is decent too, with plenty of USBs and an SD card slot, and the keyboard is very good. The trackpad lets the side down a little but it’s still perfectly useable, unlike some really cheap and nasty laptops. Battery life can’t quite keep pace with either the Air or the XPS 13, but at comfortably over eight hours it’s enough for most of a working day.

Something a little different, the Acer Chromebook 14 forgoes Windows and instead runs Google’s ChromeOS. This is a stripped-down, simple operating system, but as a result it needs far less processing speed and it sips rather than guzzles power, making for an incredibly cheap and long-lasting laptop. For around £200, you’re getting a laptop that’ll cover all your basic computing needs such as web browsing, email, word processing, basic photo editing, watching video – basically anything that you can do in Google’s Chrome web browser. Inevitably at this price, you’re skimping when it comes to design, with no metal or other premium materials on show. But you still get a smart-looking laptop that’s impressively thin and light, though it is a slightly larger 14-inch machine rather than a 13-incher. One crucial area where you really are missing out is the screen. With only a 1,366 x 768 pixel resolution, the quality just isn't that great. Still, with a perfectly decent keyboard and trackpad, and adequate performance from the Intel Celeron N3060 and 2GB/4GB RAM, you can get all your basic computing done and enjoy a far better typing experience than on a tablet. If you're coming from a MacBook Air, it will be significantly slower, so you should only consider a Chromebook if your needs are very basic, or you're looking for a secondary laptop. Note that you only get 16GB or 32GB of storage – the idea is you store most of your files on Google’s cloud services – and that you need an internet connection to get pretty much anything done on Chromebooks. But with the better part of 10 hours' battery life, this makes for a great laptop for students or those on a really tight budget. Buy Now: Acer Chromebook 14 at Amazon.com from $299 Best Deals for Acer Chromebook 14 4) Asus ZenBook UX330UA Price: £749 Our Score: 7/10 Our Verdict: "A thin, light and fast laptop that’s outshone by its rivals." Asus' ZenBook line has produced some of the most consistently good alternatives to the MacBook Air, thanks to eye-catching design, solid performance and competitive pricing. The UX330UA continues this trend, including a 3,200 x 1,800-pixel display and 256GB SSD– all for under £800. Like the Lenovo Ideapad though, the design here is more about aping the look of premium metal, rather than emulating its actual feel. Only the lid is metal – and it looks fab – but the rest of the machine is plastic with embedded metallic particles. Other areas where it can’t quite match the competition are the middling keyboard and below par battery life. You’ll get only around six hours of use from a charge, which is below the 8-10 hours many others will manage. If battery life is less of a concern, though, then the superb screen and good overall performance make this a good option. Best Deals for Asus ZenBook UX330UA 5) New Razer Blade Stealth Price: £999 | $1,649 Our Score: TBC Early Verdict: "You’re getting a great, powerful ultrabook with a bunch of freebies." If gaming’s your thing but you still want a truly thin and light laptop then the Razer Blade Stealth might be just what you’re after. The 12.5-inch laptop is just 0.52-inches thick, weighs only 1.25kg, and can be kitted out with either a 4K or QHD display. In almost every way, it's a typical high-end ultrabook, packing an Intel Core i7-7500U along with 8-16GB of RAM, a 256GB-1TB SSD, and a claimed battery life of up to nine hours. The real trick with this laptop, though, is that it can dock with an external graphics card so that it can transform into a powerful gaming machine. The Razer Core (£499), as it’s called, is a box that contains a power supply and desktop graphics card – which can be upgraded – and it plugs into the Blade Stealth via a Thunderbolt cable. We’ve yet to review the Razer Blade Stealth in full, but it looks set to be a truly exciting laptop for on-the-go gamers.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Phil Schiller cites 2016 Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro as most ordered Apple notebook ever made Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Thursday, November 3rd, 2016, 05:20 Category: Hardware, iOS, MacBook Pro, macOS, News, retail Tweet The Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro may be about the most popular MacBook Pro to date. In a recent interview, Apple Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller noted that the new model is the most popular notebook that Apple has ever shipped. “Our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before,” said Schiller. Schiller also indicated that Apple will keep macOS and iOS distinct from each other, because of how the hardware differs and how users interface with the devices. “There’s iPhone and iPad which are single pieces of glass, they’re direct-manipulation, multi-touch and tend towards full-screen applications,” said Schiller about half of the Apple hardware equation. “We want to make those the best in that direction anyone can imagine.” “Then there’s the Mac experience, dominated by our notebooks and that’s about indirect manipulation and cursors and menus,” Shiller compared. “If you made the Mac a touchscreen you’d have to figure out how to make it a good experience with your finger on a touchscreen. Trust me, we’ve looked at that —it’s a bad experience. It’s not as good or as intuitive as with a mouse and trackpad.” Schiller also addressed the removal of the SD card slot on the new model, stating that many users found early implementations of the slot as being “cumbersome” and a “trade-off.” The card was excised because of the “path forward” with more generic physical card readers, or the growing implementation of wireless transfer. Regardless of complaints by users alleging that the new MacBook Pro isn’t “pro” enough, Schiller says that the 3.5mm headphone jack was retained for professionals with audio gear that do not have wireless solutions, and still need the jack for macOS. Orders for the new notebook have been solid with assorted configurations taking six or more weeks due to demand. Apple hasn’t detailed any order numbers, as of yet, but Schiller is pleased with what he’s seen so far. The 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar is now in stock and immediately available to ship. The unit starts at $1,499 from assorted retailers.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: Apple incorporating augmented reality features into car project Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Thursday, November 3rd, 2016, 05:21 Category: Hardware, Rumor, Software Tweet The new rumors have Apple’s car project incorporating augmented reality somewhere down the line. Per a report by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has turned its attention to developing a software-based autonomous driving system “make sense”, given that the system will support augmented reality and provide an “innovative user experience”. All of Apple’s past successes were related to human-machine interfaces, such as mouse for Mac, click wheel for iPod, and multi-touch for iPhone and iPad. Kuo offered the following note: Assuming Apple successfully develops AR, we predict the firm will enjoy the following competitive advantages: (1) redefining existing key products and leading competitors by three to five years. For instance, this could happen for iPhone, iPad and Mac; (2) eliminating obstacles of Apple Watch and Apple TV by offering an innovative user experience; and (3) entering new business fields, such as autonomous driving system. We expect Apple to generate preliminary results for AR in the next 1-2 years at the earliest and working with iPhone may be the first step. Kuo also indicated that the augmented reality market will increase significantly in 2018 and will replace virtual reality to become the mainstream market focus as Apple enters the field. As such, Kuo has predicted that the augmented reality and virtual reality markets will combine to grow from $40-50 billion in 2018 to $150 billion in 2020, with the majority increase coming from AR. Apple has expressed public interest in augmented reality, CEO Tim Cook having spoken about the topic on a number of occasions recently, hinting that the company’s approach to AR should encourage, not replace, human contact. According to rumors, Apple has a research team working on augmented and virtual reality, exploring the AR/VR field and investigating how the company could embrace augmented or virtual reality in the future. Apple has reportedly built prototype virtual reality headsets, but Cook’s continued comments on augmented reality indicate Apple is more heavily invested in that technology. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Judging by a leaked photo, the new Apple phone could be reallllllll different Most Popular Pin By Anna Lewis 3 November 2016 Share Tweet Share E-mail So here's something interesting for you. Word on the street is that the iPhone 8 is going to be a flip phone. Wait… what? Why in the name of all that is sacred would Apple do this to us? Maybe it's just me and everyone else is actually wildly excited about the idea of going back in time, but I'm just not a sure a flip phone is the direction I would be going if I was an Apple engineer. But then again I can hardly even use my TV remote, so it's probably just as well I'm not involved in the manufacturing of the iPhone 8 or anything technical for that matter… Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The reason we're all thinking a flip phone is in the pipeline is this leaked photo. Pin Most Popular An Apple pending patent for "electronic devices with carbon nanotube printed circuits" includes a sketch of a phone-like device split down the middle and opened. So not your typical flip phone. Part of the patent summary reads, "Carbon nanotubes may be patterned to form carbon nanotube signal paths on the substrates. The signal paths may resist cracking when bent. A bent portion of a carbon nanotube signal path may be formed in a portion of a flexible substrate that traverses a hinge or other flexible portion of an electronic device." Pin We don't know tonnes more about the new phone, which is due for release in September 2017 to celebrate Apple's 10th anniversary. But we have heard that it might have a glass back. Mmmmmmmm, snazzy. A source told the Nikkei Asian Review, "Apple has tentatively decided that all the 5.5-inch, 5-inch and 4.7-inch models will have glass backs, departing from metal casings adopted by current iPhones, and Biel and Lens are likely to be providing all the glass backs for the new iPhones next year."

Last week, CEO Tim Cook gave an overview of the quarters activities which was less than enthusiastic and the team also decided to put the launch of its AirPods on hold. Telecoms.com was waiting for the third instalment of bad news on Friday, but alas it didn’t come. Never mind, Strategy Analytics came to the rescue this week with the estimation Android accounted for 88% of global market share over the course of Q3, at the expense of iOS and smaller rivals. “Android’s domination of global smartphone shipments remained strong in Q3 2016, with a record 88% of all smartphones now running Google’s OS. Android’s gain came at the expense of every major rival platform,” said Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics. “Apple iOS lost ground to Android and dipped to 12% share worldwide in Q3 2016, due to a lackluster performance in China and Africa. BlackBerry and Microsoft Windows Phone have all but disappeared due to strategic shifts, while Tizen and other emerging platforms softened as a result of limited product portfolios and modest developer support.” Apple still has a dedicated following, which does not seem to be the problem, it would appear those sitting on the fence or new customers are simply finding better deals. China is a prime example. Once a market where the iPhone was seen as a status symbol, Apple commanded a strong position is an increasingly affluent market, however recent months have seen the Huawei and Samsung claw away at this promising position. With the US market also seemingly peaked for smartphone penetration, and cash-strapped consumer no longer willing to invest in new handsets as frequently, it would appear this former cash cow is starting to dry out for Apple. Smartphone sales did grow year-on-year, but it is not a throwback to the glory days, there are still big hurdles to overcome. “Global smartphone shipments grew 6% annually from 354.2 million units in Q3 2015 to 375.4 million in Q3 2016,” said Linda Sui, Director at Strategy Analytics. “This was the smartphone industry’s fastest growth rate for a year. Modest smartphone regrowth is being supported by emerging markets with relatively low smartphone penetration across Asia and Africa Middle East, particularly countries such as India and South Africa.” The earnings call last week highlighted the team are generating more cash from the services division, 24% year-on-year growth, which is an area which Cook and co. will need to capitalize on should Apple wish to remain as a major player in the technology world. Telecoms.com is not sure as to whether this can replace former glories, so further diversification, like it’s new TV App, will probably be needed. Apple will not disappear in the near future, there are simply too many iLifers around the world, but the signs are showing the company is loosening its grip. The brand may remain as one of the most respected in the eyes of the consumers, it is in fact the most valuable brand in the world according to Brand Finance, but this is not being directly reflected in the money being brought in quarter-on-quarter. Global Smartphone OS Shipments and Market Share in Q3 2016 Global Smartphone Operating System Shipments (Millions of Units) Q3 ’15 Q3 ’16 Growth YoY % Android 298.0 328.6 10.3% Apple iOS 48.0 45.5 -5.2% Others 8.2 1.3 -84.1% Total 354.2 375.4 6.0% Global Smartphone Operating System Marketshare (%) Q3 ’15 Q3 ’16 Android 84.1% 87.5% Apple iOS 13.6% 12.1% Others 2.3% 0.3% Total 100.0% 100.0% Total Growth Year-over-Year % 9.5% 6.0% Source: Strategy Analytics Tags: Android, Apple, featured, iOS, mobile OS, smartphone 5 comments David Hiskiyahu 03/11/2016 @ 12:48 pm Reply Am I alone with this thought – would be happy to switch from iOS to Android, but my relations with people which prefer Facetime keep me back on iOS. Once WhatsApp video calls become available, Facetime will become redundant, because everyone I know is on WhatsApp. What will WhatsApp video do to Apple? Will the impact be as significant as I think it will be? David. Jamie Davies 09/11/2016 @ 1:49 pm Reply Hi David – could be a killer blow from Facebook/WhatsApp – does kind of rely on whether Facebook/WhatsApp is able to negotiate the brewing storm of data sharing – users favour WhatsApp because there isn’t any advertising/its free – will the data sharing saga turn users off WhatsApp in the long-run? Jamie Davies 09/11/2016 @ 1:54 pm Reply Check out what the UK gov is up to with regard to the Facebook/WhatsApp saga (http://telecoms.com/477159/uk-slams-facebook-and-whatsapp-data-relationship/) – could have some serious implications Luis Quezada 09/11/2016 @ 5:50 pm Reply ¿Really Jamie? Frankly I don’t understand how journalists continue to focus on smartphones marketshare by units, when everybody knows that the vast majority of android devices out there are mere dumb phones that can’t compare to the real smartphones in the high-end, where the iPhone absolutely dominates. Have you ever used one of the Samsung devices in the mid to low-end that comprises the bunch of unit sales they have? They are absolute crap. User experience is awful, they’re slow to death, poor screens, cameras that stink, let’s don’t talk about the responsiveness in general, can’t be upgraded to new android versions, etc. Of course they are cheap and not everybody can spend >$600 for a high-end phone, so I’m glad they exist, but let’s not compare those to an iPhone. You focus on device numbers and, as many other journalists, don’t know – don’t want – don’t bother, to do some research and write about the revenue and profit numbers of that market segment. Apple now owns practically the total of the profits from the smartphone industry, even as it’s market share in relative percentage seems to shrink and android to gain. http://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-iphone-grabs-104-of-smartphone-industry-profit-in-q3/ Almost every year has been the same history, regularly having only Apple and Samsung earning real money from their smartphones businesses, but Apple taking the whole lot of it. Sure Apple has to be worried with iPhone cash-cow sales decreasing in units every quarter, but they are still taking all the profits that market segment has to offer, growing from 94% in 2015 to 103% in 2016. I’m pretty sure Cook and Co. are not loosing sleep because of this, as many like you think. Scott Bicheno 14/11/2016 @ 2:09 pm Reply Good rant Luiz. We are fully aware that Apple has accounted for the majority of smartphone profits for years, but market share is still relevant and Apple’s is falling. Incidentally I would back my Galaxy S7 over an iPhone every time. The reason it’s relevant to look at marketshare by units is to observe trends, as any impartial market observer should want to do. Apple’s share is declining and that’s interesting. No need to take it personally dude.

This means that there are a lot of devices out there in the world with many different types of video connections. But what are the differences between them all? Which ones do you need to care about? What’s the bottom line? In this article, we’ll explore the most prominent cable types of today and when you may want to use each one. VGA The Video Graphics Array (VGA) is one of the oldest connection standards which can still be found in large swaths of computing equipment. It was first developed by IBM and introduced in 1987. It was widely used for video cards, TV sets, computer monitors, and laptops Two Monitors for an Extended Desktop: 3 Things You Should Check First Two Monitors for an Extended Desktop: 3 Things You Should Check First You'd think that all you'd have to do is plug any video display into the computer port on your laptop or PC. Well, it's a little more complicated than that. Read More . Image Credit: PPBR via Shutterstock VGA can support resolutions up to 640 x 480 in 16 colors, although you can increase the colors to 256 by lowering the resolution to 320 x 200. This is known as Mode 13h and is commonly used when booting your computer into Safe Mode. It’s also the mode that was used in computer gaming back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Image Credit: Choksawatdikorn via Shutterstock The VGA cable can carry RGBHV video signals: Red, Green, Blue, Horizontal Sync, and Vertical Sync. The VGA socket is made up of 15 pins in three rows of five pins, and typically colored blue. The cable socket is securely attached to the device using two screws, one on each side of the socket. Ads by Google It is rarely used today and is mostly found on older hardware, having been largely replaced by the digital DVI and HDMI connections, which we explore later in this article. RCA The famous red, white, and yellow setup of the RCA connector was once the most popular and widespread connection type for audio/visual devices. Image Credit: dugwy39 via Shutterstock While they are often referred to as RCA cables, RCA actually refers to the metal connectors at the end of the cables, named after the Radio Corporation of America which popularized the connection type. Image Credit: Vladimir Zhupanenko via Shutterstock The cables themselves are red and white audio cables and yellow for single channel composite video. The three cables together are able to transmit stereo audio along with video up to 480i or 576i resolution — where the i refers to interlaced video Graphic Display Resolutions - What Do The Numbers Mean? [MakeUseOf Explains] Graphic Display Resolutions - What Do The Numbers Mean? [MakeUseOf Explains] Display resolutions can be a rather cryptic business, with multiple standards used to describe the same display resolution in 10 different ways. All of those technical terms tend to change based on the display's purpose... Read More . Just as with VGA, the once-popular RCA connector has been superseded by the digital DVI and HDMI connections. DVI More than a decade after IBM introduced VGA, the Digital Display Working Group launched the digital successor, DVI, in 1999. DVI, which stands for Digital Visual Interface, can transmit uncompressed digital video in one of three different modes: DVI-I (Integrated) combines digital and analog in the same connector. DVI-D (Digital) supports digital signals only. DVI-A (Analog) supports analog only. Image Credit: PPBR via Shutterstock DVI-I and DVI-D can come in single- or dual-link varieties. Single-link can support 1920 x 1200 at 60 Hz, while adding a second digital transmitter for dual-link means the resolution can be increased to 2560 x 1600 at 60 Hz. In order to prevent forced obsolescence of VGA devices, DVI was developed to support analog connections using the DVI-A mode. This meant that DVI connections and devices could be backwards-compatible with VGA connections. Mini-DVI Apple is infamous for always trying to make their devices thinner and lighter. Most people think of this as a relatively recent development, but they’ve been at it since at least 2006 when they decided to move on from the mini-VGA port. In its place, they developed the mini-DVI connector. Image Credit: Wijit Wongwijit via Shutterstock It was included in the PowerBook G4, Intel-based iMacs and Macbooks, and Xserve. The mini-DVI doesn’t support dual-link connections and so was always limited to resolutions of 1920 x 1200 or less. This, in conjunction with advancing technology, led Apple to discontinue the use of mini-DVI in 2008 and replace it with Mini DisplayPort connections instead. HDMI HDMI, or High Definition Media Input, is a proprietary but wildly successful digital audio and video transfer interface. HDMI was created by a group of electronics manufacturers — including Sony, Sanyo, and Toshiba — to transfer video (uncompressed) and audio (either uncompressed or eight-channel compressed) to computer monitors, digital TVs, and DVD or Blu-ray players. Image Credit: PPBR via Shutterstock As of HDMI 1.4, it can support 24-bit uncompressed audio at 192 kHz and video resolutions up to 4096 x 2160, which is also known as 4K or Ultra HD What's the Difference Between 4K and Ultra HD? What's the Difference Between 4K and Ultra HD? Thinking of buying a new TV or monitor but feeling lost with all of the terminology like 4K and Ultra HD? Here's everything you need to know about it. Read More . As HDMI uses the same video format standards as DVI, the two are compatible through an adapter. As no signal conversion is necessary, there is no loss of quality either (although unlike HDMI, DVI does not support audio). There are three commonly used HDMI connectors. Type A is the full-sized HDMI connection for use on TVs and home theater equipment. Mini-HDMI (Type C) is commonly used on laptops and tablets, while Micro-HDMI (Type D) is mostly used on mobile devices. DisplayPort DisplayPort is a digital display interface developed by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). DisplayPort can carry digital video and audio, making it functionally similar to HDMI. As of DisplayPort 1.4, there is support for resolutions up to 8K (7680 x 4320) at 60 Hz, which surpasses even HDMI 1.4. Image Credit: PPBR via Shutterstock However, HDMI and DisplayPort were designed for different markets. While HDMI was made primarily for home entertainment, DisplayPort was designed for connecting computing devices to monitors. Due to their similar functionality, it is possible to connect DisplayPort and HDMI devices together using a Dual-Mode DisplayPort adapter. DisplayPort operates using packet data transmission which is commonly used in Ethernet and USB connections, and that’s what makes it ideal for use in computing as opposed to home entertainment. Mini DisplayPort Image Credit: PPBR via Shutterstock Apple replaced the mini-DVI connection on their Macbooks and iMacs with their own take on DisplayPort, known as Mini DisplayPort (MDP). Although Apple created MDP, it was incorporated into VESA’s DisplayPort 1.2 specification in 2009. Thunderbolt Thunderbolt is an interface used to connect peripheral devices to a computer. It was originally developed by Intel under the name of Light Peak and used optical cables for data transfer (hence the name Light Peak). After extensive testing, Intel found they could make it cheaper with copper cables without impacting performance. Apple was the first manufacturer to bring Thunderbolt to the market in their MacBook Pro models in 2011. When Thunderbolt debuted, it was able to use the MDP connector that Apple had created, meaning the new connection would be backwards-compatible. One of the biggest advantages of Thunderbolt over DisplayPort is the high speed of data transfer. Versions 1 and 2 of Thunderbolt could transfer at a rate of 20 GB/s using the MDP connector. Thunderbolt 3 will increase this Thunderbolt 3: What It Is & Why You Need to Start Using It Thunderbolt 3: What It Is & Why You Need to Start Using It Thunderbolt 3 may just be the only device cable you need to know about anymore.

Read More  through a technique called daisy-chaining, which reduces the amount of ports needed on a device. Thunderbolt is able to carry audio either using the DisplayPort protocol or by using USB audio cards. As of Thunderbolt 2, there was support for DisplayPort 1.2 specifications, which allowed for 4K streaming to a 4K monitor. The Simplification Factor If you’re still confused, the good news is that the world is moving towards a unified standard. HDMI Licensing recently announced that in order to connect to an HDMI device, all you will need is a compatible USB Type-C to HDMI cable Everything You Need to Know About HDMI Alt Mode and USB Type-C Everything You Need to Know About HDMI Alt Mode and USB Type-C The new HDMI Alt Mode standard will allow phones and tablets to stream directly to monitors and TVs using USB-C-to-HDMI cables. Here's all you need to know about it. Read More which can run in “Alt Mode”. This is one part of the industry’s larger push to simplify cabling. Standardization is possible — remember all of the proprietary mobile device chargers that existed before the micro-USB standard? It’s like that, except this time the industry is pushing USB Type-C as the next all-in-one standard for audio, video, power, and all other connections.

I've seen this kind of port in many today's boards. Reply Jeremy Collake September 4, 2012 at 2:54 am As MakeUseOf pointed out to *me* on G+, the latest DisplayPort is actually called Thunderbolt now. Fortunately, its rights are owned by INTEL, not Apple. Needless to say, this matters ;). This interface has all the bandwidth to do *everything* we need. "Thunderbolt is interoperable with DisplayPort 1.2 compatible devices. When connected to a DisplayPort compatible device the Thunderbolt port can provide a native DisplayPort signal with 4 lanes of output data at no more than 5.4 Gbit/s per lane. When connected to a Thunderbolt device the per-lane data rate becomes 10 Gbit/s and the 4 lanes are configured as 2 channels with each bidirectional 10 Gbit/s channel comprising one lane of input and one lane of output.[2]". -wikipedia Reply Fer September 4, 2012 at 3:40 am Thank you Jeremy :) Reply subhasish nayak March 22, 2016 at 11:54 am display port is better than HDMI.. Reply Danny Chamorro September 3, 2012 at 6:53 pm Nice and useful article. I just have one question, why not include DisplayPort? Reply Jeremy Collake September 3, 2012 at 5:09 pm I love this idea of educating the masses on these simple things. Us geeks have known for years, and it doesn't take much to look up the differences. However, it is important for Joe Consumer to understand, as the manufacturers *sure don't* explain the differences when buying - especially low-end - monitors and such. It *is* too bad you didn't add DisplayPort though, as *that* may be the future of how we dock our mobile devices to multi-monitor setups with keyboard and mouse all with one cable. Let me add one more thing: Avoid Analog at all costs. You want Digital. Digital Digital Digital. No DVI-A (or analog over DVI-I). .. and, again, DisplayPort - watch for it! Want to future proof your next monitor purchase? Buy one with a DisplayPort (DP) input.

I find this to be especially helpful in covering the differences between the various DVI connecters which can be confusing. One thing to remember is that you don't need to spend horrendous amounts of money on the digital cables as the inexpensive ones will carry the digital signal as well as the expensive ones. Reply Kasey Bell September 6, 2012 at 6:40 am I was wondering that ie... Gold plated hdmi $45 as good as the $15? And is there much quality loss with adding adapters Reply Mark Stevens November 8, 2016 at 4:14 am No there is no difference. I have a $60 Monster Cable and there is no difference in the signal whatsoever between that and a $15 one. As far as adapters go, I have seen different qualities between adapters. The most important thing with adapters it that all connections are as secure as possible, and try to avoid having any hanging stress on the cables or connections.

XD Reply illegal3alien September 3, 2012 at 1:45 am Also worth noting is HDMI is compatible with DVI (minus the audio). You can pick up a $1 adapter on Amazon to convert DVI to HDMI (or vice-versa). There are also devices that allow you to hookup DVI and audio out to a HDMI connection. Newer video cards support audio out over HDMI so you can hook your computer up to the TV and hear sound by only plugging in an HDMI cable to your video card. Reply Simon Slangen September 3, 2012 at 12:05 pm You're right, HDMI type A and C are electrically compatible with DVI-D. You need to be careful with what type of DVI, though. Below is a small overview.

It’s gone, it’s no longer a thing, it’s as dead as the metaphorical dodo. But why has Apple dumped the SD card slot when most people still use one? Only Apple has the answer… After four long years, Apple recently unveiled the brand new MacBook Pro Apple Unveils New Touchy-Feely MacBook Pro Apple Unveils New Touchy-Feely MacBook Pro Apple has taken the wraps off of its brand new MacBook Pro. It's a beautifully designed piece of hardware, with several innovative touches and some annoying caveats potential buyers will have to beware. Read More . It’s fair to say reactions varied. Some focused on the innovative changes such as the Touch Bar, while others focused on what Apple removed to make way for these exciting changes. Apple dumped all of the various ports in favor of USB-C ports What Is USB Type-C? What Is USB Type-C? Ah, the USB plug. It is as ubiquitous now as it is notorious for never being able to be plugged in right the first time. Read More . That means there’s no room for an SD card slot which most people use to transfer photos from their camera to their laptop. Which seems like a strange decision, and one which has annoyed many users. Phil Schiller Explains It All Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller has given an interview to The Independent covering a range of subjects. One of which is the removal of the SD card slot. Schiller was asked why the new MacBook Pro has no SD card slot, to which he replied: “Because of a couple of things. One, it’s a bit of a cumbersome slot. You’ve got this thing sticking halfway out. Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD. So we could never really resolve this – we picked SD because more consumer cameras have SD but you can only pick one. So, that was a bit of a trade-off. And then more and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfer into the camera. That’s proving very useful. So we think there’s a path forward where you can use a physical adapter if you want, or do wireless transfer.” Another Courageous Decision So there we have it. There’s no real mystery involved. Apple thinks there are better options available than the SD card slot. So, in the same “courageous” way it decided to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 Apple Launches New iPhone 7 With No Headphone Jack...

Far too proprietary and restrictive in the way it controls those who own them. And their absolutely stupid excuse about the SD card poking half out, well on my 2x laptops, my families 3x laptops, my tablet and my families tablets, plus all the other non-apple laptops and tablets I have seen my friends with, none of them have the SD card poking out when fitted. If it pokes out in a mac, then it's all down to rotten apples fault for not implimenting the hardware incorrectly. Besides, has anyone else noticed how much slower wireless transmission is in comparrison to just plugging in a high speed SD card, it takes sooo long, especially when there big files to move. Then you have to have the extra space left on the internal memory, again no good if you have over 100GB of files to move. Finally, you also have to carry around a extra USB SD card adapter - just in case - what a pain! Whereas I can just fit a 128GB SD card (or micro SD with a adapter which can be left, out of they way, in the SD slot of the laptop) without all that hassle. Same reason I have switched from Samsung after being faithful for many years (no removable battery any more and look what mess that got them into - and no micro SD slot - both of which I make use of). AAgghh, what is wrong with companies today, another example - Microsoft first gets rid of a perfectly good GUI (Win 8) and then brings it back (win 10), but in such a badly broken form after a monumental number of complaints. Why do they think that they have to keep changing things for changes sake. Didn't anyone every tell them that "Don't try to fix that which is not broken, you only just end up ....ing it up!!" Reply Ranjit Kumar Gupta November 5, 2016 at 5:20 am Apple removed the SD Card reader! Thats the only innovation left of them. :P Reply k1d bl4ck November 4, 2016 at 10:26 am Being a "Pro" user, I use SD cards (well actually microSD cards in adapters) for images to boot up a range of embedded devices, the Raspberry PI being the most popular. I guess I am now too "Pro" for the MacBook Pro. Reply Some1 November 4, 2016 at 2:02 am Go ahead drain your camera's precious battery while transferring wireless to your macbook. Reply Ferg November 7, 2016 at 10:41 am spot on - if you're using a laptop with your camera you're quite likely o be in 'the field'. In which case why kills battery on both devices using a (slow?) wireless protocol... Is this what 'Innovation' is now? Removing features? Reply JEA November 3, 2016 at 10:17 pm So they removed the slot because you’ve got “this thing sticking halfway out”. Because it is so much better to insert the dongle which is now needed to attach an external card reader. The MacBook Pro is now a desktop Macs. Because you can’t have it on your lap if you insert all those dongles. Reply Hildy J November 3, 2016 at 7:57 pm Cameras are one thing, storage is another. For a trade-off of slower access, SD cards allow unlimited storage in 512gb (soon to be 1tb) chunks. The real reason they were removed- Apple saves money and can charge double the going rate for more SSD space. Reply Bradk November 3, 2016 at 2:12 pm Most people use still use sd cards? Um no. Almost no one uses them especially in laptops. (And with cell phone tablets that never take them out) Serious amateur/Pro photographers sure. Average consumer no way. Photagraphers already carry a ton of shit around so another dongle isn't a big deal. Let's be realistic it's a niche market. I'd rather see a laptop locking slot use that real estate. That's something most people could (should) use. Reply Martin Robbins November 6, 2016 at 7:30 pm I don't know where you got the data that allows you to state as fact that most people do not use sd cards. I for one (and many of my friends and associates) find sd cards among the easiest and simplest way to move data around and, most importantly, to protect valuable data by removing it from the computer. I always remove my sd card, which I use to store all of my data, when I leave my machine anywhere it cannot be regularly monitored by me. I travel a lot on business. I always remove my sd card (if I do not need access to my data) whenever I am away from my computer in public, semi-public, and even private places such as hotel rooms, friends' and client's offices, libraries and airplane seats (do I really want to lug a data-laden laptop into the airplane restroom, or do I just want to leave my data card by an unoccupied seat?) I even remove my sd card when making presentations when I know that I will not be near my machine for periods of time, particularly before and after a presentation when I am walking around, distracted and busy answering questions. I am particularly conscious of "loose" hands in university settings. I just transfer my presentation to my laptop and pocket my data file. I find sd cards one of my best tools for both portability and security. All I need to access my data on a strange machine is a slot or a usb-based card reader. Now they want to take it away from me if I upgrade my MacBook Air. I am not sure I want to upgrade to the new MacBook Pro. It's a step down for me. Reply Marco V. Jacquez November 7, 2016 at 5:28 pm I have to agree with Martin, I do not know were you get the data. I do have four wireless SD cards for four different cameras (from a DSLR to a point and shoot) that I configured to download the pictures to my main computer running Windows 10. However, I do some business travel for which I use a 13" MacBook Air (mid 2012) and some times I take one or two of the cameras but I change the cards for regular cards and then I download the pics to my Mac using the SD card. I am the last one using an SD card slot? I do not think so. Reply likefunbutnot November 3, 2016 at 12:41 pm I know! Let's make the guys who haul around $20,000 worth of gear around buy a new camera body because Apple thinks 802.11 can somehow magically keep up with shooting hundreds of RAW files and/or that camera makers didn't plan far enough ahead by not putting USB-C connectors on everything three years ago! My company stopping buying Apple laptops because Apple stopped shipping them in configurations with acceptable amounts of RAM and no way to upgrade, but it's a damned shame that Apple thinks it's OK to call something that can only support 16GB RAM *and* doens't have standard USB connectors *and* needs an external dongle for pretty much all standard ports a "Professional" device. This new device sounds more like a fashion accessory than a working tool. Reply John Robertson November 3, 2016 at 2:39 pm Likefunbutnot, I couldn't agree more. I am an Apple fanboy at heart, but these changes or direction they are heading just doesn't sit well. I want a SD card slot built in. I can live with, but not the happiest that they removed the head phone jack. I love the OS, and the tight integration with all things Apple, but quit taking away our stuff that we depend on!!! Reply John November 4, 2016 at 3:31 am Apple does work great with all things Apple, Android works great with everything else Reply Gaz November 7, 2016 at 12:19 pm I agree, it has not been a working tool for a while now, but it is definitely a "TOOL"! (just in case you mistake my meaning - not in a good way ? ) Have you checked out how much that rotten apple sell a SD card reader? Not much change left from $65 Australian Or you could pay A$75 for a more useful AV multiport adapter, which unfofrtunately only has a standard USB port (for a cheaper SD card reader as long as it is a USB 2.0 adapter), problem is that it is not compatible with some of apple's USB 3 products (and maybe other untested or unmentioned products - apple do not give out any information which THEY don't think or want you need to know). So you need yet another adapter. One good way to get more and more money out of zombied apple users. I was stuck in hospital for ages (with no wifi and didn't want the huge expense of trying to download via a mobile phone plan) , where family and friends used to bring in all sorts of recorded TV shows and movies on SD cards that I could plug straight into mu Asus tablet. And too top it off, the SD cards never poked out half way of my tablet, they went in all the way. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Kohl's To Sell Apple Watch Posted: Nov 3 2016, 5:20am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 3 2016, 8:59am CDT, in News | Apple   Kohl's Black Friday 2016 Apple Watch deal   Kohl's will sell the Apple Watch starting November 15, and yes there will be Kohl's Black Friday deals on the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch will after Macy's also be available at Kohl's. The department store chain will start offering the Apple Watch in 400 of its 1,100 stores and online on November 15. The Apple Watch will featured in Kohl's activewear and wellness sections. For Apple the Kohl's distribution deal makes sense. The Apple Watch benefits from diverse points of sales.  Don't Miss: Hatchimals in Stock at Walmart “We’re not launching it as an electronics partner,” Michelle Gass, Kohl’s chief merchandising and customer officer, told Fortune in an exclusive interview. “We were positioning this as an active and wellness device.”  The Apple Watches will be shown on four-foot-tall display fixtures that feature four different watch models, and the areas will be staffed by Kohl’s workers. Kohl’s will stock 10 different kinds of Apple Watches. Kohl's has seriously improved its consumer electronics offering over the past two years. The Apple Watch makes Kohl's able to compete with Target and Best Buy. Earlier today the Kohl's Black Friday 2016 ad has been officially released. The 64-page Kohl's ad is featuring Black Friday Apple Watch deals. Kohl's might have one of the best Apple Watch Black Friday 2016 deals. The Apple Watch Black Friday deals are through Kohl's popular Kohl's Cash. The Apple Watch Series 2 for $369 is earning buyers $105 Kohl's Cash and the $269 Apple Watch Series 1 earns $75.  During the Kohl's Black Friday 2016 sale starting at November 21 customers get $15 Kohl's Cash on every $50 spent. They can redeem the earned Kohl's Cash during the redeem period November 27 to December 5. Kohl's Cash is like real cash, but you have to spend it at Kohl's online store or brick-and-mortar locations during the redeem period. We have not seen Apple Watch Black Friday 2016 deals yet, but a $105 discount is going to be one of the best deals this season on a Series 2 Apple Watch.  You May Like The Author Luigi Lugmayr Luigi Lugmayr (Google+) is the founding chief Editor of I4U News and brings over 15 years experience in the technology field to the ever evolving and exciting world of gadgets.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Could Apple Surprise Investors With a Massive Special Dividend? November 3, 2016 6:47am Nasdaq:AAPL ShareTweet From Ian Wyatt: With $164 billion of cash, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the world’s richest company. The company is also an up-and-coming favorite for dividend investors. Since 2012, the company increased the dividend by 10% per year. CEO Tim Cook has embraced investors with a growing dividend and huge stock buyback program. But our research indicates that the company could be on the verge of a huge special payout. That’s because after subtracting its debts, Apple has $164 billion of cash. On a per share basis, that’s nearly $30 in cash per share. If Apple were to pay this out, it could deliver a mind-blowing 32% one-time dividend. Now, I’m not expecting anything of that magnitude. But it’s very possible that Apple will follow in the footsteps of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), which issued a $32 billion one-day payout in 2004. Apple Special Dividend And a one-time payout could dwarf Apple’s annual 2.5% dividend. So, how would this work . . .  and how exactly has Apple amassed $164 billion in cash? A little known company called Braeburn Capital is at the heart of Apple’s cash stash. Located in Reno, Nevada, Apple formed Braeburn as a subsidiary in 2006. Braeburn is a company that was formed with the explicit goal of helping Apple sidestep state and federal taxes in the U.S. And they’ve been extremely successful. Apple currently pays less than 10% in taxes, versus the 39% U.S. corporate tax rate. The New York Times reports: Setting up an office in Reno is just one of many legal methods Apple uses to reduce its worldwide tax bill by billions of dollars each year. As it has in Nevada, Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places like Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands — some little more than a letterbox or an anonymous office — that help cut the taxes it pays around the world. Braeburn has very effectively helped Apple navigate the current environment. But our research indicates that things could quickly change. With government debt rapidly growing, there will be increased pressure on companies including Apple to bring cash back into the U.S. When they do that, these companies will be hit with a big tax bill. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton could open the door for a tax holiday, encouraging the repatriation of corporate profits. If that happens, we’re expecting a flurry of huge dividend payouts, including an Apple special dividend. Apple shares fell $0.79 (-0.71%) to $110.80 in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, AAPL has gained 6.01%, versus a 2.87% return in the benchmark S&P 500 during the same period. This article is brought to you courtesy of Wyatt Investment Research.

A march to support Apple’s decision to site its latest data centre in Athenry takes place in the town this weekend, with organisers calling it a show of “solidarity with Apple” to illustrate that "the majority of the people in the area” welcome the multinational giant to east Galway. The march takes place this Sunday at 11.45am gathering at the railway station/church carpark and moving to the Square, where the gathering will be addressed by a small number of local people on the theme, ‘Athenry for Apple’. Apple’s decision to locate in Athenry, and invest €850 million into the proposed data centre was announced in February 2015. It was granted planning permission by the Galway County Council, but was then appealed to An Bord Pleanála. ABP granted permission but some objectors have since been granted a judicial review of that decision. This week Apple asked the High Court to fast-track a legal challenge which has stalled its plan to build the data centre. Last month, two applications to seek a Judicial Review of the decision by An Bord Pleanála to allow the Data Centre, were granted in the High Court. Two local residents are seeking a Judicial Review of the An Bord Pleanála decision, while a third individual who lives in Wicklow, is seeking a second Judicial Review. Among the organisers of the march is Athenry-based Fine Gael county councillor Peter Feeney. While he acknowledges "the right to object is there in law and some have chosen to exercise that right," he said the "wider community" in Athenry, and surrounding towns, villages, and rural areas, "have a right and an expectation that their young people have the opportunity to live and work where they have grown up". He pointed out that more than 3,000 children attend school in Athenry, and that within 15 miles of the proposed Apple site, are more than 50,000 young people secondary school pupils and third level students. "We need the jobs Apple will bring," he said, "and we need the jobs that will follow such a huge investment." "Since the initial announcement in February 2015 the people of Athenry have been anxiously waiting for the day that the Apple project finally starts. We have been patient, waiting for the Planning Application to be lodged, pleased at the decision by Galway County Council to grant permission, disappointed at the decision to appeal to an Bord Pleanála and then nothing short of heartbroken to hear that some of the objections have sought and been granted a Judicial Review of the Bord’s decision to allow the project to go ahead.

Apple Patent Indicates Future iPhones Will Have Bendable Design Similar To Nintendo 3DS By Rishabh Jain On 11/03/16 AT 7:47 AM Close Apple has been granted a patent for a bendable/foldable iPhone design. The Apple patent numbered 9485862 lists a carbon nanotube based clamshell design similar to what the Nintendo 3DS looks like now. The patent showcases in detail how the iPhone could be flexible in not just folding but even bending. The company also justifies its choice of material: “Conductive carbon nanotube paths can form signal paths that are flexible and resistant to cracking.” Other materials that have been indicated for manufacturing future iPhones include glass, ceramic, fiber aluminum and plastic.

While Apple was granted the patent Tuesday, rivals Samsung and LG have been working on similar devices for long. No company has yet succeeded in providing customers with a genuine bendable phone up till  now. When this model would be released, is anyone’s guess.

Ben Lovejoy - 2 weeks ago @benlovejoy Feature MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit We’ve run three opinion pieces recently addressing Apple’s decision to remove all but USB-C ports from the new MacBook Pro – and each has attracted literally hundreds of comments. I started the ball rolling by arguing that while I do fully appreciate the pain involved in the transition, it’s a trade-off. Buying a few new cables or adapters today versus ending up with too few USB-C ports when the new standard has taken over a year or so down the line. That one generated more than 700 comments, many of them arguing that I was wrong and that Apple should have offered a mix of USB-A and -C ports, as well as retaining the SD slot … Jeff addressed the SD card issue in more detail, suggesting that we should be demanding that camera manufacturers add high-speed data transfer via USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt, and that Apple’s move will encourage this. Finally, Zac argued that while there are reasons to complain, USB-C is the future, and it’s not difficult to adapt to it by replacing a few cables. We’re currently at 1400 comments and counting across the three threads. The main counter-argument raised is that, while USB-C may be the future, it isn’t the present. Apple is adding to the cost of an already expensive new machine by forcing us to buy cables and adapters, which are also a pain to carry around. And SD cards may not be used in pro cameras, but it’s not uncommon for professionals to use prosumer cameras that do use SD cards. It’s clear from the heated debates that many have very strong feelings about this. What’s harder to judge is whether these feelings are held by an extremely vocal minority, or whether they in fact represent the majority view. So we’re running this poll to find out. We’re asking two questions. First, which of the ports in the older MacBook Pro do you currently use on a regular basis? Please also use the comments to let us know what kind of devices you currently attach to your MacBook Pro, and what you use them for. That will provide a broader appreciation of the issue. Second, do you view Apple’s decision as positive or negative, and how strongly do you feel about it? Is Apple right, that we’ll all be using USB-C ports within a year and it’s better to use all the available slots for the emerging standard? Is it a good thing, the decision helping push manufacturers toward faster adoption of a superior standard? Or is the company wrong, and we’ll still be using those older ports years from now? A bad thing because Apple is making its customers pay for a poor decision? I’d also note again that Disqus can sometimes struggle with very high comment volumes, so if you post something and can’t immediately see your comment, please check back later in the day. We don’t delete comments because we disagree with them.

Over the years the Clinton Farmers' Market and the annual Apple 'n Pumpkin Harvest Festival have grown and become a favorite for many folks from all over the area. Putting on an event like the harvest festival and running the farmers' market every Sunday, May through October, takes a lot of planning with the help of supporters and volunteers. I would like to thank everyone that help me make these programs of the West Jersey Farmers' Market Association and the Clinton Book Shop so successful: My partner, Rob Dougherty, who works tirelessly along side me to make all this happen. Mayor Janice Kovach for all her support. The members of the Clinton Town Council for their support. To Weichart Realtors of Clinton, Mount Salem Vineyards, Unity Bank, Clinton United Methodist Church, Country Fresh Farm for their support. A big thank-you to Anna Maria Gialias and all the folks from the Clinton House for planning and running the beer/wine garden the day of the harvest festival. To those that I know of that volunteered their time or gave their support in various ways, Town of Clinton Clerk Ceil Covino, Rosemary and Marty Pendergast, Cathy Pawlowski and Glen Ehrhardt, Deb Banes-Schaffer, Margaret Villegas, Sara Brown, Pina Giuliana, Lori Grossi, Kathy Burkhour with Bark Printing and Promotions, Sandy Dabb and the Hunterdon County Fur 'n Feather 4-H Poultry Waterfowl & Small Animal Club, Eagle Tent Rentals, Lightsource Chiropractic, Yoga Barre Haven and Yellow Dog Paddle. To all the Clinton Farmers' Market vendors that truely make the farmers' market and the festival a huge success. To the Clinton Fire Company for the use of their parking lot. To the Twin River Rounders, Allie-OOPS!, Raritan Valley Recovery, and Wild Magnolia who entertained us on the day of the festival and to Tom Johnston who faithfully provides music at the farmers' market throughout the season. To Vince's Cheesesteaks, Maddalenas, Aunt DeeDee's, and Celestine's Catering Company for providing yummy stuff to eat on the festival day. To everyone that contributed money in the collection jars on the Clinton Farmers' Market vendor's tables all season long. To all the other vendors and crafters that came on festival day and to all that entered your apple pies in the baking contest. To everyone that I'm unaware of or don't know your name that helped that day. And a real big thank-you to the kids and adults that attended the festival and made it a huge success this year as well as supporting the Clinton Farmers' Market every Sunday May through October. I hope you all had a fun time this past season and I'm looking forward to seeing you all next year on the first Sunday in May for the opening of the farmers' market and Sunday, Oct. 1, 2017 for the third annual Apple 'n Pumpkin Harvest Festival.

Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Patents-Patents+ Apple has been granted a patent for a foldable and/or bendable iPhone made from advanced carbon nanotube structures. Recently uncovered by Patently Apple, the patent application dates back to 2014 and describes what looks like a flexibledevice with a clam shell design. Another patent for a solely bendable phone filed back in 2013, serves as further evidence that the Cupertino giant has had continuous interest in this concept over the last couple of years. The patent filed in 2014 uses the iPhone moniker explicitly, instead of the generic “electronic device” or derivatives of it, and contains illustrations of both the familiar iPhone design (not pictured), albeit in very simplified form, as well as concept drawings for a new, foldable device that may also have a bendable display. The documents also offer some details regarding the possible materials of which this iPhone of the future could be made, mentioning ceramic, glass, fiber, aluminum, and plastic as possible contenders, but explicitly names carbon nanotubes as the material that would make the foldable design possible:  Conductive carbon nanotube paths can form signal paths that are flexible and resistant to cracking. The carbon nanotube structures may be incorporated into signal cables such as flexible printed circuit cables, rigid printed circuit boards, printed circuits that include rigid portions with flexible tails [...], portions of display structures, portions of touch sensors such as capacitive touch sensor arrays for displays or track pads, camera structures, antenna structures, housing structures, internal device structures, electrical components, substrates, brackets, housing walls, other structures, or combinations of these structures. These patents are proof that Apple is showing some interest in bendable/foldable devices, but should not be taken as a clear indication that the next iPhone, or any future Apple phone for that matter, would sport this type of design. Other major phone makers, such as LG and Apple’s main rival Samsung, have also expressed interest in foldable smartphones in the past year, with rumors claiming that next year will see the technology used in mass-produced mobile devices.

The patent should not have been allowed by Apple since Samsung had a patent for it already. I thought that was what patents were for, so others could not do the same thing. That is why Apple sued Samsung for rounded corners. posted on 03 Nov 2016, 17:30 0 Reply 25. xondk (Posts: 1520; Member since: 25 Mar 2014) Yup, they apparently already had a working concept just don't think it was ever practical, but patents as is, doesn't really require people to build what they patent, which is the insane part, come up with something, patent it, if someone else later makes something similar, demand pay. posted on 03 Nov 2016, 07:08 0 Reply 12. guests (Posts: 165; Member since: 19 Jun 2016) Wow, this might be the first time apple patented something after they released the actual product (ip6+).. good job apple. posted on 03 Nov 2016, 07:36 1 Reply 13.

The cost to make the Apple Watch is 24% of its retail price May 1, 2015, 1:28 pm EST  |  By William White, InvestorPlace Writer     The Apple Watch isn’t as expensive for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to make as you may think. Source: Apple A recent teardown of the Sport version of the Apple Watch was done by IHS Technology’s Teardown Mobile Handsets Intelligence Service. The company’s teardown revels that the price of the components in the smartwatch comes to $81.20. It estimates that manufacturing the devices costs an additional $2.50, bringing the total cost of the device to Apple to $83.70. The Apple Watch Sport retails for $349.00. This means that the total cost of the device to Apple is only about 24% of the retail price. The Watch has many pieces of technology in it that have never been a part of a single device before. This could be why the company has marked the price up as much as it has. “It is fairly typical for a first-generation product rollout to have a higher retail price versus hardware cost,” Kevin Keller, senior principal analyst at IHS Technology, said in a statement. “While retail prices always tend to decrease over time, the ratio for the Apple Watch is lower than what we saw for the iPhone 6 Plus and other new Apple products, and could be of great benefit to Apple’s bottom line if sales match the interest the Apple Watch has generated.” More From InvestorPlace 10 Richest People in the World 2015 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy for Under $10 10 Best Stocks for Next 10 Years Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2015/05/apple-watch-teardown-how-much-does-it-cost-aapl-to-make-one/. ©2016 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy 5 Tech Stocks in Trouble After Trump 4 Biotechs to Buy After Clinton’s Defeat 3 Mexican Stocks to Buy, 1 to Sell in Trump’s World 7 Mutual Funds That Should Be Banished From Your Portfolio 7 CEOs Heading to the Chopping Block by '18 Comments are currently unavailable.

Dvorak November 2, 2016 10 Comments The MacBook Pro's Touch Bar is a pathetic stopgap to having a full touch screen, but fanboys will probably love it. I have no idea what Apple is trying to do with its MacBook Pro lineup. Instead of merely making the most powerful machines possible, Cupertino is just fixing what is not broken. In this case, I mean the keyboard. The top row, which is normally home to the function keys, is replaced by what is called the Touch Bar; it can be programmed for all sorts of chores. MacBook Pros with the new Touch Bar do have one thing going for them—an outrageous and gorgeous display with a bigger color gamut and high dynamic range (HDR) potential with 500 nits of brightness. That's great. But the odd idea that the escape key and ALL the function keys are useless and could be eliminated seems like a stretch. Computer users are used to the existing keyboard layout; why drastically change it when nobody asked for it? If you read reviews of the machine, you hear a lot of Apple apologists go on and on about Apple's "courage," a reference to Apple's explanation for why it removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7. But while there are practical reasons to remove the headphone jack, like waterproofing, the only reason to eliminate the top row of the keyboard is to make room for the Touch Bar. The company could have made a touch screen like everyone else, but no. This Touch Bar, along with a huge trackpad, seems to be a stop gap and an obvious and blatant compromise. Before the fanboys get all up in arms, yes, the Touch Bar can be remapped to return the function and escape keys. However, if you use the bar for specialized apps, you lose immediate access. Apple apologists assert this is all great because they never use the escape key; that's nice, but I use it daily. //Related Articles MacBook Pro 2016: Should You Upgrade? The other complaint I hear is the lack of keyboard "throw" on the keys, creating the possibility of typing fatigue. This was apparently done for aesthetic reasons. I'm a fan of thin and light laptops, so I'm not going to complain about this, but it seems as if Apple is eyeing a perfectly flat keyboard with no feel at all, like the virtual keyboards projected onto the desk. They have been around for years but nobody wants to use them. People like to push buttons. Maybe Apple hasn't noticed the renewed interest in funky mechanical keyboards? A keyboard requires some movement; otherwise you're just pounding against nothing, which takes some getting used to (and might result in injury). I'm pretty sure these MacBooks are not what the Apple community wanted. But I'm generally wrong about Apple (there, I've said it), so it's possible they will be a rousing success despite what I consider to be serious drawbacks.

Details to come, as they say -- and no yelling about Apple's high prices this time around. With an eye on the upcoming holidays, Multimedia Editor, nee Gadget Guru, Keith Shaw regales Mearian and Executive News Editor with a trifecta of tech gadgets. Who wouldn't want a $70 Bluetooth enabled lock, a portable battery/car jumper cable kit and a quiet mouse. Yes, really, it's a computer mouse that doesn't click. (Who knew there was even a market for such devices?) Finally, Mearian gives his best "Oh, and one more thing..." report on Tesla's announcement that it plans to sell solar rooftop shingles next year that turn your whole roof into one giant photovoltaic system -- one that also looks like a traditional roof and last 50 years.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US Election World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones iPhone 6 price in India: Attractive discount, exchange offer and cash back compels buyers The Flipkart discount is available only for iPhone 6 16GB variant. Sami Khan   November 3, 2016 15:17 IST 2 Shares 2 Shares iPhone 6 gets discounted in IndiaReuters Apple launched its latest iPhone 7 series in India and other parts of the world, but the premium price tag may not be suited for many. For such shoppers, there is an alternative to stay a part of Apple's ecosystem. Apple's 2014 flagship, the iPhone 6, has received a generous price cut in India, specifically on Flipkart – one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the country. With the latest discount on the iPhone 6, the 16GB variant costs as low as Rs 33,990 instead of Rs 36,990. But that's just the straight-cut discount and additional cash back and exchange offers make the deal sweeter. Why advertise with us? Related Apple AirPods won't ship before January 2017: Rumours Samsung Galaxy Note 7 users opted for Apple's iPhone 7? Buyers can avail up to Rs 22,000 exchange bonus, get 5 percent off on Axis Bank Buzz credit cards or Rs 3,000 flat cashback on Citi back credit cards. To make it convenient for buyers, Flipkart is offering no cost EMIs on iPhone 6 purchases. Comparatively, Amazon India is offering the 16GB variant of iPhone 6 at Rs 34,999. The retailer is also giving 50 percent assured buyback within 6 months of purchase and 40 percent assured buyback within 15 months of purchase. So if you are planning to upgrade your smartphone temporarily, Amazon.in gets you a sweet deal. On Snapdeal, the iPhone 6 16GB costs Rs 36,990 and as far as the offers go, there is a flat Rs 500 instant discount on all credit and debit cards. Shoppers can also exchange their old devices and get up to Rs 20,000 off on the iPhone 6 purchase. The limited period offer is valid only on the 16GB variant of the iPhone 6, while the 64GB and 128GB are selling at their regular prices. This may not be the biggest price cuts in the recent days, but it is certainly worth something if buyers are serious about buying the iPhone 6. Apple iPhone 6s series witnessed the biggest price cut last month, saving buyers up to Rs 22,000 in wake of the iPhone 7 launch. The 128GB variant of the iPhone 6s was brought down from Rs 82,000 to Rs 60,000 and the high-end iPhone 6s Plus, which was priced at Rs 92,000, was shot down to Rs 70,000.

Android captured 87.5 percent of global smartphone market share in the three months to the end of September, Strategy Analytics said in a report. This means that nearly nine out of 10 smartphones in the world run Google's OS. Shipments of Android devices hit 328.6 million, up 10.3 percent year-on-year. Meanwhile, Apple's shipped 45.5 million iPhones, down 5.2 percent from the 48 million in the same period last year. This was confirmed in Apple's latest earnings results, which showed the third straight quarter of declines for iPhone sales. Apple iOS market share stood at 12.1 percent in the third quarter, down from 13.6 percent the year before. Getty Images Attendees visit the Android booth during a Google I/O developers conference in San Francisco. Other mobile operating systems including those made by BlackBerry, Microsoft and Samsung's Tizen "have all but disappeared" and collectively make up just 0.3 percent of the total smartphone market. The growth of Android has been driven by the rise of low-cost vendors in countries such as China using the OS, but it could face challenges ahead. "Android's leadership of the global smartphone market looks unassailable at the moment. Its low-cost services and user-friendly software remain attractive to hardware makers, operators and consumers worldwide," Woody Oh, director at Strategy Analytics, said in the report. "However, several challenges remain for Google. The Android platform is getting overcrowded with hundreds of manufacturers, few Android device vendors make profits, and Google's new Pixel range is attacking its own hardware partners that made Android popular in the first place." Google released two devices last month – the Pixel and larger screen Pixel XL – in one of its biggest hardware pushes to date. At the time, analysts said that the search giant could risk antagonizing manufacturers reliant on its mobile OS. The fall in Apple's iOS shipments was expected but it's important to remember that the flagship iPhone 7 released in September was only on sale for a short time in this quarter and analysts are expecting an uptick in sales for the three months to December.

Is Apple working on a foldable iPhone? by Joe Roberts 03 November 2016 0 shares Read Comments We've heard a lot about the iPhone 8 already, despite the fact it's almost a year away, but what could Apple have in store for future iPhones? A newly published patent (via Patently Apple) gives us an idea, showing a smartphone made of nanotubes with a flexible seam that would allow it to be folded down the middle. Apple has previously filed similar designs, so this isn't the first we're hearing about a flexible device, but this is the first patent to specifically mention the iPhone. Related: iPhone 8 – Everything we know The report notes that the patent itself was filed under an engineer's name and not under Apple, to ensure it stayed under the radar until it was granted. Apple states in the patent that the design features a 'flexible portion', suggesting this isn't the kind of bendy smartphone design we've been hearing about in relation to Samsung, and that one of the materials that could be used in the device is ceramic. The patent also details how "Electronic devices may be provided with carbon nanotube structures or other structures based on carbon (e.g., graphene structures, carbon-fiber structures having carbon fibers other than carbon nanotubes, etc.). "...Conductive carbon nanotube paths can form signal paths that are flexible and resistant to cracking. The carbon nanotube structures may be incorporated into signal cables such as flexible printed circuit cables, rigid printed circuit boards, printed circuits that include rigid portions with flexible tails (sometimes referred to as "rigid flex"), portions of display structures, portions of touch sensors such as capacitive touch sensor arrays for displays or track pads, camera structures, antenna structures, housing structures, internal device structures, electrical components, substrates, brackets, housing walls, other structures, or combinations of these structures." Of course, a patent filing is far from a guarantee of a future product, and in this case a foldable iPhone is probably some way off. But it does show that not only is Apple working on the technology, it's considering it specifically for the iPhone, so expect more in the way of flexible smartphones in the future.

Credit: Lantern Photo File With the music world transitioning from buying albums into paying a monthly subscription for an unlimited streaming service, a handful of applications are beginning to stand out. Apple Music, Spotify and Tidal provide millions of subscribers access to virtually any song, from hip-hop to classical. According to Digital Music News, Spotify is the leading streaming service with 39 million paid subscribers. Apple Music has pulled 17 million paid subscribers. Tidal, which went online in 2015, is relatively new to the streaming scene, and holds 3 million paid subscribers. As a person whose bank account has hit the negatives because of a monthly subscription to a music service, I understand the pains and turmoils of shelling out nearly $10 a month for music. Here is a breakdown of each streaming service. Spotify Premium: $9.99/month or $4.99 with student discount It’s not a secret as to why Spotify provides 30 million subscribers with music — it’s just good. It’s very user friendly and its playlists curated by experts in the music industry are well-made. Each playlist is broken down into either a genre or a mood allowing the user to select something like “Chill” and find soft acoustic music or chillwave EDM. Many genres and moods have popular playlists that are updated weekly so the top of the playlists offers the newest popular songs. Each genre or mood selected also breaks down, giving recommendations for similar artists and user-created playlists. In addition, Spotify creates personalized playlists based on the user’s previous song choice called “Discover Weekly.” Spotify wins by incorporating a social networking aspect by partnering with Facebook where users can share what music they are listening to and follow other users. Spotify’s major downfall, however, comes from being a little late on getting the newest music available for its users. Examples include being a week late in releasing “Views” by Drake and 12 days late on “Coloring Book” by Chance the Rapper. Apple Music: $9.99/month or $4.99 with student discount Since the rise of streaming music, Apple shifted from offering only singles and albums on iTunes to creating the streaming service Apple Music. While Apple Music, like Tidal, was created in 2015, it has wasted no time in gaining popularity and subscribers, gaining 15 million in its first year. It’s strongest feature is Spotify’s weakest. It gives users immediate access to new music as many albums and singles are exclusively released on it first. “Views” was available on Apple Music alone for the first week after its release. Apple Music also offers a similar structure to Spotify for selecting playlists, but the curated playlists aren’t as good. Aside from their weekly updated “A-List” playlists, which offer the top songs trending on Apple Music in each genre, their curated playlists are lacking. They’re too short and don’t have enough recognizable songs. There are a few gems within the curated playlists such as a nostalgic ‘90s mix, but the best strategy for Apple Music is to download your favorite songs to your library and iCloud. TIDAL: $9.99 or $19.99 for TIDAL HiFi TIDAL gained popularity in February 2016 with its exclusive release of “The Life of Pablo” by Kanye West. TIDAL is owned by a hodgepodge of artists and musicians –– notable names include Jay Z, Beyoncé and Kanye West. It offers exclusive content to users and the content isn’t limited to just singles and albums. In April 2016, Beyonce released her second visual album, “Lemonade,” on TIDAL, which was streamed 115 million times in the week it was released. TIDAL also heavily promotes its “high fidelity music streaming” on par with CD-sound-quality music on its website. This feature is only noticeable if you listen through a quality pair of headphones, such as Bose or Beats by Dre. The free iPhone earbuds won’t cut it. a&l a+e apple music arts & life arts and life music music streaming opinion spotify streaming service tidal 2016-10-25 Mitch Hooper tweet Previous: Scarlet Scoop: Hillary Clinton continues campaigning in Columbus, OSU President Drake’s new appointment Next: ‘The Rocky Horror Picture Show’ keeps tradition of breaking rules Related Posts Columbus’ Own: Brothers get heavy in Columbus band Deathsong November 10, 2016 Jazz jams bring more than sandwiches to Subway November 9, 2016 Unchained fashion show to raise awareness of human trafficking November 7, 2016 Group focuses on photography as a developing art November 7, 2016 Gateway provides inclusive movie experience November 7, 2016 Listen Up: Musicians get out the vote November 7, 2016 One comment Music Paradise November 3, 2016 at 3:15 am Spotify is my favorite premium music streaming service.

This is one-quarter of the price of a new iPhone and a long way from the regular earpods, which are priced at Rs 2,500. It all comes down to whether Indians will be comfortable spending so much on a set of wireless earphones. The premium pricing of the AirPods could be a turn-off even for a section of the elite buyers. This is true considering the fact that high-end wireless headsets and earphones can be procured for prices starting Rs 3,000. The Airpods have also received mixed reactions over their comfort, design, price and the futuristic technology.

Nick Sas - The West Australian on November 3, 2016, 2:19 pm Share Tweet Whatsapp Email Share iPhone7 v Google Pixel v Sony Xperia ... who wins? - The West Australian Pinterest Tumblr Apple v Google v Sony: it is the battle of the tech heavyweights. Stop Video Replay 2:45 iPhone7 v Google Pixel v Sony Xperia ... who wins? UP NEXT VIDEO The West Australian iPhone7 v Google Pixel v Sony Xperia ... who wins? All three have released flagship smartphones over the past two months, and all three are grappling to get your attention. That’s not unusual in the gazillion-trillion dollar smartphone market (that’s the technical term for it) but it’s even more important now because of the big power vacuum left by Samsung’s exploding Note7 range. And, for this reviewer at least, Google’s Pixel phone is ready to suck up the void — and then some. Only the 3000-odd emails... The three phones next to each other It is better than the iPhone7 — there, I said it. After having both for about two weeks now I can confidently say that, overall, the Pixel is a better (I can already hear the Apple fanboys/girls girls battering away on their keyboards in outrage). That’s not to say that the iPhone 7 is a bad phone. It isn’t. In fact, it’s amazing. The improved camera (on the 7-plus at least) has a depth of field option which kinda makes me question why I just spend $1000 on a new mirrorless FujiFilm camera; it is insane. The back of the three phones, note Pixel’s home button It is “waterproof” (I use the quotation marks as I’m not game to test it out), has more memory and is still the easiest-to-use smartphone on the market. But the most annoying thing about the iPhone7 is, undoubtedly, the no headphone jack. I JUST DON’T GET IT. I reckon I’ve been caught out at least 15 times over the past two weeks, attempting to plug my headphones into the lightning port and just going: “ahhh . . . crap”. NOte the glorious headphone jack on the Pixek phone It is so annoying, and annoying and Apple are two words that generally don’t go together. It is also unnecessary: why not have an option for a headphone jack? Sure, the speaker is louder now - but who’s listening to music on a smartphone loudspeaker these days apart from annoying teenagers on the bus/train? The annoying factor was one the reasons I decided to transfer over to the Pixel . . . for the time being. The camera is better, IT HAS A HEADPHONE JACK and Google being Google, they just know how to make something work for you. Google assistant, Pixel’s answer to Siri, is actually pretty practical and it looks great. The home button on the back takes a little getting used to, and rather than being totally waterproof it is “splash resistant”. A side view As for Sony’s Xperia, I just can’t do it. Again, it has a great camera and of the three, it looks the best. But, personally, I just find it too complicated. I had real trouble doing something as simple as logging on to wi-fi at work, as it failed to recognise any networks. I had to reset it three times before it worked. That’s kinda frustrating. iPhone 7 Good : New camera, waterproof, extended battery Bad: No headphone jack, updates are minimal (its probably worth saving your money and choosing a 6s) Price: (7 Plus from $1269) Overall: “Apple fans will love it, and it is still a brilliant device, but for the extra money is it worth the upgrade?” PIXEL Good: Camera is insane, Google assistant is actually usable, processor is super-fast, great battery life. Bad: Home button on the back takes getting used to, splash resistant, not waterproof. Price: $1079 Overall: “Arguably the best Android phone on the market. A sensational debut from Google.” Xperia XZ Good: Camera is pretty good, looks great, 4k screen is superb. Bad: T errible battery life,'''''' for a non-Sony user it’s tough to get used to, side-finger print home screen is annoying. Price: $1000 Overall: “Looks good, has a great screen, but doesn’t have the juice of the other two.” Share Tweet Whatsapp Email Share iPhone7 v Google Pixel v Sony Xperia ... who wins? - The West Australian Pinterest Tumblr <p>Sorry, we can't show this content as your browser does not support iframes.</p> Latest News From The West WA photographers rose to supermoon challenge The Super Moon threw down the challenge and WA photographers accepted, delivering stunning images of their home illuminated by the lunar phenomenon.

The addition of the Touch Bar, that strip of touch sensitive OLED panel just above the keyboard, is something innovative for sure. But then, Apple went ahead and did a typically Apple thing – dumped all standardised ports in favour of four USB Type C Thunderbolt 3.0 ports. This has certainly not gone down well with a lot of professionals. Apple's fastest growing product category. pic.twitter.com/d1sel4N5Yc — Drew Breunig (@dbreunig) October 28, 2016 Like someone joked on Twitter, Apple’s fastest growing product category are its 17 adapters. Sure, the USB Type C port keeps future proofing in mind, but the dropping of USB Type A ports and an SD card slot are just ridiculous moves. Professional photographers who shoot a lot and want to quickly transfer images onto their MacBook Pro computers will have to get another adapter to transfer content from SD cards now. And yes, even though a lot of cameras support Wi-Fi image transfer, we all know how terribly annoying that process is. Dropping of ports aside, the entry barrier to the new MacBook Pros is quite high. The 13-inch base model, with Touch Bar, will start at Rs 1,55,900. Add in the cost of the adapters, you would need to go with these new MacBook Pros and you are looking at quite a high cost of ownership. And as we well know, Apple adapter don’t really come cheap. Investing in a 2015 MBP For those on the fence regarding investing in a brand new MacBook Pro, at their current price points, it is understandable. Not everyone is a Photoshop expert, a DJ or an FCP meister. A lot of MacBook Pro users are people who just want a powerful macOS based laptop. If you have a functioning older MacBook Pro, it just make sense to wait it out. As analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has pointed out, Apple MacBook Pro prices are expected to drop in 2017. And there are expected to be upgrades in the form of 32GB RAM and 7th generation Intel Core series processor. If your current Mac is over 3-4 years old and you are keen on just investing in a new MacBook Pro, then it makes more sense to go for the 2015 MBPs rather than the new ones. The top end 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display comes with a 4th gen Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD and you get an optional AMD card variant as well. It costs almost Rs 40,000 cheaper and it has all the ports you will need, so you save up on adapter costs. If you are looking for Windows based alternatives to the MacBook Pro, then here is a list of laptops you should be looking at. Sure, none of these come with something like a Touch Bar. Many may not even have a dedicated graphics processor. But they certainly offer a better value proposition than the new MacBook Pros. More importantly, you will not have to invest separately in multiple adapter accessories. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Although this a generation old, the Surface Pro 4 along with the Surface Type cover and Surface Pen, makes for a great alternative to the MacBook Pro. It features an excellent build quality, responsive keyboard, along with all the ports you may need to get work done. The 12.3-inch IPS LCD PixelSense display has a high resolution 2736 x 1824 pixel resolution with a 3:2 aspect ratio. This works out to a pixel density of around 267 ppi. We reviewed the base model that is selling in India, which houses the 6th generation Intel Core i5 6300U and is a dual-core, hyper-threaded part clocked at 2.5GHz. It comes with an Intel HD 520 graphics solution. The processor is paired with 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD storage. You can go for the higher end Core i7 variant as well. Other alternative to the Surface Pro 4 is the Surface Book, which has been refreshed now with longer battery life and more powerful specs. Only issue is that it doesn’t officially sell in India. Dell XPS 13 This was one of the best looking laptops we tested this year. Coming in a compact size despite its 13-inch form factor, the Dell XPS 13 packs in quite a punch. It houses a 6th gen Intel Core i7 6500U with Intel HD 520 graphics, 8GB RAM, 256GB NVMe SSD. In terms of ports and slots, you get two USB 3.0 ports, a mini displayport (USB Type-C based thunderbolt also available), an SD card reader, a 3.5mm combo jack and a Kensington lock port. There is also soft button on the left edge to check the battery status without having to open the lid. One of the USB ports is always on, which means you can charge USB based devices like a smartphone. Lenovo Yoga 900 Shown above is a Lenovo Yoga 900. Lenovo has been innovating on its Yoga series of products to an extent where event the ThinkPad lineup has a Yoga notebook. The Yoga 900 is Lenovo’s current flagship in its consumer segment of laptops. Yoga means the laptop can be used in a multi-mode arrangement. The Yoga 900 ultrabook measures just around 15mm thick when the lid is closed and weighs a mere 1.27kg. The Yoga 900 is powered by an Intel Core i7 6500U, a dual-core hyper-threaded CPU which has a base clock speed of 2.5GHz and a turbo boost frequency of 3.1GHz. It comes with 8GB RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. The 13.3-inch display has a 3200 x 1800 pixel QuadHD+ resolution. There are downward firing JBL Stereo speakers with Home Theatre certification. Coming to the ports, on the right hand side you have the USB 3.0 port at the top, followed by the 3.5mm audio jack, rotation lock key, reset button and the power button which has an inbuilt LED indicator. On the left hand side there the power port at the top followed by another USB 3.0 port, a USB Type C port with video out and finally an SD card reader. Acer Aspire S13 Acer’s Aspire S13 was easily one of the surprises this year. In our testing, we found it to be one of the best Windows ultrabooks out there. The hardware choice for the Acer Aspire is very sensible. You get a 15W Intel Core i7 6500U processor clocked at 2.5GHz (dual-core with HT), 8GB LPDDR3 RAM and a 512GB SSD. The screen resolution is a bit low at 1920×1080, but it’s enough for a 13.3-inch screen. You get two USB 3.0 ports, one on each side, a USB Type-C 3.1 port and HDMI output. You also get an SD card reader and 802.11ac Wi-Fi with MU-MIMO support, which is to be expected in this day and age. It is light-weight and high performance laptop, which can be your daily driver. HP Spectre  Image: IANS This is one the most gorgeous looking laptops out there. HP claims that it’s the world’s thinnest laptop and at 10mm thickness, it is difficult to argue. But despite the slim profile it packs in some high end goodies such as an Intel Core i7 6500U processor with 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD storage and Windows 10 Pro out of the box. There are two USB Type C Thunderbolt 3.0 ports and one USB Type C port for charging. But unlike the new MacBook Pros, HP bundles in the necessary adapters for USB, HDMI and Ethernet port. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon For a business user who does not have much need for the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon makes for a great alternative. ThinkPad X1 Carbon comes with an Intel Core i5 6300U with vPro features and Intel HD520 graphics. It clocked at 2.4GHz and is paired with 8GB of RAM. It also supports security features that are important in an IT setup, such as the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) encryption. It comes with 192GB Samsung M.2 SSD storage. In terms of connectivity, you get Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC, 3x USB 3.0 port, 1x HDMI port, 1x miniDP, a microSIM card and more. It has an impressive battery life and really good standby time for a Windows laptop. So there you have it, some Windows laptops you can consider if you are not really convinced about the new MacBook Pros. Do let us know if you think we missed out on any.

Nick Sas - The West Australian on November 3, 2016, 2:19 pm Share Tweet Whatsapp Email Share iPhone7 v Google Pixel v Sony Xperia ... who wins? - The West Australian Pinterest Tumblr Apple v Google v Sony: it is the battle of the tech heavyweights. Stop Video Replay 2:45 iPhone7 v Google Pixel v Sony Xperia ... who wins? UP NEXT VIDEO The West Australian iPhone7 v Google Pixel v Sony Xperia ... who wins? All three have released flagship smartphones over the past two months, and all three are grappling to get your attention. That’s not unusual in the gazillion-trillion dollar smartphone market (that’s the technical term for it) but it’s even more important now because of the big power vacuum left by Samsung’s exploding Note7 range. And, for this reviewer at least, Google’s Pixel phone is ready to suck up the void — and then some. Only the 3000-odd emails... The three phones next to each other It is better than the iPhone7 — there, I said it. After having both for about two weeks now I can confidently say that, overall, the Pixel is a better (I can already hear the Apple fanboys/girls girls battering away on their keyboards in outrage). That’s not to say that the iPhone 7 is a bad phone. It isn’t. In fact, it’s amazing. The improved camera (on the 7-plus at least) has a depth of field option which kinda makes me question why I just spend $1000 on a new mirrorless FujiFilm camera; it is insane. The back of the three phones, note Pixel’s home button It is “waterproof” (I use the quotation marks as I’m not game to test it out), has more memory and is still the easiest-to-use smartphone on the market. But the most annoying thing about the iPhone7 is, undoubtedly, the no headphone jack. I JUST DON’T GET IT. I reckon I’ve been caught out at least 15 times over the past two weeks, attempting to plug my headphones into the lightning port and just going: “ahhh . . . crap”. NOte the glorious headphone jack on the Pixek phone It is so annoying, and annoying and Apple are two words that generally don’t go together. It is also unnecessary: why not have an option for a headphone jack? Sure, the speaker is louder now - but who’s listening to music on a smartphone loudspeaker these days apart from annoying teenagers on the bus/train? The annoying factor was one the reasons I decided to transfer over to the Pixel . . . for the time being. The camera is better, IT HAS A HEADPHONE JACK and Google being Google, they just know how to make something work for you. Google assistant, Pixel’s answer to Siri, is actually pretty practical and it looks great. The home button on the back takes a little getting used to, and rather than being totally waterproof it is “splash resistant”. A side view As for Sony’s Xperia, I just can’t do it. Again, it has a great camera and of the three, it looks the best. But, personally, I just find it too complicated. I had real trouble doing something as simple as logging on to wi-fi at work, as it failed to recognise any networks. I had to reset it three times before it worked. That’s kinda frustrating. iPhone 7 Good : New camera, waterproof, extended battery Bad: No headphone jack, updates are minimal (its probably worth saving your money and choosing a 6s) Price: (7 Plus from $1269) Overall: “Apple fans will love it, and it is still a brilliant device, but for the extra money is it worth the upgrade?” PIXEL Good: Camera is insane, Google assistant is actually usable, processor is super-fast, great battery life. Bad: Home button on the back takes getting used to, splash resistant, not waterproof. Price: $1079 Overall: “Arguably the best Android phone on the market. A sensational debut from Google.” Xperia XZ Good: Camera is pretty good, looks great, 4k screen is superb. Bad: T errible battery life,'''''' for a non-Sony user it’s tough to get used to, side-finger print home screen is annoying. Price: $1000 Overall: “Looks good, has a great screen, but doesn’t have the juice of the other two.” Share Tweet Whatsapp Email Share iPhone7 v Google Pixel v Sony Xperia ... who wins? - The West Australian Pinterest Tumblr <p>Sorry, we can't show this content as your browser does not support iframes.</p> Latest News From The West WA photographers rose to supermoon challenge The Super Moon threw down the challenge and WA photographers accepted, delivering stunning images of their home illuminated by the lunar phenomenon.

By: Tech Desk | Published:November 3, 2016 10:15 am Apple AirPods: The shipments could be delayed to January 2017, claim reports. (Source: AP) Apple’s AirPods, the wireless headphones which were showcased at the launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, are yet to hit the stores. In India, the AirPods will be priced at Rs 15,400, but there’s no word on when these are officially launching in the country. Now it appears the shipments are delayed further in the US, and according to some reports, the AirPods are looking at a January 2017 timeline for shipping. According to a report in Economic News Daily, which is quoted by DigiTimes, Inventec which is the manufacturer for Apple’s AirPods, is expected to see a boost in revenue around the January period over Apple’s AirPods order. The report says Inventec’s revenues will rise 7 per cent on year and it cites market sources for these numbers. In an official statement to TechCrunch, an Apple spokesperon also confirmed a delay in the shipments, saying the response for AirPods has been ‘incredible’, but they don’t “believe in shipping a product before it’s ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.” Also read: Apple iPhone 7 Plus review: Buy it just for the camera, but that’s not the only great feature However, another report in AppleInsider claims while Apple has missed the October deadline for shipments, there won’t be any delay to January. According to the report, an Apple retail source confirmed to the website they have demo pairs ready and are waiting for the “word to start.” The report says the AirPods should go on sale soon and there won’t be a January delay. Apple’s AirPods are not the only ones facing a shipment delay. In India, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus seems to be unavailable in most offline retail stores as well as online. With AirPods, Apple has taken its first step in wireless headphones. Apple killed the 3.5 mm headphone jack, and the AirPods are a new way of connecting to the device. The pods come in a really small charging case, and Apple claims they have 24 hour battery life. Apple’s AirPods work as a pair when you put them in your ears and start pairing with all iOS devices through iCloud once they are out of the charging box. Apple’s AirPods will also connect with Siri by double tapping on one of the pods. Sensors on the AirPods know when you are listening to music and will automatically play or pause your music. The AirPods are powered by Apple’s new ultra-low power W1 chip. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaChill sets in early: Oppn moves to corner Govt, PM Modi hits back, says his decision troubles them IndiaKadak like my chai, rich don’t like it: PM Modi on demonetisation IndiaNo regrets, but govt addressing inconvenience, says Venkaiah Naidu IndiaPakistan says seven of its troops killed in Indian fire at LoC IndiaPanama Papers: 415 Indians under scanner as probe widens EntertainmentIn Bigg Boss 10, Bani is the most selfish contestant: Navin Prakash opens up after eviction EntertainmentKoffee With Karan 5: Twinkle Khanna's shocking revelations on the KJo's show EntertainmentITA Awards 2016: Mouni Roy, Shabbir Ahluwalia emerge big winners, see pics, video EntertainmentSalman Khan is spoiling nephew Ahil and Arpita Khan Sharma has proof, see pics Must Read SportsIndia vs England: Slow to adopt, now learning on the job SportsBCCI gets Lodha approval to pay Rajasthan players SportsRanji Trophy 2016: More brain than brawn TechnologyDemonetisation: Now, a tool to find ATMs with money across India TechnologySamsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 model numbers leaked TechnologyDemonetisation effect: Here's how to sign-up for Paytm, Mobikwik and use the e-wallets  Guru Nanak Jayanti 2016: India celebrates Gurpurab with great fanfare Nov 15: Latest News US President-elect Donald Trump could return Iraq war boosters to power Punjabis react to Trump’s decision to deport illegal immigrants: ‘May affect economy, hit unscrupulous travel agents’ Securities and Exchange Commission Chair leaving at end of Obama administration INLD hits out at Congress, BJP for ‘doublespeak’ Punjab, Haryana should resolve SYL issue amicably: BJP union minister Narendra Singh Tomar                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

Senior VP of worldwide marketing told in an interview today that the new MacBook Pros has received more orders than any Pro MacBook before. It's an indicator that even with a raving passionate dialouge about the pros and cons of the new MacBook Pro ongoing, Apple isn't bucking down and neither are the Apple loyalists. iFixit gave the 13-inch MacBook Pro without the OLED Touch Bar its signature teardown treatment and inside, it found a lot has changed since the last MacBook Pro. The smaller and thinner design still makes the MacBook Pro extremely difficult to repair, but iFixit reported it has become a little easier as compared to the 2015 MacBook Pro. The new MacBook Pro received a repairability score of 2 out of 10, while its predecessor got a 1 out of 10. For starters, the proprietary pentalobe screws make opening the gadget difficult. The battery is now smaller, but Apple claims it still provides the 10-hour battery life. However, Apple has made the battery irreplaceable by using superglue. The folks over at iFixit found it really difficult to jack it open, even with their specialized iOpener. It is also costlier to repair as the Retina display is a fused unit. There is no protective glass over it and if something goes wrong with the display, the entire assembly has to be changed. The 8GB RAM too is soldered to the logic board, so if you need more memory for your tasks, Apple will make you buy a more powerful variant, the one with the OLED Touch Bar. The PCIE-SSD flash storage can now be easily replaced than the previous generation MacBooks. Also, Apple has used a custom SSD controller which gives insane read speeds of 3.1 gigabytes per second and write speeds of 2.2 gigabytes per second, which is 100 per cent faster than the previous generation. The storage too is now higher at 256GB and Apple uses four 64GB SanDisk NAND drives to provide the storage. The battery has been made 25 per cent smaller from 74.9Wh on the 2015 model to 54.5Wh to the current base model. But Apple touts it to have the same 10-hour battery life. Not surprisingly, the 3.5mm headphone jack on the new MacBook was a last moment decision, iFixit notes. It comes taped to the bottom of the fan in a modular unit, which means Apple could easily replace it with the Lightning port in future generations. During the launch, Apple's top marketing exec Phil Schiller praised the Butterfly 2.0 keyboard. The mechanical keys now have a small bump underneath the keys. The keys themselves are now taller around the edges for a more springy feedback. Lastly, the entry-level also gets the larger ForceTouch trackpad powered by same Taptic engine found in the new iPhone 7. It is made out of ferromagnetic coils that form an electromagnet which is used to create the haptic feedback you feel when using the new trackpad. The coils are used to vary the feedback based on the use case. Credits: iFixit Apple recently announced the prices for the new MacBooks for India, even though it didn't mention a release date yet. The 13.4-inch MacBook pro minus the Touch Bar will be priced at Rs 1,29,000 while the 13-inch MacBook Pro with the trackpad will start from Rs 1,55,900 and the higher end 15-inch MacBook Pro will start from Rs 2,05,900. Meanwhile, Apple also bumped up the prices of the 2015 MacBook Pro lineup by up to Rs 10,000.

(Stephen Lam/Reuters) Share Written by Steve Blank Obsession The Office November 02, 2016 In January 2000, after running Microsoft for 25 years, Bill Gates handed the reins of CEO to Steve Ballmer. Ballmer went on to run Microsoft for the next 14 years. If you think the job of a CEO is to increase sales, then Ballmer did a spectacular job; he tripled Microsoft’s sales to $78 billion and doubled profits from $9 billion to $22 billion. The launch of the Xbox and Kinect, and the acquisitions of Skype and Yammer happened on his shift. If the Microsoft board was eager only for quarter-to-quarter revenue growth, Ballmer was as good as it gets as a CEO. But if the purpose of a CEO is long-term company survival, then one could make a much better argument that Ballmer was a failure as a CEO the moment he optimized short-term gains by squandering long-term opportunities. How to miss the boat—five times Despite Microsoft’s remarkable financial performance during these 14 years, Ballmer and the rest of Microsoft’s leadership failed to understand and execute on the five most important technology trends of the 21st century: search, smartphones, mobile operating systems, media, and cloud. Microsoft left the 20th century owning more than 95% of the operating systems that ran on computers (almost all on desktops). Fifteen years later, 2 billion smartphones have shipped worldwide, and Microsoft’s mobile OS share is just 1%. These misses weren’t just in some tangential markets—missing search, mobile, and cloud were directly where Microsoft users were heading. Yet a very smart CEO missed all of these. Why? Execution and organization of core businesses It wasn’t that Microsoft didn’t have smart engineers working on search, media, mobile and cloud. They had lots of these projects. The problem was that Ballmer organized the company around execution of its current strengths—Windows and Office. Projects not directly related to those activities never got serious management attention or resources. For Microsoft to have tackled the areas they missed would have required an organizational shift toward becoming a services company. Services (cloud, ads, music) have a very different business model, and they are hard to do in a company that excels at products. Ballmer and Microsoft failed because the CEO was a world-class executor of an existing business model trying to manage in an industry of increasing change and disruption. Microsoft executed its 20th century business model extremely well, but great short-term gains don’t make up for far less compelling long-term prospects. In 2014, Microsoft finally announced that Ballmer would retire, and in early 2014, Satya Nadella took charge. Nadella got Microsoft organized around mobile and the cloud (Azure), freed the Office and Azure teams from Windows, killed the phone business, and released a new version of Windows without the usual trauma. He’s also placing resources into exploring augmented reality and conversational AI. While it’s likely that Microsoft will never regain the market dominance it had in the 20th century, Nadella likely saved his company from irrelevance. What’s missing? Visionary CEOs aren’t just responsible for world-class execution of a tested and successful business model—they’re also world-class innovators. Visionary CEOs are product and business-model centric, and extremely customer focused. The best are agile and know how to pivot, making substantive changes to their business models before their markets have shifted. One of the best examples of a visionary CEO is Steve Jobs, who transformed Apple from a niche computer company into the most profitable company in the world. Between 2001 to 2008, Jobs reinvented Apple products three times, and each transformation—centering around the iPod and iTunes in 2001, the iPhone in 2007, and the App Store in 2008—drove revenue and profits to new heights. And that brings us to the Apple we’ve known for the last few years, and its CEO, Tim Cook. Why Tim Cook is the new Steve Ballmer One of the strengths of successful CEOs is that they cultivate a team of world-class operating executives. But in a company driven by a visionary CEO, there can only one visionary. This type of CEO surrounds himself with extremely competent executors, but rarely any disruptive innovators. While Steve Jobs ran Apple, for example, he alone drove Apple’s vision and chose to place strong operating execs in each domain—hardware, software, product design, supply chain, manufacturing—who can translate his vision into plans and procedures. When visionary CEOs depart from companies, the operating executives who reported to them believe it’s their turn to run the company, often with the blessing of the former CEO. At Microsoft, Bill Gates anointed Steve Ballmer, and at Apple, Steve Jobs made it clear that Tim Cook was to be his successor. Once in charge, one of the first things these new execution-oriented CEOs do is to get rid of the chaos and turbulence of their organizations. Execution CEOs value stability and reproducible processes. On one hand, that’s fantastic to promote predictability, but on the other hand, it often also ignites a creative death spiral in which creative employees start to leave the company in search of a new environment. This culture shift ripples from the top down, and what once felt like a company on a mission to change the world now feels like any other job. The parallels between Gates and Ballmer and Jobs and Cook are eerie. Apple under Cook has doubled its revenue to $200 billion while doubling profit and tripling the amount of cash it has in the bank (now a quarter of a trillion dollars). The iPhone continues its annual upgrades with incremental improvements. Yet in five years the only truly new product that’s managed to ship is the Apple Watch. And somehow, with 115,000 employees, Apple can barely get annual updates out for its laptops and desktop computers. But the world is about to disrupt Apple in the same way that it disrupted Microsoft. Apple brilliantly mastered user interface and product design to fuel the iPhone’s rise to dominance. But Google and Amazon are betting that the next wave of computing products will be AI-directed services—machine intelligence driving apps and hardware. Think of Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Assistant, all powered by smart, conversational artificial intelligence; most of these products will belong to a new class of devices scattered around your house, not just on your phone. It’s possible that betting on the phone as the platform for conversational AI may not be the winning hand. It’s not that Apple doesn’t have any irons in the fire in conversational AI—heck, Siri was one of the first. It also has autonomous car projects, AI-based speakers, and augmented- and virtual-reality labs. The problem is that a supply chain CEO who lacks a passion for products and has yet to articulate a personal vision for Apple is ill-equipped to make the right calls to bring a revolutionary product to market. Challenges for a board of directors in the 21st century The dilemma facing the boards at Microsoft, Apple, or any company on the departure of an innovative CEO is strategic: Do they still want to be a innovative, risk taking company, or do they want to focus on the execution of core business models, reducing risky bets and maximizing shareholder return? Steve Jobs and Bill Gates (as well as the 20th century’s other creative icon, Walt Disney) shared the same blind spot: They suggested execution executives as their successors. They confused world-class execution with a passion for products, customer experience, and market insight. One reason is that if a board of directors decides its company needs another innovator at the helm, you can almost guarantee that the company’s best executor—the No. 2 or 3 vice president in the company—will leave feeling overlooked. Now the board is faced with not only having lost its CEO, but potentially the best of its executive staff. But as companies grow larger and management falls prey to the fallacy that only need to maximize shareholders’ short-term return on investment, companies become risk averse. Large companies and their boards live in fear of losing what they spent years gaining (customers, market share, revenue, profits). This may work for some stable markets and technologies. But very few of those remain today. In a startup, the board of directors realizes that risk is the nature of new ventures and innovation is why they exist. On day one there are no customers to lose, no revenue and profits to decline. Instead there is everything to gain. In contrast, large companies are often risk-averse engines—they are executing a repeatable and scalable business model that spins out the short-term dividends, revenue, and profits that the stock market rewards. And an increasing share price becomes the reason for existing. The irony is that in the 21st century, the tighter you hold on to your current product/markets, the likelier you will be disrupted. (As articulated in the classic Clayton Christensen book The Innovators Dilemma, in industries with rapid technology or market shifts, disruption cannot be ignored.) Increasingly, a hands-on product/customer, and business model-centric CEO with an entrepreneurial vision of the future may be the difference between market dominance and Chapter 11. In these industries, disruption will create opportunities that force “bet the company” decisions about product direction, markets, pricing, supply chain, operations, and the reorganization necessary to execute a new business model. At the end of the day, CEOs who survive embrace innovation, communicate a new vision, and build management to execute the vision. This post originally appeared at SteveBlank.com.

The Kouga Express, in conjunction with Strongbow, is giving away three six-packs of Strongbow Apple Cider (Gold Apple, Red Berries and Original Dry) valued at R200 each. To enter, email your age and email address to kougaexp@media24.com. The word Strongbow must appear in the subject line. No under 18s are allowed to enter. The competition ends at noon on November 10, 2016. The largest, most widely sold cider brand in the world, Strongbow Apple Ciders hit South African shores this August 2016. The brand brings with it a new type of energy, with generations’ worth of knowledge and expertise in real orchard apple harvesting, pressing and cider-making. This is amplified with a refreshing product design and an array of delicious, natural variants. With the timely arrival of the “perfect cider”, Strongbow wants to encourage South African consumers to mix nature back into their urban surroundings – right where it belongs. Strongbow is set to lift the existing cider category with more variety and choice for local consumers - including a new taste profile and fantastic aromas like Gold Apple, Original Dry and Red Berries. From the orchard to the glass, the Gold Apple tastes sweet and golden with a crisp kick, a hint of green apple and a long, bittersweet finish. The Red Berries taste of hard cider with Strawberry and Elderberry flavours, a hint of lemon notes, and an apple finish. The Original Dry taste profile delivers a crisp, uplifting and bittersweet finish. “South Africa is thirsty for a cider made from real orchard apples complemented by a natural, unforgettable taste profile,” says Marcel Swain, Marketing Manager for New Brands. “All of this is backed up by more than 125 years’ experience in cider-making.” As part of its unique take on harnessing the positive energy of urban living, Strongbow wants to encourage the people of South Africa to take the lead, feel rejuvenated and inspired in their city, while experiencing natural refreshment.

But Apple has stiff competition this year. Samsung has unveiled a gem of a camera in Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, and on top of that, at this moment, iPhone 7's biggest competitor for the best camera is Google's Pixel phone. Let's look at the specifications first. Both the phones use a 12 MP Sony sensor, of different kinds, in the rear. While the iPhone 7 Plus relies on dual cameras, Pixel and Pixel XL have singular cameras. In the front, iPhone 7 sports a 7 MP Facetime HD camera, while Pixel has an 8 MP camera. First off, iPhone cameras have always been great and this year is no exception. As Apple's global marketing VP Phil Schiller explained at the keynote event, iPhone 7 is using a new 6-stage lens. The new sensor has an f/1.8 aperture which allows a lot more light to be captured, as compared to the iPhone 6's f/2.2 aperture. I have taken many photos from the iPhone 7 plus and they have come out great. The white balance -- a measure to tell how a white object, in reality, looks in the photo -- is a bit on the lower side of the spectrum, but shadows are very well captured. Since Apple cameras have a tendency to produce warmer colours, the result pleases the eyes. Technically, the phone is capturing a wider colour gamut than before but the difference is negligible in most cases. iPhone 7 Photos iPhone 7 Photos 1 of 12 Share this slide: Google Pixel's camera also has a 12 MP Sony sensor with f/2.0 aperture. At the keynote event, the company proudly showed off its DxoMark rating of 89. While this sensor is similar to the one used in Nexus 6P, improvements have been made. For instance, there is the sensor HDR which means that there is hardly any post processing needed after a shot has been taken. And, the picture is ready to use within seconds. The Google camera uses the smart burst to take 9 pictures and picks the best of the lot. The Pixel camera is great and has amazing sharpness and contrast. But sometimes the HDR has a tendency to over-blow the details and it kind of sticks in the eyes. Google Pixel Photos Google Pixel Photos 1 of 10 Share this slide: Additionally, the iPhone 7 has introduced Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) in both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus while Google is mainly relying on software processing with Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS). Here is where it makes a difference. Since both cameras are ultra fast, you can click many pictures in a minute. The shutter lag in both is almost non-existent. Yet, when you are clicking the photos quickly, the iPhone 7 photos come out better because of the three-axis stabilization. On the other hand, the level of detail in Google Pixel camera is better. There is a lot going around the objects that is captured. Even in a crowded food plate, you can distinguish items very well in a Pixel photograph. With out flash.

There is hardly any difference between the smaller phones in each brand. The iPhone 7 uses only digital zoom but its processing is much better. The real play starts in the bigger phones, where iPhone 7 Plus has a 2x optical and 10x digital zoom. Pixel's zoom feature, on the other hand, is not something you would enjoy using too much. iPhone 7 plus zoom hardly has any competition from Pixel. And this is a digital 10x zoom. pic.twitter.com/e79rV6RrRD — Ivan Mehta (@IndianIdle) October 24, 2016 iPhone 7 Plus. 1x, 2x, 5x and 10x zoom. pic.twitter.com/OSvT8KwTBv — Ivan Mehta (@IndianIdle) October 15, 2016 In low-light imaging, Pixel seems to have the upper hand as it tends to identify people and objects better to merge them with HDR processing and carve out a better result. With out flash. Left :iPhone 7 plus Right:Pixel XL @sahilk @gsforever22 pic.twitter.com/bkUs0U6ckJ — Ivan Mehta (@IndianIdle) October 18, 2016 With its dual camera setup, iPhone 7 has a wide angle lens with f/1.8 aperture and a telephoto lens with a f/2.8 aperture, which helps in capturing objects at a distance well. Apple has introduced a portrait mode as well that creates a shallow depth of field around an object, using both the cameras for a 'Bokeh' like effect. Sure, the effect is not as impressive as a DSLR camera's but the company has promised a lot of enhancements through the software. iPhone 7 special effects iPhone 7 special effects 1 of 5 Share this slide: Google Pixel can create a similar 'lens blur' effect by capturing an object and moving the camera upwards later for better depth. Although the end result is not as good as what is produced by the iPhone 7 Plus camera. Both phones are capable of producing 4k videos at 30 fps and the slow motion 240 fps videos with 720p quality. One major thing to consider here is that Pixel gives you unlimited photo and video storage. So, you don't have to hold back on shooting 4k videos on Google's phone. The front cameras in both phones turn out pretty well for the everyday selfies and video calls. Overall, both the phones are top notch in terms of their cameras delivering top performance. The preference will lie in the eyes of the beholder, literally, as both follow different colour schemes. While Google relies more on software processing, Apple is giving hardware a push.

The EV charging app will help allay ‘range anxiety’ by providing real time information that EV drivers can easily access to plan their journey. Designed to help drivers locate Vector’s charger stations across Auckland, the intention is to expand it so that charging stations across the country can be included. Compatible with Apple and android devices, the free app allows drivers to find and get directions to EV chargers, see whether it is a standard or rapid charger and whether it is compatible with the vehicle’s port type. Users can also filter to search for charger stations by port type, type of charger and availability. It also provides other essential information such as the live status of Vector’s rapid chargers so that drivers know if they are available or already in use before getting there. Vector welcomes owners of other charging stations to contact them with the details of their charging stations for inclusion in the app. Vector has 20 EV charger stations on its rapidly expanding network and has plans to install another nine rapid chargers and five standard chargers in the coming months. To download the EV charging app please go to the Apple Store or Google Play (play.google.com) Network summary for week ending 30 October 2016 Electricity There were two car v pole incidents over the past week in Epsom and in Devonport.

Join For Free Introduction Developers have been able to schedule notifications on iOS for a long time, but previous APIs lacked the fine-grained control you might have wanted. Fortunately, Apple has addressed this in iOS 10 and released the new UserNotifications framework. This provides you with a far richer API and simpler scheduling for both local and remote notifications. A local notification is one that is scheduled by your application, e.g. a reminder to take your lunch into work. A remote notification is usually triggered by a server and passed to Apple’s APNS service which handles the pushing of the notification to the users’ devices, e.g. to broadcast to your users that a new version of your App is out. The Project This project was developer using Xcode 8 Beta 6. To take a look at the new User Notifications framework, we’ll build a simple app which allows users to schedule an alert for a task they need to do. The notification will be displayed every 60 seconds and will repeat until the user cancels the reminder. As always, the code is available on GitHub. A loudspeaker indicates a notification is currently scheduled whilst a loudspeaker with a line through it indicates no notification exists for that task. We’ll add the ability for the user to respond from the notification itself: The UI Our application is just a simple tableview that displays a list of task the user may want to be reminded about. Other than a simple custom cell, there’s not much more to it than that. The tasks are defined like so within our NagMeTableViewController: class NagMeTableViewController: UITableViewController {
  typealias Task = String

  let tasks: [Task] = [
      "Wash Up",
      "Walk Dog",
      "Exercise"
  ]
  // Rest of class
 Our table view is populated with the tasks and each cell is setup to call a closure when the mute/unmute button is toggled. // Rest of NagMeTableViewController
  override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
    let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "TaskCell", for: indexPath) as! TaskCell

    let task = tasks[indexPath.row]

    cell.nameLabel.text = task

    // Set the cell's icon to indicate whether notification exists or not
    retrieveNotification(for: task) {
        request in
        request != nil ? cell.showReminderOnIcon() : cell.showReminderOffIcon()
    }

    // Closure invoked when button tapped
    cell.onButtonSelection = {
        [unowned self] in
        self.toggleReminder(for: task)
    }

    return cell
  }

  override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
      return tasks.count
  }
}
 To determine if the user is currently being ‘nagged’ about a task, we call retrieveNotification(for: task) which we’ll define later. If a notification object exists then we know the user has requested to be notified about the task. When the cell’s button is tapped, we’ll call another method we’re yet to implement called toggleReminder(for: task). This is where the magic will happen to schedule our notifications. Requesting Authorization Before we can schedule notifications, we need to request permission from the user to show notifications. We’ll do this when the app launches: func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
  UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.sound, .alert]) {
    granted, error in
    if granted {
      print("Approval granted to send notifications")
    }
  }
}
 This results in an alert being displayed to the user asking if they’ll grant our application permission to send notifications. The closure parameter granted indicates whether we were granted permission at this time. The alert is only displayed to the user once, but if they later decide to alter their notification settings, they can do this within the Settings app. You’ll notice that a lot of the User Notification framework’s API take a completion block. This is because requests to your application’s UNUserNotificationCenter are executed asynchronously on a background thread. Calling current() results in the framework returning the notification center object for our app. All our scheduling and removing of notifications will be done via this singleton instance. Creating Notifications It’s a bit of a mouthful to create and add the notification, so we’ll break the function down and walk through it: /// Creates a notification for the given task, repeated every minute.
func createReminderNotification(for task: Task) {
  // Configure our notification's content
  let content = UNMutableNotificationContent()
  content.title = "Task Reminder"
  content.body = "\(task)!!"
  content.sound = UNNotificationSound.default()
  content.categoryIdentifier = Identifiers.reminderCategory
 To configure the appearance of the notification, we use an instance of UNMutableNotificationContent. We set the title and content to be displayed to the user in our banner. Additionally, we specify that when the notification appears, the default notification sound should play, however you can specify a custom sound should you wish. Finally, we set a categoryIdentifier which will come in handy later when we want to attach custom actions to our notification.   // We want the notification to nag us every 60 seconds (the minimum time-interval Apple allows us to repeat at)
  let trigger = UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger(timeInterval: 60, repeats: true)
 A trigger is used by the notification center to decide when it’s time to show the alert. If no trigger is supplied, then the notification is delivered immediately. There are a few different types of trigger: UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger : Enables notification to be sent after the specified time interval. Can repeat the time interval if required. UNCalendarNotificationTrigger : Notifies user using date components e.g. trigger at 8am. It can also be repeated. UNLocationNotificationTrigger : Adds ability to trigger when the user enters or exits a particular location. We use UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger for our purposes and set it to repeat every minute.   let identifier = "\(task)"
 Our application allows the user to schedule notifications for each task in the tasks array. The identifier allows us to (you guessed it) identify which task our scheduled notification is associated with.   // Construct the request with the above components
  let request = UNNotificationRequest(identifier: identifier, content: content, trigger: trigger)
 Using all the components above, we create our UNNotificationRequest object which encapsulates all information required for our notification. We’ll then pass this to the notification center for scheduling:   UNUserNotificationCenter.current().add(request) {
    error in
    if let error = error {
      print("Problem adding notification: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
    else {
      // Set icon
      DispatchQueue.main.async {
        if let cell = self.cell(for: task) {
            cell.showReminderOnIcon()
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
 If the notification was added without any problems, we update the cell displaying the task to show the icon that indicates the reminder is on. Note that we need to switch back to the main thread to make changes to our UI. This is because the completion block is called on a background thread. Retrieving Notifications We used a helper function earlier to retrieve an existing notification. The new notifications API makes this extremely simple to do: func retrieveNotification(for task: Task, completion: @escaping (UNNotificationRequest?) -> ()) {
  UNUserNotificationCenter.current().getPendingNotificationRequests {
    requests in
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
      let request = requests.filter { $0.identifier == task }.first
      completion(request)
    }
  }
}
 As with the previous completion handler, we need to switch back to the main thread. Hooking up our Notifications When configuring each table view cell to display, we were calling a toggleReminder function to create or remove a notification for the task that was just tapped. We’ll implement this now: func toggleReminder(for task: Task) {
  retrieveNotification(for: task) {
    request in
    guard request != nil else {
        // Notification doesn't exist, therefore schedule it
        self.createReminderNotification(for: task)
        return
    }

    // Remove notification
    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().removePendingNotificationRequests(withIdentifiers: [task])

    // Now we've muted the notification, let's set the cell's icon to reflect that.
    if let cell = self.cell(for: task) {
        cell.showReminderOffIcon()
    }
  }
}
 We schedule a notification if request is nil, as that must mean a notification doesn’t currently exist. Otherwise, we remove the pending notification by passing the notification center the task’s identifier (e.g. ‘Exercise’ or ‘Walk Dog’) and update the icon to display the notification has been ‘muted’. Nice work! We now have a notification that buzzes every 60 seconds until the user turns it off by navigating to our application and finding the task. However, it’d be great if we could give the user the opportunity to cancel the repeating notification from the notification itself… Adding Actions We can add this ability by using ‘notification actions’. These allow users to swipe down on a notification banner, or swipe left on the notification in the lock screen to reveal these actions. You can add up to four actions (although, on some devices Apple says only the first two may be displayed due to screen-size constraints) and each action is encompassed in a ‘category’. func addCategory() {
  // Add action
  let cancelAction = UNNotificationAction(identifier: Identifiers.cancelAction,
                                          title: "Cancel",
                                          options: [.foreground])

  // Create category
  let category = UNNotificationCategory(identifier: Identifiers.reminderCategory,
                                        actions: [cancelAction],
                                        intentIdentifiers: [],
                                        options: [])

  UNUserNotificationCenter.current().setNotificationCategories([category])
}
 We define our action as requiring the application to open when the action is tapped using the .foreground UNNotificationActionOptions. Additional options enable you to indicate an action is destructive or requires unlocking before being performed. We’ll call addCategory() within application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:). The identifiers are simple strings, which can result in notifications not working as you’d expect due to typos. I had one defined as “cancel” and another as “Cancel”, which took a while to track down and led me to create a simple struct where all identifiers could reside: struct Identifiers {
    static let reminderCategory = "reminder"
    static let cancelAction = "cancel"
}
 To be notified when an action was tapped, we need to conform to the UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate protocol. To keep things as simple as possible, we’ll just make our AppDelegate the delegate and we’ll assign it within application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:): UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self
 Now we can implement our action handlers: public func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
                                       didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse,
                                       withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {
  if response.actionIdentifier == Identifiers.cancelAction {
      let request = response.notification.request
      print("Removing item with identifier \(request.identifier)")
      UNUserNotificationCenter.current().removePendingNotificationRequests(withIdentifiers: [request.identifier])
  }

  completionHandler()
}
 We check that the reason this delegate method was called was due to the user selecting the action button (it’s also called when the user taps directly on the notification which we don’t want to act on). If it was, then we just remove the notification using the identifier. Finally, we need to call completionHandler to signify to the system that we’ve finished handling the response and it can carry on its merry way. Note: In Beta 6 there’s a bug with autocompletion for the above delegate method. If you get a warning saying something like: Instance method ‘userNotificationCenter(:didReceive:withCompletionHandler:)’ nearly matches optional requirement ‘userNotificationCenter(:didReceive:withCompletionHandler:)’ of protocol ‘UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate’ you should go to the delegate’s generated interface and copy the method from there. The autocompletion appears to miss off the @escaping annotation for the completion handler. So, we’re almost there. But what about showing our notification when the app is in the foreground? If we leave our project as it is, the notification will be silenced by the system. Let’s fix that quickly. Receiving Notifications When App Is in Foreground This is a welcome addition in iOS 10: you can now choose to display the notification when your app is in the foreground. To do this, it’s as simple as implementing one more delegate method and adding one line of code: func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
                                willPresent notification: UNNotification,
                                withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationPresentationOptions) -> Void) {
  completionHandler(.alert)
}
 In this case, we just tell the system that the notification should be displayed as an alert. Further Reading I hope that gives a good introduction to the power of scheduling local notifications with the new User Notifications framework. It looks like Apple have listened to the problems developers have had and come up with a pretty comprehensive API. Although we haven’t looked into handling remote notifications, the new framework should help there too as it brings local and remote notifications under the same API, thereby reducing code duplication. To learn more, you can watch the Introduction to Notifications from WWDC 2016. Again, feel free to have a poke around the sample project on GitHub.

Is Losing Global Smartphone Market Share Growth is coming from regions where the tech titan doesn't do well. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Nov 2, 2016 at 11:08PM iPhone SE could become Apple's emerging market play. Image source: Apple. Slowly but surely, the global smartphone market is growing again. Growth has undoubtedly decelerated in recent years, even dipping into negative territory for the first time ever earlier this year, as developed markets reached saturation and sales in those regions transitioned toward upgrades instead of first-time purchases, but there are still many parts of the world where adoption is low. Strategy Analytics has released its estimates for the third quarter on global unit volumes, and the market researcher estimates that worldwide shipments grew 6% in the third quarter to 375.4 million. Android continues to dominate the global landscape, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is growing its share at the expense of all other platforms. There were nearly 330 million Android handsets shipped, comprising 87.5% market share. Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) 45.5 million iPhones were good enough to grab 12.1% share -- down from 13.6% a year ago. All other platforms combined saw units fall 84%. Platform Q3 2015 Share Q3 2016 Share Android 84.1% 87.5% iOS 13.6% 12.1% Others 2.3% 0.3% Data source: Strategy Analytics. Specifically, unit growth is coming from emerging markets where adoption remains low, such as India and South Africa. Given Android's dominance at lower price points, it makes sense that the search giant is capturing these first-time adopters. Within the confines of Apple's premium pricing strategy, it's also trying to make iPhones more affordable, but the pricing disparity is still dramatic. Strategy Analytics notes that Apple didn't fare well in China or Africa last quarter. A second opinion The figures are comparable but slightly different than IDC's estimates that came a week ago. IDC pegged third-quarter units up just 1% to 362.9 million, with Apple grabbing 12.5% share. While Apple reported a 30% drop in Greater China revenue, local rivals like OPPO and vivo in the Middle Kingdom are enjoying breakneck growth. OPPO saw unit volumes surge 122% while vivo shipped about twice as many phones. Huawei also grew 23%, as its peers catch up. Apple losing global smartphone market share isn't really a new phenomenon, and it has never been the company's goal to ship the most units. The iPhone maker is still the most profitable handset manufacturer in the world, precisely because it refuses to compete on price alone. That being said, it's still discouraging to see Apple miss some opportunities in emerging markets, an area where it has long been weak. Maybe not now, but the iPhone SE has potential over time. At $400, the iPhone SE is the lowest price point that Apple has ever launched an iPhone at. That's still quite pricey in many emerging markets, where you can buy an Android smartphone for as low as $100, but think of the iPhone SE's $400 as a starting point. Over time, if Apple keeps the device in production and lowers the cost as it ages even further, it can become competitive. Still, with these estimates out, you have to wonder what Apple is talking about when it brags about high levels of Android switchers on every earnings call.

One of the ports that met its demise was the SD card slot, which to the annoyance of many was unfathomable. This Wednesday, Apple’s senior VP Phil Schiller explained why they removed it. “One, it’s a bit of a cumbersome slot. you’ve got this thing sticking halfway out. Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD,” Schiller said in an interview with The Independent. “And then more and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfers into the camera. That’s proving very useful. So we think there’s a path forward where you can use a physical adaptor if you want, or do wireless transfer,” he added. It’s true that more and more cameras now come with wireless transfer capabilities, but it has not become the standard yet, as pointed out by The Next Web. Consumers would also have to keep buying external card readers and dongles to physically transfer their photos from their cameras, which can also be a huge pain for many. Related Stories New MacBook Pro Sans Optical Digital Audio Output? Apple Is Testing OLED For Next MacBook Series The absence of the SD card slot on the new MacBook Pro has been a hot topic recently. Gaming laptop maker Razer came under fire yesterday for tweeting an offensive joke about the absence of an SD card slot on the new MacBook Pro, as reported by Polygon. Razer has deleted the tweet and has already apologized. With the new MacBook Pros completely replacing all ports with USB-C (with ThunderBolt 3 support), many are wondering why the 3.5mm headphone jack is still present on the new models while Apple decided to ditch it on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Schiller explained that the decision to keep the headphone jack on the new MacBook Pro isn’t inconsistent at all. He said that a lot of users still have studio monitors and other pro audio setups that require that particular port. Schiller also admitted that he was a bit surprised with the negative reactions toward the new MacBook Pro. He added that they took a “bold risk,” which means that there are changes to deal with moving forward. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

The EV charging app will help allay ‘range anxiety' by providing real time information that EV drivers can easily access to plan their journey. Designed to help drivers locate Vector's charger stations across Auckland, the intention is to expand it so that charging stations across the country can be included. Compatible with Apple and android devices, the free app allows drivers to find and get directions to EV chargers, see whether it is a standard or rapid charger and whether it is compatible with the vehicle's port type. Users can also filter to search for charger stations by port type, type of charger and availability. It also provides other essential information such as the live status of Vector's rapid chargers so that drivers know if they are available or already in use before getting there. Vector welcomes owners of other charging stations to contact them with the details of their charging stations for inclusion in the app. Vector has 20 EV charger stations on its rapidly expanding network and has plans to install another nine rapid chargers and five standard chargers in the coming months. To download the EV charging app please go to the Apple Store or Google Play (play.google.com) Network summary for week ending 30 October 2016 Electricity There were two car v pole incidents over the past week in Epsom and in Devonport.

However, there are some things about the new laptops that the Cupertino giant did not disclose during its launch event.  According to AppleInsider, Apple’s new 13-inch MacBrook Pro does not have support for optical digital audio output that was present in the 3.5mm headphone jack of its 2015 predecessor and earlier. This feature enables users to connect the MacBook to devices like DVD players, computers and video game consoles for a surround sound experience.  Based on the technical specifications of the 13-inch and the 15-inch MacBook Pros, they come with a 3.5mm headphone jack. The listing does not include “support for audio line out (digital/analog),” and this could only mean that both models do not have optical digital audio output support.  Related Stories Apple Is Testing OLED For Next MacBook Series Surface Book vs. MacBook Pro 2016 — Which Is Better? Apple Rolls Out New iOS 10.2 Beta It appears Apple is getting rid of support for this kind of technology, since it was also found out that even the Apple TV (third and fourth generations) are also void of TOSlink connector and are instead sporting USB-C ports. Explaining why it has ditched TOSlink or optical digital cable support, the Cupertino giant said that the feature was not being used by many consumers and that there’s already information to prove that “plenty of USB-C zero-latency professional peripherals” with optical audio out connectivity are coming to the market soon.  Aside from AppleInsider’s discovery, there’s also a recent revelation about the MacBook Pros that is making headlines. Unfortunately, the tech giant has removed the SD slot on the new laptops. Speaking with The Independent on why they decided to ditch the SD slot, Apple’s Phil Schiller said, “One, it’s a bit of a cumbersome slot. You’ve got this thing sticking halfway out … And then more and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfer into the camera. That’s proving very useful. So we think there’s a path forward where you can use a physical adapter if you want, or do wireless transfer.” Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Just two days after releasing its first macOS 10.12.2 beta to developers, the tech giant is now rolling out the second beta build of the upcoming software update. According to AppleInsider, this new build is just a minor incremental update, but it does come with several bug fixes. The bugs that this new beta is capable of crushing are still unknown at this point. Perhaps developers or Apple itself would be sharing a list a day after.  What is known about the new macOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta for now is it comes with the same emojis that were uncovered in the recently rolled out iOS 10.2 beta. It can be noted that when iOS 10.2 beta was released, it was reported that it came with Unicode 9 characters. Thus, developers can expect the same thing form the new macOS beta.  Related Stories Apple Rolls Out New iOS 10.2 Beta watchOS 3.1 Found To Boost Battery Life Is Apple Discontinuing The iPad Air Series? Listing some of the emojis found in the betas, MacRumors stated that new characters include face palm, selfie, crossed fingers, croissant, avocado, owl and shark, among many others. The Apple-centric news site also indicated that both macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and iOS 10.2 betas update existing emojis by enhancing them with more details for a more realistic look.  MacRumors also specified that the beta build for the new beta is 16C32f, while the previous one had 16C32e. The tech site stated that based on the build codes, the new one could not be considered a full second beta build. This explains why the new beta is still labeled as macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Beta 1 and not Beta 2. Nevertheless, the new beta is expected to bring under-hood fixes and performance improvements. It is already available for download over-the-air for registered developers who are getting the beta for the first time. It is not being rolled out via the Mac App Store.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Apple iPhone 8 Latest News and Rumors: 3 iPhone Versions, Specs and Features, Release Date By Neal A. Lasta Nov 2, 2016 | 10:22 AM Even though the Apple iPhone 7 has just been released, rumors about the iPhone 8 have already been surfacing. Many fans speculate that this version of the iPhone will be released next year. The following are some of the rumors related to what surprises the future Apple iPhone 8 has in store for its users. 3 iPhones Sold This Year Many technology news websites said that Apple will release three versions of the iPhone next year. While that may seem a lot, it is worth noting that Apple actually released three versions this year, so the idea isn't that farfetched. First is the Apple iPhone SE. SE stands for Special Edition, a version which is very popular in Eastern countries and in Africa. Second and third are the flagship smartphones, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit As Apple continues to reach out to consumers on a tight budget, it seems reasonable to expect that 3 versions of the iPhone will also be sold next year. Perhaps an iteration of the iPhone SE along with the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus will be sold. In China, Huawei and Xiaomi Oppo products are selling fast, with features similar to iPhones at much cheaper prices. Because of this, Apple sales in the region are affected. To improve sales, Apple may have to call for a change of strategy when it comes to pricing in these regions. Specs and Features One of the more prevailing rumors about the iPhone 8 is an all-glass casing. This will be a revolutionary look to the iPhone look we've gone accustomed to. Aside from the all-glass casing, the iPhone 8 is said to also have a metal frame which will hold the front and back parts in place. The Apple iPhone 8 is also rumored to employ OLED technology in its screens. It will also come in 3 different sizes: 4.7-inch, 5-inch and 5.5-inch screens. It will also have both light and eye sensors for added security. The iPhone 8 will also come in 3 memory options; 64 GB, 128 GB and 256 GB. RAM allotment comes in two varieties: 4 GB RAM and 8 GB RAM. It is also expected to have wireless charging, and in general, improved touch feedback features. Release Date It's hard to make a guess when it comes to the release date of Apple iPhones in general. But that doesn't stop analysts from guessing. One of the most reasonable guesses is that the iPhone 8 will be released in September 2017, just in time for the tenth anniversary of the Apple smart phones.

Annie Apple continued her criticism of the Giants on Wednesday in a story she wrote on SI.com as a follow-up to her displeasure with the organization’s handling of the Josh Brown domestic violence case. Annie Apple, who wrote last week about being the victim of domestic violence, said she was “livid” with the Giants, not only because of how team owner John Mara addressed the situation earlier — when he told WFAN that Brown “admitted to us that he’s abused his wife in the past. And I think what’s a little unclear is the extent of that” — but also because she felt the team was putting pressure on her son to handle the situation. “I was livid with the Giants, not just because of John Mara’s comments but I was disappointed in the organization because I felt they were leaning heavily on a 21-year-old kid in an effort to control what his mother says,” Apple wrote. She added that no one from the Giants organization reached out to her after her criticisms, which also left her disappointed. And she said she didn’t attend the Giants’ win over the Rams in London.

Eli Apple's balancing act after mom rips Giants over Josh Brown “At that moment I just couldn’t cheer for a team I felt had turned its back on what was right to protect an image,” Apple wrote. “It was difficult because I love my son and I’ve always been in his corner at every game, but for me, this was bigger than a game.’’ Annie Apple’s story was published after Eli Apple addressed the media Wednesday, but last week the rookie said of his outspoken mother, “She’s her own person and she’ll do whatever she’s going to do.’’ It seems clear she likely will remain a thorn in the side of the Giants for the foreseeable future. “When Black Eli got drafted, everyone raved about what a great organization the Giants are,” Annie Apple wrote. “I was proud. I wanted my then 20-year-old son to go to a team that would help him grow not just his talents, but as a man and person. I believed the hype. I even drank the sugar-free blueberry Kool-Aid. By Friday in London, I was spitting it up.’’ Filed under annie apple ,  eli apple ,  new york giants Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Sheldon Richardson admits his Jets reality: I'm 'odd man o...

Schiller and David Phelan of The Independent discussed a wide range of MacBook-related topics, including the evolution of Apple’s laptop lineup, why there is no touchscreen MacBook, and Siri on the Mac. What interested me most of all though, was Phelan’s two follow-up questions posed after the initial interview: How would you describe the response to the new MacBook Pro? There has certainly been a lot of passionate dialogue and debate about the new MacBook Pro! Many things have impressed people about it, and some have caused some controversy. I hope everyone gets a chance to try it for themselves and see how great the MacBook Pro is. It is a really big step forward and an example of how much we continue to invest in the Mac. We love the Mac and are as committed to it, in both desktops and notebooks, as we ever have been. And we are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before. So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it. Are you surprised by how vocal the critics have been? To be fair it has been a bit of a surprise to me. But then, it shouldn’t be. I have never seen a great new Apple product that didn’t have its share of early criticism and debate — and that’s cool. We took a bold risk, and of course with every step forward there is also some change to deal with. Our customers are so passionate, which is amazing. We care about what they love and what they are worried about. And it's our job to help people through these changes. We know we made good decisions about what to build into the new MacBook Pro and that the result is the best notebook ever made, but it might not be right for everyone on day one. That’s okay, some people felt that way about the first iMac and that turned out pretty good. Schiller’s message is clear. Apple took a risk with its new MacBook Pros, is confident in its decision, is committed to both desktops and laptops, and cares about its critics’ concerns. That said, by emphasizing that the MacBook Pro has had record online sales, Schiller is also suggesting that the MacBook Pro’s critics are a vocal minority.

By: Prajith Sabbani Updated: Thursday, November 3, 2016, 7:13 [IST] Apple launched the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus recently and both of them were criticised severely to be just an underwhelming iteration of their respective predecessors. And the removal of essential features one would want on a smartphone such as a headphone jack made things only worse for the Cupertino giant. SEE ALSO: These 5 Changes in Apple iPhone 8 Will Surprise You for Sure [iPhone 8 Leaks] Until it brings more innovation to the table, people won’t stop questioning its liability for being the innovative company it was previously.

Recently, we’ve reported that the iPhone 8 will be launched in not two but three size variants with a 5-inch iPhone variant joining the family. In addition, it is rumoured to go back to the glass and metal sandwich design as first seen on the iPhone 4 and 4s variants along with the curved display.

She says they go there every day after school and read the picture book “I Need My Monster.” Credit Amir Levy for The New York Times Every day after school, 4-year-old Nicholai Rose demands that his mother take him first to the park then to the Barnes & Noble in the Baychester neighborhood of the Bronx. There, they snuggle in a corner in the children’s section and, each time, read “I Need My Monster,” his favorite picture book. In a few months their ritual will end — permanently — when the store closes for good, leaving the Bronx, a borough with nearly 1.5 million people, without one general-interest bookstore. For residents, the closing carries a painful sting the borough knows too well, of being long underserved and overlooked, which persists even as the Bronx is experiencing a renaissance. “How am I going to tell him that the bookstore is going?” said Nicholai’s mother, Shauna Rose, 29, as she sat in the store on Wednesday, the monster book on her lap. “And there’s nothing else.” With 50,000 titles in its inventory, the Barnes & Noble opened in the Bronx in 1999. Two years ago, it nearly closed after the landlord sought to raise the rent. But it remained open after a public outcry, and after elected officials stepped in to assist in the rent negotiations. It has withstood the economic crunch that shut down smaller bookshops in the borough over the years. While there are a few bookstores in the Bronx attached to various universities and some stores that sell religious texts, the Barnes & Noble remains the last of its kind, until it closes in January, because of a rent increase. It will replaced by a Saks Off 5th store. Acclaimed Novels and Memoirs That Call the Bronx Home While Brooklyn and Manhattan might be better known from book titles, the Bronx has been home to famous authors and host to venues that provided them with their muse. The decision has provoked another round of outrage, laced with deep resentment and a sense of loss. Christina Tipiani, 23, a student who lives in the Soundview section of the Bronx, bemoaned the closing as she browsed books with her daughter Gabriella Padilla, 3. “We have enough clothing stores,” she said. “What do you want to teach your children? I want to teach my child actual values.” . Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story The move, she said, is out of touch with the area’s needs: “We can’t even afford Saks clothing!” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The loss contributes to a long-held sense that the Bronx is still shunned, even as its years of blight, arson and rampant crime are long past. Property values across the borough have steadily climbed, its population is rising and investment by developers in the South Bronx, once a national symbol of urban decay, hopes to turn the waterfront area into the city’s next hip neighborhood. But the Bronx remains the poorest county in the state, and one of the poorest in the United States, and it is often left in the cold by retailers. In October, a consortium of Bronx politicians sent a letter to Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, noting that the Bronx is the only one of New York City’s five boroughs without an Apple store. They asked for one to be built. A spokeswoman for Apple declined to discuss whether the company had plans for a store there. It was reported on Wednesday that Apple had signed a lease to open another store in Brooklyn, in the Fort Greene neighorhood. Barnes & Noble said in a statement it fought to remain open in Baychester but could not afford the higher rent sought by the landlord. As for what might happen in the future, the company said it was committed to reopening in the Bronx at some point. But the impending bookstore desert goes beyond the loss of a single store. Photo The only Barnes & Noble in the borough, which opened in the Baychester neighborhood in 1999, will close in January. Credit Amir Levy for The New York Times “I really do think that there is a preconceived concept that folks that live in the Bronx, they’re not interested in reading, or that they are going to steal everything,” said Claudette Mobley, 72, a retired nurse, as she browsed the aisles of the store. “We are just as interested in knowledge and reading as anybody else. We just don’t have the access to the things that the rest of New Yorkers do.” David Sax, an author who writes about the importance of physical spaces and establishments, including bookstores, said the closing of the Barnes & Noble was a blow to civic pride. “Bookstores are located in neighborhoods and areas that are intelligent, elegant, intellectually curious,” he said. “So for the Bronx, there is a sense of a loss of self-worth — beyond that if you lose a sneaker shop — that they weren’t good enough, smart enough to deserve books.” Samuel Portè, 27, an urban planner who lives in the Marble Hill section of Manhattan, was at the Barnes & Noble, buying a book on entrepreneurship. “It’s a disservice to the community to not give them books of all natures,’’ he said. “It’s a shame to close down a bookstore where the elderly, where kids, where college students go to seek out knowledge. It’s people up top not taking a feel for what the community actually needs, just thinking about the bottom line, what makes the most money.” New York Today Sign up to receive the latest on local news, arts, sports, dining, style and more, delivered to your inbox every morning.

In recent years there has also been a nationwide resurgence of independent bookshops. Still, the news is not necessarily all bad, said Todd Dickinson, the president of the board of the New Atlantic Independent Booksellers Association, a regional trade group. “It looks to me that the Bronx missed out on the revival,’’ he said, “but that to me means there is an opportunity, rather than reflecting badly. It means there is potential.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Bronx has 35 branches of the New York Public Library, with a collection of 1.7 million items, an increase of 16 percent during the past 10 years to meet the demand of readers. Standing in the fantasy section at the Barnes & Noble, Kim Laird looked around a place she had been visiting for 17 years. She said there was something special about owning a book, explaining that since she was little, she had bought about one book every week there. “For me, reading is just an escape, books were my escape to a different world that I would probably never get to see in my lifetime,” Ms. Laird said. “For me, that’s what this store was.” Ms. Laird, 23, who lives near the store and plans to attend graduate school, signed a petition to try to keep the store open. “This fostered my imagination, this created worlds for me, this let me see even realities — to go to Europe without leaving my room,” she said. “This for me was my ticket to my way out,” Ms. Laird added. “And now it’s gone.” Correction: November 3, 2016 An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of an author who writes about the importance of physical spaces. He is David Sax, not Dan. A version of this article appears in print on November 3, 2016, on page A22 of the New York edition with the headline: Resentment in the Bronx as a Bookshop Is Set to Close.

This mysterious bug is known to have been around for some time now, but its presence is not strongly felt by owners until recently.  According to MacRumors, the mysterious Apple TV bug disables several menu options such that only the Computers, Music and Settings options are appearing when the device is switched on. This means affected units cannot show Netflix, Hulu and all of the other Apple TV channels.  Owners of second- and third-generation Apple TVs are reportedly taking to Reddit and MacRumors' own online forums to share their concern and disappointment over this problem. Making the situation worse is the lack of any stopgap to counter the issue, while Apple has yet to release an update to address it.  Related Stories Will.I.Am And Kendall Jenner's Wireless Earbuds Buttons Launch On Apple Store For $229 A Camera Strap For Your Apple Watch Apple Rolls Out New iOS 10.2 Beta Based on the things users were sharing, restarting the device and even resetting the router or the Apple TV itself won’t fix the problem. There are users who claimed that changing DNS settings fixed the issue, but others who tried to do the same thing said it did not work for them.  The bug appears to only affect the second- and third-generation Apple TV units. The fourth-generation does not show signs of having the same problem. It’s also good that Apple has already promised to release a software update as soon as possible to crush the bug.  The news comes almost a week since Apple introduced its new Apple TV guide app called “TV” during the launch event for its new MacBook Pros. The app is designed to bring a unified experience for discovering and accessing content from multiple apps.  Unfortunately, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves told CNBC’s “Power Lunch” on Monday that patronage for the TV app seems bleak. "I think the challenge that Apple has here is it's really hard to become the front end when you don't have the services that people watch. And without Netflix and Amazon ... as part of that app, I don't think anybody's going to tune in,” the analyst was quoted as saying.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

However, one thing the tech giant glossed over was the laptop’s omission of the SD card slot.  Unlike the headphone jack funeral held during the iPhone 7 announcement, Apple didn’t spend any time mourning the removal of the SD card slot. This left many to speculate whether the omission of this crucial port was due to Apple’s vision of an all USB-C world. Or, perhaps the laptop was just too thin for it to be integrated. Compare this with Microsoft's Surface Studio efforts Well, today, Apple finally broke its silence on the matter. In an interview with The Independent, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller explained the company decided to remove the SD card reader because it’s a nuisance and wireless transfer is good enough. Here’s the full quote below: "Because of a couple of things. One, it’s a bit of a cumbersome slot. You've got this thing sticking halfway out. Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD. So we could never really resolve this – we picked SD because more consumer cameras have SD but you can only pick one. So, that was a bit of a trade-off. And then more and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfer into the camera. That’s proving very useful. So we think there’s a path forward where you can use a physical adaptor if you want, or do wireless transfer." I’m sorry, Mr. Schiller, but you are completely wrong.  Because of a couple of reasons. First, Apple is in full control of designing a slot that can eat the entire card or have just a nub stick out on the back of the slot.  Second, CompactFlash was already on its way out and rapidly replaced by SD cards by the time the card reader was first introduced in 2009 with the first 13-inch MacBook Pro. Today, CF cards are rarely used and not found on most camera bodies, except the Canon 5D Mark IV and the Nikon D5. Finally, while wirelessly transferring photos from cameras has become increasingly easy, transporting images over the air to a computer is more complicated even if it's available on Sony and Canon cameras. Modern cameras are designed to create their own wireless network to connect to smartphones, but this functionality doesn't extend to computers. Instead, users need to connect both the camera and their laptop to an existing wireless network, a luxury that won't always be available in the field. What’s more, the images being transferred are often compressed JPEG when creative professionals need to transfer large RAW files. The 42.4MP Sony Alpha A7R Mark II, for example, produces files that are 63MB at a minimum, and the latest Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II produces RAW images averaging around 20MP. These files are only bound to get bigger as Medium Format Cameras begin to rise while the APS-C standard rises to 24MP and full-frame sensors regularly go above the 50MP limit.  And that’s just the still photography. The 4K footage and 1080p movies Apple hopes its users will edit with Final Cut Pro X on the Touch Bar can’t be wirelessly transferred to the new MacBook Pros, either. Some argue that it’s the camera manufacturers that need to adapt to the times and introduce faster data ports than a mini/micro USB 2.0 port. It’s a fair point. I just reviewed the first and only camera to feature USB-C, the OM-D E-M1 Mark II, and it’s baffling it’s taken this long for the new-fangled connector to appear on a camera when it seems like the perfect adopter.  However, one problem with transferring images and video over a wired connection is that it is very power consuming. If you ask any photographer or videographer to choose between burning through a battery to transfer files for 30 minutes or shoot all day, they would all almost pick the latter.  As a photographer and videographer myself, it’s hard to justify the cost of the new MacBook Pro even with its revolutionary Touch Bar. There’s a wide selection of Windows 10-powered machines to choose from that are just if not more powerful than Apple’s latest laptop and equipped with an SD card slot no less. So honestly, save yourself a lot of grief and get a Surface Book or another production machine today.

The faulty models cannot access the majority of the channels except the following sections: computers, settings and music. The owners of the affected Apple TV units can no longer access Hulu, Netflix and the rest of the channels because the menu options have stopped displaying. Although this kind of bug has been around for quite some time now, it has become prominent the past couple of days. MacRumors says that they have received a number of complaints from owners of the malfunctioning Apple TV devices. The major issues that affect the units include the following: the inability of the Apple TV device to reboot, the incapacity to reset the router and the disabled resetting of Apple TV unit. Although a change in the region settings seems to offer a quick fix, the channels would still eventually disappear overtime. Changing the DNS settings also worked for some of the affected Apple TV owners, but not all. One complainant told MacRumors that he is unable to access the main menu setting, rendering the device unusable. He said that he has tried restarting both his Apple TV and AirPort Extreme devices as well as inserting all his info into his iCloud account, all to no avail. “There's absolutely nothing in there as an option. It obviously is logging onto the Internet since I was able to connect my iCloud account. One other strange thing is that my iTunes won't recognise the Apple TV when I plug it in directly to my Mac mini via a USB cable. It just doesn't show up,” he said. Although not all Apple TV devices are hounded by the mysterious bug, it is considerably extensive. Only the second and third generation Apple TV units are affected by the issue. The fourth gen models are working seamlessly. According to MacRumors, an Apple representative has said that a solution is imminent and that a software update is on the way.

RocketNews24 Bringing you yesterday's news from Japan and Asia, today. RocketNews24 Japanese TOP » Japan » Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen singer to release 20-track album featuring brand-new songs Featured Weird Studio Ghibli Jobs Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen singer to release 20-track album featuring brand-new songs Casey Baseel Nov 3, 2016 Tweet Is Piko Taro about to go from one-hit wonder to 20-hit wonder? It’s pretty safe to assume that Japanese comedian Kosaka Daimaou has never been more squarely in the spotlight than he is right now. “Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen,” the song Daimaou performs under his Piko Taro musical persona, has become an international hit, and now he’s riding that wave of popularity to the release of his first full album. While it’s titled PPAP, there’s more to the album than just the title track. In total, 20 songs are planned to be part of the collection, featuring both previously released works and brand-new tunes. The list of currently confirmed songs is: ● Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen ● Romita Hashimikov ● Piko Taro’s Theme ● PLEASE LET ME BORROW THEM ● NEO SUNGLASSES ● I Love Daikon Pickled in Salted Rice Yeast ● Hey… ● Get the Sweets Together and Become a Star ● Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen – Long Version Let’s take a look at a few of them, in case you’re not familiar with Piko Taro’s non-“PPAP” library. Like the artist’s biggest hit, “NEO SUNGLASSES” is pretty easy to sing along to, since it only has two lyrics: kurai (“dark”) and akarui (“bright,” but, with the characteristic Piko Taro panache, officially rendered as “dazzling” in the video). At one minute and 35 seconds long, “PLEASE LET ME BORROW THEM” is an epic ballad compared to Piko Taro’s briefer songs, but that’s because it has so much to say. The lyrics translate to: Please let me borrow 100,000 yen (US$970) I’ll pay you back 50,000 yen I’ll pay you back next weekend I’ll pay you back 50,000 yen Please let me borrow your car I’ll sell it on Yahoo! Auctions I’ll pay you back 50,000 yen With the money I get from selling it on Yahoo! Auctions Two versions of the album will be offered, one with the CD by itself, and the other bundled with a music video DVD. However, if you’re a true Piko Taro fan, you’ll want to get both releases, since the CD-only album includes a special 30-minute track, “The Piko Taro One-Man At-Home Concert.” Meanwhile, the CD/DVD bundle comes with Piko Taro dress-up mustache stickers and a kids’ size Piko Taro costume apron (preordering gets you an adult-sized apron too). A release date has yet to be announced, but the album’s producers are no doubt looking to strike while the iron is hot. As such, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the album on sale by the end of the year, which would make it a great Christmas gag gift, or a serious one if you happen to know someone who earnestly appreciates Piko Taro’s musical stylings.

Called “Head-Mounted Display Apparatus For Retaining A Portable Electronic Device With Display,” the patent details a device similar to Samsung’s Gear VR headset, although this design appears to favor smaller phones and customers who wear glasses. If you’re not familiar with how the Gear VR headset works, it depends on a smartphone to provide a huge portion of the hardware to generate a virtual experience. The headset itself provides the lenses, a proximity sensor, a touchpad, a Home button, a Back button, and a wheel to sharpen the focus for each user. The phone itself plugs into a built-in jack and snaps in front of the lenses, controlling the touchpad and buttons. Audio is produced through the phone’s headphone jack, not the headset itself. What’s great about Gear VR is that it supports Samsung’s larger phones, like the Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, which has a 5.7-inch screen. However, Apple’s solution would depend on a smaller screen. Based on the patent, if customers insert a “Plus” size iPhone, the system will display the content smaller than the actual screen, and possibly in a lower resolution, depending on the proximity of the user’s eyes. “The system is not limited to displaying one image frame,” the patent states. “In some cases, it may be beneficial to provide multiple redundant image frames (dual image frames) in order to implement stereo-like viewing. In cases such as these, the image frames may be displayed at two locations within the display screen. The timing or image characteristics of the dual image frames relative to one another may be varied to provide an enhanced viewing effect.” As seen in the diagram above, the company illustrates what appears to be a heavy set of glasses rather than an engulfing headset. The arms (312) play host to built-in, dangling earphones (316) resembling the pair that comes with the company’s iPhone. There’s also a head strap (310) connected to the arms to keep the glasses secure against the wearer’s head, and to possibly hold on to the specs when they’re slipped off for a moment. Other ingredients shown in the illustration detail the camera region on the front (306), a speaker mounted on the temple (308), and an area for ports to connect external devices (314). Additional connectors or jacks are mounted on the side (320) just below a strip of buttons (318) for navigation, display adjustment, volume, playback, and more. The separate hand-held device (322) represents a remote control, such as the company’s own Apple Remote. Related: Apple making major augmented reality push, CEO Tim Cook confirms As for where all the hardware is installed, that’s in section 324, as shown in the image. This area will contain memory, sensors, the processor, communications circuity, battery, and so on. Actually, the patent states that these regions can be scattered throughout the form factor, inside or out. Hopefully, that doesn’t mean we’ll be sitting with a pair of glasses on our face sporting long, Wi-Fi antennas like corny couch potatoes from outer space. “In one example, they are placed in the lower sections on the right and left of the nose support region of the main body,” the patent states. “This section would otherwise not be used because of the configuration of the portable electronic device.” Apple is seemingly taking a step up from Samsung’s Gear VR headset to provide a sleek solution for iPhone owners that sports its own rechargeable battery. This is just a newly landed patent, of course, and doesn’t mean a solution will hit the market anytime soon. Also watch: It’s Apple vs. Microsoft all over again: who’s best now?

I have tried all types of wearables from the basic step trackers to the complex Android Wear. Over the past year, the Apple Watch has been way up there when it comes to smartwatches. The Apple Watch, despite emerging as the second largest watch brand in the world in value, has not really been perfect. With the Apple Watch Series 2, there seems to be a serious effort to get nearer to perfection. The Apple Watch 2 is not different on the design front, though Apple has roped in some new variants like the ceramic. It is still a stylish, good-looking watch that you would want to wear without the whole world looking at your wrist. Also, the basic Apple Watch bands are the most comfortable to wear over a long period of time, especially if you are the type that likes to take wearables to your bed. What is good? I have used the first Apple Watch on and off during the past year. It’s a great device for keeping track of your activity and being ahead of your notifications. However, I needed to use only a third of the watch’s functionality. But with the actionable complications and app dock in Watch OS 3, I ended up using the apps more. Now I tap on the activity icons on the watch face to see my steps or heart rate, avoiding multiple swipes and taps like before. Also, I can easily switch to my favourite app and not go to the app screen which I still find very complicated. I was caught in a deluge while on a recent trip to Kochi. With any other wearable I would have quickly taken the band off and slipped it into my pocket. But the Apple Watch 2 is waterproof and intelligently so. It has speaker holes which can be taken in water, but there is also a neat functionality that uses a certain frequency of sound to dispel any moisture that might have come inside the device. And being soaked does not affect the performance one bit. Apple has launched a new set of watch faces which are very stylish. But they also utilise the abilities of a smartwatch better. There are the screen now that show you a lot of information, each actionable on a single tap. The new processor is faster than before and you can feel it. The slight wait for apps to open on the first version is now gone for good. Apps load instantly and switching between apps is a breeze too. The Watch 2 comes with GPS. So it can track your route even if you don’t have the phone with you. However, to save battery this feature is not kept on all the time, but only when you have selected an outdoor run or walk. And when the phone is nearby, it will use the GPS on the phone as default. I found the new breathe feature really handy in coping with stress at work. It helped me relax and refocus on work and not get stressed all over again. The battery life has improved. There have been days when I have squeezed out close to 22 hours. This is the brightest display on pretty much any device at the moment. So no squinting to read under a bright sun. What is not that great? The Apple Watch still takes close to 90 minutes to reach full charge. So if you have forgotten to keep the watch on the dock overnight or at least early in the morning, you have an issue. The app screen on Watch OS is still something I fail to comprehend, at least at first glance. It is rarely that you have the information there or open an app from there. Apple needs to figure out a better way. The Apple Watch is smart enough to understand what you are doing and log it likewise. However, it does not switch off the GPS if you have completed your outdoor activity and I realised I am not smart enough to do it myself at the end of walks. This could be something Apple could work on. Verdict Given the build quality and sheer usability, the Apple Watch 2 is now the best smartwatch out there. Buy this is if you want to make a style statement and a lifestyle statement. For me, the Apple Watch, especially the satisfaction of seeing those full rings at the end of the day, has been a good motivating factor that helped me lose a couple of kilos after many years.

Even Pay for a Massive Media Acquisition? Or any blockbuster megadeal, for that matter. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Nov 2, 2016 at 6:21PM CEO Tim Cook at Apple's October 2016 Mac event. Image source: Apple. The market price for media content creators is on the rise. As telecommunications giants continue scooping up content plays in an effort to take over more of the value chain while fending off being relegated to dumb pipes, content companies are seeing themselves enjoy premium valuations. The biggest and most recent example is AT&T's (NYSE:T) current pending acquisition of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), a massive $85.4 billion deal that was announced less than two weeks ago. Ahead of that announcement, there were reports that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had considered making an offer and had discussed possible business combinations with Time Warner, which owns HBO and CNN, among other valuable media assets. Speculating on Apple acquisitions is essentially an investing pastime at this point, and over the years many have suggested that Apple should acquire dominant online video streamer Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Here's a recent argument in favor of such a deal by Stratechery analyst Ben Thompson. Hopefully he doesn't mean that literally Investors used to be able to rule out most acquisition speculation immediately based on the implied deal size, pointing to Apple's history of only making small, targeted acquisitions that were predicated on innovative technology that could be integrated into future products. The smaller, the better, as Apple would often subsequently shut down the target's business, since those revenue streams would be negligible relative to Apple's consolidated financials. This has changed in recent years under CEO Tim Cook, who will no longer rule out a potential deal based on size provided that it's the right strategic fit. Cook has expressed this many times, most recently on the earnings call last month: We are open to acquisitions of any size that are of strategic value where we can deliver better products to our customers and innovate more. And so we look at a whole variety of companies, and based on that, we choose whether to move forward or not. But we're definitely open and we definitely look. The "any size" part is actually kind of terrifying, since the last thing I want as an Apple investor is for the company to start making Microsoft-esque blockbuster acquisitions that come back to attack the balance sheet. The largest acquisition that Apple has ever made was Beats for about $3 billion, which itself was about six times larger than any prior known acquisition. Now that larger deals are seemingly on the table, investors have to actually start considering the implications of any potential megadeal. When we start talking about massive media-related acquisitions in the U.S., how would Apple even consider paying for it? But at what cost? For the record, Apple is not interested in getting into a bidding war over Time Warner, according to CNBC. The initial reports said Apple only had preliminary talks that never really proceeded in a meaningful way, either. AT&T doesn't have to worry about Apple cutting in here. But there are still other fish in the sea, such as aforementioned video streamer Netflix. Netflix's current enterprise value is about $54 billion. As a quick refresher, enterprise value is a relevant metric for potential acquisitions, particularly if the target company has debt since the acquirer would need to acquire that debt net of cash. Enterprise value is calculated as a company's market cap plus the market value of debt minus net cash. $1 billion can buy a lot of Bojack Horseman episodes. Image source: Netflix. That $54 billion figure wouldn't include the $1 billion in debt that Netflix raised after the close of the quarter to fund original content production. The offering has no immediate impact on enterprise value, since the cash received will equal the debt issued, but as Netflix spends the cash that it received while maintaining that long-term debt, its enterprise value will rise even further. After the offering, Netflix should have about $3.4 billion in long-term debt. Any acquisition of Netflix would conservatively cost at least $60 billion, and Apple doesn't have that kind of money laying around stateside. At the end of last quarter, Apple had "just" $21.6 billion in domestic cash, with the remaining $216 billion being held by foreign subsidiaries. So particularly for any potential U.S.-based deal of this magnitude, cash funding really isn't an option. Bad and worse The other two options would be taking out a massive amount of debt to fund a megadeal, or doing an all-stock transaction. Neither sound appealing. For example, let's just say Apple needs $50 billion to do some deal. Apple has been accumulating copious amounts of debt in order to fund its share repurchase program. If you also include commercial paper that Apple uses for working capital purposes, Apple now has $87 billion in total debt. The notion of Apple taking on another $50 billion in debt (which would itself be the largest debt offering in history) to pay for a megadeal does not sound realistic or attractive, even if Apple's balance sheet could theoretically handle it. Conversely, issuing $50 billion in stock would also be a terrible idea. For starters, any acquirer that is highly confident in a deal should structure the deal in all cash, so that any subsequent value creation is fully captured by the acquirer and its shareholders. Structuring a deal with stock transfers some of the risk to the target and its shareholders, should the acquisition not work out well. More importantly, issuing that much stock would be extremely dilutive to shareholders. That amount would translate into over 450 million new shares, representing about 9% dilution relative to the current 5.39 billion shares outstanding. It would also negate much of the share repurchase program that Apple has aggressively implemented, where it has bought back $133 billion worth of stock over the past four years. It's hard to fathom Apple making an acquisition of this size, jumping from a historical high price of $3 billion to anything even approaching $50 billion. But based on Cook's comments, we have to think it through now. The best-case scenario would be a tax repatriation holiday, which would allow Apple to refill its domestic coffers at low tax rates. Apple has been lobbying Congress for this for years, but even without it Cook might still repatriate billions of dollars next year, setting aside billions more for taxes. If Apple doesn't repatriate and still wants to pursue some megadeal, it has to choose some combination of a bad option and a worse option. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple and Netflix.
