Even for suppliers who know the risks, a contract with the company is seen as a badge of prestige that will bring in other customers. Richard Drew by Tim Bradshaw Business is booming at Cirrus Logic, the Texas-based audio chipmaker. Sales are growing by more than 25 per cent for the third year in a row and its shares are up by 70 per cent in the past 12 months. However, despite running a public company with a market capitalisation of $US4bn, chief executive Jason Rhode struggles when explaining to investors the finer details of its impressive results. Even though a single customer accounts for two-thirds of its annual revenues – and as much as 85 per cent in the quarter ending in December – Mr Rhode never dares mention it by name. On every quarterly earnings call, Mr Rhode trots out the same carefully worded phrase: "While we understand there is intense interest related to our largest customer, in accordance with our policy, we do not discuss specifics about our business relationship." Of course, every Cirrus investor knows that the unnamed customer is Apple, the world's leading maker of smartphones by sales. When Apple revealed strong demand for its new iPhone 7 in mid-September, Cirrus's shares leapt by 8 per cent in a single day. Apple headquarters in California. The company's patronage is a blessing when everything is going well but it can quickly become a curse. Marcio Jose Sanchez Yet Apple's obsessive secrecy, coupled with the extreme demands it makes of its manufacturers and the competition to join their ranks, means its suppliers dare not put a foot wrong. Apple's patronage is a blessing when everything is going well but it can quickly become a curse. The consequences of a break-up can be devastating, as London-listed chip designer Imagination Technologies discovered this week. Related Quotes 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating... View full quote Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements Imagination's graphics processors have been a core part of the iPhone since it first launched a decade ago. Its shares lost almost two-thirds of their value on Monday when the chipmaker revealed that Apple "has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination's technology". It was one of the most dramatic share-price reactions for a large UK company - previously worth £754m - in a decade. Imagination's relationship with Apple has been rocky for a while. Early last year, amid deepening losses as it struggled to adapt to the smartphone market slowdown, its long-serving chief executive Sir Hossein Yassaie left the company. Soon after, it emerged that Apple - which owns an 8.1 per cent stake in the chipmaker - had discussed acquiring Imagination outright but ultimately decided against making an offer. Today, Apple still accounts for more than half of Imagination's revenues but within two years it intends to "no longer use the group's intellectual property", Imagination said in a statement. Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst now a venture investor at Loup Ventures, compares investing in the group's suppliers to playing "Russian roulette". "It's the classic deal with the devil," he says. "You know you are going to pay a price for it, whether it is getting left behind completely or squeezed on your profits." A Pokemon Go player attempts to catch a Charmander character. Augmented reality products are capturing consumers' imaginations. Thomas Cytrynowicz Apple's abrupt severance may seem ruthless but it shows how the group is moving to own more of the core technologies at the heart of its products. By making such a drastic shift into graphics processors, Apple is seizing control of a component that is becoming essential to not just video and gaming, but two coming tech megatrends: artificial intelligence and augmented reality. That will come as little consolation to Imagination, which is facing what one analyst called its "black swan" moment. For many such vendors, though, the pattern is all too familiar. Not the first "This is not the first time this has happened in the Apple supply chain and reminds us that a discount should be applied to Apple suppliers' valuations," wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a note to clients this week. Apple declined to comment for this piece. An early victim was PortalPlayer, a provider of audio technology to the iPod, which relied on Apple for around 90 per cent of its sales. In December 2005, PortalPlayer was riding high on the success of Apple's MP3 player, with its chief executive saying it was "well positioned for the year ahead" thanks to its "strong" relationship with its unnamed "leading customers". Just four months later, Apple switched to another supplier and the company lost half of its value almost overnight. Before the year was out, PortalPlayer had been sold to Nvidia, the graphics chipmaker. As a result, publicly-listed manufacturers who count Apple as a customer, tend to trade at a lower multiple than their peers, analysts say. On Wall Street, this phenomenon is known as the "Apple risk discount". Last September, analysts at RBC Capital Markets noticed that 10 of 11 suppliers with significant revenues from Apple were seeing their gross margins contract. "We think Apple has been pushing for price discounts from multiple suppliers," RBC said in a note at the time, as a way to mitigate increases in its own costs due to currency fluctuations. Yet even for suppliers who know the risks, a contract with Apple is seen as a badge of prestige that will bring in other customers. It also brings huge volumes - Apple will sell more than 240m iPhones this year, according to analysts. "The best thing is to do the deal with Apple anyway," says Mr Munster. "Even though you are probably going to get throttled in the end, you will have three years of great times you probably would never have had if you hadn't done it." Nonetheless, news of Imagination's predicament will have triggered concern across Apple's supply chain. "Companies working with them in certain areas are really struggling to get financing, because of the risk," said an executive at one company that has worked with the iPhone maker for many years. "Every bank has every Apple vendor on a watchlist now. The negative impact on [Apple's] supply chain is huge." Tiny electronic brains Imagination is an extreme case because Apple is not just swapping to another supplier - it is taking development of the same technology in-house. Chipmaking is not a new endeavour for Apple, though. Since it acquired PA Semi in 2008, it has developed formidable expertise in crafting the tiny electronic brains inside its devices. As well as the A-series processors that power its iPhones and iPads, Apple has custom-designed special chips that run in its Watch and AirPods wireless headphones. Analysts see this as a key strategic advantage for the company, given that the huge resources required to make custom processors put them out of reach of many rivals. Yet creating a new graphics processor (or GPU) is far more complex and ambitious than anything Apple has attempted so far. Only a handful of companies other than Imagination, including Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm and SoftBank's Arm, are able to produce the technology at real scale. Apple has been steadily poaching employees from Imagination as it learns to fine-tune its off-the-shelf processors. "Apple has demonstrated extraordinarily well that its chips can be well optimised for the specific functions of the iPhone," says Geoff Blaber, analyst at CCS Insight. Ditching Imagination for its own GPU is "just Apple being Apple - they want to customise as much as they can", he adds. "Given the clear directions Apple is moving in, a GPU is only going to become more important." In today's iPhones, graphics processors are used to make richer video games and more visually sophisticated apps. But the next model will feature a new front-facing camera that can sense the depth in a scene, such as capturing all the features of a face in 3D, according to people familiar with Apple's plans. That will enable not only new security techniques, such as a user's face unlocking the phone instead of today's fingerprint reader, but also new kinds of features and inputs that are loosely gathered under the buzz term of " augmented reality". That could mean elaborate special effects in photos and videos, like a supercharged version of Pokémon Go or Snapchat's selfie masks, which give people dog ears or turn them into a character from a TV show. Beyond the iPhone, Apple is also researching AR glasses - a new frontier in wearable technology that companies across Silicon Valley are spending billions on to develop. "This [Imagination move] is as clear a nod that Apple has given that it sees a dramatic shift in how people are going to interact with their devices," says Mr Munster. "This is like the tremor before the earthquake." Core technology For such a secretive company, Apple chief Tim Cook has been unusually vocal about his enthusiasm for augmented reality, saying it could be "huge", as big as the iPhone is today. "I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives and be entertaining," Mr Cook told the Independent in February. "It's not a product per se - it's a core technology." A graphics processor is also important beyond images because its architecture is uniquely suited for processing the huge amounts of information that lie behind AI systems, which already appear in today's iPhones in its Siri virtual assistant's suggestions and automatic face recognition in photos. While Apple dreams up new applications for AR and AI, Imagination faces a nightmare scenario from which few suppliers have ever fully recovered. Knowing that it has worked with Apple for so long, it might attract renewed interest from rival smartphone makers, analysts say, while it may yet be able to force Apple to license its intellectual property. Royalties would bring in less revenues than chip sales but command a higher profit margin. "Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights," the company said on Monday, flexing its legal muscles. Perhaps Imagination might learn from the experience of another British supplier to Apple, audio chipmaker Wolfson. After it lost Apple as a customer in 2008, Wolfson posted five years of operating losses before being bought by a larger rival: Cirrus Logic. magazine.afr.com Financial Times Share Share via Email Share on Google Plus Post on facebook wall Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit Advertisement Advertisement Commercial Real Estate Related articles Lessons for the ATO in Amazon win 30 mins ago US-Russia reset hopes were already fading 41 mins ago Trump keeps cards to his chest on Syria 1 hr ago Millennials and Modi reasons to invest in India 1 hr ago Trump team touts US-China trade plan Latest Stories Sweden strikes a defiant tone 6 mins ago Melbourne city apartment sales slow 10 mins ago Turnbull ramps up demands on Russia 27 mins ago More Advertisement Lang Walker gambles on $100m Fijian paradise How Jose Neves built a fashion unicorn Fashion that fuses East and West 43 little accessories to stash away Why chefs need a fashion makeover Nominate a True Leader for the 2017 BOSS list Forget the robots, hire old people The start-ups challenging big power How burnt-out execs found new purpose How business can win back public trust Barossa wine auction solves a big problem 5 of the best houses on sale in Australia now Good times ahead with luxury gifts for all What year are we in again?

It can also be one of its most confusing. By the very nature of how it works, it’s hard to suss out exactly what 3D Touch can do for you as an iPhone user. After all, it’s not like iOS or Apple does a great job of advertising the feature’s capabilities. However, once you get a handle on all its myriad functions, you’ll find that 3D Touch can help simplify and make more efficient many of the everyday actions you complete with your iPhone. What follows are some of the best ways to use 3D Touch to be more efficient with your Apple smartphone. How-to use 3D Touch to slay notifications For the better part of a decade, notifications were a nightmare on iOS. But with the release iOS 10 and the introduction of several 3D Touch specific shortcuts, it’s now possible to get a handle on notifications with ease. Most iOS users likely know that you can use 3D touch to act upon notifications, whether on the lock screen or notification shade, by pressing down on them. Depending on the app in question, you have several options. For instance, in the case of Gmail, pressing down on an email notification allows the user to archive the message, write a response without leaving the notification or reply to everyone in the email thread. Less know is the fact that you can clear all your notifications in one go with 3D Touch. To do so: 1. Pull down the notification shade. 2. Apply pressure to the ‘X’ icon to the right of the “Recent” header. 3.  After a second, a “Clear all Notifications” shortcut will appear. Tap it to clear all your notifications. How-to use 3D Touch with Control Center to access even more functionality With the release of iOS 10, Apple reworked the operating system’s Control Center, the small panel devoted to device settings and media playback you can pull up by swiping up from the bottom of your device’s screen, to make it more organized. Along the bottom of the Control Center are four icons that allow you to use your phone as a flashlight, as well as quickly access the Clock, Calculator and Camera apps. If you use 3D Touch on the flashlight icon, you can adjust how much light the iPhone’s flash module emits when used as a flashlight. Meanwhile, if you apply pressure to the Timer icon, you can quickly set a one hour, 20 minute, 5 minute or one minute timer. Using 3D Touch on the calculator icon allows one to copy the last to the iPhone’s internal clipboard. Lastly, using 3D Touch on the camera icon lets you jump straight to the taking pictures using either of the iPhone’s two main cameras. You can also use this same shortcut to jump straight to the camera’s slow motion and video capture functionality. Use 3D Touch to prioritize downloads By now, most people know that they can use 3D Touch on almost any app to quickly access certain functionality within said app, but it turns out you can also use 3D Touch on apps iOS is in the process of downloading. When you do so, you’re given the option to cancel the download, pause it or prioritize it. The last one is especially useful if you’ve just setup a new iPhone and need access to one app in particular as soon as possible. How-to use 3D Touch to make selecting and editing text easier In my opinion, this next tip is one of 3D Touch’s most useful applications; it allows you to quickly and accurately select and edit text using a trackpad. To activate iOS 10’s trackpad 1. Launch an app and bring up the keyboard. 2. Press down firmly on the keyboard. 3. Drag your finger along the keyboard to move the cursor. 4. Bonus tip: You can press down anywhere on the keyboard to launch trackpad mode. However, I find bringing up the trackpad is the fastest if you press down on the spacebar. It’s also possible to use the virtual trackpad select text. To do so, slightly reduce and then reapply the pressure to the keyboard. It can take a bit of practice to execute properly, so be patient if it doesn’t work at first. How-to use 3D Touch to access an app’s functionality from the home screen If you’ve tried to use 3D Touch before, you’ll likely know that a lot of third-party apps allow you to jump to specific parts of their interface and functionality by pressing down on their homescreen icon. With the Air Canada app, for instance, you can jump straight to its check-in screen using 3D Touch. That said, some of the most useful home screen actions come courtesy of Apple’s own first-party apps. For example, if you push down on the settings app, you can quickly jump to the Wi-Fi, battery and Bluetooth menus, making this is a great way to enable iOS’s powerful low power mode and switch between Wi-Fi networks on and off on the fly. Another great place to use 3D Touch on is the App Store icon. It gives you the option to update to jump to the app’s search and update functionality. How to use 3D Touch to switch between apps 1. Press down on the left side of the screen. 2. Wait until you see your most recently used app peeks from behind the home screen. 3. Quickly move your finger to right side of the screen. 4. Repeat the past three steps to switch back to your next most recently used app. You can also use 3D Touch to access iOS’s multi-tasking menu. Many of the same steps above apply here. 1. Press down on the left side of the screen. 2. Wait until you see your most recently used app peek from behind the home screen and continue holding on the screen. 3. Use the multi-tasking menu as you normally would, swiping through the list to find the app you want to use. Given that you can also access the multi-tasking menu by double tapping the home button, I find this to be one of the less useful 3D Touch shortcuts. However, you find you prefer to access the iPhone’s app switcher this way if you own the iPhone 7.

Since the years has passed, Apple iPhones has seen change in size, shape, features and its capabilities—the iPhone has evolved in these 10 years, and hopes are high on iPhone 8 as well. While the rumours mill is churning out information about the next iPhone almost every day, imagine the upcoming iPhone in retro look. Designer Martin Hajek, who is known for creating 3D renders of rumoured Apple products, has put together a new iPhone 8 concept video based on the latest leaks about the handset. In the<br /> In the video, the iPhone 8, placed next to iPhone 7, is shown how the upcoming iPhone would look like with an edge-to-edge OLED display, glass-and-steel-body and no homebutton. According to information revealed by industry sources, Apple will be releasing three models of iPhones. One would be a premium iPhone 8 model and other two will be upgrade to iPhone 7— iPhone 7s and iPhone7s Plus. The premium iPhone 8 models will feature OLED screen, while the rest will continue to sport LCD display. According to Nikkei Asian Review, Apple has already placed order for 70 million OLED panels with Samsung for use in this year’s handsets—the premium iPhone 8 models. The premium iPhone 8 is also said to include 3D-sensors to allow facial recognition as a part of new biometric feature.  All three handsets will incorporate wireless charging and True Tone, which allow displays to automatically adjust colour temperature based on the room environment, technology. However, these new features, especially OLED panels and 3D-sensor are cited to cause delay in the handsets' release from September to October, or even November.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple releases iOS 10.3.1 update, offers bug fixes, security fixes Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Tuesday, April 4th, 2017, 05:36 Category: Hack, iOS, iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, News, security, Software After a major OS update come the fixes. Apple on Monday released iOS 10.3.1, an update available for its iOS devices available as an over-the-air update or when connected to iTunes via a Mac or Windows PC. The update, which weighs in at just under 30 megabytes as an OTA download, resolves issues such as a hardware-specific problem wherein iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c handsets had trouble updating over the air. The 5 and 5c were Apple’s last iPhone models with a 32-bit processor, the A6. Since the iPhone 5s all iOS devices have turned to 64-bit technology. Apple is in the process of phasing out 32-bit support, and indeed the iOS 10.3.2 beta appears to omit it entirely. Among the core changes introduced in iOS 10.3 was the switch to the Apple File System, which is better optimized for flash storage. In some cases, the switch restored gigabytes of storage space to the device. The update addresses bugs, offers security updates and also resolves a vulnerability that would let hackers run attacks through a device’s Wi-Fi chip. If you’ve installed iOS 10.3.1 and have any feedback to offer, please let us know what you make of it in the comments.

Bruised fruits taste great used in the cart’s signature apple fritters (left). U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once described states as the nation’s “laboratories of democracy” for driving innovation on social and economic policy. The same could be said about the impact of mobile vendors on Madison’s food scene. Food carts are operated by entrepreneurs looking to carve out a niche in a notoriously difficult industry. With more carts making their way to the streets each year, vendors need to creatively distinguish themselves in a crowded field. Quality ingredients, healthy entrees, inspiration from regional cuisines and local sourcing set these five carts apart. Local produce Laurel Burleson opened Ugly Apple last fall as most carts were heading into winter hibernation. She specializes in breakfast, serving apple fritters, oatmeal, muffins, biscuit sandwiches and market frittatas, which change each week depending on what local produce is available. As spring vegetables start to trickle in from local farms, the menu will diversify. Burleson is committed to sourcing produce that tastes good but is on its way to the compost heap only because it lacks aesthetic appeal. “I still get some strange looks from farmers when I ask, ‘Hey, do you have anything you don’t want to sell? Will you sell it to me?” says Burleson. “Lately, it’s been a lot of squash and rutabaga. But what I have heard from farmers is that when spring takes off, I should be able to buy some overstock vegetables, the stuff that’s left over at the end of the day and is probably not worth bringing back the next week.” This year, Ugly Apple is parked at the corner of Wisconsin Avenue and Mifflin Street on Tuesday, Thursdays and Fridays 7-10 a.m.. On Wednesdays, the cart heads to the west side to vend at University Research Park. × Expand Carolyn Fath Daniel and Leticia Hernandez do Mexican the Cali way with their shrimp taco (left). A touch of California Wife-and-husband team Leticia and Daniel Hernandez have settled into a nice groove with their cart, Cali Fresh, located on the Library Mall. This will be the third year Cali Fresh will vend on campus. The couple took some time off this winter but were back in action by mid-February serving taqueria-style tacos, burritos, quesadillas and chalupas. Leticia says the cart’s cuisine is true to its name, blending traditional Mexican fare with California street food. “[The menu] comes from a family background in restaurants. For me, it was all authentic Mexican growing up,” says Leticia. “Daniel is from California. He used to have a job where he’d travel up and down the state. So there’s definitely inspiration from all these little places he visited on the road.” California natives seem to recognize the Golden State’s influence on Cali Fresh’s menu — it’s unique among Madison’s Mexican carts in its daily offering of a shrimp taco (its best seller) and shrimp quesadilla. It also offers a vegan taco based on roasted cauliflower. Leticia says they have quite a few regulars who keep coming back for a reminder of home. “When we first started selling at Library Mall, it was a shock just how many students were from California,” says Leticia. × Expand Linda Falkenstein Yes, this is homemade pasta. It’s headed to delicious bowls at Common Pasta, served up by co-owner Brian Baur (right). Housemade pasta One food cart that braved it through most of the winter was Common Pasta. Chef-owners Brian Baur and Thomas Durbin say they were pleasantly surprised that business turned out to be just as brisk as the weather. Common Pasta has been vending on campus, 1025 W. Johnson St., since it opened last fall. The cart’s spicy mac and cheese has proved popular no matter the season. “We start cooking at six in the morning, extrude all of our pasta off-site, bake fresh bread and make the sauces every morning,” says Baur. “It’s always been important to us that we don’t cut corners. We prepare each pasta to order in a pan just as we would in a restaurant. I’m pretty sure we are the only food cart with a six-burner stove.” In mid-April, Common Pasta will join the crowd of carts on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. There, downtown lunch-goers can expect to see short rib ragu, pesto (made with basil and kale), and mac and cheese, as well as rotating specials. Last month, the cart served lumache pasta with smoked tomato sauce, parmigiano reggiano and spicy Italian sausage. Another recent special was spaghetti and meatballs. “We’re trying to make the best-quality pasta you can get for eight dollars in the city,” says Baur. “I think we’re doing it.” A sea salt caramel — also made fresh daily by Baur and Durbin — is complimentary with every dish. × Expand Good Food Melanie Nelson (right) focuses on a good-for-you menu at the two Good Food carts. Thai tacos (left) come wrapped in lettuce. Carbs, crushed Serving the healthiest food possible has been Melanie Nelson’s mission since opening Good Food in 2010. It turned out to be a winning strategy, enough to warrant the opening of a second cart, Good Food II in 2014. This season, Nelson is taking her healthy cuisine to a new level. “I’ve been learning about the metabolic disasters that can result from too much sugar. And pretty much everyone is eating too much sugar,” says Nelson. “I was seeing sugar everywhere I looked. The dried cranberries, the candied walnuts, the peanut sauce, even the balsamic vinaigrette had honey in it. I couldn’t do it anymore. So I decided to revamp the whole menu to go low carb.” The new menu still has six items that can be served as a salad or in a wheat flour tortilla wrap. Low-carb versions of old favorites like the Caesar Supreme and Lunchtime in Albuquerque are on the menu. New additions include a citrus-avocado-kale mix that features chopped pink grapefruit and oranges tossed with kale, diced avocado, pickled red onions, salted sunflower seeds, crumbled feta and citrus vinaigrette. The option of adding grilled chicken or tofu is also still available. “We took away all the honey. All the frozen orange juice concentrate. All the added sugar. The idea is to make everything 30 net carbs or less. A lot of the items are much less than that,” says Nelson. “We still use some fruit and I’ve started using stevia as a sweetener.” Nelson has also introduced a new method of delivery for her entree salads: lettuce tacos (it’s built like a tortilla wrap, only the salad is rolled in a lettuce leaf). Good Food I cart is staying at its spot in front of Walgreens on East Main Street this year. Good Food II will return to the Library Mall. In April, Nelson’s new brick-and-mortar restaurant — Good Food Low Carb Cafe — is set to open at 4674 Cottage Grove Road. × Expand Ladonia Cafe Amie Swanson of Ladonia Cafe (right) focuses on fresh flavors, with her roasted sweet potato tamales, pinto beans, organic brown rice and fresh housemade salsa. Alternative proteins Ladonia Cafe’s Amie Swanson doesn’t plan on changing her menu much this season. Ladonia will continue to serve staples like the tamale platter, BLT sandwich (made with meat-free, tempeh “bacon”) and quinoa salad. All items sold at the cart are vegan, and most are gluten free. But Swanson doesn’t make a big deal out of it. “Shh....I’m a secret vegan,” says Swanson. “Over 80 percent of my customers aren’t vegan or even vegetarian.” But Swanson says her customers don’t care if her food happens to be animal-free; they come back because the food is “fresh, tastes great and is satisfying.” “I try to balance all the meals I put out with some protein,” says Swanson. “I’ve had some roasted vegetable sandwiches that taste good, but afterwards I was still hungry. That’s because it didn’t have a protein.” Swanson offers occasional specials. She’s also developing a new salad that she hopes will be on the regular menu soon. Street construction on the Capitol Square starting in April will temporarily relocate some food carts to nearby downtown locations. The Ladonia Cafe food cart, usually in front of 1 E. Main St., will move in front of the Madison Municipal Building until construction is complete in mid-summer.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars No, Detroit is not winning the robocar race. Submitted by brad on Mon, 2017-04-03 17:30. Robocars A new report from Navigant Research includes the chart shown below, ranking various teams on the race to robocar deployment. It’s causing lots of press headlines about how Ford is the top company and companies like Google and Uber are far behind. I elected not to buy the $3800 report, but based on the summary I believe their conclusions are ill founded to say the least. This ordering smacks of old-world car industry thinking. Saying that Ford and GM are ahead of Waymo/Google is like saying that Foxconn is ahead of Google or Apple in the smartphone market. Foxconn makes the iPhone of course, and makes lots of money at a modest profit margin of a few percent. Apple and Google don’t make their phones, they design them and the software platform. Ford and GM might feel good reading this report, but they should not. I do actually like Ford’s plan quite a bit — especially their declaration that they will not sell their robocar to end-users. I also like Daimler’s declaration that they want to have a taxi style service called “Car2Come” after their Car2Go one-way on-demand car rental service. (Americans giggle at the name, Germans are never bothered by such things. :-) GM does not belong high on the list, other than for its partnership with Lyft. They were wise to acquire a company like Cruise — and I know the folks at Cruise, this is not a criticism of them — but it’s not enough to catapult you to the front of the list. A similar article came out a few months ago, declaring that Silicon Valley was sure to lose to Detroit, because Detroit knows how to make cars, and Silicon Valley doesn’t. The report went further and declared that Google was falling behind because they had said they did not plan to make a car. The author had mistakenly thought Google had plans to make a car — Google never said anything like that — and so decided that the announcement that they would not make one was a big retreat on their part. Companies like Google, Apple and Uber have never stated they wished to make cars, or felt they were any good at it. If they want to make cars, they have the cash to go buy a car company, but there is no need to do that. There are a couple of dozen companies around the world who are already very good at making cars, and if you come to them with an order for 100,000 cars to your specification, they will jump to say “yes, sir!” Some of the companies, the big leaders like Toyota or BMW, might well refuse that order, not wanting to be the supplier for a threat to their existence. But it won’t help them. Somebody will be that supplier. If not a German, Japanese or U.S. company, then a Korean company, or failing that a Chinese company. In fact, Foxconn has said it is interested in making cars, and Apple is designing them, so the Apple-Foxconn relationship may be far more than a metaphor for this situation. When you summon an Uber, you don’t care what nameplate is on the car. When you summon UberSelect, you don’t care if it’s Lexus, or Mercedes or BMW. Uber was your brand, and you aren’t buying the car for 15 years, you are buying it for 15 minutes. Brand plays a completely different role. Companies like Waymo, Apple, Uber, Zoox and others would be foolish to manufacture cars, unless they want a car so radically different that nobody knows how to make it. (Then, they might decide to be the first to figure it out.) The car manufacturers would be foolish to turn down the giant purchase order, or partnerships with whoever has the best technology. The winner of the transportation game of the future will be the company that thinks outside the car. That doesn’t mean the big car companies can’t do that. It’s just harder for them to do. The chart’s not entirely wrong. Honda is pretty far behind — but PSA is even further behind. BMW, Daimler and Ford are among the best of the car companies, but Tesla and Volvo deserve higher ranking. Hyundai is not ahead of Toyota, and Tesla, while not ahead of Waymo, is in a pretty good place. Bosch is a surprising absentee from the list. FCA should be on it, just very low on the chart, along with the smaller Japanese vendors and many Chinese vendors. But be clear. Making the car is essential, but it’s also old and a commodity. The value will lie in those building the self-driving software systems and sensors, and those putting services together around the technologies. The big automaker’s advantages — nameplate and reputation, reliability, manufacturing skill and capacity, retail channel experience — these are all less valuable or commoditized. They have to act fast to move to new business models that will make it in the future. Of course, one plan is to own the important components I name above, and several companies like BMW, Daimler, Ford, Nissan and Volvo are trying to do that. But they’re behind Waymo by a fair distance. » brad's blog My bet is Tesla is leading the race Submitted by Alnair (not verified) on Tue, 2017-04-04 02:16. Because autonomous driving is based on machine learning algorithms (similar to algorithms that use Google for the search engine) and provided the most data you have, the better result you get from those algorithms, a company that delivers 100K cars/year (soon 300K) with all hardware for autonomous driving capable to work in shadow mode gathering data from all his costumers around the world will soon overpass all the competition by large. That company is Tesla. I no doubt Waymo will be the best autonomous car in Palo Alto roads, but world is much more diverse and to learn all possible scenarios you need hundreds of thousands cars, not just hundreds. » reply Often said Submitted by brad on Tue, 2017-04-04 09:05. But if you go around the industry and ask the question, “Which company is the clear leader in machine learning and neural network technologies?” The answer will almost universally be “Google.” So do you really imagine that Tesla would be so far ahead of Waymo on that? That Waymo, even though recently put into its own company, has not made use of that skill? Why would they not? » reply automated transport Submitted by jim (not verified) on Thu, 2017-04-06 11:08. If you rephrase the question as "Which company is likely to profit the most from automated transportation in the next ~15 years? I would respond : Amazon I would think that automating the package delivery business is a better defined and easier problem than automating taxies. And Amazon is well on its way automating the package delivery business.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: Apple orders 70 million OLED units from Samsung for next-gen iPhone Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Tuesday, April 4th, 2017, 05:37 Category: Hardware, iPhone, Processors, Rumor, Samsung A company doesn’t buy 70 million components unless you’re probably going to include it in a future product. Apple has reportedly placed an order for 70 million OLED panels from Samsung, which looks to be set to become Apple’s sold OLED supplier. Demand for the 2017 iPhone, which is expected to feature a major design overhaul with an edge-to-edge display, glass body, and a premium price tag, is expected to be high as it typically is in a year when a new look is unveiled. Apple and Samsung are gearing up to meet demand with the large panel order. The story is followed by the following comment from IHS Markit analyst David Hsieh: “Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations.” It’s rumored that the OLED panels will be in short supply come the next-gen iPhone’s launch in September, with the majority of the stock unavailable until later in the year. Hsieh has stated that “it is also possible that some of these 70 million handsets will not be shipped to customers this year and be carried over to next year depending on demand.” An anonymous source also stated that the next-gen iPhone will feature a 5.2-inch screen and no home button, which will be sold alongside standard 4.7 and 5.5-inch devices with LCD screens and home buttons. All three iPhones will include wireless charging functionality (lately said to be inductive) and waterproofing, while at least one model, presumably the OLED iPhone, will include a 3D sensor that supports facial recognition. Other rumored features include improvements to the camera, a faster and more efficient A11 processor, Touch ID built into the display, True Tone ambient light adjustment, and perhaps augmented reality functionality enabled through the camera. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars No, Detroit is not winning the robocar race. Submitted by brad on Mon, 2017-04-03 17:30. Robocars A new report from Navigant Research includes the chart shown below, ranking various teams on the race to robocar deployment. It’s causing lots of press headlines about how Ford is the top company and companies like Google and Uber are far behind. I elected not to buy the $3800 report, but based on the summary I believe their conclusions are ill founded to say the least. This ordering smacks of old-world car industry thinking. Saying that Ford and GM are ahead of Waymo/Google is like saying that Foxconn is ahead of Google or Apple in the smartphone market. Foxconn makes the iPhone of course, and makes lots of money at a modest profit margin of a few percent. Apple and Google don’t make their phones, they design them and the software platform. Ford and GM might feel good reading this report, but they should not. I do actually like Ford’s plan quite a bit — especially their declaration that they will not sell their robocar to end-users. I also like Daimler’s declaration that they want to have a taxi style service called “Car2Come” after their Car2Go one-way on-demand car rental service. (Americans giggle at the name, Germans are never bothered by such things. :-) GM does not belong high on the list, other than for its partnership with Lyft. They were wise to acquire a company like Cruise — and I know the folks at Cruise, this is not a criticism of them — but it’s not enough to catapult you to the front of the list. A similar article came out a few months ago, declaring that Silicon Valley was sure to lose to Detroit, because Detroit knows how to make cars, and Silicon Valley doesn’t. The report went further and declared that Google was falling behind because they had said they did not plan to make a car. The author had mistakenly thought Google had plans to make a car — Google never said anything like that — and so decided that the announcement that they would not make one was a big retreat on their part. Companies like Google, Apple and Uber have never stated they wished to make cars, or felt they were any good at it. If they want to make cars, they have the cash to go buy a car company, but there is no need to do that. There are a couple of dozen companies around the world who are already very good at making cars, and if you come to them with an order for 100,000 cars to your specification, they will jump to say “yes, sir!” Some of the companies, the big leaders like Toyota or BMW, might well refuse that order, not wanting to be the supplier for a threat to their existence. But it won’t help them. Somebody will be that supplier. If not a German, Japanese or U.S. company, then a Korean company, or failing that a Chinese company. In fact, Foxconn has said it is interested in making cars, and Apple is designing them, so the Apple-Foxconn relationship may be far more than a metaphor for this situation. When you summon an Uber, you don’t care what nameplate is on the car. When you summon UberSelect, you don’t care if it’s Lexus, or Mercedes or BMW. Uber was your brand, and you aren’t buying the car for 15 years, you are buying it for 15 minutes. Brand plays a completely different role. Companies like Waymo, Apple, Uber, Zoox and others would be foolish to manufacture cars, unless they want a car so radically different that nobody knows how to make it. (Then, they might decide to be the first to figure it out.) The car manufacturers would be foolish to turn down the giant purchase order, or partnerships with whoever has the best technology. The winner of the transportation game of the future will be the company that thinks outside the car. That doesn’t mean the big car companies can’t do that. It’s just harder for them to do. The chart’s not entirely wrong. Honda is pretty far behind — but PSA is even further behind. BMW, Daimler and Ford are among the best of the car companies, but Tesla and Volvo deserve higher ranking. Hyundai is not ahead of Toyota, and Tesla, while not ahead of Waymo, is in a pretty good place. Bosch is a surprising absentee from the list. FCA should be on it, just very low on the chart, along with the smaller Japanese vendors and many Chinese vendors. But be clear. Making the car is essential, but it’s also old and a commodity. The value will lie in those building the self-driving software systems and sensors, and those putting services together around the technologies. The big automaker’s advantages — nameplate and reputation, reliability, manufacturing skill and capacity, retail channel experience — these are all less valuable or commoditized. They have to act fast to move to new business models that will make it in the future. Of course, one plan is to own the important components I name above, and several companies like BMW, Daimler, Ford, Nissan and Volvo are trying to do that. But they’re behind Waymo by a fair distance. » brad's blog My bet is Tesla is leading the race Submitted by Alnair (not verified) on Tue, 2017-04-04 02:16. Because autonomous driving is based on machine learning algorithms (similar to algorithms that use Google for the search engine) and provided the most data you have, the better result you get from those algorithms, a company that delivers 100K cars/year (soon 300K) with all hardware for autonomous driving capable to work in shadow mode gathering data from all his costumers around the world will soon overpass all the competition by large. That company is Tesla. I no doubt Waymo will be the best autonomous car in Palo Alto roads, but world is much more diverse and to learn all possible scenarios you need hundreds of thousands cars, not just hundreds. » reply Often said Submitted by brad on Tue, 2017-04-04 09:05. But if you go around the industry and ask the question, “Which company is the clear leader in machine learning and neural network technologies?” The answer will almost universally be “Google.” So do you really imagine that Tesla would be so far ahead of Waymo on that? That Waymo, even though recently put into its own company, has not made use of that skill? Why would they not? » reply automated transport Submitted by jim (not verified) on Thu, 2017-04-06 11:08. If you rephrase the question as "Which company is likely to profit the most from automated transportation in the next ~15 years? I would respond : Amazon I would think that automating the package delivery business is a better defined and easier problem than automating taxies. And Amazon is well on its way automating the package delivery business. I would be surprised if they don't already have a plan in place to cut the labor cost of delivering a package by a factor of 10 in the next 10 years. » reply Online retail Submitted by brad on Fri, 2017-04-07 09:40.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Recently published patent application shows how Apple might incorporate Touch Bar, Touch ID functions into next-gen Magic Keyboard Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Wednesday, April 5th, 2017, 05:02 Category: Hardware, MacBook Pro, News, Patents, Rumor, Touch Bar, Touch ID Apple may be looking to bring both the Touch ID and Touch Bar features to an updated version of the Magic Keyboard. A new Apple patent application, or at least some form of the application, shows a device may also include a processing unit positioned within the housing, and a primary display positioned at least partially within the housing and configured to display a graphical-user interface executed by the processing unit. In some embodiments, the display is an organic light-emitting diode display. The electronic device may be a keyboard device. This change would address one of the main concerns expressed about the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro, in that its advantages would become moot if the user were using an external keyboard. Apple has also been rumored to have been holding discussions with dynamic keyboard maker Sonder, so there may be some interesting things coming down the pipe in this area. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

The fad gadget you strap to your wrist has seen a precipitous fall in the last year. Pebble closed its doors after releasing a solid fitness tracker, and Fitbit has struggled (though we liked its new Fitbit Alta HR). There's also the fact that fitness trackers, while great for athletes, seem to not actually help most of us lose weight. Image: Fitbit Which means if you're desperate to track sleep or steps or how many calories you consume you might be better off sticking to your phone. If you've taken a dive into your phone's fitness apps lately, you'll have noticed it can track your steps, your runs, and even your sleep without any help. So really, what's the point of buying yourself a separate wearable? Maybe your phone is enough tracker Image: Apple All contemporary smartphones come packed with sensors, which help it sort out where you are on a map, what orientation you're holding the phone in, and so on. It turns out these tiny components can do a lot of fitness tracking, too. Both Google Fit and Apple Health, depending on your choice of OS, are capable of keeping tabs on the steps you've taken, the distance you've covered, and the calories you've burned as you make your way about your day. Image: Google Google Fit is the more fitness focused of the two platforms, as its name suggests. Try adding an activity and you get a hundred to choose from, including everything from water polo to backcountry skiing. A lot of these activities can only be tracked in a very loose way, but the options to record them are there. Apple Health gives a more rounded picture of your health, and while it doesn't have quite as many activity categories as its Google counterpart, it goes into more detail and depth. For example, it includes the option of tracking caffeine intake and glucose levels. Image: Strava What apps do you need to turn you phone into a tracker? You don't necessarily need another device to keep tabs on a lot of these extra measurements, but you do need extra apps. There's a pile of apps, from Strava to Runkeeper, that can measure walks, runs, and bike rides using only your mobile phone, and in a lot more depth than your phone's own software can. (Both Strava and Runkeeper can share data with either Google Fit or Apple Health if necessary.) Image: Sleep As Android And an app such as Instant Heart Rate Monitor (for iOS or Android) can measure your heart rate using the technology built into your phone's camera. It might not be as accurate or as comprehensive as using a device strapped to your wrist or your chest, but it can add new depths to your health tracking, and the apps come with plenty of useful options for analysis and assessment. Apps can use your phone's sensors to figure out just how much quality shuteye you're getting as well. Sleep as Android can judge how restful for night has been for Android, while Sleep Cycle is one of the best options for iPhones or iPads. That's a lot of data you can keep on top of using nothing but your phone and a well-chosen app or two, though admittedly, there's more manual input involved if you want to go beyond the basics of step counts and sleep times, and it will definitely drain your phone's battery a little faster. Yet, as your phone is usually always with you, you may not need that separate tracker. Why you might still want a fitness tracker Image: Fitbit If you do decide to pay extra for a dedicated fitness tracker, the first benefit you get is portability: you don't have to lug a 15cm phone around on your morning jog, because a snug wristband or a tracker clipped to your pocket is doing all the tracking for you. With many smartwatches now including GPS, you can track your location too. Smartphones might feel like extensions of our natural bodies these days, but for some high-intensity activities you really don't want to take your phone with you. From running around on a soccer pitch to doing laps of the pool, the more advanced your fitness activity, the more a dedicated tracker starts to make sense. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo And by fitness tracker we also mean smartwatch with advanced fitness tracking capabilities — being able to glance at your wrist as you hit the home straight of a 5K run is much more convenient than trying to fish your phone our of your pocket. The latest fitness trackers also bring more sensors and more accurate sensors to the table: whether it's the continuous heart rate tracking of the Apple Watch or the altimeter, barometer, and compass built into the Garmin Fenix 3, you can usually expand on the monitoring capabilities of your phone with a dedicated wearable. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo That often translates into less time spent manually inputting data — if there's one sticking point likely to interfere with your fitness tracking goals, it's having to enter data manually. It's a job that just never gets done, or doesn't get done often enough, and you don't have to worry about it if you're wearing a device that knows the difference between a gym session and a jog without being told. Of course there are a wide range of fitness trackers out there, some of which do a better job than others at keeping tabs on what you're doing, but generally speaking you get more automation and more detail with an extra device to help your phone along. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo And all that's before you get to the app and software that comes with your tracker, which you may well prefer to the built-in offerings from Apple and Google — Fitbit's bundled app is particularly handy and gives you a detailed breakdown of your stats on the web as well as on your phone. The big downside to a fitness tracker? It's another gadget you'll need to be charging every day (or week), and the majority of trackers are big ugly rubber bands. Those are nearly as aesthetically pleasing as a smartphone in your back pocket. Originally published on Gizmodo Australia.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars No, Detroit is not winning the robocar race. Submitted by brad on Mon, 2017-04-03 17:30. Robocars A new report from Navigant Research includes the chart shown below, ranking various teams on the race to robocar deployment. It’s causing lots of press headlines about how Ford is the top company and companies like Google and Uber are far behind. I elected not to buy the $3800 report, but based on the summary I believe their conclusions are ill founded to say the least. This ordering smacks of old-world car industry thinking. Saying that Ford and GM are ahead of Waymo/Google is like saying that Foxconn is ahead of Google or Apple in the smartphone market. Foxconn makes the iPhone of course, and makes lots of money at a modest profit margin of a few percent. Apple and Google don’t make their phones, they design them and the software platform. Ford and GM might feel good reading this report, but they should not. I do actually like Ford’s plan quite a bit — especially their declaration that they will not sell their robocar to end-users. I also like Daimler’s declaration that they want to have a taxi style service called “Car2Come” after their Car2Go one-way on-demand car rental service. (Americans giggle at the name, Germans are never bothered by such things. :-) GM does not belong high on the list, other than for its partnership with Lyft. They were wise to acquire a company like Cruise — and I know the folks at Cruise, this is not a criticism of them — but it’s not enough to catapult you to the front of the list. A similar article came out a few months ago, declaring that Silicon Valley was sure to lose to Detroit, because Detroit knows how to make cars, and Silicon Valley doesn’t. The report went further and declared that Google was falling behind because they had said they did not plan to make a car. The author had mistakenly thought Google had plans to make a car — Google never said anything like that — and so decided that the announcement that they would not make one was a big retreat on their part. Companies like Google, Apple and Uber have never stated they wished to make cars, or felt they were any good at it. If they want to make cars, they have the cash to go buy a car company, but there is no need to do that. There are a couple of dozen companies around the world who are already very good at making cars, and if you come to them with an order for 100,000 cars to your specification, they will jump to say “yes, sir!” Some of the companies, the big leaders like Toyota or BMW, might well refuse that order, not wanting to be the supplier for a threat to their existence. But it won’t help them. Somebody will be that supplier. If not a German, Japanese or U.S. company, then a Korean company, or failing that a Chinese company. In fact, Foxconn has said it is interested in making cars, and Apple is designing them, so the Apple-Foxconn relationship may be far more than a metaphor for this situation. When you summon an Uber, you don’t care what nameplate is on the car. When you summon UberSelect, you don’t care if it’s Lexus, or Mercedes or BMW. Uber was your brand, and you aren’t buying the car for 15 years, you are buying it for 15 minutes. Brand plays a completely different role. Companies like Waymo, Apple, Uber, Zoox and others would be foolish to manufacture cars, unless they want a car so radically different that nobody knows how to make it. (Then, they might decide to be the first to figure it out.) The car manufacturers would be foolish to turn down the giant purchase order, or partnerships with whoever has the best technology. The winner of the transportation game of the future will be the company that thinks outside the car. That doesn’t mean the big car companies can’t do that. It’s just harder for them to do. The chart’s not entirely wrong. Honda is pretty far behind — but PSA is even further behind. BMW, Daimler and Ford are among the best of the car companies, but Tesla and Volvo deserve higher ranking. Hyundai is not ahead of Toyota, and Tesla, while not ahead of Waymo, is in a pretty good place. Bosch is a surprising absentee from the list. FCA should be on it, just very low on the chart, along with the smaller Japanese vendors and many Chinese vendors. But be clear. Making the car is essential, but it’s also old and a commodity. The value will lie in those building the self-driving software systems and sensors, and those putting services together around the technologies. The big automaker’s advantages — nameplate and reputation, reliability, manufacturing skill and capacity, retail channel experience — these are all less valuable or commoditized. They have to act fast to move to new business models that will make it in the future. Of course, one plan is to own the important components I name above, and several companies like BMW, Daimler, Ford, Nissan and Volvo are trying to do that. But they’re behind Waymo by a fair distance. » brad's blog My bet is Tesla is leading the race Submitted by Alnair (not verified) on Tue, 2017-04-04 02:16. Because autonomous driving is based on machine learning algorithms (similar to algorithms that use Google for the search engine) and provided the most data you have, the better result you get from those algorithms, a company that delivers 100K cars/year (soon 300K) with all hardware for autonomous driving capable to work in shadow mode gathering data from all his costumers around the world will soon overpass all the competition by large. That company is Tesla. I no doubt Waymo will be the best autonomous car in Palo Alto roads, but world is much more diverse and to learn all possible scenarios you need hundreds of thousands cars, not just hundreds. » reply Often said Submitted by brad on Tue, 2017-04-04 09:05. But if you go around the industry and ask the question, “Which company is the clear leader in machine learning and neural network technologies?” The answer will almost universally be “Google.” So do you really imagine that Tesla would be so far ahead of Waymo on that? That Waymo, even though recently put into its own company, has not made use of that skill? Why would they not? » reply automated transport Submitted by jim (not verified) on Thu, 2017-04-06 11:08. If you rephrase the question as "Which company is likely to profit the most from automated transportation in the next ~15 years? I would respond : Amazon I would think that automating the package delivery business is a better defined and easier problem than automating taxies. And Amazon is well on its way automating the package delivery business. I would be surprised if they don't already have a plan in place to cut the labor cost of delivering a package by a factor of 10 in the next 10 years. » reply Online retail Submitted by brad on Fri, 2017-04-07 09:40. Will indeed profit nicely, but it’s small compared to personal transportation. Delivery services around the world are a few hundred billion dollars. Personal transport is 5 trillion. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: Next-gen, modular Mac Pro may not be available until early 2019 Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, April 7th, 2017, 05:39 Category: Hardware, Mac Pro, Rumor As dead sexy as the idea of a revamped Mac Pro might be, it might not see the shelves until 2019. Current rumors have Apple designing a modular Mac Pro, albeit Apple has stated that it won’t be available in 2017. The rumors point towards a design that might not be available until 2019. Citing anonymous “people and sources who know their stuff”, OSNews’ Thom Holwerda writes that Apple’s decision “seems to have been made only in recent months” following professional user response to the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and the lack of Mac Pro updates. Holwerda also points out that issues with LG’s UltraFine 5K display pushed Apple to invest in its pro hardware. LG eventually resolved those issues, but a new Apple branded pro display is coming alongside the module Mac Pro according to the company. Apple is also rumored to be integrating the iPad Pro and Apple Pencil closely with macOS in such a way is a neat idea on its own regardless of the Mac Pro direction and timeline. Users already do this with competing tablet products, and Astropad takes this same approach. As of now, it’s all part of the rumor mill, but it does hint towards what Apple may be looking to design and manufacture in the next few years. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Lifestyle Here’s what makes a global brand valuable and the key drivers behind its strength Here’s what makes a global brand valuable and the key drivers behind its strength For the ranking, a brand’s strength is assessed (based on factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, preference, sustainability and margins) to determine what proportion of a business’ revenue is contributed by the brand. By: FE Bureau | New Delhi | Published: April 9, 2017 2:29 AM This year, Google has overtaken Apple to become the “most valuable global brand,” as per the rankings. Just like last year, technology brands dominated the top 10. EACH YEAR, valuation and strategy consultancy Brand Finance values the brands of thousands of the world’s biggest companies. For the ranking, a brand’s strength is assessed (based on factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, preference, sustainability and margins) to determine what proportion of a business’ revenue is contributed by the brand. This is projected into perpetuity and discounted to determine the brand’s value. This year, Google has overtaken Apple to become the “most valuable global brand,” as per the rankings. Just like last year, technology brands dominated the top 10. The ranking is based on interviews with more than three million consumers plus data on the financial and business performance of each company, using data from Bloomberg and the company Kantar Worldpanel. Here, we list the top 10 brands in the world and what makes them valuable… Google Brand value: $109.4 bn Last year’s rank: 2 The last time Google was at the top of the ranking of the most valuable brands in the world was six years ago. Its ranking in the most valuable brands was helped by a 20% growth in ad revenues. As per Brand Finance, the company “remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, which is the mainstay of its advertising income.” Though Google has largely benefitted from increased revenues, its brand strength score is also a factor in its success. Apple Brand value: $107.1 bn Last year’s rank: 1 After five years at the top, Apple lost its crown in 2017. As per Brand Finance, Apple “has failed to maintain its technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected.” It further explained that the tech giant has “over-exploited the goodwill” of its customers, namely because of its failure to generate significant revenues from products like the Apple Watch. Also Watch: Amazon Brand value: $106.3 bn Last year’s rank: 3 Amazon’s significant brand value growth meant it came close to securing the top spot in 2017. It continues to be a force in reshaping the retail market and started to move into physical stores by expanding its Amazon Fresh delivery service, opening brick-and-mortar stores, and launching its checkout-free Amazon Go store. AT&T Brand value: $87 bn Last year’s rank: 6 AT&T was at the heart of one of the biggest shifts in media in recent years with its $85-billion acquisition of Time Warner. The company overtook Verizon as the most valuable telecom brand. After its 2015 acquisition of DirecTV, it took a mono-brand approach and integrated the two logos, which has helped with its recognition among consumers, as per Brand Finance. Microsoft Brand value: $76.2 bn Last year’s rank: 4 With every new product release, it seems, Microsoft is increasingly trying to go against Apple’s customers. Its advertising is increasingly going after the Cupertino company and its products, like the Surface Studio computer, even look similar to a Mac. Samsung Brand value: $66.2 bn Last year’s rank: 7 Despite the scandal of the Galaxy Note 7 catching fire, the South Korean company went up one spot in the rankings. Financially, it quickly bounced back from the smartphone scandal, buoyed by stellar growth in its chip business. The company faced another scandal to start off 2017, as the group head was arrested in the midst of a corruption scandal. Verizon Brand value: $65.8 bn Last year’s rank: 5 Verizon dropped down from its fifth spot last year after signing up fewer subscribers than Wall Street analysts expected. It did, however, see its revenue grow. The company made some significant moves to set itself up for the future and grow a media division with the acquisition of Yahoo, video start-up Vessel and media company Complex. Walmart Brand value: $62.2 bn Last year’s rank: 8 Walmart beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations with revenue reaching $133 billion, driven by a 36% growth in e-commerce sales. It maintained its eighth spot on the ranking from last year. It also made a move to improve its employee welfare and started to pay them more last year. The retailer is already working on its own version of the store of the future. Facebook Brand value: $61.9 bn Last year’s rank: 17 2016 was a good year for Facebook. In April, CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined its 10-year plan, which would focus on artificial intelligence, increased connectivity around the world and virtual and augmented reality. The company’s revenue grew by 51% in 2016 and shows no sign of stopping in 2017. ICBC Brand value: $47.8 bn Last year’s rank: 13 Chinese state-owned bank ICBC is the world’s largest and also the most valuable bank in the world. This year, the bank pulled ahead of Wells Fargo to become the most valuable bank, as well as the most valuable financial brand in the Brand Finance rankings. The bank had steady financial results in 2016 with net profits growing by 1 billion yuan ($145 million). No Comments.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Apr 8, 2017 at 3:23PM It shouldn't surprise anyone that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) makes most of its money from the iPhone. After its initial launch in mid-2007, the iPhone gradually replaced the iPod as Apple's biggest revenue driver. Between fiscal 2008 and 2016, Apple's iPhone shipments surged from 11.6 million to 211.9 million. During that period, Apple's annual revenue rose from $32.5 billion to $215.6 billion. The seminal iPhone helped Apple crush former mobile kings Nokia and BlackBerry, sparked a tech shift which turned Microsoft and Intel into underdogs, and made it the most valuable company in the world with a market cap of about $750 billion. Let's take a closer look at how important the iPhone is to Apple, and why its success is also a double-edged sword. Apple's iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. How much does the iPhone matter to Apple? The annual launch of new iPhones remains one of the biggest tech events of the year for consumers, tech journalists, Wall Street analysts, and investors. But demand for the phones has clearly been slowing, due to competition from high-end Android rivals and the saturation of major markets like the U.S. and China. That's why last year's 211.9 million shipments actually represent an 8% decline from the 231.2 million units the company shipped in 2015. However, analysts believe that the tenth-anniversary iPhone 8 -- which will likely feature a glass body, edge-to-edge bezel-less OLED screen, and numerous hardware improvements -- will get growth back on track. Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski believes that iPhone shipments in calendar 2017 will reach 230 million. Last quarter, Apple's iPhone sales grew 5% annually and accounted for a whopping 69% of the company's top line. Apple produces iPhones for about $200 and sells them for over $600. That total excludes R&D, marketing, and other expenses, but it still allows Apple to make a lot more money than Android OEMs, which are selling their devices at much thinner margins. That's why research firm Strategy Analytics reported that at the end of 2016, Apple raked in 79% of the entire smartphone industry's profits, despite controlling just 18% of the global market. That's also why Apple constantly promotes its devices as luxury products. It's also how Apple takes prisoners But it's not just the hardware revenue that matters to Apple -- the iPhone also represents the easiest way to lock users into iOS. After iPhone users start buying apps and media from the App Store and iTunes, they're less likely to leave behind their purchases by switching to Android devices. Image source: Apple. Apple clearly knows that its lock-in strategy works. That's why it boldly launched an "upgrade" program which lets people pay for their iPhones on a monthly basis for two years. That plan also gives customers AppleCare+ coverage, and works with all carriers since users are buying an unsubsidized device. After 12 months, users can switch to the latest iPhone to reset the payment process.  It's highly unlikely that an Android OEM can launch a comparable "forever" plan, since Android users can easily swap between handset brands without losing all their Google Play content. It's a launchpad for Apple Services That brand loyalty makes the iPhone an ideal launch pad for Apple's growing Services business, which includes the App Store, iTunes, iBooks, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and Apple Music. CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly stated that Apple plans to grow its software services to offset its gradual slowdown in iPhone sales. Apple's Services revenue rose 18% annually and accounted for 9% of its top line last quarter, but there have been a few speed bumps. Apple claims that Apple Pay's user base tripled over the past year, but Loup Venture recently claimed that just 13% of iPhone users have ever used the service. Wal-Mart still doesn't accept Apple Pay, and the service is still being trampled by Tencent's WePay and Alibaba's AliPay in China. Apple Music hit 20 million paid subscribers at the end of 2016, but questions about the platform's profit margins persist. Why is the iPhone a double-edged sword? It's easy to see why the iPhone is a double-edged sword. As long as iPhone sales are rising year-over-year, investors will be happy. But once interest in the iPhone finally fades, Apple needs new products and services to pick up the slack. Mac sales rose and iPad annual sales fell last quarter, but their combined sales only accounted for 16% of Apple's revenues. The Apple Watch still generates so little revenue that it's included in the Other Products category, along with iPods, Apple TV, and Beats audio devices. No one is sure what Apple's next big move will be -- whether it be new hardware products, media acquisitions, or connected cars -- but most investors agree that it needs to reduce the weight of the mighty iPhone on its top line.   Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

 10 things in tech you need to know today Sam Shead Apr. 5, 2017, 2:18 AM 2,411 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Good morning! Here is the tech news you need to know this Wednesday. 1. Apple is planning a major overhaul of the Mac Pro, its high-end desktop computer. However, it won't be released until 2018. 2. Apple is also planning to release a much more powerful iMac later this year. Apple normally keeps quiet about the products in its pipeline, but the company's "preannouncements" this week were an exception. 3. Universal Music Group has officially signed a new, multi-year global licensing deal with Spotify. The move is considered to be a vital step in the streaming company's journey towards attempting an IPO. 4. Analysts warned that Imagination Technologies may not be able to survive without Apple. Apple notified the UK graphics chip designer this week that it plans to start designing its own graphics chips within the next two years and the company's stock price fell more than 70%. 5. Twitter won't stream the NFL's Thursday Night Football games again this year. Instead, Amazon has won the rights to stream 10 of the NFL's games. 6. Mercedes has formed a new alliance with Bosch to develop robot taxis. The alliance will look to develop the autonomous software before 2025. 7. Vin Diesel said Mark Zuckerberg is such a huge fan he'll correct his own movie quotes when they hang out. "He's such a great guy and he's a fan of my work," Diesel told The New York Times. 8. Teens think Google and YouTube are some of the coolest brands around. That's according to a self-promotional study by Google, which it is now being mocked for online. 9. Airbnb joined the same-sex marriage debate in Australia with its new ad campaign. In the ad, the company calls for marriage equality by asking people to wear a broken ring. 10. Scientists have invented a smartphone-screen material that's designed to repair its own scratches. The group predicts that this new self-healing material will be used for phone screens and batteries by 2020.

Next Apple Watch to have 4G connectivity?Thu, 06 Apr 2017 2:45 PM Share Your Email The Apple Watch, Credit: Apple, Inc     Two years after the official launch of the Apple Watch, the brand's third generation smartwatch could have a SIM card slot, according to reports by various tech news websites. This could revolutionize its use. The advantage of a smartwatch with a 4G SIM card is that it is totally autonomous and does not need to have a smartphone nearby. The SIM card obviously makes it possible to communicate (phoning and sending SMS/MMS) as well as connecting to the internet via 3G or 4G. The next Apple Watch could well incorporate the new eSIM technology, meaning a SIM card built into the watch. If Apple makes this move, it will be following a general trend. The latest version of Android Wear, which is the operating system used in most of the devices that rival Apple Watch, now handles autonomous apps which can be installed directly on the watch and no longer need a smartphone to operate. This has prompted a string of manufacturers to offer smartwatches with a SIM card and 4G connectivity. Some of the more high-end examples of this include the LG Watch Sport, LG Watch Style and the Huawei Watch 2. The Samsung Gear S3 is another example, using Samsung's own Tizen operating system. The increasingly availability of smartwatches with 4G is one of the reasons why Apple cannot launch a new generation of the Apple Watch which is not standalone. It would therefore be possible to communicate, listen to music, and share on social media without the need for an iPhone nearby.

Apple Music for Android updated to v2.0 with a redesigned user interface Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 12:02pm PDTApr 4, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 75 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares153 Applications News Apple Music doesn't have the best reviews in the Play Store. Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. Shame-sung C.E.O You know you lose when you make up excuses to block anyone. Blocking someone is the ultimate way to say "Your right and i'm wrong so im scared and i will block you now" LMFAO! AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Malhaar Kale But it censors music tracks. (At least when I had checked it last time). Genuine question - have they stopped doing it? Jay It has full support for explicit music in India now, for a while. Malhaar Kale That's amazing. Wasn't aware Loved FYI, Even Google play music offers the same 2$/ Album in those same price sensitive areas like India. Apple music is no better Roh_Mish Apple music has subscription for streaming here. Play music doesn't. Jay Which has little to do with the topic in hand. Your FYI is kinda wasted since i live here in India and already knew that. We were talking about streaming networks here and GPM does not offer streaming as an option in India yet. Loved Good to know Loved Ahemmm... GPM now offers streaming all access in India... And that's for nearly 3/4th apple's price... I standby what I said: APPLE MUSIC IS NO BETTER Jay Hah! How could anyone have known, that they were going to start offer it for 90 bucks (inr) just a few hours later?! XD Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. Carson Saldanha Says here that it is: https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/28/google-play-music-india/ Is the subscription service not available? Jay Nope and it says so in the article you linked itself. While the Play Music store has launched, there are some caveats. It doesn’t include the Spotify-like ‘All Access’ streaming service and there’s no radio or podcasts yet. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. chandrizzle Android Auto would be nice too Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone. Shows up compatible here on 3T with OOS Open Beta 4. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4bab1cfba435fd009bd0fa2e223e05a036c0f0e20e9e1ba8174a887f9ac8ba42.png Zorn I have the OOS Open Beta 4 installed as well. Still greyed out and says this version is not compatible with my device. No idea. Rebel without a Clue I wonder why, 3T here running a rooted custom rom and it's compatible with it. Margaritas Ante Porcos Both Apple Music and Google Music are terribly awful. Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. Daniel Tiberius You can if you run the desktop app. Brian Demodulated That only lets you play your local music, and it's a pretty bad local music player. I want to be able to play my music at work on in the car. Daniel Tiberius I've heard if you run the desktop app at home you can access those files through the mobile app. Brian Demodulated I haven't used Spotify for 2 years so perhaps they've added this. Before I subscribed to Google Play Music I used to run a free open source music streaming server called Subsonic. Loved it! Daniel Tiberius I still use Subsonic. It's very handy. WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music. It felt like it never left beta state which I was using since beginning. Reason I use it instead of Spotify ? Slightly larger song base for Asian artist ( at least those I listen to ) Shailesh Kumar OMG! That Black Status Bar is killing my eyes. Deborah Sawyer Who freakin' cares. Why do we have Android in the first place? I don't need or want Apple software on my Android phone. Nicholas Conrad Oh, that'll be nice for 14 people.

Diskus1 I really wonder if Apple Music actually has more subscribers on Android than Google Play Music does... amazing how bad Google promotes and develops the Music app. Bikas A big surprise for me is their pricing in India, it's so apt. They are charging Rs.120 (< $2) / month which is quite competitive and good. They can potentially win against Spotify ($9.99/month) and Play Music (if launched). But their major problem is music services here like Gaana (Rs.60/month), Wync or Jio Music (free with career). hooch Wow is that ugly Follow Android Police 1.5M 464k 142k 105k Latest Deals 7 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Gen LTE for $179.99 ($220 off) on eBay 2017/04/08 7:15pm PDTApr 8, 2017 14 [Deal Alert] 4-pack Type C to MicroUSB adapters $4.95 at Amazon w/Slickdeals code ($3 off MSRP) 2017/04/07 1:02pm PDTApr 7, 2017 9 [Deal Alert] JBL Flip 3 on sale at $64 ($36 off MSRP) as an Amazon Gold Box daily deal 2017/04/07 12:12pm PDTApr 7, 2017 3 [Deal Alert] Snag an Arlo Pro 3-pack from Amazon for $500 ($80 off) 2017/04/06 7:07pm PDTApr 6, 2017 25 [Deal Alert] Grab these free and 10-cent apps, games, and icon packs 2017/04/05 6:44am PDTApr 5, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Apple lists only one security fix, but it’s a doozy, and undoubtedly explains why Apple pushed 10.3.1 out so quickly. The update addresses an exploit that could have enabled an attacker within range to execute arbitrary code on the Wi-Fi chip in an iOS device. We hope this bug existed only in iOS 10.3. If you have already updated to iOS 10.3, we recommend installing 10.3.1 to get this security fix. If you’re still running iOS 10.2.1, stick with it for another week or so to make sure 10.3.1 doesn’t introduce some new problem.   TextExpander: Communicate smarter.

Apple has released iOS 10.3.1 with bug and security fixes, but the company isn’t disclosing much. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment David Empson  2017-04-05 18:31 This bug could easily affect versions before iOS 10.3. It was reported to Broadcom in December, therefore was discovered before iOS 10.3's first beta was released. The initial report may have been for Android devices, and it isn't clear when it was discovered to also affect iOS devices. The blog post from Google Project Zero says that the Broadcom chipset in question has been used since the iPhone 4, therefore it might affect versions as far back as iOS 4 on new enough models (iPhone 4 or later, all iPads, recent iPod Touch). The question is when the "Fast BSS Transition" feature with the bug was implemented on iOS: if Apple didn't implement it until a later iOS version, then earlier versions might be safe. This needs testing with the demo exploit to confirm which iOS versions are affected. For now, I'd assume all recent iOS versions are potentially affected, therefore all devices able to update to iOS 10.3.1 should do so, but it isn't urgent yet as the exploit hasn't been available for long. Devices which can't upgrade to iOS 10 might be vulnerable; if so they are unlikely to get a fix unless Apple decides to do a "late" security update for iOS 9 (an iOS 7 fix for the iPhone 4 is even less likely). https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6975 https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/04/over-air-exploiting-broadcoms-wi-fi_4.html https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1059 Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-07 19:35 Thanks for the details, David! Sounds like this will be a real reason to move to 10.3.1 sooner rather than later for those devices that can do it. Reply  Search   Cached.

The Swiss financial services company suggests that the next generation iPhone will retail at less than $1,000, with new models of the smartphone expected to achieve what UBS describes as a “bulge of buying”. FunkyFocus / Pixabay Stock price hike As a result of its price anticipation for the iPhone 8, UBS is now positive about the Apple financial outlook for 2018. It now believes that Apple’s earnings per share will be $10.55 in this period, which is a significant increase over its previous estimate of $10.25. UBS also asserts that the iPhone average selling price will be $692, which is up from a prior estimate of $667. So what has caused the investment bank to radically alter its perception of Apple and the iPhone 8? UBS believes that the 2017 iPhone release will benefit from a massively boosted upgrade cycle, with high-end technology boosting the iconic smartphone series. UBS seemingly believes that the much vaunted OLED iPhone 8 will indeed come to fruition in the next six months, with three models of the smartphone series also expected. Apple is expected to benefit from the superior display quality of OLED technology, and particularly the power efficiency boost over its previous LCD screens. however, there will also be financial challenges for Apple in manufacturing the iPhone 8 at an affordable price point, with UPS stating that the factory cost of the 64GB iPhone 8 will be around $80 higher than the iPhone 7 Plus. Price tag floated Nonetheless, despite the extra manufacturing costs, UBS believes that the iPhone 8 will retail at a price point between $850 and $900. This will have a significant influence over Apple’s profitability, as UBS believes that it will negatively impact upon the gross margin for the company. However, the extent of this will be relatively trivial, with UBS suggesting that it is likely to decline to around 38.5 percent in the 2018 fiscal year; only a slight decline from its estimate of 38.7 percent for the existing financial period. And the investing bank also believes that the 64GB OLED iPhone 8 model priced at $870 will be a strong performer for the Californian corporation. “We think an $870 price would be accretive to EPS but dilutive to gross margin, a dynamic Apple has said it would accept,” UBS opined. Samsung battle It seems that with Samsung having already released the Galaxy S8 at an affordable $720 price point that there is pressure on Apple to deliver a more reasonably priced smartphone. Even the larger Galaxy S8 Plus retails at $840, and it quite clear that Apple would be pushing even its massive reputation and brand penetration with a $1,000 plus price point. Nonetheless, it is notable that the estimate of UBS places the RRP for the iPhone 8 above even the premium Galaxy S8 Plus version. But the investment bank believes that consumers will be willing to shell out the extra money in order to purchase hardware that is considered innovative. Additionally, the Apple brand remains one of the most bankable in any industry. Analyst Steven Milunovich noted that Apple has been able to retain the average selling price of its Macs above $1,200 despite the industry ASP falling to around $600. Yet despite the disparity in price, sales of the desktop computer have remained extremely robust, with the Cupertino-based company having posted only two negative years of Mac sales. “Apple customers seem fine with paying more for products they feel are differentiated,” Milunovich asserted. Even the iPhone 7 Plus has sold rather well for Apple, with UBS noting that the phablet “has had more demand than any other Plus model release”. The dual-camera unit included in the phone is thought to have been particularly significant, and UBS predicts that the Plus range will account for over 40 percent of-sales in fiscal year 2017. This is excellent news for Apple, and illustrates the growing significance of its flagship phablet, as the historical average for this device has been around 25 to 30 percent. Screen size hint Meanwhile, with UBS suggesting that the Plus mobile may account for around 45 percent of sales for the iPhone 8 series, the financial institution also make predictions about the screen size of the smartphone. It is suggested by UBS that the main model of the iPhone 8 will feature a 5.2-inch display; an interesting suggestion as it would represent an increase in screen real estate over previous releases. Nonetheless, it is still notable that the 5.2-inch screen would be significant as this will be a serious area of consideration with regard to pricing. “Apple’s top model will be at a display size disadvantage to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 Plus. We still think Apple will choose to price its top model relative to Samsung’s top model, but remain cautious on how much higher Apple could ultimately go on price given a smaller display,” Milunovich suggested. Thus, the UBS analyst believes that Apple must deliver unique and innovative new features if it is to capture the imagination of consumers. “Offsetting this display size differential is the fact that the OLED iPhone could have features not included in the Galaxy S8 Plus, such as a front facing 3D sensing camera, embedded fingerprint sensor and higher quality facial recognition,” the analyst wrote with regard to the next generation Apple handset. Responding to its predictions about the iPhone 8, UBS reiterated its $150 price target for Apple stock, significantly above the mean of $147, according to Reuters data. Barclays research note In other news, a research note from Barclays Investment bank suggests that Apple will include “full spectral sensing” as part of a “True Color” display in the iPhone 8 generation. This is effectively an ambient light sensor, already included in the iPad Pro. Barclays analysts Andrew Gardiner, Hiral Patel, Joseph Wolf, Blayne Curtis, and Mark Moskowitz collaborated on a report which floats this content improvement for the iPhone 8. Clearly Apple is stepping up its preparation for the next gen flagship.

Job adverts posted in the last month reveal a string of openings at Apple’s “UK Design Centre” for roles in graphics unit design. It is likely to increase fears that Imagination will lose more staff to the iPhone maker after dozens of employees have jumped ship from the Hertfordshire-based group. Last week, Imagination was thrown into chaos when it emerged that Apple planned to stop using its designs for the graphics chips that power the iPhone and iPad. imagination technologies 5 day shares The British group, which relies on Apple for more than half of its revenues, suffered a 62pc share price fall and analysts said the company faces the prospect of a break-up. Apple’s openings reveal around a dozen new opportunities for roles in designing and supporting the graphics architecture, the technology that Imagination currently licenses to Apple. Imagination’s current employees are likely to be a key target. Profiles on the networking website LinkedIn reveal that at least 25 former Imagination staff have joined Apple in the last two years in San Francisco and London. They include John Metcalfe, Imagination’s former chief operating officer. FAQ | Apple and Imagination Imagination has challenged Apple’s claims that the US company will be able to build its own graphics technology. It said it would enter negotiations with Apple but did not rule out the prospect of legal action. Imagination has licensed its graphics designs to Apple for a decade, and revenue from the contract is expected to rise from £60.7m to £65m this year. Apple now plans to be using its own designs within two years, Imagination said on Monday.

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 08, 2017 1:43pm   Comments Share: Your local ATM could recognize your face within five years. Your taxes could be prepared by a robo-accountant. Your lawyer might be reduced to an algorithm fully versed in legal precedent. Your ear canal is a better form of identification than a fingerprint, let alone a driver’s license, and might become the prevailing form of preventing cyber fraud. Welcome to the futuristic world of Gene Munster, 45, a venture capitalist who specializes in the worlds of virtual reality, augmented reality, robotics and artificial intelligence. “We’ve only scratched the surface,” said Munster, a managing partner and co-founder of Loup Ventures in Minneapolis. Before leaving at the end of last year to form Loup, the Tony Stark of investors spent 21 years as a top analyst for Piper Jaffray, where he covered tech companies such as Apple Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB). He’s perhaps best known for picking Apple to take off in 2004. The difference with the new job? A lot of mundane administrative work. “It’s so far, so good,” he said. “I would say 70 percent of what I do is what I did before. The part I don’t like is the business operation side (human resources, legal issues, etc.).” The Price Of Intelligent Robots: People Augmented reality and artificial intelligence are keys to future breakthroughs in fintech, said Munster, one of the judges at the Benzinga Fintech Awards to be held in New York on May 11. “How people interact and how they work is going to radically change in the next 30 years,” he said. But there is a price for swapping out people with robo-replacements, he added. “I think a majority of people will benefit and many people will be displaced [...] As a culture going forward, we will have to deal with that.” “Accounts are going to go away. A lot of lawyers will go away.” Augmented reality wearables might soon identify a person you should recognize but can’t recall the name. During a panel of college students assembled for input on augmented reality, he said a young woman described an angst-filled dream in which every person she met was viewable as a set of likability metrics. “That probably is a point of anxiety for some people who grew up surrounded by social media,” he said. Wearables May Replace Telephones He said the telephone as the prime engine of augmented reality is good for the next five years, after which a wearable device — one that projects images and information back to the eye like an all-purpose screen — will eventually supplant the phone. Biometrics — the ear canal has been proven as an almost conclusive way — &rlquo;are the best ways to authenticate people” and reduce cyber fraud. Augmented reality will almost certainly be used to direct people to their seats at stadiums or concerts. Light fields — often confused with holography — are good bets in telecommunications. Eventually, he believes, the human interface with technology will be reduced a single screen. “The crazy part of all this is that today we are surrounded by screens,” he said. “In the future we will probably have one screen.” Munster’s endeavor is headquartered in his native Minneapolis, with considerable time spent in New York and San Francisco. He and his wife have a 10-month-old daughter. “Fitness is my hobby,” he said, and a Moscow Mule — vodka and ginger beer — his beverage of choice. _____ If you liked this profile, check out these articles from our "Day In The Life" series: A Day In The Life Of The Fintech CEO Attacking Student Loan Debt A Day In The Life Of An InsurTech CEO Who Just Raised $5 Million If you’re looking for cool fintech startups and access to top financial institutions, and are sick of attending stuffy corporate conferences, the Benzinga Global Fintech Awards is the event for you.

The main building resembles a flying saucer with a hole in the middle. Through its large, gently curving windows, workers will eventually look out on a wood containing some 7,000 carefully chosen trees. It is as though a race of high-tech beings has landed on a pristine planet. And then, unfortunately, there’s the car park. For 14,000 workers, Apple is building almost 11,000 parking spaces. Many cars will be tucked under the main building, but most will cram into two enormous garages to the south. Tot up all the parking spaces and the lanes and ramps that will allow cars to reach them, and it is clear that Apple is allocating a vast area to stationary vehicles. In all, the new headquarters will contain 318,000 square metres of offices and laboratories. The car parks will occupy 325,000 square metres.

Cupertino has a requirement for every building. A developer who wants to put up a block of flats, for example, must provide two parking spaces per apartment, one of which must be covered. For a fast-food restaurant, the city demands one space for every three seats; for a bowling alley, seven spaces per lane plus one for every worker. Cupertino’s neighbours have similar rules. With such a surfeit of parking, most of it free, it is little wonder that most people get around Silicon Valley by car, or that the area has such appalling traffic jams. Parking can seem like the most humdrum concern in the world. Even planners, who thrill to things like zoning and floor-area ratios, find it unglamorous. But parking influences the way cities look, and how people travel around them, more powerfully than almost anything else. Many cities try to make themselves more appealing by building cycle paths and tram lines or by erecting swaggering buildings by famous architects. If they do not also change their parking policies, such efforts amount to little more than window-dressing. There is a one-word answer to why the streets of Los Angeles look so different from those of London, and why neither city resembles Tokyo: parking. For as long as there have been cars, there has been a need to store them when they are not moving—which, these days, is about 95% of the time. Washington, DC, had a parking garage in 1907, before Ford produced its first Model T. But the most important innovation came in 1923, when Columbus, in Ohio, began to insist that builders of flats create parking spaces for the people who would live in them. “Parking minimums”, as these are known, gradually spread across America. Now, as the number of cars on the world’s roads continues to grow (see chart), they are spreading around the world. The codes that tell developers how much parking they must provide can be wonderfully revealing of local mores. In Las Vegas, “sex novelty shops” must have at least three spaces per 1,000 square feet (93 square metres) of floor space but “adult entertainment cabarets” at least ten for the same area. Singapore insists on one space for every 500 niches in a columbarium—a place where funerary urns are stored. Chennai’s city plan calls for one parking space for every 20 square metres of marriage hall. Perhaps unwisely, the city of Swan, in Australia, has parking minimums for taverns and wineries. Might as well do the white line Some developers are happy to supply parking spaces. Ryan Shear of Property Markets Group builds expensive flats in Miami, which are often bought by Latin Americans. He sometimes creates more spaces than the city requires, because his customers desire a safe place for their precious motors. But most developers create the number of parking spaces they are compelled to build and no more. In 2004 London abolished minimum parking requirements. Research by Zhan Guo of New York University shows that the amount of parking in new residential blocks promptly plunged, from an average of 1.1 spaces per flat to 0.6 spaces. The parking minimum had boosted supply far beyond what the market demanded. Water companies are not obliged to supply all the water that people would use if it were free, nor are power companies expected to provide all the free electricity that customers might want. But many cities try to provide enough spaces to meet the demand for free parking, even at peak times. Some base their parking minimums on the “Parking Generation Handbook”, a tome produced by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. This reports how many cars are found in the free car parks of synagogues, waterslide parks and so on when they are busiest. The harm caused begins with the obvious fact that parking takes up a lot of room. A typical space is 12-15 square metres; add the necessary access lanes and the space per car roughly doubles. For comparison, this summer The Economist will move into a building in central London where it is assumed each employee will have ten square metres of space. In cities, such as Kansas City (see map), where land is cheap, and surface parking the norm, central areas resemble asphalt oceans dotted with buildings. Kerb your enthusiasm The more spread out and car-oriented a city, as a result of enormous car parks, the less appealing walking and cycling become. Besides, if you know you can park free wherever you go, why not drive? The ever-growing supply of free parking in America is one reason why investments in public transport have coaxed so few people out of cars, says David King of Arizona State University. In 1990, 73% of Americans got to work by driving alone, according to the census. In 2014, after a ballyhooed urban revival and many expensive tram and rapid-bus projects, 76% drove. The rule of thumb in America is that multi-storey car parks cost about $25,000 per space and underground parking costs $35,000. Donald Shoup, an authority on parking economics, estimates that creating the minimum number of spaces adds 67% to the cost of a new shopping centre in Los Angeles if the car park is above ground and 93% if it is underground. Parking requirements can also make redevelopment impossible. Converting an old office building into flats generally means providing the parking spaces required for a new block of flats, which is likely to be difficult. The biggest cost of parking minimums may be the economic activity they prevent. Free parking is not, of course, really free. The costs of building the car parks, as well as cleaning, lighting, repairing and securing them, are passed on to the people who use the buildings to which they are attached. Restaurant meals and cinema tickets are more pricey; flats are more expensive; office workers are presumably paid less. Everybody pays, whether or not they drive. And that has an unfortunate distributional effect, because young people drive a little less than the middle-aged and the poor drive less than the rich. In America, 17% of blacks and 12% of Hispanics who lived in big cities usually took public transport to work in 2013, whereas 7% of whites did. Free parking represents a subsidy for older people that is paid disproportionately by the young and a subsidy for the wealthy that is paid by the poor. A few crowded American cities, including San Francisco, have abolished their parking minimums. So has one shrinking city—Buffalo, in New York state. But most of the country seems to be stuck with a hugely costly and damaging solution to the parking problem. And the American approach to parking is spreading to some of the world’s fastest-growing cities. In China, cars park everywhere—in marked spaces, in places where parking is specifically banned, in bicycle lanes, on pavements. In some cities, the fight for parking spaces has become so intense that people install metal barriers to which only they have the key, or persuade their parents to reserve spaces by sitting in them. Beijing’s streets are patrolled by orange-jacketed workers who, in theory, put slips of paper on car windows to mark when the vehicles arrive, and then collect money from drivers when they leave (they also assist novice drivers in the tricky art of parallel parking). In practice, the parking wardens give discounts to drivers who forgo receipts, then pocket the money. Some also make cash from illegal parking spaces. Beijing’s parking minimums were laid down in 2003, before driving took off, and are modest: just 0.3 spaces per flat in the city centre and 0.5 outside it. They are expected to rise in response to the growing chaos on the streets. Most Indian planners concur that the best way of ameliorating a shortage is to require more off-street parking, says Shreya Gadepalli of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, a think-tank. One reason, she suggests, is that so many of them studied at American universities. Whether in America or Asia, oceans of free parking might delay a transport revolution. When autonomous cars that are allowed to move with nobody inside them become widespread, demand for private cars could fall sharply. Starting in the morning, one car could take a child to school, a city worker to his office, a student to her lecture, party people to a club, and a security guard to his night shift, all more cheaply than taxis. Cars that now sit idle could become much more active, which would drastically change parking needs. Parking garages would still be needed in a driverless world, predicts Sean Behr, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. Instead of storing vehicles for hours at a time, though, garages might become service centres where shared battery-powered cars could be cleaned, repaired and recharged before being sent back on the road. “We will need better facilities for a smaller number of vehicles,” he suggests. These garages need not be in city centres. In the slow hours of mid-morning and early afternoon, driverless cars could trundle to industrial estates in suburbia. Much of the area now allocated to cars in city centres could be turned into homes, offices or parks. Mr Shear is already building flats with drop-off and pick-up areas, to accommodate people who travel by Uber cars. In a radically driverless future, he could perhaps do away with many of his parking spaces. But only if consumers decide to forgo car ownership—and whether they do is connected to parking. Where spaces are expensive, shared vehicles that need not be parked are highly attractive. They are less attractive in cities where parking is plentiful and free, such as Miami. Unlike Africa and Asia, European streets are for the most part well-policed. Although some cities have parking requirements, these are seldom as extravagant as American ones, and have been progressively weakened. Several cities even have parking maximums, which restrict the amount of spaces. Huge buildings rise with hardly any provision for cars: the Shard in London has 95 storeys but just 48 spaces. Yet European cities are much kinder to cars than they usually admit. To ride in one of Amsterdam’s “scan cars” is to witness the epitome of Western parking enforcement. As it moves through the streets, clicking noises confirm that roof-mounted cameras are snapping the number plates of every parked car. If any vehicle has overstayed—which the system knows because Amsterdam’s parking meters are connected to a database, and drivers are required to enter their number plates when they pay—a second officer is alerted. He rides to the scene on a moped and issues a digital fine. Amsterdam’s parking officers describe their system as fair. They mean it is so ruthlessly efficient that it cannot be beaten. Just the ticket Amsterdam charges up to €5 ($5.30) an hour for parking on the street. Visitors can also park underneath office buildings or in large, clean park-and-ride garages run by the city. Drivers thus have many choices and the city raises a lot of money—€190m in 2015. Yet this diverse, market-based system covers only a small slice of parking in Amsterdam. Three-quarters of spaces on the streets of the city centre are occupied not by visitors or commuters but by residents. And the people of Amsterdam, who are so keen on pricing parking for others, would not dream of exposing themselves to market forces. Anybody who lives in a home without a dedicated space is entitled to buy a permit to park nearby for between €30 and €535 a year. This is a good deal and, not surprisingly, the number of takers in many districts exceeds the number of spaces. So Amsterdam has waiting lists for permits. The longest, in the Westerpark area, is 232 months long. To free more spaces, the city has begun to reimburse permit-holders part of the annual fee if they keep their cars in suburban garages. Take-up is encouraging—which suggests that, despite the long queues, many people do not prize the opportunity to park close to their homes. It’s a sign of the times in Kolkata A more obvious solution would be to charge more for permits. But that is politically fraught. Amsterdammers believe they have a right to park near their homes, explains Pieter Litjens, the deputy mayor in charge of transport. (They also believe they should be able to leave their bicycles absolutely anywhere for nothing, which is another headache.) So the queues for permits are likely to grow. Amsterdam expects to build 50,000 more homes before 2025, which will mean between 20,000 and 30,000 more cars. Even more than in America’s sprawling cities, car parking in Amsterdam is unsightly. “The canals are beautiful, and cars are parked along them all the time,” laments Mr Litjens. The city would love to sweep them away, but that would be unpopular. So in one district, De Pijp, a bold (and expensive) remedy is under way. Engineers have drained a canal and are digging an underground garage with 600 parking spaces into the marshy ground beneath. When the car park is finished and sealed, the canal will be refilled with water. The city will then abolish 273 parking spaces on the streets above. Other cities lauded for their excellent public transport and enthusiasm for market-based solutions to traffic problems also have a blind spot when it comes to residents’ parking. Much of inner London, for example, is covered with residents’ parking zones. The permits are often even cheaper than in Amsterdam: Kensington and Chelsea charges between £80 ($100) and £219 a year for the right to park anywhere in the borough and on the fringe of nearby Westminster. Visitors, on the other hand, must pay between £1.20 and £4.60 an hour. Given that the average home in Kensington and Chelsea sold for £1.9m last year, residents’ parking represents a gift to some of Britain’s richest people. Despite being the home of Lyft and Uber, two car-sharing services, San Francisco is similarly generous. It charges just $127 a year for residents’ permits. Unlike Amsterdam, though, San Francisco does not cap the number, and in some neighbourhoods one and a half are issued for every parking space. The result is a perpetual scrap for empty kerb. A survey in 2015 found that 53% of permit-holders had spent at least five minutes looking for a space at the end of their most recent trip, and 7% more than half an hour. As San Francisco’s infuriated drivers cruise around, they crowd the roads and pollute the air. This is a widespread hidden cost of under-priced street parking. Mr Shoup has estimated that cruising for spaces in Westwood village, in Los Angeles, amounts to 950,000 excess vehicle miles travelled per year. Westwood is tiny, with only 470 metered spaces. There is, however, one exception to the rule that residential parking must never be subjected to market forces. In the 1950s, when it was still far from rich, Japan began to require city-dwellers who did not have parking spaces in their buildings to purchase them. These days anybody who wishes to buy a car must first show a receipt for a space. He or she had better use it: any vehicle without one left on the roadside will be removed by the police in the middle of the night. Parking brake Freed of cars, the narrow residential streets of Tokyo are quieter than in other big cities. Every so often a courtyard or spare patch of land has been turned into a car park—some more expensive than others. Takaomi Kondoh, who works for a firm that manages buildings and car parks, explains that prices are usually higher close to transport hubs, because commuters compete for those spaces. Near the central station in Tama, a suburb, the going rate is ¥17,000 per month ($150). Ten minutes’ walk away it drops to ¥10,000. Once you become accustomed to the idea that city streets are only for driving and walking, and not for parking, it is difficult to imagine how it could possibly be otherwise. Mr Kondoh is so perplexed by an account of a British suburb, with its kerbside commons, that he asks for a diagram. Your correspondent tries to draw his own street, with large rectangles for houses, a line representing the kerb and small rectangles showing all the parked cars. The small rectangles take up a surprising amount of room.

Apple iMac Pro Features, Specifications & Release Date: What We Know So Far. April 8, 2017 by Staff   Filed under News, Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns Leave a Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 6 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) Apple iMac Pro is coming soon and the company has confirmed that it will be focused more on the specific requirements of professional users. Apple recently called journalists and revealed that the company is currently working on a new iMac Pro. Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller told journalists that the new product is being designed keeping the pro customers in mind. Several publications brought the information from the Cupertino based company. In his statement, Schiller said “We have big plans for the iMac. We’re going to begin making configurations of iMac specifically with the pro customer in mind,” BuzzFeed quotes. Without revealing any specific details about these configurations, Apple made it very clear that it has realized the need of professionals. A large number of professionals including developers and designers use Apple’s desktops. Now when the arrival of the iMac Pro is confirmed, here’s what the company has officially revealed so far. Features Many of the Apple iMac Pro features are still under wrap. Apple usually doesn’t speak about the upcoming products, but surprisingly the company has made this pre-release announcement this time. When Apple says it will focus on the needs of professionals, it means that the majority of focus will be storage and performance. It is obvious that this time, the company will be implementing the lessons learned from the controversial MacBook Pro release. Without going into specifics, Schiller confirmed that touch functionality will be absent from the iMac Pro. Specifications The current user base for iMac is in different categories and according to Apple, the specifications offered by the existing machines do not fulfill the needs of a wide array of professional users. According to Schiller, 15 percent of Mac users use professional applications many times in week. The company also says that the user base is huge and what Apple is trying to do is to bring as many professionals as possible on Apple iMac Pro. Apple says that it is reaching close to the 100 million Mac user base. The company admits that it didn’t appreciate the design much and now Apple feels that the available iMac designs do not match with the company’s vision for the future. The machines at present do not have the capabilities to cover the audience Apple aims to bring in. When asked about the expected changes, Apple confirmed that the changes are not just limited to design or architecture only. Without highlighting any specific aspects, the company said that it will be a complete overhaul. “With regards to the Mac Pro, we are in the process of what we call ‘completely rethinking the Mac Pro,” said Schiller, during the roundtable conversation as reported by Tech Crunch. With the advent of iMac desktops, the Mac user base is growing. According to the company, it ships the notebooks and desktops computers at the ratio of 80:20. The company also said that it has witnessed growth in the MacBook Pro sales in the first quarter of the financial year. Apple considers Mac as a huge part of the company’s future and so much is invested into Mac. Release Date Apple has not shared any official statement regarding the Apple iMac Pro release date. As usual, the rumors are circulating the next iMac Pro, and it is being said that the company will launch it sometime around October this year. On the other hand, there are reports that the product is not going to arrive before 2018. Apple has only said that they are working on the product which will definitely require time as the company aims to rebuild the entire structure to cater to the needs of wide ranging professionals around the world. The company also expects the Apple iMac Pro release not to happen anytime soon. So, without any official words, it is better you take the rumors with a pinch of salt.

It's been another thrilling week across the tech world, with no end of exciting announcements, spicy rumors... and some disappointments. As ever, 7 Days is here to bring you up to speed with what's been happening with a handy walkthrough of the week's top tech news. Our journey begins this week with Microsoft, which is preparing to host its a 'virtual career fair' building on its Autism Hiring Program. The event coincides with National Autism Awareness Month in the United States, and aims to provide new opportunities for talented individuals with autism. The latest in WikiLeaks' Vault7 series of releases revealed details of 'Marble', a framework used by the CIA to mask the source of the malware it used to target devices, in an effort to avoid detection by forensic investigators. Meanwhile, a security researcher examined Samsung's Tizen operating system, used in its smart TVs, smartwatches, and other devices. The researcher declared the OS a security disaster, and said it "may be the worst code I've ever seen". The European Aviation Safety Agency raised serious concerns about passenger safety following the recent ban - on some flights to and from the US and UK - of many electronic devices from the main passenger cabin. Verizon is preparing to install an app on its mobile devices that will monitor user data in order to target ads at its customers. Predictably, that news hasn't gone down well with many people - in fact, the Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized Verizon for loading its phones with "spyware". Verizon is pushing ahead with its Yahoo acquisition, and announced this week that it will merge that company with AOL into a new division branded - hilariously, and inexplicably - as 'Oath'. A branding expert at the highly regarded Brand New site described the name as "completely ridiculous, pretentious, annoying, and, above all, irrelevant to anything having to do with digital media." Can't argue with that. Mozilla is planning to introduce a new user interface with the upcoming release of Firefox 57, along with several new features for the browser. WhatsApp is reportedly in talks to integrate its communication service with a mobile payment platform. Apple released iOS 10.3.1 on Monday, bringing an important security update to fix a vulnerability that could allow someone to execute code on the Wi-Fi chip. Apple dumped its hardware partner Imagination Technologies, as it now plans to develop its own graphics processor technology for future mobile devices. That move had a devastating effect on the British company, wiping over 60% off its stock price. After three and a half years without an update, Apple apologized this week for having done nothing to improve its Mac Pro desktop PCs, and promised that a new model is on the way - but it won't be coming anytime soon. It finally made some spec changes to the existing Mac Pro line, along with some pricing adjustments on Tuesday, and said that it will launch an 'iMac Pro' later this year - but no, it won't have a touchscreen. Apple is also said to be rethinking its approach to TV, and may be planning to sell bundles of pay-TV services such as HBO, Showtime and Starz. Google launched its new YouTube TV service in six US markets this week, with 39 TV stations and at least ten more on the way. The service will be priced at $35 per month. A beta version of YouTube Go - which allows users to watch and share videos offline - also appeared on the Google Play Store. Google published its latest breakdown of Android version usage this week, showing no growth at all for Android 7.1 Nougat, the latest version of the OS. Android 6.0 Marshmallow saw a slight decline in usage, but the ageing 5.x Lollipop remains the most widely used version. The long, slow rollout of Nougat continues, reaching more devices in recent days: Android 7.0 rollout begins for Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 and 9.7 Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ get Nougat on Sprint Android 7.1.2 images now available; Nexus 6 and 9 are no longer supported Google Pixel and Pixel XL on Verizon get their own version of Android 7.1.2 The poor state of Android updates was clearly demonstrated this week, as several devices were finally upgraded to Android 6.0 Marshmallow, eighteen months after that version was released: Better late than never: Oppo R9, R9 Plus and F1s finally get Marshmallow update Fairphone 2 gets Android 6.0 update YotaPhone 2 gets Marshmallow; YotaPhone 3 teaser appears A handful of Samsung's devices also received the March security update, over four weeks after those patches were made available by Google: Galaxy A5 (2017) in Europe Galaxy A5 (2016) in Europe Galaxy S7 and S7 edge on Sprint We knew it was coming, but Google finally killed its Map Maker tool last weekend, promising to integrate its features into the core Google Maps product. Google also delivered an update to its Daydream virtual reality platform, adding a minor, but useful feature. Unfortunately, it also emerged that Samsung's new Galaxy S8 and S8+ aren't compatible with Daydream, and given that Samsung is promoting its own separate Gear VR suite, it's not yet clear if that compatibility will ever come. Samsung launched a new version of its Galaxy S8+ in its home market of South Korea, featuring 6GB of RAM and 128GB storage, rather than the 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage on the standard model. Samsung has been promising to launch devices with foldable displays for years now. Recent rumors had even suggested that it would release one such device before the end of 2017. But the company made it clear this week that the technology isn't yet 'mature', and the first foldable devices won't arrive until at least 2019. In November 2016, OnePlus said that it would fix a touch input lag issue on its flagship 3 and 3T devices, but said that it wasn't the company's top priority. At the time, OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei told customers complaining about the issue to "keep things in perspective". Over four months later, OnePlus has finally fixed the problem - although the fix isn't yet available to owners of those devices. OnePlus said in November that its top priority was working on its Android 7.0 Nougat update, which it released for the 3 and 3T in January. But owners of the OnePlus 2 and OnePlus X have been told nothing about its plans to deliver Nougat for their devices - and they're becoming increasingly frustrated with the company about that. More details were revealed this week about HTC's new flagship (yep, another one), which is expected to be released as the 'HTC U'. Sony's new "super mid-range" Xperia XZs went on sale on Wednesday, priced at $699. Its key feature - which it shares with the range-topping Xperia XZ Premium - is its rear camera, which can record super-slow-motion video at a whopping 960 frames per second. HMD Global still hasn't announced exact release dates, but it's looking increasingly likely that its new Nokia 3310 will go on sale in April, with the Nokia 3, 5, and 6 launching internationally throughout May. According to the latest data from StatCounter, Android has officially passed Windows as the most widely used operating system for internet usage - a major milestone for Google's OS. Meanwhile, Windows 10 has been making good progress among gamers, reaching its highest ever usage share on the Steam gaming platform, now at 51.2%. On Wednesday, Microsoft officially released the Windows 10 Creators Update, although its general rollout won't begin until April 11. For now, those wishing to install it can do so using the Media Creation Tool, or via Microsoft's Update Assistant. Microsoft has advised those on the Windows Insider Program to check and adjust their settings, as it said that the next wave of new Fast ring builds from the Development Branch are likely to include many bugs and instabilities. The first cumulative update for the Creators Update, build 15063.13, has already been released to the Production ring, for those who have installed the newest version of the OS. Coinciding with availability of the Creators Update, Microsoft also launched the 'final' - i.e. non-preview - version of the Software Development Kit (SDK) for that release. There are a couple of issues that some users will need to be aware of, though. For example, Apple's Boot Camp doesn't yet support clean installations of the Windows 10 Creators Update on its Mac devices. And some users have reported problems with the Logitech BRIO webcam after installing the Creators Update - but there is a fix available. Microsoft updated its hardware requirements for Windows 10 as part of its Creators Update refresh, including those for mobile devices. However, there's still no support for Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 821 and 835 chips, so any company wishing to build a Windows handset remains limited to using older processors. You can see the full list of changes to the Windows 10 Mobile hardware requirements here. But a far greater disappointment for Windows 10 Mobile users is that the Creators Update won't be coming to all currently-supported handsets. Devices such as the Lumia 735, 830, 930 and 1520 will apparently be unable to get an official upgrade to the new version. As you can probably imagine, that revelation - which hasn't yet been explicitly confirmed by Microsoft - resulted in a wave of anger towards the company from owners of those soon-to-be-unsupported handsets. One handset that is on the list of supported devices is HP's Elite x3. Last month, Microsoft slashed 25% off the cost of the Windows 10 Mobile flagship, and its Desk Dock accessory, reducing the bundle's price from $799 to $599 in the US. That offer was due to end on March 31, but Microsoft has extended it for another month. Over in the UK, Microsoft is offering huge discounts of up to 22% off its Surface Book devices. This latest deal - and good grief, there have been a lot of them lately - is due to last for two months. Microsoft released new firmware for its Surface Book and Pro 4 on Thursday - but it's only available for those who have upgraded their devices to the Windows 10 Creators Update. The first details were revealed about Microsoft's new Surface Pro 5 - but if you were hoping for a major redesign of the device, you'll be disappointed. The new version is described as "nothing dramatic" in comparison with its predecessor, and is expected to include only a few minor upgrades to bring its specs up to date. Microsoft beat Apple in the JD Power 2017 US Tablet Satisfaction Study for the first time. The study found that Microsoft's Surface tablets came top for design, accessories, the range of ports on its devices, the storage options available, and more. JD Power said that Microsoft Surface "sets the bar for customer satisfaction". Microsoft is working on 'Project Sopris', an effort to improve security among the growing number of low-cost internet-connected devices. The company has also confirmed that Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 support will be required for Windows 10 IoT Core devices in a future update. Microsoft opened up about the types of data that it collects from Windows 10 devices, revealing a much greater level of detail than ever before on the telemetry that it harvest from users' systems. Its commitment to greater transparency comes alongside new user-facing privacy controls introduced in the Creators Update. With the Creators Update - developed under the codename 'Redstone 2' - now reaching Production status, Microsoft is already pushing ahead with development of its next major update. The company released its first Redstone 3 Insider Preview, build 16170, for PCs in the Fast ring on Friday. Given Microsoft's earlier warnings about potential instability in early RS3 builds, make sure you read the release notes before deciding whether or not to install it! Microsoft is focusing on 'structural' improvements to OneCore in its early RS3 builds, but we're already learning more about its plans to improve the look and feel of Windows 10 in its next update, with a refreshed design language developed under the codename 'Project NEON'. For example, one change coming to the PC Start menu will be the introduction of transparent Live Tiles. New animations will also be part of the updated user experience in Windows 10, as these Redstone 3 concept images show. Elements of Project NEON have already started creeping into the OS through updates to some of Microsoft's Windows 10 apps. After a similar update to its Groove Music app last month, the Movies & TV app also received a minor update for Insiders in line with the new design ideas. Over nine months after its iOS beta was released, and nearly eight months behind the Android beta, Microsoft finally released the first preview of its Flow business app for Windows phones on Monday. Unfortunately, popular music streaming service Spotify announced that it will no longer add any new features to its app for Windows phones, which has now been placed in "maintenance mode". And there was more disappointment for Windows phone owners, as EA also revealed that The Sims Freeplay will get no more updates on those devices. Netflix introduced its Download & Go feature - which lets users save videos to watch offline - to iOS and Android last year. On Monday, it finally added that feature to its Windows 10 app. Messaging app Telegram also made its way to the Windows Store for PCs. Microsoft made some improvements to the Windows Store for Insiders, including a new progress bar design, and a revised share button. Another feature that it added to the Store is the ability to install an app on the Xbox One from a PC. However, it also made a change to its store policies, explicitly banning all game emulators from the Windows Store and its Xbox One consoles. But perhaps the most exciting news of the week was the revelation of key details about Project Scorpio, which Microsoft describes as "the most powerful console ever". The mighty machine will have eight custom x86 cores, a custom-designed GPU, 12GB of GDDR5 RAM with 326GB/s bandwidth, and more - all adding up to some serious gaming power. Microsoft's Mike Ybarra said that Scorpio isn't just about making superlative gaming hardware; it's also a clear demonstration that the company is doing everything it can to "win the developers back". There's still a lot we don't know about Scorpio, and it won't actually be released until much later in the year. But in the meantime, Microsoft is continuing development of updates for its existing Xbox range. Following the release of the Creators Update (Version 1703) for the Xbox One last month, Xbox Insider Preview build 15063.2013 (Version 1704) made its way to those in the Alpha ring on Thursday, while those in Preview Ring 3 also got their first taste of Version 1704 this week. There were just two additions to the list of Xbox 360 games playable on the Xbox One through the Backward Compatibility Program. We Happy Few - an eerie survival game set in a drug-fuelled, alternate version of 1960s England - is being made into a movie. The game is currently available in preview form on the Xbox One and PCs. Mass Effect: Andromeda, which was released on the Xbox One, PS4 and PC last month, is getting a big update. The new update, which rolled out on Thursday, brings animation improvements, additional romance options, and more. Numerous owners of the new Nintendo Switch have said that their consoles are 'warping', particularly when being used in docked mode. One publication reported seeing the same issue on one of their consoles. AMD released its latest Crimson ReLive driver, 17.4.1, adding better support for Oculus Rift's ASW and Steam VR's SVRAR virtual reality APIs. However, this is only for a particular set of graphics cards. Nvidia delivered its latest GeForce Game Ready 381.65 WHQL drivers, adding support for the Windows 10 Creators Update. But our journey across the tech world ends this week, with Nvidia's monstrous new GTX TITAN Xp, which the company describes as "the world's most powerful graphics card", featuring 12GB of GDDR5X memory, and boasting a beastly 12 teraflops of power. Want! Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Michael Firth celebrated the 25th birthday of Windows 3.1, which, frankly, made some of us feel a bit older than we'd have liked! Nonetheless, it was a great excuse to eat some cake. Rich Woods got his hands on HP's stylish new Spectre x360 2-in-1, which has a 4K display and Pen support. Check out the unboxing video for his first impressions of the device. And Rich also got his paws on HP's EliteBook x360 G2, a business-class Windows 10 2-in-1 with some pretty solid specs and handy features. His unboxing video and first impressions can be found here. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend!

The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac It was a good week for Mac users this week, specifically for pro users that had been long waiting news regarding a Mac Pro update that Apple introduced back in 2013. Apple did something it doesn’t do often, pre-announce new products without an event, giving pros confirmation that it’s working on a new modular Mac Pro (and a display to go with it) that will address upgradability needs that weren’t met with the old design. The company also confirmed it will have new iMacs later this year, and some pretty impressive alleged specs for the machines leaked not longer after. The latest iPhone 8 reports arrived claiming the high-end model could be delayed as one report claimed the device will include a Smart Connector for ‘wireless’ charging and VR/AR accessories. A new report claims Apple Watch Series 3 will launch late this year. And we give you the walkthrough and some tips to get started with Apple’s new Clips video editing app in this week’s top video.

The patent was part of a dump of 250 Apple patent applications from the US Patent Office late last month and discovered by Patently Apple… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The patent application depicts the AirPods charging case doubling as a charger for a variety of products, including the Apple Watch, MacBook, iPhone, and iPad. For instance, you can see a slightly redesigned AirPods case in the graphic above below as an Apple Watch charger with an inductive pad on the back of the case. Apple’s notes in the text of the patent application, however, that the inductive pad could be used to provide “wireless” charging to other devices. As usual, the patent application is overly broad, but it does list some interesting devices: “Such devices can include, for example, portable music players (e.g., MP3 devices and Apple’s iPod devices), portable video players (e.g., portable DVD players), cellular telephones (e.g., smart telephones such as Apple’s iPhone devices), video cameras, digital still cameras, projection systems (e.g., holographic projection systems), gaming systems, PDAs, as well as tablet (e.g., Apple’s iPad devices), laptop (e.g. MacBooks) or other mobile computers. Some of these devices can be configured to provide audio, video or other data or sensory output.” The patent application also details the possibility of a waterproof case design. This could hint at future AirPods themselves that are waterproof: Another aspect of this next-gen AirPods case worth noting was found in patent FIGS. 28 and 29 which illustrate a liquid-tight electrical connector. Turning the AirPods case into a charging station would increase the usability for users, giving it more functionality than charging just AirPods. With the rumored inclusion of inductive wireless charging with the iPhone 8, it makes sense too. The question, however, is just how much power the AirPods case could hold. The design of the case shown in Apple’s patent application is more square-like than the AirPods case currently available, which features rounded corners. The different design accommodates for a device laying flat and also the inclusion of more power.

Apple iPad 2017 Is The Biggest Surprise of The Year. April 8, 2017 by Staff   Filed under News, Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns 1 Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 3 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) Apple customers stand on their toes whenever their beloved brand announces a brand new product. Recently, the Cupertino-based company has confirmed that Apple’s new iPad, yes it’s called an iPad with no suffix is now available to buy. When everyone was eyeing up on the Apple’s announcements, the new iPad 2017 turned out to be a huge surprise. It’s cheaper than its predecessor Apple has discontinued iPad Air 2 which was launched at a price of US$399. And in a surprising move, Apple is selling iPad 2017 at a starting price of US$329. Undoubtedly, the price of Apple iPad is making headlines all over the world, but the low price comes with a catch. Do you find any improvements? If you ask us, the answer is yes, we have found some. As said earlier, the price tag comes with a catch. The changes Apple has made in its iPad are not significant. If you are expecting Apple to have some innovative approach towards the new iPad, the latest release may disappoint you. But as we said that there are improvements, so here’s what Apple has done with iPad. Storage Capacity: Apple has doubled the storage capacity in the iPad. The Apple iPad is now available in two options that include 32GB and 128GB storage capacity. It is obvious, since the last year, the company is following this pattern throughout its product range that includes iPhone as well. So, now there will be no 16GB or 64GB options available for the customers. Processor: Other than the price, the use of 64-bit A9 chipset is the biggest change made in the iPad this year. As Apple has shifted its focus from A8X chip, which was used in iPad Air 2, users will surely experience faster processing speed with the new iPad. For the first time, Apple used A9 chip in the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus giving the devices 70 percent more CPU performance and it also dramatically increased graphic processing power by 90 percent. Battery: The new iPad has also got its battery improved, but the company says that the new device will last for 10 hours when the battery is fully charged. With the Air 2 also, Apple claimed to give the same battery backup, so it is better not to expect any significant rise, but as the company is using the improved battery, it will possibly add a few minutes to battery life. Design: No, Apple hasn’t made any improvements in terms of design. In fact, it is really hard to distinguish between Apple’s iPad and iPad Air 2. However, there is a slight difference in the design which appears due to the thickness of the new iPad. When the entire tech industry is aiming to reduce the thickness of gadgets, surprisingly, the iPad designers had something else in mind. In the new device, the company has added some weight and made it thick. Rest of the dimensions remains the same as Air 2. That’s all? Yes. Whatever you see above are the only changes Apple has made. From the color choices (Silver, Gold & Space Grey) to screen size, the unavailability of the stylus to display resolution, everything remains the same. Just like its predecessor, Apple iPad also doesn’t feature any slot for microSD cards and sports an aluminum body. The device supports Bluetooth keyboard and also has the same 8MP rear and 1.2MP front camera. Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + Cellular options are also available at an additional cost of US$100 for each. Bottom Line The new iPad 2017 release has sparked many discussions. The rumor mill is actively hunting for the details about the future of iPad. It is being said that Apple is tired of making iPad and is ready to kill the product line, while, on the other hand, there are discussions about Apple bringing something very unique with the next lineup of products. The official information on the future of Apple iPad is still under wrap. And as far as the Apple’s new iPad is concerned, it is really a great product for those who wish to upgrade or want to join the Apple family within a budget. Shipping for the iPad Air 2 successor is scheduled to happen in April. Staff Writer; Corey Shaw Share Post Twitter Facebook Google +1 Email More Articles: Sheila Agnew; Can We Wait On Love?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 8, 2017 at 10:30AM There has been much speculation about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) potentially delaying the launch of its upcoming iPhone 8. For example, a recent report from Economic Daily News (covered here) suggested that technical issues could lead to pushing its launch to either October or November. In a new report, this time from longtime Apple bull Brian White with Drexel Hamilton (by way of Barron's), White offers up some insight into Apple's potential iPhone 8 launch plans and when customers will be able to get the devices. Image source: Apple. The several-week itch White says that a "contact" of his, presumably in the Apple supply chain, believes that "customers will be able to pre-order the new 5.8-inch iPhone 8 along with the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 8 in September." That's the good news. The bummer, though, is that the 5.8-inch iPhone will reportedly "not be available for delivery until several weeks later." What's just as interesting as this potential availability story is that White's supply chain work in Asia apparently led him to learn that "the buzz in Taiwan is around the iPhone 8 and not the Samsung Galaxy S8/S8+," and that his team "found no enthusiasm at all around the new Samsung devices during [its] trip, nor concerns from competitors." In other words, all eyes are on Apple's upcoming premium iPhone. What does this mean for Apple's business? In my previous article linked above, I argued that Apple still ought to announce the new iPhone 8 alongside the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, even if it takes a while for Apple to get them delivered into customer hands. It appears that Apple is doing just that, and I think that this course of action will serve to minimize the potential negative impact from the OLED iPhone 8 availability delays. What investors will need to get a better handle on, though, is how long that availability delay will ultimately turn out to be. The dictionary definition of "several" is "more than two but not many." So, if initial iPhone 8 customers are looking at, say, a three- to four-week lag between ordering and product delivery, then that's not really a big deal. If the iPhone 8 is as compelling as it appears to be, that's not a terribly long wait in the scheme of things. They key thing for Apple now will be to make sure that once it begins delivering these phones to customers, it's not delivering them in a trickle. That is, once it begins delivering phones, it needs to deliver them in consistently massive quantities. Of course, there's no guarantee that with robust supply that Apple won't still face a supply/demand imbalance -- after all, if demand is simply more than Apple can handle, then it will necessarily face an imbalance. Here's something to keep in mind, though. If Apple churns out a healthy supply of these new iPhone 8 devices and still sees demand exceed supply, then that's just a phenomenally good thing for Apple, as it would mean that it has built an extremely desirable product. Given the difficulties that Apple saw during the iPhone 6s cycle, proof that a great, feature-packed phone can drive substantial sales growth would help improve investor sentiment around Apple stock.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Perhaps it's too expensive, or you don't listen enough to justify the cost. Whatever the reason, here's how to say goodbye. Since its launch in June 2015, Apple Music has grown into a popular streaming service among Apple aficionados. At $9.99 per month for an individual account and $14.99 for a family (of up to six people) plan, Apple Music lets you stream more than 30 million songs, check out on-demand curated radio stations with your favorite music, listen to playlists created by music experts, and tune into the 24-7 Beats 1 radio station to hear tunes selected by DJs from around the world. You can also listen to Apple Music via your Windows PC, Mac, iOS device, or Android device. And you can try the service for free for three months (here's how to stop auto renewal). That sounds cool, but what if it's not everything you wanted? Perhaps it's too expensive, or you don't listen enough to justify the cost. Maybe another music streaming service stole your heart. Whatever the reason, you want to cancel your membership. Well, you can say goodbye to Apple Music on an iOS device or via iTunes on your PC. Here's how. Cancel Apple Music Through Your iOS Device Fire up your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. Tap on Settings > iTunes & App Store. Tap on your Apple ID and then View Apple ID. At this point, you may be prompted to sign in or use the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to authenticate your account. Scroll to the bottom of the Account Settings page and tap on Subscriptions. At the Apple Music Membership screen, tap on the button to Cancel Subscription. Confirm the cancellation. Your subscription is no more! Well, not just yet. Your subscription will actually cease to exist at the end of your current billing cycle. So you'll be charged for the full 30-day cycle, and your Apple Music account will still be alive for a bit longer. You can also opt to re-subscribe should you change your mind, but your new subscription will begin at the start of the next billing cycle. Cancel Apple Music Via iTunes on Your PC To cancel your subscription via your computer, launch iTunes. Click on the Account menu > View My Account. Enter your Apple ID password to view your account information. Scroll to the bottom of your Account page. Next to the setting for Subscriptions, click the Manage link. At the Edit Subscription page, click on the button to Cancel Subscription. A message pops up asking you to confirm that you want to cancel your subscription. Click the Confirm button. Your subscription is now kaput, but with the same scenario described above. Your subscription will stop at the end of your current billing cycle. You're still charged for the full 30 days during which time Apple Music is still accessible. Click on the Done button to close your Apple Music Subscription page and return to your Account Information page. You can now close iTunes.

While Apple this week released its new iPad and talked about its upcoming plans for an iMac Pro, let’s not forget its other productivity machine got a refresh not too long ago. The MacBook Pro — with and without the Touch Bar — is Apple’s flagship laptop, and right now it’s available at up to $250 off. If you’re more in the market for tablets — and you happen to live near a Staples — you might be able to find the shiny new iPad for $30 off. And if you prefer spending less than $100 for a tablet, Amazon’s taking $10 to $20 off of its Fire devices.

According to a report from Variety, Apple has agreed to a deal with SNL for humorous commercial content starring cast members from the show… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The report explains that SNL has also inked a deal with Verizon for a similar partnership. This deal will see Saturday Night Live “Weekend Update” anchor Colin Jost write a commercial spot for the carrier, while the ad itself will star Kenan Thompson. At this point, it’s unclear as to what Apple’s plans are for its advertisement. Today’s report claims that the Verizon and Apple will be different in appearance, but specifics are still unclear and Apple has yet to comment. Today’s report reads: Apple has struck a deal with NBC to have “Saturday Night Live” create commercial content slated to appear in a few weeks’ time. The show’s work for the large consumer-electronics company will look different than its Verizon efforts, according to two people familiar with the situation.  Apple did not respond to queries seeking comment. SNL’s new ad initiative comes as it looks to give viewers an incentive to tune in live rather than watch clips online the next morning. Loren Michaels explains that in a world where there is so much media, brands and shows and must differentiate in order to stay alive: “Everyone is struggling now in a world where there is so much media,” Michaels told Variety. “We are all competing for sponsors, and everything is being reinvented. ‘SNL’ has been reinventing itself from season two.” “Comedy is a big force in the culture, and I don’t think there’s a lot of over thinking about doing commercials as there was in the late ’60s and early 70s,” Michaels said. “When I grew up, it was like Jack Benny for Jell-O or Bob Hope for Chrysler or Texaco Star Theatre.” Apple’s partnership with SNL will surely be a notable one given the success of this year’s SNL season. The new Verizon and Apple ads are said to air on April 8th and April 15th, but it’s unclear which weekend will see which company’s ad.

Lee Apr 8, 2017, 11:00am EDT Presented By tweet share Waymo CEO John Krafcik. Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Where technology and economics collide Uber and Google are locked in a legal battle that could have huge implications for the future of the self-driving car industry. If Uber loses its lawsuit, it could cost the company millions and set back Uber’s self-driving car effort by months — months Uber probably can’t afford to lose. The lawsuit started when Waymo, Google’s self-driving car unit, alleged that Uber is using sensors based on stolen Waymo designs and asked the courts to block Uber from using the designs. Uber fired back in a legal brief on Friday, denying that its sensors were based on Waymo’s technology and accusing Waymo of trying to tie up a legitimate competitor with frivolous litigation. It’s not uncommon for the invention of an important new technology to be followed by legal battles over rights to that technology. Apple, for example, fought a years-long legal battle with Samsung, Motorola, HTC, and other makers of Android-based phones in the early years of the smartphone industry. Apple won some money from these lawsuits, but strategically speaking, they ended in a draw. Apple’s competitors were able to continue churning out Android-based smartphones, and Android ended up controlling a large majority of the global smartphone market. In contrast, there’s a real possibility that Waymo could beat Uber decisively in court. “This is an extraordinary case,” said William Alsup, the California federal judge who is overseeing the case, on Wednesday. His take on Google’s evidence: “I’ve never seen a record this strong in 42 years.” If the court orders Uber not to use technology similar to Waymo’s, it could set back Uber’s self-driving car project by many months. And Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has said his company will be in big trouble if another company beats it to market with self-driving technology. “If we are not tied for first, then the entity that's in first then rolls out a ride-sharing network that is far cheaper or far higher-quality than Uber's, then Uber is no longer a thing,” Kalanick said in a 2016 interview. Uber hoped that hiring some of Waymo’s top engineers would help it catch up to Waymo. But if Waymo proves that this was really a ploy to copy its technology, the move could backfire spectacularly. The lawsuit focuses on a brilliant engineer who left Google for Uber Ghostrider, Anthony Levandowski’s self-driving motorcycle. Ryan Somma The central figure in the legal drama is Anthony Levandowski, a brilliant engineer and the driving force behind the business deal that ultimately led to Waymo’s lawsuit. Levandowski quit his job at Google (now Waymo) in early 2016 and immediately started a new company called Otto. Just a few months later, in May 2016, the company unveiled a prototype of its self-driving truck technology. In August, Otto was acquired by Uber for around $700 million — a massive payout for a company that had existed for less than a year. Waymo now claims that the reason Levandowski was able to get the new self-driving truck technology working so quickly is that key elements of the design were stolen from Waymo. According to Waymo, Levandowski downloaded 14,000 confidential documents from the Waymo network in the days before he left his old employer. And Waymo believes he illegally relied on those documents to guide the development of Otto’s own technology. Levandowski isn’t well-known to the public, but in the industry it has long been obvious that he was a rising star. A 2003 profile of him as a 23-year-old UC Berkeley graduate student reported that he was already working to raise $600,000 for a startup. In 2004, the military’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which brought you the internet, announced a competition to build a self-driving car that could make it across the desert. Levandowski organized a team to enter the competition, but for an extra challenge the team built a self-driving motorcycle instead of a car. They didn’t win — in fact, no one’s vehicle completed the course that year — but it was the start of Levandowski’s involvement in the self-driving vehicle industry. Levandowski went on to found a startup called 510 Systems with some Berkeley colleagues. It started out selling camera technology to Google for collecting Street View images. Levandowski joined Google to work on its mapping technology in 2007, but continued working closely with his 510 Systems colleagues on Google-related projects. Finally, in 2011 Google acquired 510 Systems, and its engineers became early members of Google’s self-driving car project. This early history may explain Levandowski’s casual attitude about working on side projects at the same time he was on Google’s payroll. Waymo now claims that in 2012, unbeknownst to Google, Levandowski took a stake in another startup called Odin Wave (for reasons that aren’t clear, it’s also went by “Tyto Lidar” in some documents) that was founded by one of his teammates from the DARPA Grand Challenge days. “Lidar” refers to a key sensor technology that allows a self-driving car to form a 3D picture of its surroundings. Waymo says that in 2013, it heard from a third-party vendor that Odin Wave had submitted an order to build a custom lidar sensor that was suspiciously similar to Google’s own design. When confronted in 2013, Waymo says, Levandowski denied having an ownership interest in the company. The next year, Google considered buying Odin Wave and asked Levandowski to evaluate the possibility. Waymo now says that Levandowski never disclosed a relationship to the company even as he was advising Google about whether to buy it. In summer 2015, Waymo alleges in a court filing, Levandowski started talking to Uber — months before he officially left Waymo to found Otto. Pierre-Yves Droz, a 510 Systems co-founder who is now a senior Waymo engineer, stated in the filing that Levandowski spent months trying to recruit engineers on his Waymo team to join his startup, and that he expected from the outset to sell the company to Uber. Droz wrote that over dinner in the summer of 2015, Levandowski “told me that it would be nice to create a new self-driving car startup and that Uber would be interested in buying the team responsible for the LiDAR we were developing at Google.” Of course, there’s nothing illegal about an experienced engineer leaving one company to work at another one. And especially in California, where the courts don’t enforce noncompete agreements, there’s nothing illegal about an engineer putting the skills and knowledge he’d developed at one job to use for a new employer. But Google’s new Waymo division believes Levandowski crossed the line by actively recruiting employees for his new venture while he was still on Waymo’s payroll, and by taking confidential documents with him when he left Waymo. Uber says it’s done nothing wrong Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. Photo by Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch Uber responded to Waymo’s accusations in a Friday court filing. “Both of Waymo’s central premises — that former Waymo employees brought thousands of confidential Waymo documents to Uber to build a copycat lidar and that Uber’s lidar closely mimics Waymo’s single-lens design — are demonstrably false,” the company writes. Uber says it has strict policies in place to ensure that employees don’t bring confidential information with them when they join Uber from another technology company. And it says those safeguards worked: A search of Uber’s network and the laptops of key employees did not turn up copies of the documents Waymo says were stolen by Levandowski. However, this argument has a big, important caveat: Uber was unable to search Levandowski’s personal computers because he had gotten his own lawyer and invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. “Uber finds itself in a complicated situation” due to Levandowski’s lack of cooperation, the ride-hailing company admitted in its legal filing. Uber also argues that its lidar technology can’t have been copied from Waymo’s because there were significant differences between them. Lidar works by bouncing a laser off nearby objects and capturing it when it bounces back. One of Waymo’s key innovations was to use the same lens for both sending and receiving these laser pulses, significantly reducing the complexity and cost of the lidar system. Waymo accused Uber of copying this innovation, but Uber says that’s wrong. Uber says it began developing its own lidar in early 2015 and that it uses two lenses for transmitting laser pulses and two more for receiving them. Uber says that’s one of several key differences that demonstrates that its technology isn’t derived from Waymo’s. Uber’s reply is packed full of other technical details that the company says demonstrate that its lidar is not based on Waymo’s technology. However, most of these details are redacted in the public version of the document. The document also leaves a big unanswered question: Why did Uber pay around $700 million for Otto if it wasn’t trying to get its hands on key Waymo technologies? It’s possible, of course, that Uber was just optimistic about Otto’s self-driving truck business. Or perhaps Uber felt the Waymo veterans’ general knowledge about self-driving car technology — knowledge not protected by trade secret laws — was worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But we can expect Waymo to press this point as the litigation continues. While Levandowski has a right to invoke the Fifth Amendment and refuse to testify, Waymo will be able to portray this as a sign that Levandowski did, in fact, break the law as he was leaving Waymo. And it will look for “smoking gun” evidence proving that Levandowski and his colleagues illegally incorporated elements of Waymo’s technology into Uber’s own lidar sensors.

Post your comment Comments (5) George 08 April 2017 Apple iOS Mobile accessories Rumors Apple's AirPods are in a constant state of unavailability, with the 'Ships: 6 weeks' a permanent fixture on their product page. Apple's got plans for a follow-up though, and if a patent filing is any indication, the future AirPods will be a tad larger. Or their case, at least. The patent docs contain the provision for the case to serve as an inductive charger, potentially outputting power to iPods, iPhones, and even iPads and MacBooks. It's a pretty bold claim, even if patent filings do tend to be as broad and far-fetched as possible, just in case. Indeed the most likely device that you could charge from your wireless earbuds' case is the Apple Watch. A 38mm Series 2 Apple Watch packs a 273mAh cell, while the current AirPods case holds 398mAh, tiny as it is. So a larger case could very well pack enough juice to keep both earbuds and a Watch powered for let's say a couple of charges each? Though we're still hoping it's not as bulky and boxy as it looks in that image above. Also, keep in mind that there's a long way from patent to product, not to mention a huge number of the former never make it to the latter.

The smart connection at the bottom will enable wireless charging without the need for a dedicated cover. In addition, the same connection will be used by the new iPhone users in the VR / AR experience which Apple has been working on lately. It is not yet known what will be the way to transfer that experience (VR glasses? AR glasses like Google Glass?) But Apple is looking for creative ways to differentiate itself from its competitor".   We should expect Apple's new iPhone X to feature wireless charging at the least, but a few industry experts are saying Apple will have some form of AR/VR headset unveiled at the same time, and it'll work in conjunction with the new iPhone - just like Samsung's latest Galaxy S8 will work with the latest GearVR headset.

Shop: Surface Studio | New Surface Book | Xbox One S Bundles | NEW Dell XPS 13" #TeamWindows Best Windows PC Alternatives to Apple's Mac Pro By Richard Devine Friday, Apr 7, 2017 at 7:30 am EDT Apple finally "refreshed" the Mac Pro, but if you're not impressed these are some great PC alternatives that run Windows 10. Instead of a new Mac Pro, Apple just included some of its more expensive options and parts as standard in the "new" 2017 model. An all-new Mac Pro is still some time away, no doubt leaving many feeling a bit let down. The Mac Pro is four years old at this point and instead of waiting (and waiting, and waiting) how about a compact Windows 10 machine that oozes performance? Here are some of the best PCs to consider. MSI Vortex The Mac Pro isn't the only cylindrical computer on the market, and MSI's Vortex is every bit the looker. It's a tiny little can on the outside, but what MSI squeezed inside is nothing short of miraculous. At the heart, you'll find an Intel Core i7 6700K unlocked processor, which means you can get to tinkering with some overclocks if you wish. You'll also find 32GB or 64GB of RAM keeping it company, along with solid state drive (SSD) and hard disk drive (HDD) combinations for storage. Then there's the graphics. You can have a single GTX 1070 inside the Vortex, or a single GTX 1080. Both of these are terrific graphics cards, but there's also room inside to fit a pair of GTX 1070 cards if you'd prefer. Apple isn't the only company that can fit dual-GPUs inside a small cylinder. Add in Killer Doubleshot-X3 Pro networking, Thunderbolt 3 and the ability to upgrade parts down the line, and you have an extremely enticing little powerhouse. And it costs less than a base Mac Pro, as well. See at Amazon Corsair One Corsair isn't known for making PCs. This one is, in fact, its very first, but the company's reputation for quality is unquestionable. With the Corsair One, you're no longer just buying a case, you're getting a complete PC inside it. Not just a PC, either. A seriously powerful PC. And one that costs a lot less than a Mac Pro. What it doesn't have is Thunderbolt 3. But what it does have is the latest and greatest internals to make a screaming fast machine. Intel's latest Core i7 7700K unlocked processor is here, as is NVIDIA's GTX 1070 or GTX 1080 GPU. There's even an option for liquid cooling, so you get ultimate power and a whisper-quiet machine. The Corsair One is also entirely upgradeable, because it uses standard-size parts inside that sleek, compact body. Prices start at $1,800, which is reasonable. See at Amazon Origin PC Chronos Pro If you're looking for a small, powerful PC built entirely to your specifications, the Chronos Pro by Origin PC will fit the bill. Almost everything is customizable, from the exterior case color to how many drives you have and which GPU. It's also possible to build the ultimate system and send the price tag well over $20,000! That's not to say the Chronos Pro is ridiculously expensive, but there are options that go up to a 24-core Xeon processor and an $8,000 workstation-grade NVIDIA Quadro GPU. You can spend much less and get more "normal" internals, such as Skylake Core i7 processors, 32GB of RAM, GTX 1070 or 1080 graphics cards and SSD or HDD storage options. The beauty of the Origin system is that you can put exactly what you want inside your PC, as long as you're happy to pay the price. See at Origin ASUS GR8 II While not exactly subtle in appearance, the latest revision to the ASUS GR8 is small in size and big in performance. It's also a bit cheaper than others listed here, while still offering a lot in a small space. For $1,200, you'll find a Core i7 7700 processor, 16GB of RAM and a NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics card. Throw in a combination of SSD and HDD storage and ASUS's Aura lighting, and you have a small-form PC that sparkles inside and out. The custom cooling on the GR8 also keeps it very quiet, with ASUS claiming it's up to 23 percent less noisy than comparable systems. It lacks Thunderbolt 3 but covers every other base when it comes to ports, so you're not going to be caught short.

You’ll get the most value by starting at the beginning, however you can also use the series overview if you’d like to go buffet style. Note for regular readers, the already tech savvy, and IT professionals: this series is designed as a resource you can share with those you are helping or for those looking to become tech savvy on their own. Choosing the best wireless carrier for your needs can be an overwhelming and challenging task. Between the carriers battling with commercials and marketing, fine print, plans always changing, limited-time offers, and a shift away from smartphone subsidies you can spend a lot of time sorting it all out. In today’s article we’re going to take a look at deconstructing the complicated nature of the wireless carrier world and providing concrete steps you can use to make sure you’re getting the best service at the best price for your needs. Skip to the ‘Do This’ section at the bottom if you want to get right to next steps. AirPods Background, Expectations, & Best Practices First, let’s talk about hardware. The way that carriers are handling smartphone sales now may be different from what you’re used to, depending on the last time you did an upgrade. For awhile most of the major US carriers offered a standard $450 subsidy (discount) on smartphone purchases when signing or re-signing a 2-year contract. Verizon and Sprint are the last two carriers that offer the option (typically only for existing customers) but they’ve made it more expensive than choosing carrier financing or purchasing outright (we’ll break it down further in a moment). AT&T & T-Mobile only offer financing or full-price purchases (carriers will always push financing, if you know you’d like to buy full-price, it’s usually easiest to purchase outright directly through Apple). The smaller carriers typically don’t provide any subsidies or financing. Subsidies Here’s the simplest way I know how to break down why you aren’t paying more now that carriers have mostly ended subsidies: With a subsidy you would receive a $450 discount, so a $649 iPhone would cost $199. However, carriers inflated their bills to make up for this. The industry standard line fee was $40/smartphone and then you would also pay for your data/text/talk plan. When you purchase an iPhone or other smartphone at the true full-price or use carrier financing (financing plans are 0% interest), line fees with most of the carriers are between $15-$25 depending on which generation of plan you have. So you’re not getting a discount on the hardware, but you’ll see the discount on your monthly bill via the lowered line fee. With the newest plans for both AT&T and Verizon, lines fees are now $20 for each smartphone on your plan. So on an average plan you’re saving $20 per phone each month by financing or purchasing full-price, over 24 months you get discounts of $480 vs $450 that the old subsidized option would provide. Carriers also usually charge higher activation fees for 2-year contracts than financing or full-price purchases. Additionally, if you keep the same device past 24 months you continue saving with the lower line fee for each smartphone. All in all, carriers are being a bit more transparent with what you’re really paying for. The more rare, older plans with a $25/month line fee may be the one scenario when sticking with a 2-year contract may be less expensive (but you could save money by upgrading your plan to a newer one with a $20/month line fee.) Financing On the whole you’re not paying more for your iPhone with carrier or Apple financing than if you purchase outright. But there are some nuances that may influence you to spend more. All of the major carriers offer 0% interest financing. The most common term is 24 months, but some like AT&T offer a 30 month term. If you choose to keep your device through the end of the installment plan you will own your device. You can also pay off your device in full at any time without penalty and most carriers offer an upgrade option after 12 months (this varies by carrier). If yearly upgrades are important to you Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program may be a good fit and it isn’t tied to any one carrier. Example of early upgrade marketing Remember when looking at carrier websites that plan costs won’t include monthly device financing costs. Depending on your iPhone, payments will usually range from $16-40/month per device. It seems that Sprint is the only carrier that offers a true lease (you won’t own your device at the end of the 18 month term). This option is almost never a good choice as you pay for 75% of the device in monthly payments then return the device to Sprint. An 18 month old iPhone is usually worth a good amount more than 25% of its original price, so financing or buying your iPhone is usually the more cost-effective option. One tricky part about financing is that you may be tempted to buy a more expensive model when you look at the cost split over 24 months. At a glance $4 or $8 more a month per device to upgrade to another model might not seem like a lot, but it’s $100-$200 per device in total. Another thing to ask your carrier is if financing will require a credit check or if you are already pre-approved. Full-Price This happens to be my preferred way to purchase, but comes down to personal preference. I like the ease of not messing with financing paperwork, I’m free to sell my phone at any point and I’m not tied down to any carrier since I purchase unlocked models directly from Apple. I also find it helps me budget and plan more intentionally. Carrier Coverage Making sure you have good coverage with your carrier can be a bit tricky as sometimes the coverage maps don’t translate exactly to real-world use. Taking a look at a carrier’s website for coverage is a good start, but don’t rely on it solely. Also some of the carriers have different map views, make sure to notice if the map is only showing voice, data or both when checking coverage. If you’re considering switching carriers, talk with family, friends, and co-workers to see who has first-hand experience with that carrier in your area. Most carriers have a 14-day return policy, so if worse comes to worse you should be able to cancel within that time period and return any devices. Another trick to make sure a different network will work for your needs is to start a new number with the new provider while keeping your existing. If it works out you can port your number over later, if not you can cancel and save the hassle. Depending on the carrier and your iPhone, you may be able to use your existing iPhone with both numbers. Another option is to borrow an older device from a friend or family member to test things out. As of this writing Verizon has the most coverage in the most places, followed by AT&T. T-Mobile and Sprint have less overall coverage but service is typically a bit cheaper. At this point most carriers will offer fast enough LTE speeds for most users in decently populated areas. AT&T’s Coverage Map Sprint’s Coverage Map T-Mobile’s Coverage Map Verizon’s Coverage Map Plans All of the major carriers have release updated unlimited data plans in the last couple of months. You may be able to save some decent money by looking at these options, but another important thing to know is if you really need an unlimited plan (check out our comparison of the new unlimited plans). There’s no doubt these new plans will typically save you money compared to old unlimited plans, but you might be able to save a lot more if you don’t opt for an unlimited plan at all. Most carrier plans offer unlimited texts and calling with all plans, so data usage is what you want to take a look at. You can find your historical data usage on your carrier’s website. As an example, Verizon has a link to usage on its homepage. Alternately you can call your carrier’s customer service number (dial 611 for most) and ask for your data information. Make sure to get several months of history to be able to make the best decision going forward. Most of the carriers’ plans feature shared data, so however many devices you have on your plan will share the same bucket. If you have an older plan or a smaller carrier you may have individual data per device/line. If you end up calling, letting the representative know that you’re shopping around for the best service and price (they’ll often ask anyway) which should prompt them to see how you could save money by sticking with your existing carrier. If you’re not sure about changing your plan check out some other options before making a decision. Apple Store’s are a great place to get plan comparisons (even if you’re not buying). They have good software that can compare most of the major carrier plans and they aren’t on commission. Discounts If you don’t have a discount on your wireless plan already, make sure to check with your carrier. Everything ranging from an employer, student, or military discount may apply. Smaller Carriers (MNVO’s) If you feel like you’re still paying more than you want for wireless service it may be worth checking out a smaller carrier or MNVO. MVNO’s (mobile virtual network operators) use the airwaves of the major carriers and include carriers like Cricket, Boost, Straight Talk and others in the US. They usually offer pre-paid service at more affordable prices. Although these carriers are often viewed as second-class, they are continually improving and in some cases may be just as good an option as a one of the major four carriers. An important thing to keep in mind is what major wireless network the smaller carrier is using.  Cricket uses AT&T for its network (it was actually acquired by AT&T a bit ago as well), Boost uses Sprint, Straight Talk uses a different network depending if you need GSM or CMDA service. You can usually find coverage maps on the smaller carriers’ websites. Cricket Two of the most interesting smaller carriers in my opinion are Cricket and Ting. First up Cricket offers great service via AT&T with really affordable plans that include taxes and fees. Single line plans start at $30/month and you can get a plan for 5 smartphones with 3 GB of LTE (high-speed) data per phone for $100 flat. Like the major carriers have followed suit on, if anyone goes over their data, there are no extra charges, your data is just slowed down. I’ve used all of the major carriers except for Sprint and was disappointed with how much we were paying even after discounts and owning our iPhones outright. We gave a shot to Cricket over a year ago and have been super happy with the service and we’ve cut our wireless bill in half. We have the same coverage we had with AT&T and have never had dropped a call. One caveat, in densely populated areas AT&T customers do get priority over Cricket customers, so there is a chance if you may not get as good of an experience in big cities. But personally, I haven’t had any issues at all while using Cricket in cities like Chicago and San Diego. Ting This is another interesting provider with really flexible plans. They use Sprint and T-Mobile for their service depending if you need CDMA or GSM. The way they approach pricing is you only pay for what you use each month. Ting is particularly worth a look if you don’t use a lot of data. There are definitely a lot more options when it come to the smaller carriers, just make sure to find out what network they use before giving them a shot. You can also try the same trick mentioned earlier, start a new line with a MNVO and see what you think for a month. There are no contracts with almost of the smaller carriers, so you don’t really have anything to lose. Do This If you’re not sure, find out what plan you have now and how much you’re paying. Is it one of the current offerings or an older plan? Find out how much data you’re using compared to how much you’re paying for. Discover for yourself or ask your carrier if a newer plan would reduce your monthly cost. Compare to other carrier options. Pop into an Apple Store to get some help. They have slick software to easily compare the major providers and they’re not on commission. Double check about potential discounts if you don’t already have one. Weigh the pros and cons of a smaller carrier to see if it’s worth giving one a shot.

Prisma-like video effects. Soundtracks. Clip trimming. Easy sharing. Cons Only square videos, no widescreen. Limited sticker and filter selection. Occasionally crashed during testing. Not built into a social app. Bottom Line You can find each of the video tricks in Apple Clips in other apps, but combining them all in one place makes for truly fun video creativity. By Michael Muchmore You may be wondering: Why did Apple publish Clips, a fun video editing and sharing app? That seems more like the domain of Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook. But Apple has the video software technology, thanks to its excellent iMovie and Final Cut Pro applications, so why not? The flexible, capable Clips app offers a unique combination of video effects, and it really is fun to use. //Compare Similar Products Compare Apple iMovie (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Snapchat (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Instagram (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Moodelizer (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Adobe Premiere Clip (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Getting Started The free app requires iOS 10.3 or later, meaning it runs on models back to the iPhone 5. Clips is a slim 49MB download, so it won't eat up your iPhone storage like the company's fuller iMovie app, which weighs in at 668MB. I tested it on an iPhone 6s. Happily, you don't need to sign into any accounts to get going with the app. When you first run Clips, you see a promo video that attempts to show how fun it is to use the app. You can hit Get Started to get past this. Using Apple Clips In these days of Snapchat and musical.ly, Clips' interface is notably self-explanatory. In fact, with 11 on-screen controls, Clips interface is busier than most of today's trendy apps, but that means its functions are out in the open rather than hidden. The app starts up in Selfie mode—after all, the idea is to send clever video messages to your contacts and the world. To start shooting, you do what the big button at the bottom of the screen says: Hold to Record. There's a mic button to the left of this for muting, and a camera-switching button to the right. You can also switch to Photo mode to include a still in your movie. Clips doesn't restrict you to only using videos shot live from the app, the way some social video apps such as Moodelizer do. Nor does it restrict recording time: You can record as long as you like, unlike Instagram's strict limits. One restriction it does share with some other apps is that videos can only be square, so forget about widescreen footage filling the whole screen like you get with Instagram. After you shoot your first take, which appears as a thumbnail image in the tray along the bottom of the screen, a tooltip suggests adding "animated text using your voice." This is actually pretty cool: You get a choice of seven caption styles, and after tapping one, you can start recording. While you do so, the crawl text appears as you speak. The Giphy Says app does a similar thing, though not in real time, and that app lacks a lot of Clips' other cool editing features and effects. Like Prisma for Video Artisto and Prisma itself are actually already capable of working their artistry on videos, as well as still photos, but Apple's inclusion of this cool effect is not unwelcome. Apple calls the most-Prisma-like effect Comic Book, and there are also pencil drawing, black-and-white, and old-film effects that you can apply while shooting. The other two apps, however, offer a greater variety of artistic effects. Having the spoken text scroll across the screen as you shoot with these live filters is truly impressive, and I'm not aware of an app capable of the same. For more meme-like fun, you can add stickers to any clip in the sequence from the star icon. The choices for these are fairly limited, including phrases like 'Hello' and 'Meanwhile…' along with date and time stickers. But a second page of selections adds emoji as options. Snapchat and mopico offer more stickers, as did the dearly departed Facebook Stickered app. Clips lets you easily move its stickers around the screen with a finger swipe, for optimal placement. Finally, there are also full-screen meme text clips that you can intersperse with your shot video clips and photos. What would an appealing short video be without some catchy background music? Apple offers a decent selection of soundtracks from known recording artists, grouped by mood (Playful, Chill, Sentimental). Or you can simply use anything from your music library as background to your mini video. Once you've got all your clips shot or selected, I'm happy to report that you can trim, delete, or mute them. Just tap on a clip thumbnail, and these choices become obvious. I'd be remiss not to note an issue I had with the app on my iPhone 6s: Often when I tried a new feature during testing, the app suddenly disappeared. On the next try or two, however, it worked fine. I haven't heard of others with this problem, so you may not experience it. Sharing and Output Perhaps the biggest drawback to Clips is that it's another app you have to open before sharing your fun video. Snapchat and Facebook Messenger both let you jazz up videos right in the app you're sharing from. It may have made more sense for Apple to include this functionality in Messages to get the same immediacy. Be that as it may, it's easy enough to share directly from Clips, which naturally supports any video-accepting app in the standard Share Sheet. It even offers a direct share option to your most-recent contact as a choice above the app icons. Apple's Social Video Bid You can find apps in the Apple iTunes App Store that do everything Clips does, but it's useful to have them all in one place. And the real-time captioning is impressive and fun. But if you don't mind putting a tad more time and effort in, Clips lets you create more compelling and entertaining mini movies. And unlike Snapchat's, they don't disappear automatically, never to be enjoyed again. For real iPhone video-editing power, though, get our Editors' Choice app, iMovie.

And while iPhone 5 battery life reviews have been mostly positive, there are always ways to improve battery life with the iPhone and we wanted to share some tips about how to get better battery life with the iPhone 5. The company claimed that the iPhone 5 gets better battery life than the iPhone 4S in its iPhone 5 announcement and initial tests reveal that it gets about the same, if not a little better mileage than the iPhone 4S. Users are seeing anywhere from 8 to 12 hours of usage with the iPhone 5 and that’s downright impressive for Apple’s first attempt at an 4G LTE smartphone. Read: iPhone 5 Battery Life Reviews. We show you how to get more out of your iPhone 5 battery. And while impressive, there are some things that users can do to help improve the battery life on the iPhone 5. They might not add an extra five hours, but they should help to add some extra minutes, something that is often crucial while on-the-go. Here are a few tips for improving the battery life on the iPhone 5. Turn Off Wi-Fi/4G LTE One of the ways I used to conserve battery life on my iPhone 3GS was by turning off the Wi-FI when I was out and about. This way, the phone wasn’t trying to connect to Wi-Fi networks I wasn’t going to use. With the iPhone 5, users will not only want to turn off Wi-Fi when not using it, but 4G LTE as well. By turning both of these off when you need them, you’ll be saving yourself some extra battery life. Fortunately, turning both of these off is quick and easy. For Wi-Fi, head into Settings and at top, you’ll want to click your Wi-Fi network. You’ll be taken to a new menu where you can toggled Wi-Fi On or Off. Switch it to Off. Toggling off 4G LTE and Wi-Fi will help preserve battery life on the iPhone 5.   To turn off 4G LTE data speeds, head into Settings, then General. Once there, tap Cellular. There, you will see an option for Enable 4G LTE which has a toggle. Toggle it to Off. Turn Down Screen Brightness One simple trick that could save you quite a bit of iPhone 5 battery life is turning down the screen brightness. The screen eats up a lot of juice and by toning it down a bit, the strain on the iPhone 5’s battery will ease a bit. This is simple as well. Go into the Settings on your iPhone 5. From there, you’ll see an option that reads Brightness & Wallpaper. Tap that option and you’ll be taken to a screen that looks like the one below. By default, it should be around 50% but you have the option to turn it lower or even toggle off Auto-Brightness which will keep your iPhone 5 at a constant level, perfect when you’re in an environment where there is consistent lighting. Turn Off Location Services/Notifications While many of the services offered in iOS are extremely useful, they can also eat up battery life when turned on. We recommend shutting down twoof these in particular if you wish to conserve battery life on your iPhone 5. 1. The first, Location Services. Location Services is the feature in iOS that uses GPS and crowd-sourced Wi-Fi to constantly determine your location. This is a particularly useful feature in the Maps application but it also is used by an assortment of other third-party apps. Turning this off could help save battery life. To do this, first go into Settings. From there, scroll down to Privacy. Tap that and then tap Location Services at the top. At the top of the next page is a toggle where you can flip Location Services to Off. 2. And second, it’s time to turn off Push Notifications which are the notifications that pop up on your home screen when something happens in one of your apps. For instance, when someone posts something on Facebook. Go to Settings, then Notifications. You’ll then see a long list of applications to choose from. From here, you can either turn of Do Not Disturb which will disable all Notifications or you can manually turn the ones you don’t care about off when tapping on their name. Personally, I disable just about every single one. You also might want to think about taking the Stocks and Weather widgets out of Notification Center. To do that, simply click on the appropriate one and toggle Notification Center to Off. Switch Email to Manual Another trick I have used in the past is to switch my Mail to manual. What I mean by that is, by default, your iPhone 5 will be fetching new data aka checking for new email automatically. This used to eat up battery on my iPhone so I turned it off, set it to manual and got great results.   To do this, go to Settings. Then, head to Mail, Contacts, Calenders. Scroll down and tap on Fetch New Data. There, you have the option of turning off Push completely if you want but I recommend scrolling down and tapping on Manually. What this means is that you’ll now have to manually check for email. Fortunately, Apple just made this simple. In iOS 6, you no longer have to tap to refresh email. You just have to pull down and it will check for new mail. A fantastic trade-off for a little more juice. Restart the iPhone 5 A simple trick to get better battery life is just to restart your iPhone 5 once in awhile to flush its system. If you’re like me, you’ll often leave your device on for weeks maybe even months at a time without restarting it. Just by holding down the power button and turning it off, you may be able to gain back some precious battery life. Simply hold the power button and Slide to Power Off when it asks you to. Reset All Settings Something else to try in order to improve iPhone 5 battery life is resetting all of your settings. This will turn back the clock on your settings without deleting the apps and data found on the iPhone 5. Reset all settings to get fix battery life issues on the iPhone 5. To do this, head to Settings. Then, tap on General. Next, scroll to the bottom and tap on Reset. Tap on Reset All Settings. If you’re prompted, enter your Passcode. Wait for the reset to finish then use your phone until it gets down to 0% then shuts off. Then, plug in your iPhone 5 until it charges to 100%. This should help to solve any battery life issues you’ve been having. Airplane Mode Airplane Mode isn’t just useful for when you’re on a flight. It can also be used to save precious battery. By putting your iPhone 5 into Airplane Mode, it will disable all data/cellular related services. That means no data, no phone calls, no texts. This makes it perfect for battery life emergencies. To turn on Airplane Mode, head into Settings and toggle Airplane Mode to On. Last Ditch Effort – Restore If none of these work, there is a last ditch effort that iPhone 5 owners can perform in order to try and resolve battery life issues. Again, this should only be attempted if nothing else has improved your battery life and you’re not getting what you want. First, you’ll want to make a backup of your iPhone 5 so you don’t have to reinstall all of your applications or move all of your files. The backup process begins after you plug your device into a computer. If it doesn’t happen automatically, you can force a backup to occur. Simply go into iTunes, right click on your device, and select Back Up. I recently did this with my iPhone and while it takes a bit of time, it’s going to be necessary for what you do next. Make sure your device is still plugged in. Then, through iTunes, click your device on the left-hand menu which should being up a screen that looks like the one below. Click Restore. This will transform your phone into the iPhone 5 it was when it first arrived. No files, no apps, nothing. Once that is done, you will again want to right click your device in iTunes and you’ll want to select Restore from Back Up. This should restore your iPhone 5 to the way it was before, apps and all, but with better battery life. 41 Responses 09/24/2012 sickmansick Reply Does the restore from backup, restore music, books and playlists? My restore, restored everything but the aforementioned. Is this normal or was my original backup corrupted? Still having battery issues too. Thanks 11/18/2012 jim Reply I got the iPhone 5 Battery Case http://www.prezzydeal.com/iphone-5-battery-case.html 09/24/2012 Agnes James Reply All info given to expand battery life is amazing and works great. Its just the obvious thing that any android consumes much battery than other phones. In any case if it seems to you that your iPhone/iPad battery is getting down and you have to spend sometime without charging it. To restart your iPhone is the great option as you want to get back some battery of your iPhone. By doing this you can get little of you battery back. On other hand if you want to reset your iPhone you can also go for it. As it would wipe your all corrupted apps present in your device. Which could save your device battery life. By resetting your iPhone you may lost your important data, so you must have to take its backup. Thanks 06/24/2013 bobby Reply Je ne suis pas d’accord. De nombreux iPhone avec IOS 6.1.3 sont défectueux car la batterie se vide à vue d’oeil. La seule solution que j’ai trouvée c’est de mettre un moment sur “mode avion” lorsque la batterie chauffe et se vide. 07/18/2013 Justin Reply If your phone is about to die, do NOT restart it in order to attempt to get extra juice. Doing so can weaken your battery and actually lessen the life of your battery. This was in the user manual of the iPhone or in the Battery app I had, I forget, but I do remember reading that. Letting it die is fine, but do NOT restart it to completely kill the battery by using up all the remaining juice. 09/25/2012 AdamEvans Reply what Alexander answered I am taken by surprise that a person able to make $7307 in a few weeks on the internet. have you read this(Click on menu Home more information) http://goo.gl/MERfL 09/25/2012 Jose R Pinga Reply This is incredible. so the idea is not to use any of the great features that I get from a Smartphone. just to “save” battery…I have a better Idea… Why not turning the damn phone off? that will save you Lots of battery! 02/04/2013 Adam Eisman Reply Silly rant. Just turn off the stuff you use less frequently. Every feature is not used by every user all the time. I don’t need the weather channel to know where I am, so I turn off its location finder feature. My zip code is already in there. I don’t need every email within a minute of its existence. I don’t need notifications from every app (even many of the ones I love) every moment an idea pops into its app head. I can dim my screen a bit and survive. No great sacrifice. The phone is still amazing. And I can still be reached by my kid. 09/25/2012 Josh Reply You forgot to mention closing all apps running in the background. Double tap your home button and and shut down all open apps. Make this a habit every time you use your phone and battery life soars. 09/25/2013 Selena Lee Reply Do you know how to turn off all the appl running for latest update of iPhone? 09/25/2013 Will Reply Double tap the home button and swipe each app up. 09/26/2012 John Reply It would be so nice to have articles proofread before posting. Seeing typo after typo is so irritating. Just saying… 10/13/2012 Harold Reply Really? Someone takes the time to post something helpful and that is all you have to say. Wow! I would much rather be surrounded by people who are willing to be helpful, just to be helpful instead of those such as yourself who choose to be critical of others short comings. 11/18/2012 Jim Reply There’s no space in “shortcomings” 12/25/2012 Jed Reply Thankyou 12/25/2012 Jed Reply Thunk you 09/26/2012 A Reply Or, try getting on wifi. It looks like if you have poor cell coverage, the anteannea will try to boost itself eating the battery, but connecting to wifi actually fixes it. http://iphonetouch.blorge.com/2012/09/26/iphone-5-battery-issues-your-cellular-signal-could-be-the-problem/ I’ve had poor coverage with AT&T in the city some blocks and in rural areas. I wonder if this only affects non-Verizon and rural users. iLounge tested this and it seemed like it was only AT&T and rural networks, but connecting to wifi actually fixed this anteannea boosting behavior… 09/28/2012 jas latos Reply Why not build an iPhone5 mock up and save $700 instead? You can carry a lumia with you for staying connected to the world. It even has a battery saver feature that does what you describe above and usually kicks in after 2-3 days of use! But Make sure no one sees you using a microsoft phone. That would be humiliating. 10/04/2012 Dave Reply This is such a great and informative article! I havent read any of these “tips” anywhere else ever! I actually found the best way to optimize the battery for my iphone 5. My battery can last for weeks using my method. What I do is I press and hold down the power button, then slide the bar to power off! If I leave it powered off my battery can last up to a month or more! its so great. I dont actually get to use the phone or any of its features but man my battery lasts a long time! 10/04/2012 Dave Reply This is such a great and informative article!

Why buy the iphone5? Can apple answer this. First apple not happy with having to recharge two, three times a day. 10/14/2012 Mark W Reply I agree. Battery life gets sucked up quick. I have an iPhone 4 that has much better battery life. Great features on the 5 but why have it if I have to turn everything off? 02/04/2013 Adam Eisman Reply Silly rant.

Thank you :) I just got an iPhone and have a 2G data plan, and am worried if I am using up data when I least expect it. …..last question 4. If you turn off cellular data, does it use-up any of the 2G’s of data on my plan? ********Or is the data only used when I am not connected to wi-fi?************ MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION Well thanks for your time,and I hope you can help me :) PS- If you could label the anwsers with the number from the question that would be awsome! Have a great day :) :) :) 11/29/2012 Lindsay Reply 1) Any app that has to fetch information outside of your phone will use data, mininal as it may be. This includes Free Angry Birds and some other free apps because of the ads that are embedded in the game. 2) If you have your phone set up to receive notifications (the messages that appear on your lock screen), then your phone may be using data even though you are not using it. 3) Your phone will not use data if you are connected to wi-fi. 4) If you turn off cellular data, your phone will not use data AT ALL. 12/27/2012 John Reply Unlock your iphone at extremely cheap prices from unlockiphones.info .

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple iPhone 8: Insider outs exciting new features, but says phone is delayed Zach Epstein BGR NewsApril 7, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Demand for Apple’s upcoming new iPhone 8 is going to be through the roof when it is released later this year. Apple fans are long overdue for a new design since Apple decided to reuse its 2014 iPhone designs yet again in 2016. Thankfully, it looks like they’re definitely going to get what they want in 2017 as Apple ditches the home button and the thick bezels, and opts for a more modern design and an OLED display. That’s the good news. The bad news is that yet another insider with a decent track record has reported that the iPhone 8 will be delayed, though the delay might not be as long as others have said. Don't Miss: There’s only one thing keeping all these iPhone users from switching to the Galaxy S8 Multiple recent reports have said that Apple’s new iPhone 8 will not be released at the same time as the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Those two phones are supposedly still on track for a September release, but the redesigned iPhone 8 might not debut until October or even November, if those rumors are to be believed. Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White agrees that the OLED-equipped iPhone 8 won’t be released alongside the two other models, but he says the “delay” should only be a few weeks. If White is correct, that means we’re likely looking at a release date sometime in early October. White has a mixed track record, but he has accurately reported on unreleased Apple products in the past. For example, he was one of the first to reveal that Apple was working on the iPad mini back in 2012. Apart from the delay, White says that his supply chain sources have given him some insights into a few exciting new features Apple has planned for the iPhone 8. Among them are new augmented reality capabilities, new 3D sensing features, and secure facial recognition for unlocking the phone and authenticating Apple Play transactions. “First off, our smartphone contact believes the 3D sensing technology and OLED displays will only be offered with the 5.8-inch iPhone 8,” White wrote in a note to clients that was seen by BGR. “However, our contact strongly believes the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will be delayed by several weeks due to challenges around the 3D sensing technology but still in time for the December holidays. This is not the first time that we have heard about a potential delay with a new iPhone; however, our contact was so emphatic about the delay that we are taking this data point more seriously. Since it is only April, this situation could improve.” The analyst continued, “Essentially, our contact believes customers will be able to pre-order the new 5.8-inch iPhone 8 along with the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 8 in September; however, the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will not be available for delivery until several weeks later. The 3D sensing capability is important to Apple and has a host of use cases outside of AR. For example, 3D sensing will allow a user to open their iPhone with their face in a secure manner (cannot be tricked with a photo) and approve payment on Apple Pay, while potentially negating the need for proximity sensors that are used when holding the iPhone near one’s ear. Our contact believes approximately half of the new iPhone 8 shipment volume will go toward the 5.8-inch version.” White’s reporting comes following meetings with multiple LCD panel makers, smartphone vendors and a component supplier in Taiwan. While he neglects to specify the names of the companies he met with, some or all of them are presumably in Apple’s supply chain.

Macs & Mac OS X | 04 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (8) Apple Drops Cylindrical Mac Pro Prices by $1000 by Josh Centers It will be 2018 at the earliest before we see the redesigned Mac Pro that Apple has promised (see “Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency,” 4 April 2017), but if you need a cylinder-style Mac Pro in the interim, there’s some good news: Apple has rejiggered the configurations to provide existing higher performance options at lower prices. (These changes have been called a speed bump, but in our opinion, a speed bump requires the introduction of a faster CPU that was previously unavailable. In comparing the technical specs, it seems clear that all Apple did here was drop the prices on existing configurations.) For $2999, the new low-end configuration gets the specs of the previous high-end configuration, which equates to a $1000 price drop. It moves from a 3.7 GHz quad-core Intel Xeon E5 CPU to a 3.5 GHz 6-core Xeon E5 and from dual AMD FirePro D300 graphics processors with 2 GB of VRAM to dual AMD D500 graphics processors with 3 GB of VRAM. The new $3999 high-end configuration moves from a 3.5 GHz 6-core Intel Xeon E5 CPU to a 3.0 GHz 8-core Xeon E5. It too gets beefier graphics processors, trading dual AMD FirePro D500 graphics processors for dual AMD FirePro D700 graphics processors. These aren’t new options, and our best guess based on current prices is that this configuration also received a $1000 price drop. Oddly, the Apple online store reports this configuration as “Currently unavailable.” Both models now feature 16 GB of RAM standard, up from 12 GB for the low-end model, with upgrades to 32 GB ($400) or 64 GB ($1200) available. They come standard with 256 GB of flash storage, and you can boost that to 512 GB ($200) or 1 TB ($600). For the ultimate performance, you can still upgrade to a 2.7 GHz 12-core Xeon E5 CPU ($2000). A tricked-out Mac Pro still costs a whopping $6999! Nor do any other specs change. Notably, the Mac Pro still relies on Thunderbolt 2, so you can’t connect new accessories like the LG UltraFine 5K display. Besides the six Thunderbolt 2 ports, it still has 4 USB 3.0 ports, two Gigabit Ethernet ports, one HDMI 1.4 port, and yes, a 3.5mm headphone jack with optical digital output. For wireless connectivity, it features Bluetooth 4.0 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. These improvements aren’t likely to make anyone jump on the Mac Pro train, but if you need to buy additional units for your business in the near future, they’ll provide a bit more performance for your money. For many desk-bound professionals, the 27-inch iMac with Retina display is a better choice, and most of us here at TidBITS now use that machine.   TextExpander: Communicate smarter.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Michael Lever  2017-04-04 17:43 I have a 27inch 5k retina display. When i switch off at the end of each day, the screen sometimes displays an array of coloured lines before finallty turning off. I say sometimes because it's random. Is this normal or a sign of problems to come? Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-05 10:48 I almost never actually power my 27-inch Retina iMac down (only when I go on vacation), so I'm not sure if this is in any way normal or not. I haven't seen what you describe, or at least not enough that it has registered. For the most part, there isn't much win in turning the iMac off as long as you let it sleep so it's using almost no power while it's not in use. Reply Laine Lee  2017-04-04 18:36 If you've ever seen Star Wars Episode I, you know that a communications disruption can mean only one thing: invasion. If you've followed Apple for a while, you know that a substantial price reduction can mean only one thing: imminent release of a new model. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-04 19:08 Except that they explicitly said that there would be no new Mac Pro this year. Sorry! Reply James  2017-04-06 09:27 This is the second site I've seen with this headline. They didn't drop the price, they bumped the specs up. The price for the low end machine is still the same as it was, and the price for the high-end is still the same... you just get slightly more power for your $ now. Reply Steve Nicholson  2017-04-06 10:09 Just like with relativity, it all depends on your frame of reference. If you're looking at it from the amount of money you're spending, it's a speed bump. If you're looking at it from the machine you're buying, it's $1000 cheaper. Both points of view are valid. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-06 12:07 As I said in the article, in our opinion, it's not a speed bump if there are no new configurations. Had Apple made a previously unavailable CPU available with a faster clock speed, that would be a speed bump. This is all three-year-old technology at lower prices. It's still welcome, it's just not the same thing. Reply Charles Jacobs  2017-04-08 09:01 Could this now be the super Mac mini that so many have asked for? Is the price still too high? I just checked - a fully decked out Mini is $1999!!! Certainly this is twice the performance.

But reports have suggested that the smartphone may be delayed this year after all. JESHOOTS / Pixabay October launch date? The Chinese language publication Economic Daily News suggests that the launch of the iPhone 8 could be pushed back to either October or November, citing supply chain issues. An increasing proportion of iPhone components are manufactured in China, and Economic Daily News has a reasonable record in delivering unique Apple titbits already. And the publication suggests that “technical issues related to the lamination process of curved OLED panels” could pose significant difficulties for Apple, which would prompt the Californian corporation to delay the release of its most important product. OLED challenges Apple may also have problems getting hold of the requisite number of OLED panels, with the technology largely anticipated to feature in the next generation mobile. Reports have suggested that Apple is already attempting to acquire 70 million OLED panels with the intention of including them in the iPhone 8 later this year. Sources close to the Apple supply chain provided this information to Nikkei Asian Review, with the publication noting that the large order number suggests that Apple expects the iPhone 8 to be a massive seller. Nonetheless, this will obviously be the first time that Apple adopts OLED technology for inclusion in its iPhone range, which could be challenging for the corporation, while the Cupertino-based tech firm is also expected to produce the first ever curved screen iPhone this year. This represents a significant overhaul of the iPhone concept, and this could mean scheduling is even more challenging for the consumer electronics giants than usual. 95 million units Analysts believe that Apple may produce 95 million iPhone 8 units in 2017, as it looks to meet what may be heightened demand. Ironically, its great rival Samsung will be intimately involved in the plans for the iPhone 8, with Apple intending to utilize the Korean corporation as a major supplier. Although Samsung has been using this technology for many years, it is thought that the availability of OLED maybe problematical. Samsung naturally intends to utilize OLED displays in future device releases, while Apple is also demanding a quite significant number. This adds up to a challenging supply chain environment for the California company, and one which East Asian sources believe could ultimately delay the iPhone 8. However, it should be said in mitigation that this is hardly the first time that a media report has suggested that an iPhone release could be delayed. Quite frequently such rumours emerge without anything ultimately coming of them, and Economic Daily News suggested the iPhone 6 would launch a month early, which turned out to be wide of the mark. But Apple is also expected to integrate new technology into the iPhone 8, with this release representing the tenth anniversary of the iPhone range. Analyst expectation is that Apple will produce something outstanding in order to mark this occasion, and the number of units seemingly being anticipated and ordered by the manufacturer does suggest that this conclusion is valid. Staggered release If Apple pushes out the boat with the iPhone 8 and attempts to produce something revolutionary then this will obviously create further challenges for the corporation, increasing the likelihood that the release date will indeed be pushed backwards. Another suggestion that has appeared in the media periodically is the idea that Apple could have a staggered release of three separate iPhone models in 2017. Many indeed believe that Apple will produce three separate devices in the calendar year, but whether the company would seriously consider releasing them at separate times remains to be seen. Previous iPhone releases have always been simultaneous, and it would be something of a surprise for Apple to hold back at least one model of the iPhone 8. Share price rise In other iPhone news, the potential of the iPhone 8 has caused some investment groups to respond favorably to Apple stock. In particular, Pacific Crest Securities to raise its price target on Apple shares, suggesting that the 12-month price should be $150, up from $140. Apple shares have long since smashed through the psychologically important $100 barrier, and the corporation has enjoyed a favorable trading year, with its share price up around 60% from the lows of May 2016. Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves believes that the future is bright for Apple, and is positive about the potential of the iPhone 8. “We continue to recommend owning AAPL. Recent checks at suppliers indicate strong initial indications of component orders for the coming iPhone cycle, which prompts an increase to our unit estimates at the high end of the iPhone lineup. This drives our EPS estimates higher,” Hargreaves commented. The analyst slightly disagrees with predictions regarding the manufacturing of the iPhone 8, suggesting that Apple may produce even more units than suggested elsewhere. Hargreaves believes that the the consumer electronics behemoth could build 100 million iPhone 8 handsets in the second half of 2017 to meet huge demand. New innovations Meanwhile, reports have suggested that Apple will finally implement wireless charging with the iPhone 8, following suggestions that Foxconn is investigating the technology for future Apple devices. Apple is expected to provide an enhanced version of wireless charging that will enable consumers to charge the device at a distance of 15 feet. Apple is also said to be working on another major innovation for the iPhone 8, with an entirely new type of connector set to appear in the iconic smartphone. The Ultimate Accessory Connector delivers an eight-pin connection, smaller and thinner than either USB-C or Lightning ports. The precise specifications and advantages of Ultimate Accessory connection are not known as of yet, but it will be interesting to see whether this indeed features in the iPhone 8, even if we may have to wait a little longer than usual in order to get our hands on this device.

 Apple could make the iPad a true laptop replacement if it just had these 2 simple features Dave Smith Apr. 8, 2017, 9:00 AM 38,637 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple made a lot of things clear this week: It will strive to do better at making computers geared towards professionals, but it will keep those pro desktops separate from its touchscreen devices like iPhones and iPads. In other words, don’t expect Apple to release a touchscreen Mac anytime soon. These 5K iMacs are pretty, but you can't touch 'em. Skye Gould/Tech Insider Here’s Apple’s reasoning, according to a company spokesperson in an email to Business Insider (emphasis ours): “Here's how we think about this. Others have taken a traditional PC and tried to build touch into a single catch-all product, but the results are full of compromises. Those products provide neither a good laptop experience, nor a good tablet experience. Apple has pioneered the use of Multi-Touch technology across our product lines from iPhone and iPad to our trackpads. We’re focused on delivering a great customer experience and for some products, a touchscreen does that, but for others we think touch is implemented in better ways. That's why we invented the Touch Bar for MacBook Pro.” Aside from that last sentence — I personally don't think the Touch Bar is all that useful for pros or anyone else — I am totally okay with Apple’s philosophy here, with regards to keeping its traditional desktop Mac line separate from touch interfaces. Microsoft is doing its own thing — BI's own Matt Weinberger loved the Surface Studio, an iMac-like desktop you can also draw on like a giant canvas — but Apple is very content with keeping these products separate and encouraging customers to buy multiple items. If you want to draw on your desktop monitor, Microsoft has you covered. Apple, not so much. Darren Weaver/Business Insider So while you can argue about which philosophy is better, there’s no doubt Apple’s strategy is business-savvy. If you want a computer, buy a Mac. If you want a touchscreen, buy an iPhone or iPad. Apple wants you to buy both separately, assuring you they will work better together than a single all-in-one product. That’s where I disagree. As someone who’s owned an iPad for many years now, I really believe the iPad could be that killer all-in-one product that blends the best of iOS with a solid desktop experience. And I really think it's that close to being a laptop replacement. For a couple of years, I actually used my iPad as my main computer for trips or going out on assignment, as it was the best portable device for taking notes, thanks to a great Bluetooth keyboard from Logitech that also served as a screen protector. But all these years later, the iPad, particularly the higher-end Pro, is still not a pure laptop replacement, even though that's how it's been advertised the last two years. Frankly, all iPads — mini, normal and Pro — would be much more useful devices, and actual laptop replacements, if they just had two simple things: 1) A proper file system, a la Finder iCloud Drive on iPhone and iPad is nowhere near as robust as Finder on the Mac. Dave Smith/Business Insider It boggles my mind that iOS still lacks any sort of meaningful management system for all your files and documents, in the way you can search for literally anything on your computer’s hard drive using the built-in Finder app. Mind you, Apple introduced iCloud Drive in 2014 as a way to access your saved files across your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, but it's nowhere near as robust or customizable. You can't create new folders, rename folders, or organize documents in a way that makes sense to you from your iPhone or iPad — some folders can be renamed or organized to your liking, but all of that must be done on a PC or Mac computer. Also, Apple files everything in separate folders based on the app it uses, so you can't create your own organizational methods. Meanwhile, there's Finder, the Mac's one-stop shop for everything from search to file management. Finder is easily the most-used app on my Mac. It keeps me organized: I’m always able to find any documents I’ve created, and put documents of varying types in one folder so I can easily find everything later. I can easily create and delete files and folders, and rearrange them to my liking. To me, Finder is essential, and I still have no reason why there’s no comparable version on iOS — this kind of organization is probably less important on an iPhone, but it's probably the biggest aspect keeping the iPad from being a true laptop replacement. You should be able to reorder and reorganize your files as you see fit on any device, especially an iPad. 2) Mouse and trackpad support Apple loves its multi-touch technology, but if Apple really wants people to buy more iPads, it should allow people to use more input methods — particularly the mouse, one of the most-used and traditional methods in the history of desktop computers. Granted, I spend most of my days on a laptop, but that has a separate trackpad below that mimics the actions of a mouse. Using the touchscreen is simply not the same. It is not nearly as precise, or as efficient. You’ll also get tired after constantly raising your arm just to touch different parts of the screen, which is particularly bad if you're doing something time-intensive like photo or video editing. A touchscreen alone is just fine on a tiny five-inch iPhone screen, but not nearly as great on a 10-inch or 12-inch iPad screen. Apple's Magic Mouse 2 Apple Please, Apple, let me use a Bluetooth mouse, or a Bluetooth trackpad. Apple even makes these peripherals! But neither of them works with the iPad. I would love the ability to rest my iPad on my lap or a coffee table, and be able to use it effortlessly from my couch with my Bluetooth keyboard and mouse/trackpad. Heck, I’d be okay if Apple only made it work with its own Magic Mouse or Magic Trackpad, as long as the iPad supports some solution. It's strange to me how Apple embraced accessories with the iPad Pro, but only to some degree. Apple says the $170 Smart Keyboard and the $100 Apple Pencil make the iPad Pro a more complete "pro" experience, but curiously didn't support its own Bluetooth mouse or trackpad on that device.  When I asked Apple about this on the phone, the company had a great answer for why the iPad supports keyboards: "People want a great typing experience, and it helps people get to where they want to go faster." But by that same token, mice and trackpads help users get to where they want to go faster, too, and they're much easier to use and more satisfying than spending hours lifting your arm to touch a part of the screen. Apple didn't have a good response for that — they suggested one could use an Apple Pencil for touching parts of the screen, but the reason I own an iPad/iPhone/Mac is so I don't have to constantly use a pencil and pad in the first place. I really do hope that Apple will consider adding these features to the iPad, which is already a great device but not quite a true laptop replacement. I can't reliably use my iPad for working, although it's better with a keyboard. With mouse/trackpad support, and a proper file system, it would be that much better.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Kārlis Dambrāns Regulator sues Apple for millions over iPhone repair policies Chris Smith @chris_writes April 6th, 2017 at 10:45 AM Share Tweet Remember the “Error 53” message that appeared last year on iPhones that were serviced by third-party repair shops? It turns out that kind of practice isn’t legal in Australia, or so the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) says. The regulator is suing Apple, alleging that the iPhone maker broke local consumer laws by bricking devices that were not repaired in official Apple shops. Don't Miss: 5 features on the LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8 you won’t find on any iPhone Error 53 was initially explained as a security measure meant to protect users whose iPhones or iPads had the Touch ID sensors swapped by a third-party repair shop. Apple than labeled it a mistake, providing support on how to avoid it. However, the ACCC thinks that Apple’s behavior isn’t acceptable in Australia. According to The Wall Street Journal, the ACCC is seeking monetary penalties for Apple that could go up to around $829,000 per violation. It’s unclear how many violations were registered in the region between September 2014 and February 2016. “It’s fair to say we haven’t observed similar behavior by other manufacturers,” chairman of the ACCC Rod Sims told The Journal. “Apple seems to have a particular way of doing things.” He said that the lawsuit isn’t just about Error 53, as it also targets Apple’s policy of charging for repairs if a device was previously serviced by a third party. The ACCC argues that it is often cheaper for customers to seek repairs from third-party shops. Under Australian consumer law, when a client purchases a product there is a guarantee the product will be a “reasonable fit” for its purpose. That guarantee is “not extinguished because a consumer has goods repaired by a third-party repairer,” according to Sims. “We want manufacturers to know that, and we want consumers to know that.” The ACCC says that Error 53 rendered devices unusable, which is why the regulator is seeking monetary compensation from Apple.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Computers Image Source: USPTO Don’t say goodbye to the MagSafe charger just yet Chris Mills @chrisfmills April 5th, 2017 at 4:01 PM Share Tweet Apple has been clear that it thinks USB-C is the future. You don’t get the option of buying a new MacBook without USB-C ports; the only question is if you want one, two, or four. Since USB-C allows charging as well as data transfer, everyone assumed that the coming of USB-C meant the end of Apple’s legendary MagSafe charger. But according to an Apple patent recently uncovered by Mashable, Apple could be looking at a way to merge the two. Don't Miss: Watch the Pepsi commercial that has the entire internet going crazy The patent, filed early last year, is for an adapter that would convert the original MagSafe adapter to USB-C. Making a dongle to use an old accessory on a new laptop isn’t a new move — Apple is the master of dongles, after all — but the exciting thing here is that MagSafe could come to a bunch of products that aren’t MacBooks. After all, USB-C is a universal standard that we’ve already seen on smartphones, laptops, monitors, speakers, headphones, and anything else that needs charging or data. In the patent filing, Apple lists “portable computing devices, tablet computers, desktop computers, laptops, all-in-one computers, wearable computing devices, cell phones, smart phones, media phones, storage devices, portable media players, navigation systems, monitors, power supplies, adapters, remote control devices, chargers, and other devices” as potential beneficiaries. So, uh, not an exhaustive list at all. It’s a little puzzling that Apple has chosen the old MagSafe design for the patent, rather than the newer MagSafe 2, but perhaps the barrel design works better. It’s also possible that despite the grand language of the patent, Apple is only intending on this being an adapter for old MacBook chargers, to help ease the pain of upgrading to a new laptop.

The first AirPods patent actually surfaced in Australia back in late January. Then on March 21 a next-gen AirPods patent surfaced regarding sports oriented AirPods with biometrics and noise cancellation features. Late last month the U.S. Patent Office published a whopping 250 patent applications from Apple on a single day. Usually when that occurs I'm able to find some fresh new concepts buried in this mountain of paperwork. To date Patently Apple has reported on more than a dozen interesting inventions derived from that same patent group. The latest find reveals a next generation AirPods charging case worth noting.   While the concept may be simple, it could pack quite the beneficial punch for future Apple customers. Apple is considering adding a secondary charging system to the AirPods case so that it could double as a portable wireless charging dock that could recharge other iDevices on its outer surface.   To be more specific, Apple lists the following as possible future products that could be recharged by this next-gen AirPods case:   "Such devices can include, for example, portable music players (e.g., MP3 devices and Apple's iPod devices), portable video players (e.g., portable DVD players), cellular telephones (e.g., smart telephones such as Apple's iPhone devices), video cameras, digital still cameras, projection systems (e.g., holographic projection systems), gaming systems, PDAs, as well as tablet (e.g., Apple's iPad devices), laptop (e.g. MacBooks) or other mobile computers. Some of these devices can be configured to provide audio, video or other data or sensory output."   Hmm, is a "holographic projection system" relating to a method of delivering Augmented Reality? I can't wait to find that patent some day!   The Second Charging System   The key to this invention was found in Apple's patent FIG. 23 noted below which illustrates an AirPods case #2300 that includes a wireless power transmitting component #2330 that enables the case to wirelessly charge an accessory electronic device outside of the case instead of within the case.   For example, as shown in FIG. 23, case #2300 is depicted as wireless charging an Apple Watch #2301 that is placed over and aligned with a wireless power transmitting component #2330.   While FIG. 23 illustrates a watch as the accessory device being charged, the invention could be used to wirelessly charge other appropriate electronic devices as noted at the top of the report being an iPhone, iPad, iPod, MacBook and others including a portable holographic projection system.   In some embodiments, case #2300 could also include one or more sensors to determine whether the Apple Watch is present and ready to receive transmitted power from the charger. For example, the Apple Watch could include an optical sensor, such as an infrared proximity sensor. When Apple Watch is attached to the case, the infrared proximity sensor could produce a signal used to determine the presence of the watch.   Other methods or structures to verify the presence of the Apple Watch or other iDevice), could include a mass sensor, a mechanical interlock, switch, button or the like, a Hall-effect sensor, or other electronic sensor.   AirPods Case: Waterproof Receptacle Connector   Another aspect of this next-gen AirPods case worth noting was found in patent FIGS. 28 and 29 below which illustrate a liquid-tight electrical connector. As shown in FIG. 28, the electrical connector #2800 could have mounting flanges and sealed features to make it resistant or impervious to liquid penetration.   Apple notes that In various embodiments the liquid-tight seal shall be rated between 3 (spraying water) and 6 (powerful water jets) while in some embodiments the liquid-tight seal shall be rated between 4 (splashing water) and 7 (immersion up to 1 meter). In various embodiments the liquid-tight seal shall be rated between 5 (water jets) and 8 (immersion beyond 1 meter) while in some embodiments liquid-tight shall mean the seal will protect the electronic device against liquid ingress up to 100 feet for 30 minutes.   Apple follows the waterproofing standards defined by the International Protection Rating and International Electrochemical Commission (IEC) 60529 that is widely known as the I.P.68 rating system. Click on the image below to review the entire rating system variables from 1 through 9K.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q3 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

HOLD the big red button, and then... Clips is Apple's fun new video editing app for iPhone and iPad. With it you can quickly and cooly add video, photos, subtitles, effects, title cards, and music, and share it with your contacts and social networks. To do that, you first need to get all the videos and photos into Clips. Here's how! How does the Clips interface work? Clips has a refreshingly discoverable — buttons are mostly obvious and clearly labeled. From the main screen, top left to bottom right, you have: Downward caret: Switch to Projects. Speech bubble: Live titles. Overlapping circles: Shows the Effects filters. DF logo: Opens the Overlay browser. T-square: The Title Cards. Musical note: Opens the music library. Live view: Shows you what's going to be recorded or inserted. Photo: Switches to the still camera. Video: Switches to the video camera. Library: Switches to your photo library. Microphone: Toggles audio recording on or off. Hold to Record / Add This Clip / Add This Photo: Inserts the content into the Clips timeline. Camera: Switches between the front-facing and rear-facing cameras. Play: Plays the current Clip stream. Clip thumbnails: Clips currently in the stream. Done: Switches to projects. There are a few differences between the Photo and Library screens, for example, a flash button, but not many. The project screen is a different beast entirely, again top left to bottom right: Upward caret: Switches to the capture screen. ? button: Opens the help browser. + button: Starts a new project. Collages: Your existing projects. Preview: The currently selected project. Play: Play the preview. Open: Switches to the capture screen. Share: Opens the Share sheet. How do you start a new project in Clips? Clips organizes videos into Projects. Each project has it's own clip stream. You can edit or add projects at any time. Tap the Projects button (Looks like v) at the top left. Tap the New Video button (looks like a +) or an existing project to select it. Tap the Done at the bottom right to go back to the capture screen. (You can also tap the Projects button again or the preview window.) How do you take a video with Clips? Taking videos is one of the primary functions of Clips, so it's super-simple to do. Tap on the Video tab, center, beneath the live view. Tap the Record Audio button to switch between mic (with audio) and mute (no audio) modes. Tap the Camera Chooser button to switch between front (selfie) and back (elsie) cameras. Use the live view to frame the subject(s) you want to record. Touch and hold Hold to Record. Pinch on the live view to zoom in or out while recording. Let go when you're done. As soon as you're done you can record more video or start working on the video you just shot. Note: Clips will use the front mic for the front-facing (selfie) camera and the back mic for the back-facing camera. So, if you're shooting something else and you want your voice heard (and/or Live Titled, see below), SPEAK UP. If you have headphones with a mic attached, Clips will use that mic regardless. How do you take a photo with Clips? Photos are treated almost like static video in Clips, so you don't just choose your shot, you choose how long to hold on your shot as well. Tap on the Photo tab, left, beneath the live view. Tap on the Flash button to cycle the flash between auto (white), on (yellow), and off (struck out). Tap the Camera Chooser button to switch between front (selfie) and back (elsie) cameras. Tap the big, round Shutter button to take a photo. Tap Retake if you're not happy with it and want a do-over. Touch and hold Hold to Add This Photo to insert the photo as a clip. (You need to hold for at least 1 second for it to be inserted.) Pinch or Swipe on the live view to zoom in or out or pan while inserting. Let go when you're done. When you're done, you can immediately insert the same photo again, say with different zooming, switch back to video, or switch to something else. How do you insert existing photos and video into Clips? You don't have to create brand new videos or photos for Clips. You can insert the photos and videos you already have. Tap on the Library tab, right, beneath the live view. Tap on the Albums button, top right, to switch albums. Tap on the photo or video you want to insert. (If you pick the wrong one, just tap on Library again and start over.) Tap the Record Audio button to switch between mic (with audio) and mute (no audio) modes. (You can add live audio to any photo or video while you're inserting it.) Touch and hold Hold to Add This Clip/Photo to insert the video or photo. Pinch or Swipe on the live view to zoom in or out or pan while inserting. Let go when you're done. You can immediately add the same video or photo again, with different pan and zoom, for example, or move on to the next clip. How do you move and rearrange Clips? <img src="/sites/imore.com/files/styles/larger/public/field/image/2017/04/clips-rearrange-screens.jpg?itok=eaHDFrEs" width="1152" height="2048" alt="" class="right" style="max-width="250" /> Once you've captured or inserted a Clip, you can change the order and sequence at any time. Touch and hold the Clip you want to move. Drag the Clip to its new position. Let go. If you make a mistake, just repeat the process until the Clip is where you want it. How do you mute or un-mute audio in Clips? If you record a Clip with audio and later want to silence it, or if you mute a clip and later want to restore audio, it's just a tap or two away. Tap the Clip you want to mute or un-mute. Tap on the Sound button (looks like a speaker). How do you trim (or un-trim) a Clip? If you record too much and want to trim off the beginning or end of a Clip, you can do it using the same type of controls as the Photos app. Tap the Clip you want to trim. Tap the Edit button (looks like scissors). Drag the left or right Trim control to remove video from the beginning or end. Tap Apply to finish. How do you delete Clips? If you decide you no longer want a Clip, you can trash it. Tap the Clip you want to trash. Tap the Delete button (looks like a trash can). Tap Delete Clip to confirm. How do you delete a whole project? Tap the Projects button (Looks like v) at the top left. Touch and hold any of your projects until they go into delete mode. Tap the Delete button. Tap Delete Video to confirm. Any Clips questions? If you have any questions on adding or editing video or photos to Clips, drop them in the comments below!

The iPhone 8 is rumoured to have a revolutionary new design with a bezel less OLED display and a new 3D camera. Increasing reports suggest the Cupertino giant might unveil the new smartphone in September but delay its release to later during the year. According to a research note from Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White, Apple’s new 3D camera is facing challenges that could result in delay of the new smartphone’s release. Apple launches iPhone 7, 7 Plus in red “Our contact strongly believes the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will be delayed by several weeks due to challenges around the 3D sensing technology but still in time for the December holidays. This is not the first time that we have heard about a potential delay with a new iPhone; however, our contact was so emphatic about the delay that we are taking this data point more seriously. Since it is only April, this situation could improve,” read the research note. Buying the iPhone 7 right now could be your worst mistake One possibility White lays out is that Apple could announce the redesigned iPhone in September, but instead of it going on sale shortly afterwards, it would go up for pre-orders instead. The 3D camera is expected to be one of the major new features of the new smartphone and is critical for Apple’s ambition in augmented reality.

The new app looks completely new and is not your usual serious Photos editor. Neither is it as detailed and capable as iMovie. Apple keeps the name short to just ‘Clips’ and like the short name, it appeals to a younger Instagram, Snapchat generation; minus the social aspect. Limited Clips basically lets you add some cool effects, filters, text, banners, stickers, emoji and more to your photos and images with ease. Too tired to type down text? Well, simply speak it out and Clips with transcribe them for you. While things appear to be a bit limited in all areas, whatever it does clips is able to pull off well, save for the transcribing bit. If you don’t want to be a part of the image you can event choose from cool templates. Like everything else on this app, there are just 12 templates to work with. Adding emoji as stickers is fairly simple as well. Just tap on the sticker button at the top, swipe to the left to access emojis, select one (of the few) place and then resize by pinching. Fun but confusing Clearly everything just works in the way its supposed to. But as simple as it may look, the app is confusing and comes with a rather steep learning curve, that makes iMovie look super user-friendly. Launch the app from the homescreen and you are greeted to a number of icons that let you add text, filters sticker, templates and music at the top. To the left of these icons is a drop down arrow. Tap on it an you will discover that there’s no menu there but just access to folders of clips and images sorted by date. Next to the folders is a ‘+’ icon which is where you can start with a new clip. Yes, you will need to tap on the drop down arrow every time you want to start a new clip, else your new additions get added to the older folder. How I wish there was a dedicated button on the top layer for creating new clips. With viewfinder in the middle of the display area the bottom bit looks familiar to the default iOS Camera app. You have Photo, Video and Library with a flash button, shutter button and camera switch below them. Below that is the preview of the current Clip in the working. Adding images is confusing In case you were wondering, Library lets you access both photos and videos stored on your phone along with your photos and video saves from the Clips app. Adding any of these items is as confusing as tapping on them where they suddenly appear in your viewfinder. Instead of going “huh?” with that confused look on your face, you need to look at the “all-important” red recording button below. Tapping on it lets you add your photo to the current clip being edited. Confusing? Yes, it sure is. What? No 3D Touch in 2017? That problem with transcribing text I tried the app both on an iPad Pro and an iPhone 6S. The app works fine except for when it comes to the transcribing bit. While the app could hear my voice clearly on the iPhone, it could do so (like not at all) when it came to the iPad. This is clearly a speaker placement issue as  I was in a quiet room (which is not the usual shooting scenario for this type of app). There’s a catch with the transcribing feature as well. You need to keep the red button pressed down not until you have taken the video footage you want but until the software understands what you are saying, that is a few seconds after as well. In short, you will need to keep the button pressed down until the decoder finished understanding your speech (which is a few seconds later) and then release the red recording button. If you release the button just after your video along with your voice is recorded, Clips will only display the text that has been decoded till then and not the complete sentence, because it did not get enough time to complete the task. Indeed these are some minor problems that Apple can fix, but I do not see Clips replacing the editors offered by social media giants. The selection of edits tools and templates is very limited and with no social connect (apart from sharing) it’s an app that will reside in a folder or end up being uninstalled quickly.

With new details emerging, we want to take a look at a few things you should be looking for as the iPhone 5 iOS 9.1 release date approaches. In September, Apple confirmed four iOS 9 updates for the iPhone 5. Three of those updates (iOS 9.0, iOS 9.0.1, and iOS 9.0.2) have rolled out to the iPhone 5 bringing new features and bug fixes to the aging former flagship. The iPhone 5 currently sits on iOS 9.0.2 and it could stay there until Apple’s ready to release the other iOS 9 update that’s sitting on the horizon. Shortly after its iPhone 6s launch date, Apple confirmed an iPhone 5 iOS 9.1 update. The company didn’t roll out the red carpet like it did for iOS 9.0. Instead, it confirmed the iOS 9.1 update with a release into its beta program for developers and the general public. Apple didn’t reveal much on stage but the iOS 9.1 beta confirmed several details including brand new emojis for the iOS 9 keyboard. The update will bring a taco, burrito, unicorn, and more to the iPhone 5 in the future. iOS 9.1 is the first milestone upgrade for the iPhone 5 and naturally, there’s a ton of excitement. Thing is, with Apple reportedly skipping an October launch event, we might not see the iOS 9.1 update or its release date appear on stage. With that in mind, we want to take a look at a few things we think iPhone 5 users need to be looking for as we approach the iOS 9.1 release date. Keep these things in mind as we push deeper into the month of October. iOS 9.1 Release Date Clues   1 / 10 Apple probably won't host an October launch event which means that we probably won't get any iOS 9.1 release details ahead of the release date. So that's why those of you interested in iOS 9.1 and its emojis will need to look for clues. The biggest clues that we have right now are the reports that suggest that iOS 9.1 will be coming out alongside the iPad Pro and Apple TV 4. The iPad Pro is Apple's new 12-inch slate and its release date is confirmed for November. The Apple TV 4 will most likely land in October. So, the iOS 9.1 release date will likely land in October or November. Keep your eyes peeled for iPad Pro release date rumors (we've already see a few emerge) and keep an eye out for Apple's Apple TV 4 iPad Pro announcements. They'll help set your expectations for the iOS 9.1 release date for the iPhone 5.   1 / 10 4 Responses 10/09/2015 Jamietpierre Reply nice 10/24/2015 roger Reply http://www.amazon.com 10/28/2015 Erin Reply I haven’t upgraded to the 6 because I’m still really happy with my iPhone 5. It’s been dropped and has taken the odd swim, and I’ve never needed to replace the screen or battery. I’m hopeful that this new update from Apple will prolong my 5, but an Otterbox would likely help with that as well!

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: April 9, 2017 9:55 am Apple launched an updated variant of its 9.7-inch iPad with a brighter Retina display, better processor and performance in March. Apple iPad (2017) Wi-Fi only model is now up for pre-order on Flipkart in Silver, Gold and Space Grey colour variants. The 32GB model costs Rs 28,000 and users will get an extra Rs 1501 off on Apple Earpods if purchased with the new 9.7-inch iPad. Axis bank Buzz credit card users get an extra 5 per cent off. Apple iPad 9.7-inch (128GB) with Wi-Fi+4G is listed for pre-order as well. It can be bought in the same colour options as the 32GB Wi-Fi model. Apple launched an updated variant of its 9.7-inch iPad with a brighter Retina display, better processor and performance in March.  “New customers and anyone looking to upgrade will love this new iPad for use at home, in school, and for work, with its gorgeous Retina display, our powerful A9 chip, and access to the more than 1.3 million apps designed specifically for it,” Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, said.

Apple is promising 10 hours of battery life on WiFi, and around 9 hours of life for browsing the web on Cellular. Apple’s new iPad gets 8MP rear camera and 1.2MP front FaceTime camera. Apple iPad 9.7-inch 32GB Wi-Fi only model was launched along side the iPad 32GB Wi-Fi+ Cellular model at Rs 39,900.

In fact, it's been almost two and a half years since the regular full-size iPads got a refresh.  New Apple iPad 9.7 vs iPad Air 2: What's the difference? Which iPad is best for you?  With the 9.7-inch iPad for 2017, Apple focussed on trying to give a great all-round experience, without canniblising its Pro series and making it as affordable as possible. In almost every way the company has succeeded and, simultaneously, brought sense to the iPad range naming scheme. New iPad review: Design 7.5mm thin Weighs 469 grams Space Grey, Silver and Gold models As far as looks go, the new 2017 iPad sits somewhere between the original iPad Air from 2013 and the iPad Air 2. That’s to say, it’s the same thickness as the first, but with refined ports, drilled holes and fingerprint sensor from the second. Pocket-lint Despite being slightly thicker than the iPad Air 2, the new 2017 iPad at just 7.5mm is still a slim device and rests easy in the hands thanks to weighing just under 470 grams. It has the Air-like rounded edges and corners to make it feel comfortable when held, and has the chamfered edges. Except they’re no longer polished, they’re given the same soft bead-blasted anodisation treatment as the rest of the metal casing. You’ll find the usual selection of ports and buttons on the new iPad. This includes the Lightning port flanked by 13 milled mini-holes on either side on the bottom edge, pill shaped volume buttons recessed into a groove on the right edge and a power/sleep key on the top. There’s nothing entirely new or exciting in the aesthetic department, but that’s not a bad thing. The iPad’s sturdy, slim and attractive minimal styling has long been one of its strong points. This remains, as does the series of under-the-hood magnets for using accessories like the Apple Smart Cover. Unlike the iPad Pro, there are no connectors for smart keyboards, which means you need to stick with the usual Bluetooth keyboards for typing on the go, if you don’t like using the on screen virtual QWERTY. And yes, there is still a headphone jack. Apple iPad (2017) review: Display 9.7-inch LCD IPS panel 1536 x 2048 resolution 264 pixels per inch If there’s any area Apple has taken a slight step backwards, it’s on the display. Sure, it has the same 1536 x 2048 resolution panel based on LED backlit LCD technology as before, but it’s not fully laminated like the iPad Air 2 screen was. That means there’s a small gap between the surface glass and the actual display panel, where there wasn’t in the last model. This is why the 2017 iPad is slightly thicker, and cheaper, than the previous generation. Pocket-lint What that means in real life use for the average consumer: not a lot. You won’t get the same “floating on the surface” effect that gets you close to your content, but the screen is still full of attractive and natural colours. It doesn’t really take away any of the enjoyment you get from binge-watching your favourite Netflix videos in bed, or agonising trying to get those last few Disney Crossy Road characters unlocked. It’s still more than 260 pixels per inch on display, meaning everything looks sharp at arm’s length, but you will see individual pixels if you hold it close to your face. Again, this isn’t something you’d notice in daily use, and the resolution is pretty much standard for 9.7-inch tablets. Even the much more expensive Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 and iPad Pro have the same pixel density and resolution. The most obvious difference between this and the iPad Pro’s display - apart from the Apple Pencil support - is the True Tone technology on the Pro, which adjusts the white balance based on ambient lighting conditions. It does, however, have iOS Night Shift which cuts out the blue light to help relax your eyes when you’re winding down in the evening. On the whole, it’s as good a platform for your favourite content as it has been. No better, and not really any worse. Apple iPad 9.7 review: Software iOS 10.3 at launch New messages app Split screen multitasking Apple Pay support As with all new iOS devices, the 2017 iPad runs the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system. In this instance, that’s iOS 10.3, which comes with all the latest features that aren’t iPhone or iPad Pro specific. Pocket-lint That means, just like the iPhone, your iMessages can be brought to life with bubble and full-screen effects, and various images and animations from the iMessage App Store. With some installed apps, the iMessage capabilities will also mean being able to share useful information and articles from apps like iMDB and Pocket or challenge your friends to a game of 8 Ball Pool, right from the Messages conversation. Apple iOS 10 tips and tricks: See what your iPhone and iPad can do now iOS 10 Messages explained: What's new and how to use it You also get the new Home app which brings together all of your HomeKit enabled accessories into a simple, intuitive dashboard. If you want to - and you don’t have a fourth generation Apple TV - you can opt to use your new iPad as the central hub for HomeKit devices, providing it’s an iPad that never leaves the house. One of the most useful features, which only made its debut in recent years, is the split screen multitasking. When using any app in landscape mode, you can drag your finger across from the right side of the screen and select any app to run alongside it. It’s particularly useful if you need to look something up while chatting to a friend, or if you need a constant reference point while working on a document. As for things you don’t get: there’s no Raise to Wake feature like you get on the iPhone, and no quick actions shortcuts from app icons, since the screen isn’t pressure sensitive. Pocket-lint Where iPad does succeed, and where it always has, is in the richness of its App Store ecosystem. There are thousands of great apps which are optimised for the iPad’s larger screen. These include great games, as well as fantastic creative programs like Paper by 53 and Procreate. So far, despite many years trying, this is an area where the iPad consistently outdoes Android tablets. New Apple iPad review: Performance and battery Dual-core A9 processor 2GB RAM 32 or 128GB storage 10 hour battery Like most new iPads since the first model launched seven years ago, the overall performance of the 9.7-inch iPad is slick and smooth. Its game loading speeds might not blow anyone away, but the A9 chip inside is still one of the most efficient and speedy processors on the market. Transitions between apps, interactions with content on screen and touchscreen responsiveness are all good. In short - it gets everything done with no hiccups and no drama. For an everyday tablet, that’s all you can ask for, and all you really need. Even running two apps side-by-side didn’t pose any real problems. Pocket-lint To keep it running all day there’s the non-removable battery which, as always, is built to survive ten hours of constant use, and many, many days on standby. Depending on your own usage, the results will vary, but we’ve found the 10 hour use target to be fairly accurate. Some days you might get less, other times more. If you only use the iPad for a couple of hours a day, it could easily survive four to five days without needing to be plugged back into a power source. Perhaps one slight downside is, unlike many new smartphones and tablets from other manufactures, the iPad (like the iPhone) still doesn’t have any kind of fast-charging solution. The included 10W power adapter is the same as it has been for many years, and will charge your iPad from empty to full in the space of 2-3 hours. iPad 9.7 review: Cameras 8MP rear camera Full HD video at 30fps 1.2MP FaceTime camera While photography is never a primary focus on iPads, it can be useful to have both the front 1.2-megapixel and rear 8-megapixel snappers, especially for Facetime calls. Apple's tablet remains one of the most useful windows for video calling. It's easy to pick up and move around, and easy to switch between those two cameras to show what you're looking at.  Pocket-lint Camera quality is decent enough too. Photos aren't as balanced as those you'd see from high end smartphones, but they're good enough for those who want to just snap something quickly to share with friends and family. It tends to struggle a little with over exposure and, like many, has a hard time focussing on objects that are really close.  Verdict This new iPad offers a solid, consistent tablet experience at the lowest price we’ve seen from Apple in a new, full-size tablet. In essence, it answers the question for those with dying 2-3 year old iPads who want to know what they should upgrade to, without spending £500+ on an iPad Pro. What’s more, it fits into the iPad range right in the middle, and brings cohesion to Apple’s tablet range. Now we have iPad mini, iPad, and iPad Pro. This iPad is easy to recommend to anyone. Alternatives to consider Pocket-lint Pixel C As it stands, the Android tablet market is a little bare, but the Pixel C shows off the best, cleanest version of Android in a stunning piece of hardware. It's really well made, has a great screen and is fast enough to cope with pretty much anything. It costs nearly £500, however, which is some premium over the regular iPad.  Read the full review: Google Pixel C review: Pixel perfect? Pocket-lint iPad mini 4 If you want a great Apple tablet without the size of the 9.7-inch iPad, the fourth generation iPad mini is an easy choice. Because the screen is smaller than the regular iPad, it's considerably sharper. It shares many of the features with the iPad 9.7, but just has them in a smaller package. It does, however, cost a little more than the iPad.  Read the full review: Apple iPad mini 4 review: Compact without compromise Sections Apple Tablets Best tablet / 2-in-1 2017: The best tablets and 2-in-1 devices available to buy today Apple iPad Pro 9.7 review: The tablet to beat all tablets New Apple iPad 2017 review: Solid, affordable replacement for the aging Air Emirates gets round laptop ban by handing out Microsoft Surface tablets to passengers Popular In Tablets On Pocket-lint New Apple iPad 2017 review: Solid, affordable replacement for the aging Air Emirates gets round laptop ban by handing out Microsoft Surface tablets to passengers Tablets for kids: How to setup an Amazon Fire tablet for children Which iPad is best for you? iPad mini 2 vs iPad mini 4 vs iPad Air 2 vs new iPad 9.7 vs iPad Pro 9.7 vs iPad Pro 12.9 New Apple iPad 9.7 vs iPad Air 2: What's the difference?

View All Editorials → Saturday Night Live to Produce Real Commercials for Apple and Verizon Bryan Chaffin @TMOBryan · +Bryan Chaffin Apr 7th, 2017 11:17 PM EDT | Editorial Apple and Verizon have struck separate deals with Saturday Night Live for the show to create commercials for the companies. The spots will run during SNL itself later in April, with Apple having committed to buying at least one spot. Thinking Differently about Advertising Ignoring Verizon—because who really cares?—the move marks a change for both Apple and SNL. Apple is known for exerting maniacal control over its advertising, but the company will be putting its message into the hands of one of the best satirist teams in entertainment. What could go wrong? SNL is also stepping into new territory by making ads that aren’t solely for the sake of comedy. Entertainment magazine Variety interviewed SNL creator Lorne Michaels, who said the deal is the result of a compromise made with NBC. In exchange for removing three minutes of advertising from each 90 minute episode, Mr. Michaels agreed to be a wee bit more accommodating to advertisers. Note that three minutes of ads this year are worth $660,000, as SNL‘s rates have risen sharply along with its ratings. The show’s viewership is the highest it’s been in some two decades, driven largely by interest in the show’s skewering of the Trump administration. Apple isn’t talking about the deal, and Mr. Michaels isn’t telling us what we should expect out of the spots. It’s a sign, though, that Apple is willing to think differently about advertising.

Mr. Mossberg came to fame in the 1990s as tech columnist for The Wall Street Journal. He consistently dinged Apple until shortly after the return of Steve Jobs. His career rose sharply as tech exploded and became an ever-more important part of modern society. He was one of the few journalists blessed by Steve Jobs, and was often given advanced access to Apple’s leadership and products. He and journalist partner Kara Swisher also got Steve Jobs, Tim Cook, and other Apple execs on stage for the AllThingsD conference, as shown in the image below, and later at Re/code’s Code conference. I didn’t always agree with Mr. Mossberg, but he contributed greatly to our understanding of what the tech world was up to. Accordingly, salute, Mr. Mossberg, and enjoy your well-earned retirement!

Hall of Fame Awards 2017 Bollywood celebs spotted at an awards event Can ‘an apple a day keep the doctor away’? "Eat an apple on going to bed and you will keep the doctor from earning his bread"TNN | Apr 6, 2017, 03.19 PM IST This phrase was first used in 1922, which went on to become 'An Apple a day keeps the doctor away' in the 20th century. It gives us the impression that apple is the most nutritious fruit around. While it may be true to some extent, there are fruits like banana, cherries, papaya, oranges and blueberries that are also heavily loaded with nutrients. Then why was apple the only fruit that was made part of the folklore? The reason that this phrase lasted so long is because there is indeed some truth to it. Apples can prevent the buildup of cholesterol and can also manage blood pressure. Some studies even suggest that it can even protect you against some cancers. According to Boyer and Liu, when the adage was created, 'apples were easy to grow. In fact, they still are easy to grow. And they can be in storage for almost a year after being harvested. Some studies also establish that apple's nutritional value remains relatively intact for as long as 200 days after harvest.' Moreover, you cannot deny the convenience of the fruit. It is easy-to-eat and since it consists of 85 per cent water and lots of fibre, it makes you full without burdening you with calories. Apple is among the most nutritious fruits, but it definitely doesn't keep the doctor away. The key is to have a varied diet. Nutritionists across the globe are recommending 3:4 ratio diet - which means three different colours of fruits and four different colours of vegetables every day. So next time you go shopping, do not forget to pick citrus fruits, seasonal fruits and berries besides apples.

X Bank of Ireland being left behind on new payment methods Cantillon: Bank risks missing boat on technologies such as Android and Apple Pay Sat, Apr 8, 2017, 06:45 Ulster Bank and KBC have adopted Apple’s contactless payment technology Apple Pay in Ireland. Photograph: Maxim Zmeyev/Reuters         When Android Pay launched in December last year, it was to a great fanfare. The contactless payment method allows customers to use a compatible phone to pay for goods and services in shops, with an extra layer of security for purchases over the €30 threshold that was imposed on contactless cards. Card numbers aren’t shared with retailers, making it more secure for users. AIB and KBC were first out of the gate with the new payment method, although Google promised that more banks would follow. Just a few weeks ago, Apple launched its contactless payment technology Apple Pay in Ireland. Same principle as Android Pay, same level of convenience, and secured with a fingerprint or code. This time, it was Ulster Bank and KBC who adopted it immediately. KBC has embraced the move fully, saying it is in line with its digital strategy for its customers. Again, others are likely to follow. Compatible with any contactless terminal, the days of having to carry plastic cards appeared numbered. So where, in all of this, is Bank of Ireland? One of the biggest banks in the State appears to have missed the boat when it comes to the new technology. Another product It’s a topical issue as it appears we are on the brink of seeing yet another contactless technology introduced here, with Samsung Pay predicted to launch in mid- to late-summer. Could the bank be biding its time? You could argue that there aren’t enough people interested in both Apple and Android Pay in Ireland to justify the bank making that leap, but offering the option to customers should at least be contemplated. And looking at other markets where the contactless technology is already in use doesn’t really bear the “market size” theory out. According to Apple’s most recent results, for example, the number of Apple Pay users has tripled in the last year, and chief executive Tim Cook told analysts in January that the service racked up billions in transactions during the December quarter. As the service launches in more countries and with more retailers, that is only going to increase. In London, for example, you can use Apple and Android Pay on public transport, something that Samsung’s vice-president of mobile for UK and Ireland Conor Pierce says he would like to see introduced in Ireland. Bank of Ireland risks being left behind by customers if it fails to capitalise on yet another new technology entering the market.       Topics: Cantillon Conor Pierce Tim Cook AIB Apple Bank of Ireland Google KBC Group Samsung Read More Late 2016 UK growth surge starting to run out of steam State faces unwelcome attention as Trump tackles trade deficit Brexit talks will continue amid nonsensical scaremongering Changes to State broadband scheme may bring legal challenge Nothing distorts earnings data like messy, moveable Easter The €23m question hanging over Independent News & Media Lloyds to compensate fraud victims as inquiry reopens Former IFG Group CEO McNamara gets over €300,000 on departure Central Bank governor Philip Lane gets €7,000 salary hike Scapegoating of Central Bank for house prices ignores the problem's complexity AboutCantillon A man with a profound understanding of how money is made and lost, Kerry-born economist Richard Cantillon (1680s-1734) is a fitting namesake for this long-running column.

Insider Access Stallion Sphere Advertise Video Forum Contact Menu Home USA Canada Australia New Zealand UK / IRE Europe Round 4 of the Blue Chip Matchmaker 03:08 PM 08 Apr 2017 NZST Comment (...) Tweet Share Email Print Back to Home page Lispatty Chris Brokate Photo Medusa Chris Brokate Photo YONKERS, NY, Friday, April 7, 2017-- Yonkers Raceway's Blue Chip Matchmaker offered up Round 4 Friday night (April 7h), with a pair of harness racing $40,000 divisions. This penultimate prelim event offered a different look, notably one less grouping as some of the marquee ma'ams (co-leader Bedroomconfessions and third-place lass Regil Elektra) taking the week off. The opening event saw the millionairess formerly known as Krispy Apple (Brett Miller) cave off some very tepid fractions (:27.1, :57.1, 1:25.2).. It was only she and Wrangler Magic (Dan Dube) leaving from their respective outer venues, but neither was involved in the outcome. Lispatty (Jason Bartlett, $13.80) earned the decision over a squeezing-through, 36-1 Diva's Image (Joe Bongiorno) in 1:55. The winner, from post position No. 3, improved inside down the backside as 17-10 fave Betabcool N (Mark MacDonald) and second choice Tessa Seelster (George Brennan) both left the cones and were essentially devoid of pace. It was Krispy Apple owning a length-and-three-quarter lead the lane, but she was done. Lispatty angled out, then prevailed by three-quarters of a length. Wrangler Magic lasted for third, Hidden Land (Tim Tetrick) and Betabcool N (Mark MacDonald) settling for the remainder while Krispy Apple retreated to seventh. For fourth choice Lispatty, a 4-year-old daughter of McArdle trainer by Gilberto Garcia-Herrera for owner Gilbert Garcia-Owen, it was her first win in seven seasonal starts. The exacta paid $182.50, with the triple returning $1,594. Lispatty Friday's second Matchmaker soiree had Medusa (Matt Kakaley, $11.20) do what Krispy Apple could not...finish what she started (:28.1, :57.3, 1:25.1, 1:53.3). From post No. 4, Medusa seated longshot Empress Deo, then never had an anxious moment. The pocket-sitter gave way by the three-quarters, with Mackenzie A (Jordan Stratton) taking up the chase. That chase left her a length-a-quarter in arrears at the wire, the same distance in front of a non-threatening 3-4 choice Mach it a Par (Bartlett) Empress Deo and Shesjustadelight N (Ron Cushing) settled for the minors. For third choice Medusa, a 6-year-old daughter of Bettor's Delight co-owned by Randy Bendis and Tom Pollack and trained by Andy Federico Jr., it was her fifth win in 13 seasonal starts. The exacta paid $29.40, the triple returned $60 and the superfecta paid $390. Medusa Round 4 of the George Morton Levy Memorial Pacing Series goes Saturday night (Apr. 8), with three, $50,000 divisions.   YONKERS’ SATURDAY PICK 5 FEATURES $12,500 DOUBLE CARRYOVER A friendly reminder from Yonkers Raceway that Saturday  evening’s (April 8th) Pick 5 wager starts with a certifiably-enticing double carryover of $12,570.13.   The Pick 5 is a 50-cent base wager comprising races 7 through 11 (for programs with at least 11 races…if not, then it goes as races 6 through 10). It has no consolation payoff, meaning if no one selects all five winners (as was the case Thursday and Friday nights), the entire pool (minus takeout) moves to the next racing program.

Twitter Facebook The iCloud hackers' bitcoin ransom looks like a fake The Turkish Crime Family said they'd been paid not to wipe Apple devices, but an expert says the evidence isn't real Michael Kan (IDG News Service) 08 April, 2017 11:33 - - - - print email Comments A group of hackers who claimed to hold millions of iCloud accounts for ransom said on Friday they'd been paid. But one bitcoin expert says that's bogus.  The Turkish Crime Family grabbed headlines last month by claiming they had the stolen login credentials for more than 700 million icloud.com, me.com and mac.com accounts. They demanded increasing ransoms from Apple while threatening to wipe the data from devices connected to the affected accounts if it did not. On Friday, the hackers tweeted that they had been paid US$480,000 in bitcoin. As proof, the group posted a link showing a transaction on Blockchain.info, a popular bitcoin wallet.   “We were told by our negotiator that we have come to a final agreement with Apple,” the hacking group tweeted prior to receiving the payment.   However, the hackers actually tweeted out a transaction to an "internal treasury operation at a bitcoin exchange," according to Jonathan Levin, co-founder at Chainalysis, a provider of anti-money laundering software for bitcoin. "We have positively identified that the inputs and outputs of that transaction are controlled by a single bitcoin exchange," Levin said in an email. The transaction was part of an internal money deposit process at a Korean bitcoin exchange, he said. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment. The tech giant has said that it never suffered any such breach. The stolen login credentials that the hackers obtained appeared to come from breaches at other third-party services, Apple said. Security researchers suspect that's true, and they believe the Turkish Crime Family has exaggerated its hacking claims.   The hacking group also didn't respond to a request for comment. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

View All Editorials → Jay Z Ditches Apple Music and Spotify for Exclusive Streaming on Tidal Jeff Gamet @jgamet · +Jeff Gamet Apr 7th, 2017 6:23 PM EDT | News It looks like Tidal co-owner Jay Z doesn’t think Apple Music and Spotify are cool any more because he pulled his albums from the streaming music services. It looks like just his original content is gone while collaborations with other artists are still available. Apple hasn’t said anything, but Spotify did confirm via Twitter that Jay Z requested his catalog be removed. @PinoyBroski Hi there! We can confirm that some of Jay Z’s catalogue has been removed at the request of the artist /LP — SpotifyCares (@SpotifyCares) April 7, 2017 Spotify didn’t say if Jay Z’s decision was based on friction between Tidal and other streaming music services. Assuming Kanye West is a reliable source, it’s likely that’s exactly why his music isn’t available for streaming on the two services. Kanye West bashed Apple Music last year in what amounted to a very public meltdown where he said his music wouldn’t ever be available on the service. Shortly after that his “Life of Pablo” song showed up there, and not long after the whole “Saint Pablo” album was available, pretty much killing the claim that his music would stream exclusively on Tidal. Sorry Apple Music and Spotify, no streaming Jay Z for you Tidal’s claim to fame is higher quality streaming audio and that it is artist-owned. The US$19.99 subscription level does offer higher bit rate tracks, although its $9.99 a month service offers the same file quality as competitors. For practical purposes, that means the only real difference between Tidal and Apple Music and Spotify are exclusive streaming deals. If Jay Z did pull his albums to make Tidal more enticing to Apple Music and Spotify customers he should get ready to be disappointed. He’s more likely to push people into pirating his songs than convince them to switch streaming music services.

Imagination Technologies added it believes a brand new design for a graphics processor that did not infringe on Imagination Technologies’ intellectual property would be very challenging for Apple, setting the stage for a possible fight over intellectual property in the months ahead. Imagination Technologies has been struggling to diversify, but has remained dependent on its largest customer, Apple, and has continued to derive most of its revenue from the PowerVR graphics processor technology that Apple says it will no longer use. Last year, Imagination Technologies laid off roughly 5% of its workforce after rumors that Apple was going to buy the company failed to pan out. Apple’s move to bring its graphics chip technology in-house is part of a larger trend that is impacting several of the largest companies in the mobile ecosystem. Google and Amazon.com have both talked about designing their own chips, and Apple has been designing its own central processing units for several years, although it still uses cores designed by ARM, another British company that licenses intellectual property related to chip design. ARM recently became part of Japan’s SoftBank, the carrier that owns a controlling interest in Sprint. The decision to move forward without Imagination Technologies’ intellectual property is a more radical change than Apple’s decision to design its own CPUs using ARM cores. If the graphics chips that Apple ultimately brings to market do not rely on a completely new architecture, look for another bruising patent battle that will play out in the courts. Apple is already on track to meet another one of its key suppliers in court. Earlier this year, the iPhone maker brought a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm, claiming the leading maker of LTE connectivity chipsets had failed to remit payments promised to Apple. Apple’s pressure on its chip suppliers can be seen as part of an ongoing effort to control costs at a time when growth at the highest end of the smartphone market is leveling off. The world’s most valuable company is under pressure from investors to maintain the eye-popping returns shareholders have enjoyed in the past. Follow me on Twitter.

Before the launch of Night Shift, f.lux was the go-to tool for doing this. Let's see how they compare. Night Shift and f.lux (free) sound identical at a glance. They both attempt to reduce your exposure to blue light at night by applying a warmer colour filter to your screen after the Sun goes down. The similarities between the two end there though, and in typical Apple fashion, which one you use depends primarily on how much you like to tinker with settings. F.lux Offers Way More Options to Tweak How It Works Night Shift's (left) minimal settings are part of the appeal, but f.lux (right) offers way more ways to customise it. The biggest and most important difference between f.lux and Night Shift comes in the form of your options for customisation. With Night Shift, you can set when Night Shift activates, and then choose a colour temperature on a scale of Less Warm to More Warm. F.lux offers a somewhat insane variety of options. You can choose the temperature of your screen during the day, at sunset/sunrise, and at bedtime. You can choose from various colour presets or create your own. There's even a Night Owl setting for those who actually prefer to work late into the evening. Beyond that, f.lux also allows you to set how long the transitions between colours last, what time you get up on the weekend, and you can set reminders when it's getting close to your bed time. F.lux even includes several specific types of colour effects, like a dark room mode that inverts colours, a movie mode that preserves colours while reducing certain lights, and a mode that automatically triggers the macOS dark theme at sunset. Night Shift's Effect Is Less Noticeable Since it's shipping with a commercial product, Night Shift is also a little less extreme than f.lux. This isn't necessarily a bad thing — Night Shift is targeting a broad set of people, whereas f.lux is filling a niche. F.lux breaks down the differences in a forum post, the main difference being in how f.lux also reduces blue-green light: F.lux claims that Night Shift just doesn't reduce enough light to help with sleep. We know that the supposed effect here is about much more than just reducing the blues, but it's hard to say whether one or the other is actually better for sleep. Regardless, Night Shift is much less intrusive because all it does is add a warmer filter to your display, and you can use it without disrupting your general computer usage that much, unless you're working on colour correction in photos or videos. Even with all of the different settings tweaks you can do, f.lux has a much more noticeable impact because it does more than just apply a warmer filter; it changes the overall amount of light alongside the colour. F.lux Works On Older Macs (and Everything Else) One little surprise that came with the launch of Night Shift on the Mac is its limited compatibility. For some reason, Night Shift is limited to the following Macs: MacBook (Early 2015 or newer) MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or newer) MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 or newer) Mac mini (Late 2012 or newer) iMac (Late 2012 or newer) Mac Pro (Late 2013 or newer) Good news though, f.lux works on pretty much every Mac in existence (as well as Windows and Linux). So, if Night Shift isn't an option, you can get the same effect out of f.lux's default settings, so don't feel like you're missing out on anything special. There's also the fact that f.lux is continually a work in progress, with small iterations being released pretty often and new landmark features added in at a steady pace. The developers behind f.lux are constantly talking about the research behind their work and making adjustments to the software as they go. I doubt Apple will show this same sense of dedication to a small little feature they tossed into their operating systems. Regardless, Night Shift is still useful for a lot of people and the simplicity of its set it and forget it attitude means it will be in use by a lot more people. If you want more options though, grab yourself a copy of f.lux. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Related iPhone 8 Rumor Rollup: Fresh spate of delayed shipment speculation swirls;... iPhone 8 Rumor Rollup: The Great iPhone 8 freak-out, no worries about Galaxy... iPhone 8 may actually be called the 'iPhone Edition' Video Cool Yule Tools- Hot Picks Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 is poised to be a complete game-changer. After years of keeping the iPhone form factor more or less unchanged, the iPhone 8 will likely feature an edgeless OLED display with a Touch ID sensor embedded into the screen itself. Additionally, it's widely believed that the iPhone 8 will offer up improved water resistance, faster internals, wireless charging, facial recognition software and much more. While nothing is ever a guarantee until Apple makes it official, there's good reason to believe that the iPhone 8 will represent one of the biggest leap forwards in iPhone technology we've seen in years. Having said that, there have been a number of interesting rumors regarding the iPhone 8's retail price over the past few weeks. Now given that the iPhone 8 will be positioned as a premium device, Apple will, not surprisingly, price it accordingly. That said, early reports indicated that the going price for an iPhone 8 would fall somewhere in the $1,000 range, a price point that naturally gave many prospective consumers pause. Thankfully, the iPhone 8, while expensive, won't necessarily break the bank. According to a new research note from UBS, the financial services company anticipates that the iPhone 8 will be priced similarly to Samsung's recently released Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. Specifically, UBS believes that the entry level iPhone 8 -- with 64GB of storage -- will be priced in the $870 range. Presumably, an iPhone 8 with more storage will inch closer to the $1000 threshold without surpassing it. By way of contrast, the gargantuan Galaxy S8 Plus retails for $840. While that's cheaper than the rumored price of the iPhone 8, Apple has traditionally sold its products at a premium relative to the competition. "Apple's top model will be at a display size disadvantage to Samsung's Galaxy S8 Plus," UBS said in a note obtained by CNBC. "We still think Apple will choose to price its top model relative to Samsung's top model, but remain cautious on how much higher Apple could ultimately go on price given a smaller display." CNBC adds: Even the iPhone 7 Plus, which saw a $20 price rise from the 6 Plus, "has had more demand than any other Plus model released"... The investment bank expects the Plus could account for over 40 percent of iPhone sales in fiscal year 2017 versus a historical average of 25-30 percent. Indeed, Apple customers have never been shy about paying more for additional features. In fact, we saw this dynamic play out with Apple's 2016 iPhone lineup when demand for Apple's pricier iPhone 7 Plus was so high that it even caught Apple executives off-guard. Recall, the iPhone 7 Plus featured an advanced dual-camera system not present in the smaller 4.7-inch iPhone 7 model. As it stands now, the main question currently looming over the iPhone 8 centers on when the device will actually launch. In recent weeks we've seen conflicting reports about the iPhone 8 release date, with the most recent report claiming that the device will launch sometime in October or November.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple offers slight speed bump for current Mac Pro, hints at new models in 2018 Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Wednesday, April 5th, 2017, 05:38 Category: Apple, Hardware, Mac Pro, News Apple’s pro-grade machine got a bit of a speed bump today, albeit it might not be the overhaul that users were expecting. The tower, which has remained without an update for more than three years, is still available with the two base models retailing for $2,999 and $3,999. The lower-end model jumps from from a quad-core Xeon CPU to a 6-core one, and gets dual G500 GPUs (an upgrade over the G300 GPUs), while the step-up model gets an 8-core CPU (up from 6) and dual D700 GPUs (up from the D500). At present, there’s still no onboard USB-C and no Thunderbolt 3, which means it still won’t be able to run the LG UltraFine 5K display. Apple also stated that new, pro-level iMacs are due later this year. Apple has stated in past interviews with senior vice presidents Phil Schiller and Craig Federighi that “The current Mac Pro … was constrained thermally and it restricted our ability to upgrade it” and engineering, wherein the company has apparently “designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner, if you will.”). Executive apologized for users hoping for a major upgrade and stated that Apple is “completely rethinking the Mac Pro” with a new modular design that can accommodate high-end CPUs and GPUs, as well as Apple-branded pro displays to go with them. These improvements, per the quotes, won’t be available until next year. The company also stated that while its Mac user base is approaching 100 million users, only 20 percent of them use desktops. Of those, Mac Pro users make up a “single-digit percentage.” “We’re working on [a new Mac Pro],” Schiller said. “We have a team working hard on it right now, and we want to architect it so that we can keep it fresh with regular improvements, and we’re committed to making it our highest-end, high-throughput desktop system, designed for our demanding pro customers.” Stay tuned for additional details as they become available. And, the moment they do, I’ll proudly be snagging the new one, as I love my current Mac Pro beyond what might be considered rational… Via Macworld Tweet Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) More Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Related Recent Posts Rumor: Apple to debut next-gen Apple Watch later this year, will take two-generation approach to models available Recently published patent application shows how Apple might incorporate Touch Bar, Touch ID functions into next-gen Magic Keyboard Western Digital announces My Passport SSD, drive will feature USB-C functionality for Macs Apple begins offering refunds for customers who paid for the Workflow app Rumor: Next-gen, modular Mac Pro may not be available until early 2019 2 Responses to “Apple offers slight speed bump for current Mac Pro, hints at new models in 2018” drx, on April 5th, 2017 at 6:34 pm Said: Apple, long ago abandoned computers, traditional, upgradeable machines … of computation. Even the Mac Mini got the short end of the shaft … At one point there was a quad core Mac Mini option, with even an OK GPU … upgradable RAM, HDD/SDD/optical. My 2010 Mac Pro is running fine … highly upgraded, no thunderbolt and is way better than anything Apple currently has to offer. Certainly the late 2013 model can do some things better — if you need more 4K rendering options, yet I could even upgrade to a 12GB nVidia Titan video card, to get a few more options (CUDA processing) and in some cases better performance than the trash cans dual AMD 6GB GPUs … Apple abandoned computers … the professional market and really just about everything that made it great. iPhone are OK. One may even consider an iPhone a “computer” yet it is not nearly as good a “computer” when you need things only a older styled machine can perform. At least Apple never went the Windows 8/10 route. chris lewis, on April 6th, 2017 at 1:33 am Said: I share an irrational fondness for my 2010 Mac Pro. I’ve used G3, G4 and Intel “pro” machines for work and play for two decades and they have never caused me grief, apart from one hard drive clicking itself to death. That was my excuse to put two SSDs in a RAID on the PCI bus. zoom zoom zoom. As for Apple forsaking its “pro” user base, i seem to remember that the specs of the 2013 Mac Pro exceeded anything its competitors offered, ignoring price. And they are still pretty good today, better after Tuesday’s announcement. Some graphcs designer friends tried so-called “high-end” Windows machines to save a couple of thou$and. Cost them more in down time. They chucked them back in exchange for Mac Pros. I did not upgrade from my 2010 machine because of the 2013 Pro’s lack of expansion potential. But this news of next year’s revamp has me more than a little excited.

If so, good luck downloading it on your iPhone 5/5c or iPad 4. That’s because the free of charge video creation app lacks support for 32-bit iOS devices despite requiring the recently-released iOS 10.3, which in itself runs on 32-bit iOS devices. As first noted by AppleInsider, this could be interpreted as another sign that Apple will stop supporting 32-bit devices when iOS 11 releases later this year. “It is not exactly clear when Apple will completely drop support for 32-bit devices in the iOS itself,” writes the publication. “The omission of 32-bit device compatibility appears to be another step for the company in that direction.” In another sign that iOS 11 will make the end of the road for 32-bit apps and devices, Apple’s changed a warning about 32-bit apps on iOS 10.3. The reworded prompt now cautions users that using a 32-bit app will slow down their 64-bit device. TUTORIAL: How to identify 32-bit apps that are installed on your iOS device “This app will not work with future version of iOS,” reads the reworded prompt on iOS 10.3. Moreover, iOS 10.3 includes a new App Compatibility section within the Settings app that names and shames all 32-bit apps that are installed on your device. The following iOS devices are 64-bit: iPhone 5s/SE/6/6s/7 iPad Air and iPad Air 2 iPad mini 2, iPad mini 3 and iPad mini 4 Sixth-generation iPod touch 12.9-inch iPad Pro and 9.7-inch iPad Pro 9.7-inch iPad (2017) Last but not least, iOS 10.3.1 has brought back the ability to update 32-bit iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices over the air though owners of iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and iPad 4 were always able to update their legacy hardware through iTunes. This is interesting in and of itself because the iOS 10.3.2 beta currently lacks 32-bit device support. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube According to Apple, the Clips app requires iOS 10.3 and supports iPhone 5s and later, 9.7-inch iPad (2017), all iPad Air and iPad Pro models, iPad mini 2 and later and sixth-generation iPod touch.

Anonymouse Hey angry ant, when I wrote you must be new here, that was a tongue in cheek response to who writes like that. If you have been here for over one month let alone one year you’d have noticed that this authors articles are to put it eloquently, riddled with shite. So if anyone questions this authors writing style I’d automatically assume the reader must be new to iDB. Understand? Now pull your head in. Timothy No, he seems to be everywhere, unfortunately. Timothy Seriously dude, what’s your problem? You always point out “mistakes” in these articles that aren’t even there… I have seen dozens of your comments on iDB and I don’t think a single one has been positive. If you hate the site so much, why do you keep reading it?? Agneev Point out my mistake, if you can! Anonymouse I don’t think he was pointing out a mistake. Rather was pointing out the manner in which the author was advising readers by wishing them good luck in downloading an app that can’t be downloaded on older 32 bit devices. Like saying to a blind man, good luck watching the sun set. If I’m not mistaken English is the second language for the author, however sensitivity isn’t affected by that fact, nor is immaturity.

Credit: Apple, Inc     Apple’s new-generation iPad is set to go on sale this weekend in South Africa, bringing with it a new range of prices. According to MyBroadband, the entry-level 32GB Wi-Fi model will go for R5 999, with the 128GB equivalent priced at R7 999. Meanwhile, the Wi-Fi and cellular models, equipped with the same amount of storage, will cost R8 299 and R9 999. Apple says its new devices are run by the updated Apple A9 chip, featuring 9,7-inch high-detail Retina displays that supposedly won’t compromise the device’s battery life. The device is a level down from its iPad Pro big brother, but it still promises to deliver excellent performance, both for productivity and gaming. It will be offered alongside the Pro – which is marketed as a “super computer” - as well as the iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 4. Related Articles New Apple Mac Pro on the horizon?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Image Source: Niels Epting Apple: Pro users couldn’t care less about a touchscreen iMac Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 4th, 2017 at 4:41 PM Share Tweet With the Mac Pro languishing on the sidelines, not to mention the backlash that accompanied Apple’s arguably underpowered 2016 MacBook Pro, a narrative that Apple no longer cared about its creative professional demographic began to grow and take hold. Earlier today, Apple took steps to assure the Mac faithful that the opposite is true and that the company is working on some new hardware that is being designed from the ground-up to meet the stringent needs of video and other creative professionals. Specifically, Apple teased that a new Mac Pro with a modular design is in the works and that the company is also busy working on new iMac configurations specifically designed for pro-oriented users. “We’re going to begin making configurations of iMac specifically with the pro customer in mind,” Phil Schiller said during a recent roundtable discussion attended by a handful of select reporters, including John Paczkowski of Buzzfeed. What we won’t see, however, are new touchscreen Macs of any kind. Don't Miss: Oh good, Samsung found a way to ruin the Galaxy S8’s gorgeous design for me While Apple has long railed against the very idea of creating a hybrid device featuring a traditional Mac with a touchscreen, the fanfare that surrounded Microsoft’s unveiling of its Surface Studio PC last year prompted some to wonder if Apple might ever contemplate reversing course on next-gen versions of the iMac. The short and complete answer to that question is a resounding no. Addressing this issue head-on, Buzzfeed relays Schiller’s thoughts on a touchscreen Mac ever hitting stores. Company executives are, however, quite happy to confirm a feature the pro iMac will not have: touchscreen. “No,” Schiller said when asked if Apple would consider building such a thing. “Touch doesn’t even register on the list of things pro users are interested in talking about. They’re interested in things like performance and storage and expandability.” Far from a surprise, Schiller has previously said that a touchscreen based Mac makes no sense because it would be impossible to optimize the user experience. “It’s the lowest common denominator thinking,” Schiller said late last  year. For what it’s worth, it’s not as if Apple blindly decided not to pursue such a design. On the contrary, the company actually researched a touchscreen iMac previously and even filed a few patents on such a design, as evidenced by the photo below. Ultimately, Apple came to the conclusion that such a design would diminish the user experience across the board. “Because what that would wind up doing, or what we’re worried would happen, is that neither experience would be as good as the customer wants,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said about two years ago. “So we want to make the best tablet in the world and the best Mac in the world. And putting those two together would not achieve either. You’d begin to compromise in different ways.” Tags: Apple, iMac View Comments Trending 1 Tech Everything you need to know before installing the Windows 10 Creators Update 2 Tech Google and Nokia might finally make the Android phone fans are dying for 3 Tech Biggest iPhone 8 leak yet offers several surprising new details 4 Tech iPhone 8: Insider outs exciting new features, but says phone is delayed 5 Tech Tesla wants everyone to know: The Model 3 won’t be more advanced than the Model S Picked For You Watch the Pepsi commercial that has the entire internet going crazy By Jacob Siegal April 5th at 10:50 AM The next-gen Google Home will do something Amazon’s Echo can’t By Chris Smith April 6th at 1:43 PM This iPhone 8 would be so much hotter than the Galaxy S8 By Zach Epstein April 5th at 10:27 AM Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad Post to Cancel

Stock (AAPL) Why Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. Stock (BBBY) Has Big Upside Potential View All Posts Microsoft Corporation‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT)  Surface customers are the happiest and most satisfied when it comes to user experience, and this feeling is far deeper than it is for those using Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPads. Source: Via iStock According to J.D. Power, the reason people are more satisfied using the Surface than the iPad is that the former boasts not just of better features, but its design and styling factors are also superior. Apple’s Jony Ive will really be disheartened to learn this. Microsoft Surface vs. Apple iPad In J.D. Power’s U.S. Tablet Satisfaction Study, the Surface scored 855 points (out of 1,000), beating Apple by six points. The Surface’s connectivity, accessories and pre-loaded apps won the hearts of most users. Other factors such as the beauty of the design and the tablet’s size and build also attracted buyers. According to the survey, Microsoft Surface owners were also found to use more accessories, including a stylus (48% vs. 27% industry average), physical keyboard (51% vs. 14%) and mouse (27% vs. 6%) J.D. Power’s vice president of service industries, Jeff Conklin, said, “The Microsoft Surface platform has expanded what tablets can do, and it sets the bar for customer satisfaction. These tablet devices are just as capable as many laptops, yet they can still function as standard tablets. This versatility is central to their appeal and success.” It was found in the study that 51% of Microsoft customers believe they are usually the first ones in their circle of friends and colleagues to try new technology. This means that the majority of people choose Surface tablets instead of iPads when looking for the newest devices, notes CNBC. Apple created the modern tablet computer market with the launch of the iPad in 2010. Thereafter, in 2012, Microsoft reinvested the segment by developing convertible tablets. In 2015, Apple then came up with its own convertible, the iPad Pro. 7 Tech Stocks That Will Crush the Market for Years It must be noted that though Apple has seen a sharp decline in quarterly tablet sales, it still leads the market. The risk, however, exists for Apple to lose its bigger market share to Microsoft’s tablets. Other Survey Findings The study, which was conducted between October and December 2016, was based on a sample of 2,238 U.S. tablet owners who have been using the device for less than a year. Users were asked to rate their tablets on five parameters: style and design, features, cost, performance and ease of operation. The survey also found that average customer satisfaction with tablets has been rising. At 841, it is higher than the 2016 U.S. Tablet Satisfaction Study by 21 index points. However, brands like LG Display Co Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:LPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Asus and Acer failed to meet this average, with scores of 836, 834, 812 and 814 respectively. Second, when customers select a tablet, they give the most importance to factors like lower price and past experience, with reputation being the next most important criterion. Third, the average screen length diagonally is important. The larger the screen length, the greater the satisfaction level. The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for April Last, data plans also have much to do with satisfaction level. Customers with data plans had satisfaction levels as high as 863, while those without a plan scored just 834.

The best supermarket Easter Eggs including Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Waitrose But would you transform your mashed potatoes into high art? A Melbourne-based mum has turned suspicious foods like carrots and beetroot into masterpieces so good she’s managed to convince her son to eat them. Food guru Laleh Mohmedi started getting creative with her four-year-old son Jacob’s meals two years ago. Now, she runs an Instagram account with 84,000 followers desperate to see her next work of art. Mohmedi said that people love her food art because it takes the tension out of dinner with the kids.

Facebook Twitter Google+ Email April 5, 20173:23 PM ET Andrew Flanagan Twitter Enlarge this image Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek in 2012, just one year after the service launched in the U.S. It now has 50 million paying subscribers. Spencer Platt/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek in 2012, just one year after the service launched in the U.S. It now has 50 million paying subscribers. Spencer Platt/Getty Images "Our theory was simple," wrote Daniel Ek, co-founder and CEO of Spotify, in 2014, "offer a terrific free tier, supported by advertising, as a starting point to attract fans and get them in the door." So what happens after everybody's crossed the threshold? At the time Ek wrote that post he was reacting to the high-visibility exit of Taylor Swift from his platform over a disagreement (to put it kindly) about the vast catalog of "free" (what the industry refers to as "ad-supported") streaming music it offered. At the time, Spotify had 12.5 million paying users and 37.5 million listening for free — it now has 50 million subscribers and at least 50 million free listeners. Through that growth, the company has vehemently (and in that blog post from Ek, quite dramatically) defended its two-tier "freemium" approach — free streaming with ads and paid subscriptions with no ads — despite repeated criticism from artists over the much lower royalty rates it paid for those ad-supported streams. No longer. This week, Spotify relented, agreeing to withhold certain albums from the free tier of listeners. For a two-week window following their release dates, certain albums will only be available to paying subscribers. The deal was struck after a two-year-long negotiation with Universal Music, the world's largest record label, over the structure and cost of licensing the label's music. "We know that not every album by every artist should be released the same way," Ek wrote, surprisingly matter-of-fact, yesterday. Billboard reports that in return, Spotify got UMG to agree to lower royalty fees for hitting revenue targets. "In a market this dynamic," Universal Music chairman and CEO Lucian Grainge wrote* of the deal yesterday (Apr. 4), "one evolving more rapidly than ever before, success requires creative and continual re-evaluation of how best to bring artists' music to fans." (*Note: Some possible motivation for Universal's negotiating position can be traced to the moment in 2016 when Grainge and the label were the butt of a contractual joke engineered by none other than Frank Ocean, who used the release of his 45-minute-long visual album Endless to satisfy his contract with Universal Music. Hours later, he released his "proper" album, Blonde, as a self-released exclusive on Apple Music. Grainge reacted swiftly, calling for an end to all platform-specific album exclusives like Ocean's. Grainge already had, for years at that point, been criticizing free streaming.) A key element of the dynamism that Grainge seems to be referencing here is the fact that, unlike at the time of Ek's blog post, a huge number of listeners are now "in the door." Streaming is both the dominant source of revenue for the major labels ("streaming represents the majority of the business," as Grainge wrote yesterday) and the primary way the western world accesses music. The industry is no longer as willing to subsidize Spotify's growth (which has translated into its own success). And so we come to the death, by natural market causes, of a favorite Silicon Valley business strategy. Now, the writing is on the wall for music fans — if you want to hear what you want to hear when you want to hear it in the friction-free and anywhere-access way you've become accustomed, the time is fast-approaching when you will be required to pay up. Spotify's deal with Universal (as well as contracts with Warner Music and Sony Music which are still under negotiation) is not the only thing threatening Spotify's free tier. One month ago in Washington, D.C. a byzantine and little-known process, overseen by a panel of three judges named the Copyright Royalty Board, began to determine the rates that Spotify and its competitors will pay not to recording artists or labels but songwriters and music publishers. Put simply (this part of the music business can induce headaches), this process involves the filing of arguments by companies about how much they should pay to license song compositions — and some of these arguments would all but annihilate Spotify's free tier. Apple, arguing on behalf of Apple Music — which has become Spotify's lead competitor since its launch a little less than two years ago — writes: "Interactive streaming services do not need to be 'protected.'" What Apple is referring to is Spotify's own arguments to the Board, in which the company spends a significant amount of time defending free listening. Apple posits that Spotify's arguments to save its free tier amount to institutional protection. To that end, it has proposed a royalty rate that would, if accepted, essentially force Spotify to shutter its free tier, by making it pay the same royalty on paid and free streams. Songwriters have done essentially the same, asking for a raise and a similar change to the structure of their royalties from streaming services. The Copyright Royalty Board revisits these rates every five years. The last time it met, it kept rates the same. But the music business has changed so vastly since 2012 that the argument to keep things as they are is now more difficult to defend. (We'll find out in December, when the CRB expected to issue its decision.) Now that the traditional music business, made up of the major labels and major publishers, has some semblance of stability after a decade-and-a-half of economic diminution and strategic chaos, it's back on the offensive. Killing free streaming is one fight. Spreading its bets through licensing to virtual reality endeavors and being more open-minded to licensing its catalog to social startups — as we covered in early February — is another. Listeners, musicians and tech companies are through the door now. Spotify, an extremely important source of revenue for the music industry, now has to worry about the next milestone — going public. (A report from The Wall Street Journal today says the company may pursue a type of initial offering that could be more lucrative for its equity holders, which include the three major record labels.) After years of the industry softly subsidizing Spotify's growth into a mature business, they now want it to start acting like one.

She also fancies herself a bit of a rock star in her town and spends too much time reading comic books.  If she's not typing away at her keyboard, you can probably find her at Disneyland or watching Star Wars (or both). Apple's Night Shift for Mac is a great first attempt, but it doesn't hold a candle to f.lux. I've been using f.lux for nearly as long as it's been in existence. I get up before the sun rises and used to feel blinded by how bright my screen was while the rest of the house was still dark. A friend turned me on to f.lux, and I've had it installed on all of my Mac computers ever since. I've been using Night Shift for Mac for about two weeks and I'm less than impressed with Apple's version of the screen dimming software program. Maybe it's because I'm so accustomed to f.lux. Maybe it's because I was hoping Apple would do more with Night Shift on Mac than it did on iOS. It's a solid program that works perfectly, every time. But it's lacking some features that I find invaluable on Mac. Customization on Night Shift for Mac is scant On my iPhone, I absolutely love Night Shift. I set it up when it first launched and haven't had to think about it for a single second since then. On the Mac, however, I need a little more than just the ability to adjust the effect and switch it off in Notification Center. The size of a Mac's screen means our eyes are covering more landscape than on an iPhone. The larger the screen, the more blue light invades our space. Human beings are affected by light in different ways and are more or less sensitive under different occasions, like changing seasons. For this reason, some of us prefer the ability to customize the output of a blue light-restricting program with such things as different levels of effect during different times of the day and night or the ability to disable it only while using a specific app, or even just to set our Mac to a dark theme only after sunset. You can manage f.lux's lighting effect with such things as fast transition, which quickly brightens or dims your screen instead of taking about an hour to get to the full effect. You can set it up to trigger later on the weekends or earlier in the evening for kids, and there is an expanded daytime setting that you can customize to match the lighting in your office. I'd love to see Apple add some more color customization options for Night Shift, like the ability to dim and warm the screen even more than it currently does or multiple preset filter settings for different times of the day (like daytime, sunset, and bedtime). f.lux goes beyond screen warming and dimming f.lux also incorporates a couple of souped-up effects that are incredible under certain circumstances, like Dark Room, which turns all of the blacks red and all of the colors gray to black. Imagine working in an environment where you have to have the room very dark, like when developing film or burning a silkscreen graphic. With Dark Room mode enabled, you can use a computer in such an environment without risk of destroying what you are working on. You can set f.lux to disable whenever you use a specific app. So, if it's getting late in the evening and you're still working, but you want to take a break to watch an episode of a television show via iTunes, f.lux will automatically disable as soon as you open iTunes and will re-enable whenever you select a different app. You can keep the blue light off your eyes while using your writing program but have it automatically switch off when you want to check something out in a different app, then switch back on when you're back writing. Movie mode in f.lux is especially good for watching movies late at night when you're trying to get some sleep but just need something to distract your thoughts. When you have Movie mode set up, it will still work to reduce the blue light emitting from your screen but will keep the colors and shadow details bright to make the orange filter less obvious and won't affect the colors in the movie as much. For people that have trouble prying themselves away from their computer, f.lux has a Backwards alarm clock that reminds you at the top of every hour that it's time to go to bed. You can turn it on when you know you're working late to give you that gentle nudge that whatever you're doing can wait until tomorrow. I would love to see Apple implement some additional screen adjusting filters that we can access quickly from Notification Center or a bedtime reminder that will give us a nudge when we've been sitting at the computer for too long. A version of Movie mode on Night Shift would be invaluable. What Apple got right The level of customization and detail that f.lux offers isn't for everyone. Many people don't even know that there are software programs you can use to reduce blue light that shines from your computer and may not even care. Night Shift is the perfect feature for most Mac users — for those that don't even use their computer after sundown or before sunrise or don't stare at a screen for 10 or more hours every day. It's a nice little addition to the Mac that can be set up once and then completely forgotten (in a good way), just like it works on the iPhone and iPad. It's simple, mostly effective, and doesn't intrude on other activities you do on your computer after dark. It's especially convenient that you can turn Night Shift on or off with just the click of a switch in Notification Center, too. In the end, it's all about preference. If you like how simplified Night Shift is, you're going to prefer it to f.lux, which has a lot more features but might be a little overwhelming to someone that just wants to add a pleasant warm hue to their screen before bedtime. Not everyone needs f.lux, but if, like me, you do want more customization and need even deeper blue light filtering late at night, Night Shift just doesn't hold a candle to f.lux (see what I did there?). Your thoughts? Do you prefer Night Shift to f.lux? Do you think Apple should add more customization features? Let's talk about our feelings in the comments. macOS Sierra macOS Sierra Review macOS Sierra FAQ macOS Sierra News Hub macOS Sierra Help Forum Reader comments Why f.lux is better than Night Shift on Mac (for now) 5 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating DannyJJK I think you're missing the point of Night Shift, the idea is that it's supposed to be simple and "just work" if you may. Night shift is subtle, and the slow transitioning is part of what makes you forget that it's even enabled. You can set it to come on when the sun sets, and the idea is that it stays on regardless of what you're doing because otherwise it defeats the purpose and you would start straining your eyes again if you started using certain apps that disabled it. The only exception I can think of to wanting to turn off Night Shift, is doing photo/video editing, where you need to be able to see the true colors, but for generally watching a movie you should keep it on because otherwise you'll be straining your eyes again. 0 11 hours ago Reply Lory Gil I'm not missing the point of Night Shift. It is a matter of preference, as I wrote in the last paragraph. "If you like how simplified Night Shift is, you're going to prefer it to f.lux, which has a lot more features but might be a little overwhelming to someone that just wants to add a pleasant warm hue to their screen before bedtime." 0 8 hours ago Reply HenryMelton Your article perfectly illustrates why I had to de-install f.lux. The ugly orange tint to everything was horrible. I played with the adjustments for a couple of weeks before I gave up. I much prefer Night Shift. It doesn't get in between me and the content on my screen. 0 11 hours ago Reply DannyJJK +1 0 6 hours ago Reply johnnygoodface Hi Lory I too loved f.lux, but there is (or there was, 6 months ago) an issue with Safari and Youtube. Here's a transcript of the problem a lot of users ran into before removing f.lux from our Mac: "I'm having an issue with bright colours in youtube videos seeming to max out in brightness and pixelate. This only occurs when flux is activated and youtube is in fullscreen. When I move my mouse and the top and bottom bars are visible, the problem goes away, and then immediately returns when they hide". Since f.lux is removed, all is back to normal with Safari and Youtube.

And that most of these core words are not nouns but verbs, pronouns, prepositions, etc.? Proloquo2Go’s research-based Crescendo™ vocabulary puts core words front and center for easy access. Core words combined with AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) best practices can greatly improve the user’s language development and communication skills. And this is not only for trained therapists; parents, siblings, teachers, friends and peers can and should participate too! Find out more at bit.ly/core-words. Growth of communication skills Proloquo2Go is one of the few AAC apps that covers all users, from beginning to advanced communicators. Its research-based Crescendo™ vocabulary offers three levels: Basic Communication, Intermediate Core and Advanced Core. It’s easy to switch levels within the same vocabulary while retaining your customizations. To make sure users reach their full potential, we recommend using a large grid size. With Progressive Language you can hide buttons showing only the most important ones, and reveal vocabulary in a developmental sequence as communication skills grow. Language development To support language development, we have created templates to keep core words on a consistent place throughout the vocabulary. This takes advantage of one of the ways we learn how to do things – motor planning. We have used these templates for the folders we created, but you can also use them to create folders yourself. In addition, Proloquo2Go offers full grammar support that is customizable to the user’s level. Easy customization We have pre-programmed Proloquo2Go with over 10,000 words, so you only need to do some fine-tuning to personalize the vocabulary. To add your own buttons you have access to more than 20,000 SymbolStix symbols or you can use your own photos. Quickly create new pages with our (activity) templates. Use the many accessibility settings like scanning for users with fine-motor challenges or Apple’s VoiceOver for users with vision impairments. Buttons, pages, navigation and access – it can all be customized with just a few taps. Feature highlights • Research-based vocabulary with three levels • 23 pre-programmed grid sizes • Core words located consistently throughout the vocabulary for motor planning • Quick and easy customization • Many accessibility features for users with fine-motor and visual impairments • Customizable grammar support for verbs, nouns, pronouns and adjectives • More than 60 natural-sounding free Text to Speech voices, including children’s voices Support We don’t leave you after purchase – our support team is available 7 days a week at [email protected] and always happy to help. To get started watch our free e-learning videos and have a look at our PDF tutorials. Our AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom provides you with resources for AAC implementation.

Discounts are available through Apple’s educational Volume Purchase Program. Joan Bruno’s Gateway to Language & Learning© vocabulary is available via in-app purchase (English only). What’s new in Version 5.0.1 This version contains bug fixes for the new backup feature. Version 5.0.1 also includes all the major new features recently introduced in Proloquo2Go 5.0: Search has been on the wish list of our community and of everyone at AssistiveWare for a long time. After thorough investigation of the different ways of implementing, we think it is even better than you expected. The new Search feature has been designed with a clinical perspective; not only will you see the path to the button you’re looking for, Proloquo2Go will also guide you through the path step-by-step. If the searched button is located in your Storage, it will automatically be added to the user’s vocabulary. To make sure the user’s language skills grow and the user doesn’t become stuck at the same vocabulary, we have introduced switching between levels and grid sizes within the same vocabulary in Proloquo2Go 4. Changing the grid size unfortunately isn’t ideal for the user. As locations of buttons move, the person needs to re-learn how to find words. To make sure users reach their full potential, we recommend hiding buttons and gradually revealing them as user skills grow. However, this is a time-consuming and complicated task. What if Proloquo2Go does this automatically? Our new Progressive Language feature helps to quickly and systematically hide and reveal buttons in a developmental sequence. The biggest nightmare for all professionals, parents and users: something happens to the app or device, and then realizing that a backup was never made. Fortunately, with Proloquo2Go 5’s automatic backups to Dropbox, Google Drive, and iCloud, saving a backup is one less thing you have to worry about! When any of these features are enabled, Proloquo2Go will automatically upload a backup whenever an internal backup is made. Note that an internet connection is required to transfer these backups. Other improvements: Adds Text to Speech to Proloquo2Go for Apple Watch, which allows you to not only show your message to your communication partner but also speak the message out loud New Tools Pop-up for easy access to actions like copy/paste, switching languages and Search Several small enhancements and bug fixes As always this update is free for existing users.

When competitors like Hoover and Samsung copied his ideas after his vacuum cleaner hit the market, founder James Dyson fought and won costly patent lawsuits, and instilled an “us versus them” attitude that still permeates the company.   (Lauren Fleishman / The New York Times)   By MARK SCOTTThe New York Times Sat., April 8, 2017 MALMESBURY, ENGLAND—When Michael Aldred joined the British home electronics maker Dyson two decades ago, he had a simple goal: to quickly build a robotic vacuum cleaner. But Aldred and his team kept running into roadblocks. Their first attempt, unveiled in 2001, was too clunky for James Dyson, the company’s founder. The next prototype involved creating a computer vision system that would allow the machine to skirt independently around furniture; it took more than a decade to perfect. As smartphones became everyday tools, Dyson’s robotics team again had to rethink the vacuum cleaner, adding Internet connectivity so the machine could send notifications — with a heat map of where it had cleaned — to a mobile device. After a nearly 20-year odyssey, the robot cleaner, priced at an eye-watering $1,300, finally hit stores worldwide last year. Read more: Article Continued Below Dyson’s new battery-powered vacuum drives sales upwardsEND Dyson has tried to make a better hair dryer. Will people buy it?END “At times, I really asked myself what I had signed up for,” Aldred said in an interview at Dyson’s rural headquarters near the border with Wales. “But James Dyson always told us to focus on the product. Everything else would follow.” Not many consumer electronics brands would spend almost two decades — and tens of millions of dollars — building a vacuum cleaner that retails for more than a mid-range laptop. But combining an almost obsessive eye for design and engineering, the privately held Dyson has cornered the unglamorous market of high-end vacuum cleaners, lights and hair dryers — and in the process bucked the technology truism that companies rarely make money in the difficult arena of hardware. Even as other hardware brands like Samsung, smartwatch-maker Fitbit and camera designer GoPro have struggled with physical products because of low-priced copycats and thin profit margins, Dyson has shown an uncanny ability to mint money. Its latest robot cleaner, which is selling briskly, exemplifies that and puts Dyson in rarefied company alongside Apple as one of the few tech companies worldwide to consistently profit from consumer gadgets. “It is extremely difficult to make money if you’re not in the premium segment of the market,” said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a tech consulting firm. “That’s what Apple and Dyson have done well — being best in breed for technology and industrial design.” Dyson said its pre-tax profits rose 41 per cent last year to $1.05 billion, while revenue rose 45 per cent to $4.2 billion, partly because of the weakened British pound. Dyson, 69, who founded the company in 1992, is worth about $8 billion. The company, with 8,500 employees split mostly between Britain and a factory in Malaysia, is growing rapidly in China, where the country’s emerging middle class remains eager to spend on designer goods, including expensive vacuum cleaners. “Asia is a huge growth area for us,” said Max Conze, Dyson’s chief executive, who joined from Procter & Gamble in 2010. “Five years ago, 85 per cent of what we sold was corded vacuum cleaners. Now, more than 80 per cent comes from new products.” Dyson is indeed moving beyond vacuum cleaners, hair dryers and air purifiers. The company said it would spend more than $2 billion on battery technology, machine learning and other high-tech wizardry to create new products, many of which remain under wraps behind tight security at its headquarters. The developments may include an electric car. Dyson bought a U.S. battery startup in 2015, secured a hefty British government grant last year to develop the vehicle concept and hired executives from Tesla and Aston Martin. Dyson officials deny that they are making an electric car. “We’re still heading into new areas where companies are well established,” said Jake Dyson, 44, the founder’s elder son, who rejoined the company in 2015 and is the most likely successor to his father. “We’re not afraid to try and beat them.” As with any company synonymous with James Dyson, it is often hard to separate Dyson the man from Dyson the brand. Tall, bookish and with a penchant for designer glasses, Dyson trained as an industrial engineer and dabbled in building things like boats and wheelbarrows before settling on vacuum cleaners by the late 1970s. Frustrated with how his machine worked, Dyson reused technology that mirrored how a cyclone forcefully sucked wind from its surroundings, eventually spending 15 years — and building more than 5,000 prototypes — before releasing his first vacuum cleaner in 1993. He initially licensed the designs to companies in the United States and Japan, but eventually decided to build the machines himself. “When we launched it, we were slightly terrified,” said Dyson, who had mortgaged his home and used his life savings to fund the project. “I’m not a businessman. I didn’t start a business, I started with an idea.” His professorial look, complete with cut-glass English accent, belies Dyson’s ruthlessness. When competitors like Hoover and Samsung copied his ideas after his vacuum cleaner hit the market, the entrepreneur fought, and won, costly patent lawsuits, and instilled an “us versus them” attitude that still permeates the company. At Dyson’s headquarters — chosen for its proximity to Dyson’s original workshop — employees remain tight-lipped, even among themselves, about their projects. During a tour of the company’s facilities, prototypes were covered in tarps while large areas of the open-plan offices were off limits. Photographs of engineers’ computer screens were prohibited, and machinery in some of the research labs was obscured with black trash bags. “It’s a little like a brainwashing atmosphere,” said Mario Cosci, an electronic engineer who joined Dyson six years ago. “When you work every day with people who are driven, you can’t swim against it.” Not everything Dyson has tried has turned to gold. In 2000, the company released a washing machine priced at $1,672, or double the cost of rival products. Despite positive reviews, Dyson pulled the plug five years later after failing to turn the machine into a profitable business. Now, the original washing machine prototype stands unloved in a corridor in one of Dyson’s research buildings. At many publicly listed companies, such a failure might have cost people their jobs. But at Dyson, where 14.5 per cent of annual revenue is earmarked for research and development, engineers took the mistake in stride and began diversifying into other products. For Steve Courtney, head of Dyson’s new products unit, that included moving into cordless vacuum cleaners in 2005, even though analysts said the machines would hurt sales of the company’s corded products. It also meant releasing bladeless fans four years later that borrowed heavily from Dyson’s vacuum technology — the product range was later extended to Internet-connected air purifiers. And when the company began selling $400 hair dryers last year, its mostly male engineering team not only learned to professionally blow-dry hair to understand how rival products worked, but also again copied the battery, motor and fan technology from Dyson’s existing products. “We may go through a lot of pain and it may take a lot of time, but then we can transfer what we develop into something completely new,” Courtney said. “We need big new areas, new markets.” Dyson’s ambitions have raised some eyebrows, particularly after it bought Sakti3, a Michigan startup specializing in solid state batteries, for $90 million in 2015. This technology could be more than three times as powerful — and significantly safer — than batteries used now in smartphones and electric cars. Dyson later claimed his company would invest more than $1 billion by 2020 to figure out how to mass-produce these solid-state batteries, although experts question whether Sakti3’s technology will ever go beyond the lab. “The community was surprised by the investment,” said Eric Wachsman, director of the Energy Research Center at the University of Maryland, who is developing a rival project. “No one knows if their technology will work or not.” Mark Taylor, Dyson’s research director, said the company was committed to making the battery technology work. None of this is stopping Dyson’s long-term planning. At the modernist campus of Imperial College London, Andrew Davison, a computer vision expert, has worked with Dyson on a $8-million research project aimed at helping robots better interact with the world around them. (Dyson separately sponsors a Design Engineering School at the British college.) Davison, an Imperial College professor, helped Dyson build the computer vision used in its robotic cleaner. His team is now combining that technology with machine learning and artificial intelligence so that one day, the company’s products may navigate the real world, just as its autonomous vacuum cleaner now scuttles around people’s houses. “We’re looking really far out,” Davison said. “Most of the work that we do is years away from being in an actual product.” Read more about: Apple Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Title. Filter. Pop! Clips review: Apple will make your Snap and Insta SO LIT By Rene Ritchie Thursday, Apr 6, 2017 at 11:03 am EDT 14 Comments Rene Ritchie has been covering the personal technology industry for almost a decade. Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Clips isn't your old a/v club's timeline editor. It's a new video sketching app from Apple that aims to give everything from your iMessage to your Insta a whole new level of lit. Clips will be out later for everyone on Thursday; in the meantime, check out our review below! Selfie mode. Ready for close-up. Live Titles. Hold to Record. "Hey. This. Is. Rene. And. I'm. Coming. To. You. Live." Elsie mode. Comic Book filter. Wide on other phone. Hold to Record. "Apple's. New..." Library. Hero shot. Hold to Insert. Overlay. Bold. "CLIPS APP!" Wide angle. #nofilter. Hold to Record Pinch to zoom. Soundtrack. Hans Zimmer. Epic. Share EVERYWHERE. There's a rush of adrenaline that comes from using Apple's new Clips app, available later on Thursday on iPhone and iPad. It's the same kind of rush as Snapchat Stories or Instagram Stories, but with less anxiety. That's because Clips isn't a real-time social network — it's a real-time video capture tool. Your video is instantly available to share but it isn't instantly shared, and it turns out that makes a huge difference in how you craft stories. And Stories. A post shared by Rene Ritchie (@reneritchie) on Apr 6, 2017 at 11:39am PDT Between Memories and iMovie Last year, Apple introduced Memories to Photos as part of iOS 10. It's proven incredibly popular. Not with the Insta or Snap crowd, but with the massive mainstream audience. And the features they want are simple: Automagic assembly and a play button. Sure, there are some rudimentary controls to tweak the pace and mood, but that's enough. Until it isn't. Memories is easy-as-play, but extremely limited for creative expression. Up until now, the only step up Apple offered for video was iMovie or Final Cut Pro X. Which are really — really, really — high steps. Despite making both far more approachable than many other editing apps if you're interested in quick-hit video making and sharing, they're still a ton of tool for people who only want a quick fix. iMovie is a huge step up... but a HUGE step up. Clips is designed as an in-between option: It's far more flexible than Memories, but far faster and easier to use than iMovie. It's interesting, given that iMovie was redesigned in 2008 because Apple's then-head of video apps went on vacation, got a bunch of footage, but had no fast way to assemble and share it. That's exactly what Clips does, but for a more modern — and far more social — era. As the name implies, instead of a traditional timeline, you've got a collection of super cool clips. You can then animate and annotate over them in a variety of ways to compose a short snippet, story, or message, before sharing them directly with whomever you choose — Twitter, Facebook, or your own Photos library. Just shoot it Clips opens on the live view so the world is instantly open to you. It's not Snap or Insta — it was made by Apple's video team and not iMessage or any new social team — but it feels that way. Which is great. Under the live view is a big red button that says "Hold to Record". (Imagine that — interface that's not just discoverable but has actual affordances!) And that's really all you have to do to get started. Frame what you want to shoot, hold down to get started, pinch to zoom in or out or pan around for dramatic effect, and let go when you're done. The video is square, which fits both the 16:9 of landscape and the 9:16 of portrait. It's weird if your background is in video but perfectly normal if you've cracked open the internet in the last few years. If all you want is plain vanilla video, Clips will give you that. If you'd rather rock candy sparkle crunch, hit up the filter button. You can use them live or apply them after you shoot. Some are subtle like the existing photo filters. Others are anything but — more Prisma than pastel. There's a lot to choose from: Noir Instant Transfer Fade Comic Book Ink Chrome None You can also add overlays, everything from shapes to bubbles to emoji. Bold type old Comic News Bold type Text arrow Label Circle Square X Check Arrow Simple arrow Bubble Speech bubble Time Handwritten Location Hello There are title cards if you want to set the stage, change the context, or simply The End things in classic style. You can edit the text but not the backgrounds or fonts. Cinema Cascade DIY hand-made Painted background Bold graphic Confetti celebration Graphic bold pattern Dimensional Bold news graphic Bokeh background Simple gradient Simple black It remains to be seen how often updates the filters and effects, though. Snapchat refreshes things constantly so it's impossible to get bored or feel stale. Insta, not so much. If Apple isn't pushing new, trendy lenses regularly, I'm not sure how well the launch set will age or scale. Titles go LIVE Social video tends to start with the sound off so people have learned to add captions to make sure their messages get across, even in total silence. Apple uses something akin to Dictation to grab what you say while you're filming, transcribe it, match it to the rhythm of your speech, and overlay it on your video. You can choose the style too, from smooth and flowing to smashing staccato. Two caveats: You have to be online to use them and you have enunciate-as-though-you-learned-to-speak-at-Julliard so they come through crystal clear. Bold bar Bold lower Three line lower One word lower One word center Bold center Simple lower None You can add video from your library, of course, and also still. Adding stills is clever — you hold down the same red button but, instead of recording video, it sets the length that the still is displayed. You can even pinch to zoom in and out as your adding it, and create your own Ken Burns-type effects. Plus, anything you can do to live video, you can do to inserted photos, including ditctating out Live Titles and adding effects. There's also a collection of background music, made some incredibly famous composers, and recorded so that it can fit your clips as perfectly as possible. Everything from fun and frolicking to big action blockbuster is included. If that doesn't work for you, you can also important music from your own library. If you're not happy with any clip in the sequence, retake it, rearrange it, or remove it. And when you're ready to share, Clips will recognize any Face you've set up in Photos or any name you've used from Contacts and offer that person up as an iMessage shortcut. Otherwise, you can save your clip out or send directly any app that supports a share extension. What's next? No app is perfect, let alone a 1.0, but Clips is deep and polished right out the gate. Still, I'd love to see things like rendered effects in the future, so I can add explosions, lightning, fire, snow, and other cool elements to the shots. Basic transitions would be great as well, so fading in or wiping across could help set the mood. Right now Live Photos can be inserted but you only get the still image, not the animated frames around it. And you can't export as a GIF, which admittedly would lose the audio but would be great anyway, because GIF. The other problem I have is more human: Because Clips can do more, I want to do more. Instagram and Snapchat are literally one press and send. There's less time for paralysis by analysis, perfectionism, pressure, or simple embarrassment to hold you back. Since Clips is more of a production, it feels like I have to produce more, and then I start making excuses as to why I don't really have time for that. I'm not sure how you solve for that, though. Clips: The Ultimate Guide. We're going through Clips and showing you how to use it, step by step: How to shoot photos and video with Clips How to record and edit Live Titles in Clips How to apply filters and effects in Clips How to add overlays and emoji in Clips How to place title cards in Clips Coming later today When I first heard about Clips I didn't know what to expect. Part of me feared it would be the digital equivalent of a "dad joke" — something that was trying desperately and failing miserably to be hip. Another part wondered why Apple didn't just wait for WWDC 2017 and bake this into Messages for iOS 11 — create even more awesome if exclusive features for blue-bubble friends. It certainly wouldn't have seemed out of place if Apple had. But Clips isn't that. It's more like Music Memos, Apple's recent song sketching app for iOS. It's a creative tool, albeit it an incredibly accessible and approachable one. I had a brief chance to go hands-on with Clips when it was announced and I've now been using it for about a week. I immediately liked it a lot more than I thought I would. Despite it being almost whimsically simple to use, it was deep enough and smart enough that I wanted to keep using it so I could get better at it. So that I could start learning the language. That's what I've been doing for the last week. And it's been FUN. More than fun, it's been incredibly useful. So useful, we're going to test it for all the social video we do around here and, if it pans out the way I think it will, shift our production completely to Clips. It's that good. And our Insta and Snap will be that LIT.

(AAPL) Promises New Mac Pro in 2018, New Pro iMac in 2017 Senior Apple executives promise new Mac Pro and iMac By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 4, 2017, 2:50 pm EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: Apple Inc.

Order Telegraphs Record iPhone 8 Sales (AAPL) Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 May Be Delayed Until November View All Posts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been taking heat from customers for ignoring its core, professional Mac users. The Mac Pro was last updated in 2013, and even then, its design alienated some. Apple held a rare turntable event with tech journalists to talk about the Mac. The company promises it has heard the complaints and it’s pledging an all new Mac Pro in 2018. Source: Apple To tide those power users over in the meantime, the company has goosed the specs of the existing model, is cutting some prices and it will introduce a new iMac aimed at pro users later this year. Senior Apple Execs Talk Mac Plans Apple brought a handful of tech journalists to its headquarters for a very rare, roundtable meeting with three of its senior executives: Phil Schiller (Senior VP Worldwide Marketing), Craig Federighi (Senior VP Software Engineering) and John Ternus (VP Hardware Engineering). The reason? To talk about AAPL’s desktop Mac roadmap. The company updated its MacBook Pro laptops late last year, but desktop Macs have languished with outdated specs sometimes for years. The Mac Pro was last updated in 2013, the iMac in 2015 and the Mac Mini in 2014. In the meantime, Windows PCs have received multiple upgrades and are equipped with processors and graphics cards that leave AAPL’s offering in the dust — despite the Mac premium price tag. And Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has emerged as a threat for the creative professional users who traditionally bought Macs, with its new Surface Studio all-in-one PC. The situation was bad enough that AAPL staged this event to assure everyone that it hasn’t abandoned the Mac or its professional users. It follows on comments from CEO Tim Cook that suggested APPL might be quietly working on a new Mac Pro. Apple Admits It Missed the Mark with Old Mac Pro Professionals who need a workstation-class desktop PC need a computer that can be upgraded. The Mac Pro AAPL introduced in 2013 looked cool, but its compact cylinder form factor limited upgrade options. Quoted by Mashable’s Lance Ulanoff (who was at the routable), Apple’s Federighi had this to say about the current Mac Pro: “The Mac Pro, the current vintage that we introduced, we wanted to do something bold and different. In retrospect, it didn’t well suit some of the people we wanted to reach … We designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner.” Phil Schiller then went on to say that AAPL engineers are designing an all new Mac Pro that supports upgradability and expansion. The Apple team admitted that this move came later than they would like, but promised that a new Mac Pro in 2018 will win back its professional users.

The range-topping 5.8-inch iPhone 8 (if Apple doesn't come up with a different name) may be pushed to an October or November release due to issues with the 3D sensing tech that's set to debut on it. The 3D sensing is Apple's augmented reality tech that will gather images from the front and back cameras and a dedicated infrared sensor to be used for 3D selfies and in games that will be developed to utilize it. That's only going to be present on this iPhone 8, and not on the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus (again, if those end up being the final designations), so those two will be able to follow the usual launch cycle. The source also states that only the iPhone 8 will feature an OLED display, while the 7s's will be LCDs as until now, which seems to the consensus between people in the know. Is Apple being a bit optimistic about the number of sales of the iPhone 8 with that order for 70 million OLED panels from Samsung? Smart Connector on the iPad Pro Meanwhile, the rumor for a Smart Connector on an iPhone marks a return, this time coming from an Israeli tech blog. The folks there say that it will enable the connectivity for VR/AR applications, as well as charging. Instinctively, we know that Apple will eventually get rid of all ports, but maybe we're not there just yet.

Some say it’s gotten massively delayed to November, while others contend it’ll be available in limited quantities in September but quickly go out of stock. A new report has now added its own take on the matter, favoring the latter scenario more than the former. As per Drexel Hamilton and longtime Apple analyst Brian White, the iPhone 8 will go up for pre-orders in September alongside the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. However, his contact strongly believes that the iPhone 8 will probably be delayed by several weeks, so deliveries won’t begin until much later. Still, units may come into stock in time for the December holidays. The main reason given for this postponement is that Apple is facing challenges related to its new 3D sensing technology. Also See: Australia’s suing Apple for bricking iPhones repaired by third parties White notes that the situation could improve in the future since it’s only April. He’s currently in Taiwan gathering information via a smartphone contact who’s following Apple’s supply chain data points. This lends a dash of authenticity to the assertion, though it can’t be taken as fact until more information emerges. All in all, the varying reports all agree that the iPhone 8 is facing manufacturing issues due to new technologies and could get delayed as a result. Customers will likely face a hard time getting their hands on one after it gets announced, whether that’s in September or much later.

The site says the slate will be released on April 14 and is bundling it with a couple of offers. Chief among them is a Rs 1501 discount on a pair of Apple Earpods currently going for Rs 2500. Moreover, Axis Bank Buzz credit card holders get an additional 5% off when purchasing the iPad (2017). Flipkart’s currently selling only the 32GB Wi-Fi and 128GB Wi-Fi + Cellular models of the slate at Rs 28900 and Rs 47900, respectively. Apple had previously announced a 32GB Wi-Fi + Cellular iPad (2017) priced at Rs 39900 as well. This version hasn’t been listed on Flipkart yet. There’s no mention of the 128GB Wi-Fi only iteration either, but it’ll probably be sold in India once availability spreads. Also See: Australia’s suing Apple for bricking iPhones repaired by third parties To recap, the iPad (2017) made its debut last month. It made headlines as the cheapest large-size iPad Apple had ever launched. The move could be seen as a way of reviving flagging iPad sales, targeting enterprises, educational institutes, and budget-conscious consumers with the promise of a brand-new iPad at a much lower cost than before. The iPad (2017) itself doesn’t break the mold when it comes to changes, closely resembling the iPad Air 2 in terms of looks and features. The biggest changes show up under the hood thanks to a bigger 32.4Wh battery and faster A9 chipset. iPad (2017) specifications at a glance: – OS: iOS 10 – Display: 9.7-inch, 2048 x 1536 pixels – Storage: 32GB/128GB – CPU: Apple A9 – GPU: Apple M9 – Battery: 32.4Wh – Camera: 8MP rear, 1.2MP front – Size: 240 x 169.5 x 7.5mm – Weight: 469g/478g – Connectivity: 4G, Wi-Fiac, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, GLONASS Once again, you can pre-order the iPad (2017) via Flipkart.

But a fake iPhone is easy to spot as it runs on an Android operating system. The new iPhone models have 3D Touch technology, giving users more convenience. The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus were also upgraded with a 12-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front camera.   On ANC's Future Perfect, the Manila Bulletin Tech Lab gave a preview of the new iPhone models, which probably makes up most Christmas wishlists.

The slate has gained prominence as the brand’s most affordable large-sized tablet. This has held true even after the iPad (2017) gets converted into INR, with the entry-level 32GB Wi-Fi only iPad (2017) being priced at Rs 28900. The cost maxes out at Rs 47900 for the 128GB Wi-Fi + Cellular variant. There’s also a 32GB Wi-Fi + Cellular version for Rs 39900, but that hasn’t shown up on Flipkart. Neither has the 128GB Wi-Fi only model. Flipkart’s currently offering a No Cost EMI scheme starting at Rs 3213 per month for interested buyers. Axis Bank Buzz credit card owners get the benefit of an extra 5% off. While Apple hasn’t officially stated when the device will be available in India, the e-commerce site says it’ll be released on April 14. The iPad (2017) is generally considered the spiritual successor to the iPad Air 2. It looks just like the latter and has quite a few specs in common, including the older model’s 9.7-inch size. Two areas where the newer slate stands out is in the processing and power department since it has a faster A9 chipset and 32.4Wh battery. Here’s a quick summary of the iPad (2017)’s specifications: – Display: 9.7-inch, 2048 x 1536 pixels – OS: iOS 10 – CPU: Apple A9 – GPU: Apple M9 – Storage: 32GB/128GB – Battery: 32.4Wh – Camera: 8MP rear, 1.2MP front – Size: 240 x 169.5 x 7.5mm – Weight: 469g/478g – Connectivity: 4G, Wi-Fiac, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, GLONASS Also See: iPhone SE drops down to just Rs 19999 in India Like we mentioned above, the iPad (2017) can be pre-ordered via Flipkart.

Apple filed a patent last year, which was unearthed by Mashable recently. Like all good digs, it brought back an old friend long thought dead. The patent is for a MagSafe-to-USB adapter. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY Assuming this is true, you’d be able to use your older MagSafe charge cords with your newer MacBooks. It certainly wouldn’t be the first legacy device turned into a USB-C dongle. MagSafe was apparently killed two years ago when Apple announced the new MacBook would have a USB-C charge port. Several other companies stepped up to provide alternatives, like the BreakSafe. The MagSafe is still available in Air, and some Pro I’ve been using Windows laptops for ten years, got my first (older) MacBook two months ago, and was immediately fascinated with the MagSafe cord. I’m not going to say which laptop I prefer, but the magnetic cord is definitely a step above the DC jacks I’ve been used to. Let’s just say I don’t see myself having to fix the MagSafe port with a screwdriver, pair of pliers,  and good luck.

Objective C code (since the objective-C dispatcher may use locks) and CoreFrameworks are also out. Microsoft don 8767 t typically document which, if any, of their APIs have real-time semantics. Five Steps to Creating Effective Screencasts - Thesis Regarding the applicability of POSIX priority inheritance mutexes on OSX, the following from the OSX Kernel Programming Guide page 78 may be relevant: Introductory Paragraphs - CommNet There 8767 s just one thing though. Writing correct lock-free algorithms has just gotten a lot more complicated. Yup. Your proud existing lock-free queues/ringbuffers/whatevers? Unless they 8767 ve prepared themselves for running on multi-core ARM, they are pretty much busted. Thesis Statements: Definition, Examples, and Guidelines The ideas in this post are not secret knowledge although they are in-part folklore. They come up periodically on all the audio development mailing lists I 8767 ve ever subscribed to and I know they come up elsewhere. The thing is, avoiding locks goes against best-practice advice in 8775 normal 8776 concurrent programming. As a result, sometimes things get confused. Here are two examples of bad advice I 8767 ve found online that illustrate the confusion: Overlay images and text callouts to compliment your spoken words. This helps reinforce your message. Insert pans & zooms to help focus the viewer. Add watermarks above the video track for branding and place transitionary slides between chunks in your topics to help keep your viewers organized. What follows is an explanation of each of these patterns with examples from real magazine articles to illustrate the explanations. Disclaimer: The papers provided by serve as model papers for students and are not to be submitted as it is. These papers are intended to be used for research and reference purposes only. It isn’t always the case, but for the purpose of this post I’ll assume that the audio API periodically requests a buffer of samples by calling a callback function in your code. In the above example your callback would have to compute each and every buffer in less than milliseconds. No matter how your code is invoked your software has to provide those samples within . Each and every buffer. No exceptions. Real-time does not wait for latecomers. Explain the interest in this topic.  What experiences have caused the writer to become interested (careful using 6st person!)? If after doing this exercise you find that you still have difficulty linking your ideas together in a coherent fashion, your problem may not be with transitions but with organization. For help in this area (and a more thorough explanation of the 8775 reverse outlining 8776 technique described in the previous paragraph), please see the Writing Center’s handout on organization. «Real time thesis example for argumentative essay» in pictures.

Ever since he's been given his own radio show on Apple Radio, Frank Ocean has been in something of a giving and overly creative mood. A few weeks ago he gave us his track 'Chanel', which promptly sent the internet into something of a collective meltdown. And that wasn't long after he appeared on Calvin Harris' surprise single 'Slide', which is destined to be played on every sunny day for the rest of the year. This week on his show, he gave his fans another gift, by playing his brand new track 'Biking', which features none other than Jay-Z and Ocean's Odd Future alumni Tyler, The Creator. Unlike the previous two tracks, 'Biking' hasn't been posted immediately to Spotify or other outlets, so the only way to hear it is via his Beats 1 Show here, or by folk nice enough to upload it to YouTube, as below.

Ya Libnan Lebanon News and World News Live from Beirut Featured News Lebanon News World News Opinion Business News Arts & Culture Sci & Tech Video Jared Kushner is the wrong person to reinvent government April 3, 2017 by yalibnan 1 Comment Trump’s son-in-law and Senior White House Adviser Jared Kushner at the White House in Washington, DC, on February 16, 2017.By Elizabeth Spiers On my first day of work as the editor in chief of the New York Observer, which had been acquired five years earlier by Jared Kushner, now the son-in-law and senior adviser to President Trump, I inherited an office and a desktop computer, both in fine but used condition. The computer was a recent-model Mac, but when I turned it on, it was inexplicably running Windows. I summoned our beleaguered IT guy to explain, and he informed me that it had belonged to Kushner, who liked the design of Apple products but preferred the Windows OS. “So he was basically using a $2,500 desktop as a monitor?” I asked. The IT guy shrugged. In retrospect, this tiny moment seems like a metaphor. Frankensteining two products you appreciate into one product you appreciate even more isn’t irrational; it’s even creative, in a way. On the other hand, why did the newspaper’s owner need a $2,500 monitor? How was it anything but a vanity object? That moment in 2011 came back to me when the Trump administration announced this past week that Kushner would lead the newly created Office of American Innovation to “infuse fresh thinking” into government institutions by utilizing the hard-won knowledge of great American business executives. The appointment was announced with a breathlessness that suggests no one has ever thought of it before, or that former great American business executives have never worked in government until now. But I worked for Kushner for 18 months as he tried to infuse a much smaller institution than the U.S. government with cost-cutting impulses from the commercial real estate world. And my experience doesn’t bode well for the Office of American Innovation. Not everything that works in the private sector is transferrable to the public sector — and even if it were, Kushner isn’t the best person to transfer it. I was the youngest editor in the Observer’s history and not an obvious choice, but Kushner liked me because I had been the founding editor of Gawker, which had grown into one of the largest indie media companies in the country, with more than 100 million unique visitors a month, and because I had an entrepreneurial and digital background. I also had started a Wall Street site he’d considered acquiring, and I was the only candidate he interviewed who asked to see the Observer’s financials before I would take the job. Almost 40 percent of my compensation was in the form of a performance bonus contingent upon hitting growth milestones while staying under budget. I was fine with being held accountable; I viewed the paper as a business, just as Kushner did. But I resigned in 2012 for a variety of reasons, chiefly that the president of the company and I couldn’t persuade Kushner to recapitalize the Observer — even though I reached all my numbers. When the paper had a profitable quarter for what I was told was the first time, Kushner floated the idea of layoffs to increase the margins, seemingly ignoring the fact that staff reductions would also reduce ad inventory by reducing content. A material part of what had been attractive about the job was the promise of expansion and growth. But we submitted business plans over and over again, and Kushner rejected them. He wanted the Observer to be cheaper to run, usually at the expense of growth and evolution, and he could not see the relationship between scale and profit — between risk and reward. (The White House did not answer a request from The Washington Post to provide Kushner’s perspective for this story.) He viewed investments in terms of opportunity costs. “Why should I put more money into the Observer when I could invest in a software company?” he would say. This is a legitimate question for any returns-driven investor. But news media doesn’t scale like software. You need people to produce content, at least until artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated and sensitive sources are willing to trust a bot. Why would you buy a newspaper if you expect it to scale the way software does? Why assume that media and software have the same risk profile and dynamics? Kushner would frequently point to a media company with a 60-person editorial staff and ask why our two-person desk wasn’t producing as many stories or as much traffic. Or he’d argue, bizarrely and incorrectly, that because Gawker started with one person, that meant you didn’t need head count to scale a media company. The Internet makes media more scalable, of course — distribution is unlimited and gained at little marginal cost. But that doesn’t mean a media company is just like Uber. That same obsession with the tech world permeates Kushner’s new project. Cost-cutting is important in situations where there is excess, but it is not what catalyzes evolution; if the point here is to make government more effective, not just more efficient, cuts alone won’t do it. The Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Kushner has roped into helping him with the new office — such as Apple’s Tim Cook, Salesforce boss Marc Benioff and Tesla founder Elon Musk — would be the first to tell him that scale is important, and that growth is often a function of prioritizing R&D investments. You prototype cheaply to get to a minimum viable product, but if you stop there, you’re in trouble. You have to reinvest, constantly. Lessons from Silicon Valley are even likelier to be misapplied in government than in media. Outside experts always groan that government institutions are running outdated systems that still rely on floppy disks, and that this is a function of some combination of government waste, idiocy and ubiquitous Luddite-ism. But a more logical explanation is that systems upgrades require appropriations, many of which have been gleefully slashed by Congress. There’s also the problem of government pay, and the fact that the private sector has financial resources that the government does not. Is it reasonable to expect speedy, high-quality upgrades when engineers are making $90,000 a year and implementations are often contracted out to the lowest bidder? The irrelevance of private-sector nostrums is likely to haunt Kushner’s new initiative. “They’re all outsiders and nobody knows anything about the government,” says Elaine Kamarck, who worked for Vice President Al Gore when the Clinton administration sought to reinvent government 25 years ago and who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “It will take these people a year just to figure out what they’re doing.” There are many government functions that have no analog in the private sector, she pointed out, like maintaining a nuclear arsenal. The Clinton administration’s efforts had some success, Kamarck said, because Gore’s group was staffed primarily by government people and civil servants who worked in concert with private-sector experts. “They also have to staff the government,” she said, pointing to the Trump administration’s failure to fill hundreds of crucial positions so far, leaving any ideas that the new organization produces without a government to execute them. Kushner’s claim to business knowledge, beyond admiring Silicon Valley, boils down to his work for his family’s commercial real estate company, which is hardly comparable to a government institution. And if industry dynamics are not transitive across the board, expertise isn’t, either. On that count, I don’t even know how to quantify Kushner’s expertise, anyway. Yes, he ran the company — which he inherited, not uncommon in New York’s dynastic, insular real estate world. But he was sure he had the goods. When I worked for him, I didn’t think he had a realistic view of his own capabilities since, like his father-in-law, he seemed to view his wealth and its concomitant accoutrements as rewards for his personal success in business, and not something he would have had in any case. To me, he appeared to view his position and net worth as the products of an essentially meritocratic process. Yet when Kushner Co. bought 666 5th Avenue for $1.8 billion in 2007, it was the largest transaction for a commercial real estate building in Manhattan’s history. Had the financing gone south, as it nearly did, it probably would have destroyed the family’s fortune. The building is heavily in debt now and in need of new investors to let Vornado, a real estate firm that owns 49.5 percent of it, get out; discussions with Chinese insurance giant Anbang fell apart this past week. Is this good dealmaking? I don’t know. If I were to assume any expertise I have is transitive to commercial real estate, I might argue that Kushner Co. overpaid for the building in the first place and overleveraged itself. But I also know what I don’t know, and I don’t make a living using vast amounts of debt to buy Class A office buildings in New York, so I will defer to people who do to opine. You could construe my evaluation as a reasonable observation by an outsider with a set of “fresh eyes,” but you’d be nuts to hand me a billion-dollar commercial real estate company because of it. When it became clear in 2012 that Kushner was conflating running lean with starvation, I submitted my resignation and left the Observer mostly on good terms with him, but I was disappointed. The company president resigned a few weeks later. Kushner eventually filled our positions with a family friend and his brother-in-law, the latter of whom had no media experience. He wanted outsiders to run the business — but loyal, compliant outsiders. A few days after Trump won the election, Kushner folded the now attenuated print newspaperand subsequently announced that the Observer, in its digital incarnation, was for sale. He probably would refer to it as a “lean” operation. I would say in his zeal to trim the fat, he began eliminating muscle and hacked into a few bones. I realize also, in retrospect, that he may never have intended to grow it or improve it. It was for him, in essence, another vanity object — like the beautiful, expensive desktop computer he used as a monitor. I worry that this new office will be more of the same: a vanity project, one that exists primarily to put Kushner in the same room with people he admires whom he wouldn’t have had access to before, glossing government agencies in the process with a thin veneer of what appears to be capitalism but is really just nihilistic cost-cutting designed to project the optics of efficiency. If the outside experts have good advice, it will be heeded only where it reinforces what the administration would do anyway. And anyone who volunteers to carry out the administration’s agenda may be handed wholesale control of an area of government where their domain expertise isn’t just low, but nonexistent. But I would like to be a fly on the wall when Kushner expresses his feelings to Tim Cook about the Macintosh operating system.

(New York Times photos) - + When Michael Aldred joined the British home electronics maker Dyson Ltd two decades ago, he had a simple goal: to quickly build a robotic vacuum cleaner. But Aldred and his team kept running into roadblocks. Their first attempt, unveiled in 2001, was too clunky for James Dyson, the company's founder. The next prototype involved creating a computer vision system that would allow the machine to skirt independently around furniture; it took more than a decade to perfect. As smartphones became everyday tools, Dyson's robotics team again had to rethink the vacuum cleaner, adding internet connectivity so the machine could send notifications -- with a heat map of where it had cleaned -- to a mobile device. After a nearly 20-year odyssey, the robot cleaner, priced at an eye-watering $1,000, finally hit stores worldwide last year. "At times, I really asked myself what I had signed up for," Aldred said in an interview at Dyson's rural headquarters near the border with Wales. "But James Dyson always told us to focus on the product. Everything else would follow." Sir James Dyson, who founded the company in 1992, is worth about £5 billion, or $6.2 billion. Not many consumer electronics brands would spend almost two decades -- and tens of millions of dollars -- building a vacuum cleaner that retails for more than a midrange laptop. But combining an almost obsessive eye for design and engineering, the privately-held Dyson has cornered the non-glamorous market of high-end vacuum cleaners, lights and hair dryers -- and in the process bucked the technology truism that companies rarely make money in the difficult arena of hardware. Even as other hardware brands like Samsung, smartwatch maker Fitbit and camera designer GoPro have struggled with physical products because of low-priced copycats and thin profit margins, Dyson has shown an uncanny ability to mint money. Its latest robot cleaner, which is selling briskly, exemplifies that and puts Dyson in rarefied company alongside Apple as one of the few tech companies worldwide to consistently profit from consumer gadgets. "It is extremely difficult to make money if you're not in the premium segment of the market," said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a tech consulting firm. "That's what Apple and Dyson have done well -- being best in breed for technology and industrial design." A vacuum's pick-up performance is tested. Dyson said its pre-tax profit rose 41% last year to £631 million ($785 million), while revenue rose 45% to £2.5 billion, partly because of the weakened British pound. Dyson, 69, who founded the company in 1992, is worth about £5 billion. The company, with 8,500 employees split mostly between Britain and a factory in Malaysia, is growing rapidly in China, where the country's emerging middle class remains eager to spend on designer goods, including expensive vacuum cleaners. "Asia is a huge growth area for us," said Max Conze, Dyson's chief executive, who joined from Procter & Gamble in 2010. "Five years ago, 85% of what we sold was corded vacuum cleaners. Now, more than 80% comes from new products." Dyson is indeed moving beyond vacuum cleaners, hair dryers and air purifiers. A hair dryer with cutaways in the hair science research lab at Dyson headquarters. The company said it would spend more than $2 billion on battery technology, machine learning and other high-tech wizardry to create new products, many of which remain under wraps behind tight security at its headquarters. The developments may include an electric car. Dyson bought a US battery startup in 2015, secured a hefty British government grant last year to develop the vehicle concept and hired executives from Tesla Inc and Aston Martin. Dyson officials deny that they are making an electric car. "We're still heading into new areas where companies are well established," said Jake Dyson, 44, the founder's elder son, who rejoined the company in 2015 and is the most likely successor to his father. "We're not afraid to try and beat them." As with any company synonymous with James Dyson, it is often hard to separate Dyson the man from Dyson the brand. Tall, bookish and with a penchant for designer glasses, Dyson trained as an industrial engineer and dabbled in building things like boats and wheelbarrows before settling on vacuum cleaners by the late 1970s. Frustrated with how his machine worked, Dyson reused technology that mirrored how a cyclone forcefully sucked wind from its surroundings, eventually spending 15 years -- and building more than 5,000 prototypes -- before releasing his first vacuum cleaner in 1993. He initially licensed the designs to companies in the United States and Japan, but eventually decided to build the machines himself. "When we launched it, we were slightly terrified," said Dyson, who had mortgaged his home and used his life savings to fund the project. "I'm not a businessman. I didn't start a business, I started with an idea." His professorial look, complete with cut-glass English accent, belies Dyson's ruthlessness. When competitors like Hoover and Samsung copied his ideas after his vacuum cleaner hit the market, the entrepreneur fought, and won, costly patent lawsuits, and instilled an "us versus them" attitude that still permeates the company. At Dyson's headquarters -- chosen for its proximity to Dyson's original workshop -- employees remain tight-lipped, even among themselves, about their projects. During a tour of the company's facilities, prototypes were covered in tarps while large areas of the open-plan offices were off limits. Photographs of engineers' computer screens were prohibited, and machinery in some of the research labs was obscured with black trash bags. "It's a little like a brainwashing atmosphere," said Mario Cosci, an electronic engineer who joined Dyson six years ago. "When you work every day with people who are driven, you can't swim against it." Not everything Dyson has tried has turned to gold. A 3D printed vacuum prototype. In 2000, the company released a washing machine priced at £1,000, or double the cost of rival products. Despite positive reviews, Dyson pulled the plug five years later after failing to turn the machine into a profitable business. Now, the original washing machine prototype stands unloved in a corridor in one of Dyson's research buildings. At many publicly listed companies, such a failure might have cost people their jobs. But at Dyson, where 14.5% of annual revenue is earmarked for research and development, engineers took the mistake in stride and began diversifying into other products. For Steve Courtney, head of Dyson's new products unit, that included moving into cordless vacuum cleaners in 2005, even though analysts said the machines would hurt sales of the company's corded products. It also meant releasing bladeless fans four years later that borrowed heavily from Dyson's vacuum technology -- the product range was later extended to internet-connected air purifiers. And when the company began selling $400 hair dryers last year, its mostly male engineering team not only learned to professionally blow-dry hair to understand how rival products worked, but also again copied the battery, motor and fan technology from Dyson's existing products. "We may go through a lot of pain and it may take a lot of time, but then we can transfer what we develop into something completely new," Courtney said. "We need big new areas, new markets." Dyson's ambitions have raised some eyebrows, particularly after it bought Sakti3, a Michigan startup specialising in solid state batteries, for $90 million in 2015. This technology could be more than three times as powerful -- and significantly safer -- than batteries used now in smartphones and electric cars. Dyson later claimed his company would invest more than $1 billion by 2020 to figure out how to mass-produce these solid-state batteries, although experts question whether Sakti3's technology will ever go beyond the lab. "The community was surprised by the investment," said Eric Wachsman, director of the energy research center at the University of Maryland, who is developing a rival project. "No one knows if their technology will work or not." Mark Taylor, Dyson's research director, said the company was committed to making the battery technology work. None of this is stopping Dyson's long-term planning. At the modernist campus of Imperial College London, Andrew Davison, a computer vision expert, has worked with Dyson on a £5 million research project aimed at helping robots better interact with the world around them. (Dyson separately sponsors a Design Engineering School at the British college.) Inside the office of James Dyson at his privately-held company's headquarters. Davison, an Imperial College professor, helped Dyson build the computer vision used in its robotic cleaner. His team is now combining that technology with machine learning and artificial intelligence so that one day, the company's products may navigate the real world, just as its autonomous vacuum cleaner now scuttles around people's houses. "We're looking really far out," Davison said. "Most of the work that we do is years away from being in an actual product."

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

And this is an important one indeed, because it fixed a big security flaw in the Broadcom Wi-Fi chips used in recent iPhone models. While Apple reveals little when the security update shows up as a notifications badge on your Settings app, the security flaw is a big one and could let attackers within Wi-Fi range inject and run all sorts over code on your smartphone. The security flaw was pointed out by Google Project Zero security pro Gal Beniamini. Beniamini in his detailed blog post, pointed out how it mainly impacts the iPhone 5 and newer models and even messes up Google Nexus devices; including some Samsung Galaxy models as well. The flaw is to do with Broadcom’s Wi-Fi SoC that is used in large number of mobile devices today, so there’s really no telling how widespread this issue really is. Beniamini’s research hints that it is indeed Broadcom’s WiFi SoC commenting that the chip “lacks basic exploit mitigations, such as stack cookies, safe unlinking,” and also doesn’t use the available memory protection features. For Apple’s iOS users, it’s just another quick fix that comes on time for all Apple devices. Google too released its Android update last week, but there’s really no telling how many have received or downloaded the patch thanks to interference from manufactureres and their custom software modifications. Apple on its support page states that the update is available for iPhone 5 and later, iPad 4th generation and later, iPod touch 6th generation and later. Oddly the update is also said to re-enabled some iCloud settings and features that were by default disabled. Apple told Tom’s Hardware that only a small number of iCloud users were impacted and that Apple will be sending across emails to all affected customers to make them aware of the issue. Apple also said that the change in iCloud settings was a problem that affected its users on iOS 10.3 and that the issue was fixed in iOS 10.3.1, which is the newest update.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Alleged armed robber shot; second suspect still at large Friday Apr 7, 2017 at 12:01 AM Apr 7, 2017 at 10:14 PM Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker APPLE VALLEY — An alleged armed robbery at a local pharmacy was foiled when one suspect was shot by the pharmacist Friday evening, authorities said, but a second suspect remains at large. The incident, which occurred at Jonathan’s Pharmacy in the 19300 block of Bear Valley Road, was reported just before 7 p.m. Friday. Details were scarce, but authorities confirmed one suspect was shot while another one remains outstanding. According to scanner traffic, the pharmacy was robbed at gunpoint by two suspects, described as black men wearing bandannas over their faces. The pharmacist opened fire and struck one suspect, Apple Valley Sheriff’s Sgt. Griffith said, but the second fled before deputies arrived. An employee on scene told the Daily Press she had just left work when a friend called to ask about what happened. “I thought it was a prank call at first,” the employee said. “I’ve heard about pharmacies being robbed before, but never would have imagined it happening here.” The employee said the pharmacy’s boss and two technicians were there when the incident occurred. They were OK but “very shaken up,” the employee said. The wounded suspect suffered “non-life-threatening” injuries, Griffith said, and was taken to a local hospital before being arrested. No further details on the suspect were available Friday night. According to scanner traffic, the second suspect fled the scene in a black 2000 Nissan Altima. No further details were available. The investigation is ongoing and anyone with information is asked to call Sheriff's dispatch at 760-956-5001.

T. Bradford03/27/2012 Starting today through Friday, eBay is in New York City giving the citizens a chance to experience the company’s Instant Sale process in person. Drop by The Ainsworth at 122 West 26th St between 6th and 7th Avenues from 6PM to 9PM each night to see how much your electronics are worth. There’s always a bit more buzz around trade-in programs when a new Apple product launches, though this service has been around since February of last year. And while many are all about trading in an old iPad to get a new one, there are plenty of other electronics that will earn you some cash. However, last night when I attended the eBay preview event and had them look up some of my devices, I was surprised that several of them werent in eBay’s database. The company will take anything for recycling purposes. But, if you want money, it has to be on their list. That got me wondering about the range of items all of the popular trade-in sites would take and how they compared on trade-in offers. I looked up several devices that I either have lying around or are the type of thing consumers might be ready to get rid of in favor of new models and looked them up on eBay’s Instant Sale, Amazon’s Electronics Trade-In, NextWorth and Gazelle. Product eBay Amazon NextWorth Gazelle iPad 2 Wi-Fi 16GB $200 $310 (Like New) $279 (Good) $241.50 (Like New)$230 (Good) $240 (Flawless)$220 (Good) Galaxy Tab (original) Wi-Fi 16GB $64.69 $89.00 (Good) $112.83 (Good) n/a HTC Evo 4G $53.75 $75.25 (Good) n/a $44 Kindle 2 $11.64 $21.50 (Like New) $19.59 (Good) n/a Toshiba Camileo S30 n/a $23.00 n/a n/a Samsung NC10 $35.77 n/a n/a n/a Dell XPS 15 $254.16 (Good) n/a $7.87 (Generic Dell w/ same specs) n/a Apple MacBook Pro 13-in (2009) 2.53 GHz Core 2 Duo 250GB $395.60 n/a $297 $448 Samsung Series 5 Chromebook n/a n/a n/a n/a As you can see from the table above, eBay usually offers the lowest trade-in value for smaller electronics, but does pretty well when trading in laptops. It also had most of the items I looked up in their database. Amazon consistently offered the highest trade-in for the products I could find. iPad 2 owners should probably jump on that $310 offer ASAP. Though it did well on smaller devices, I didn’t find any of the laptops I searched for, including the MacBook. NextWorth isn’t great for laptops that aren’t a MacBook of some kind. Their database didn’t have any specific Dell models, but let me give the specs of a generic Dell. As you can see, the result isn’t great. It wouldn’t even let me enter information for a generic ASUS or Samsung laptop. Gazelle only takes a few kinds of devices these days Gazelle is problematic because they no longer accept all items for trade-in, only a few narrow categories. It’s the place to go if you want to sell an Apple product, of course (not always at the best price) and cell phones from BlackBerry, Motorola, Samsung and HTC. That’s all. One thing I noticed about these sites is that the age of the product doesn’t matter as much as I thought. For instance, eBay has the Samsung NC10 netbook from 2008 in their database but not the Samsung Chromebook. No one would take the Chromebook for money. The Toshiba Camileo camera isn’t that old, either, yet only showed up in Amazon’s search. I would have assumed that laptop trade-ins would be very popular for these sites because, unlike phones and even tablets, they’re still usable and sellable long after they’re new and hot as long as the owner takes care of them. The other lesson I learned is that Apple products fetch some of the best prices, even those not in good working condition. I have a semi-broken iPhone 3GS (16GB) and when I looked it up I found that Gazelle would give me $30, NextWorth offered $42, and eBay valued it at a modest $20.25. For a broken phone. The Bottom Line is that if you have devices you want to get rid of, be sure to check across multiple sites. All of them give you a way to ship for free, so all you have to do is pack them up. It might be a little extra work to do so, but the prices vary enough that it’s worth it. Also, keep an eye out for in-person trade-in events such as the eBay Instant sale in New York and Target’s trade-in specials. In some cases you get your money right away and don’t have to wait. 12 Responses 03/27/2012 Doug Feirstein Reply If you would like an easy way to check across multiple sites, you can go to usell.com where we compare the different offers from different buyers. 10/11/2012 Margie Powers Reply Nextworth is currently advertising that you can double the regular referral rate of $10 to $20 for friends who sell back iPhones to them. I did this and had three referrals (besides my own) but when I received the confirmation emails it mentioned a “gift card” , not cash, for the first time. I scoured their web site, including the small print, and it doesn’t refer to gift cards. I left a message at the company and their rep called at first saying it was wrong and I would receive cash. Then she called back and said she was wrong, it would be a gift card. I asked what kind and she said I had a choice of three… iTunes, Starbucks and she didn’t know the third. (And you cant get that info on their site until you have a code that you only receive after the deal is done.) That is not useful to me and I am disappointed that they are pulling this “bait and switch” at this stage. I will not follow through the selling of my phone and I will contact my three referrals and recommend they do not do business with this company. After reading more reviews on values being deflated after sending in the phones, I am wary of this also now. 10/11/2012 Lee Reply I started BuybackBoss.com. We payer higher than any other buyback website. We specialize in iPhones and Blackberries. 10/14/2012 William Reply Cool. Love your site. Why do you offer higher prices than the other big buys? 10/14/2012 Lee Reply We offer higher prices because we are a small company and we have small expenses as compared to the “Big Guys”. Since we are small and new, we are offering the highest available prices to attract customers and a following. -Lee 10/13/2012 mike Reply Ebay instant sale is a scam operation. NEVER buy or sell anything with these thieves! Gazelle, Nextworth are reputable. Sent a practically new macbook air, itouch, nanos to them for an “offer” of close to 1k and they respond that the macbook doesn’t have a HD or OS and countered with an offer of $51. Are you f-ing kidding me? Total value of my goods went down across the board. Offer reduced to $200 for everything. I said no thanks and to return everything. Of course, they managed to scratch up my mint itouch when shipping it back so it actually did actually lose value! This whole scam fronted by some shady outfit called AllTechWholesale, but ebayers don’t know that up front until they receive your goods. Just google their list of complaints. Ebay should be ashamed to be in bed with these crooks and I’m going to make sure as many people knows about them as possible to save others from such rip-offs. End story is, I sold the same goods to Gazelle for the exact offer amounts even though I had to take a hit on the itouch since I couldn’t in good faith claim it was in “perfect” condition after the con artists at AllTechWholesale were done with it. 10/16/2012 FR Reply I just tried to sell my iPhone 4 to Nextworth only to have them renege on their offered amount saying my phone was “damaged.” It was in perfect condition so I had them send it back. Gazelle offered to take my phone for $100 more than Nextworth…I sent it in and my check is on the way! BEWARE OF NEXTWORTH! 12/24/2012 Lee Lowden Reply Mr. Bradford, Great article, but next time I would focus on the smaller buyback companies that pay more cash for used devices. My company, Buyback Boss pays way more cash for used iPhones than the companies that you listed within your article. Please check out my website: http://www.BuybackBoss.com – I would loved to be featured in your next article. Thanks! Lee 07/20/2013 gabrielle barone Reply All of these big companies pay PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR, and then resell on ebay for hundreds upon hundreds of dollars more. Mail in companies like gazelle set things up on their website to allow them to plausibly lower the quoted price for your wares, once they receive it – a classic bait and switch scam which further bolsters their corporate profits. Impossible to get the word out because these companies spend fortunes to bolster their reputation. 09/05/2013 Phil Reply NextWorth is a scam. They told me something I sent into them was broken when we both knew it wasn’t, then they wouldn’t return it to me and therefore got to sell the item for 100% pure profit. There are negative reviews everywhere on the internet about NextWorth and there’s a reason for that. 04/28/2016 Kelly Scarbro Reply Just came across this write up, SUPER! Thank you for a wealth of information. 04/07/2017 weheartit.com Reply I got this site from my pal who shared with me about this web page and now this time I am browsing this web page and reading very informative posts at this place.

"We call it 'the bid underneath,'" the "Mad Money" host said. "It's a key part of the amazing sector resilience that explains this market's ability to hang in there even on days like today with a lot of bad news. And frankly, I find the bid underneath in this market astonishing." Despite negative reports of Syrian airstrikes, allegedly tense U.S.-China talks, and weaker-than-expected employment numbers, chipmakers' stocks, especially of those serving Apple devices, roared to new highs. One such company is Skyworks Solutions, a radio and mobile semiconductor play that hit a 52-week high on Friday. Another is Qorvo, which spent 2016 trading sideways and has spent nearly every day in 2017 ticking up. Watch the full segment here: show chapters Cramer tracks 'the bid underneath' to explain why the market rallies on bad news    Friday, 7 Apr 2017 | 7:17 PM ET | 04:22 Or take Apple sound system play Cirrus Logic, which cut its guidance in its last earnings report but has been "a straight line up" since March began, in Cramer's words. What baffles the "Mad Money" host is that the move is unfounded, or at least not based on any positive news in the semiconductor space that would fuel a typical rally. No sellers have emerged even amid the downpour of usually market-rattling reports, so those tired of waiting for their favorite stocks to come down have finally given in and bought up. "It's just that some portfolio managers just have been waiting and waiting and waiting for these stocks to come down, bidding underneath, as we say on the trading desk, and they aren't being hit, and they can't take it any more so they're reaching for all of them at once," Cramer said. And the semiconductors aren't the only ones with hidden bids, according to Cramer. He has spotted bids underneath in the housing stocks, railroad plays, and supermarket names like Kroger and Whole Foods. "The bid underneath, and the reach, are classic components of a true bull market," Cramer said. "Another reason why this market, for all its flaws, is a lot more resilient than it looks to the naked eye." Questions for Cramer?

By Michael Kan U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Apr 7, 2017 6:33 PM PT Credit: Michael Kan More like this Hackers threaten to wipe millions of Apple devices, demand ransom Leaked iCloud credentials obtained from third parties, Apple says The 10 biggest hacks, breaches, and security stories of 2016 Video Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key A group of hackers who claimed to hold millions of iCloud accounts for ransom said on Friday they'd been paid. But one bitcoin expert says that's bogus.  The Turkish Crime Family grabbed headlines last month by claiming they had the stolen login credentials for more than 700 million icloud.com, me.com and mac.com accounts. They demanded increasing ransoms from Apple while threatening to wipe the data from devices connected to the affected accounts if it did not. On Friday, the hackers tweeted that they had been paid US$480,000 in bitcoin. As proof, the group posted a link showing a transaction on Blockchain.info, a popular bitcoin wallet.   [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] “We were told by our negotiator that we have come to a final agreement with Apple,” the hacking group tweeted prior to receiving the payment.   However, the hackers actually tweeted out a transaction to an "internal treasury operation at a bitcoin exchange," according to Jonathan Levin, co-founder at Chainalysis, a provider of anti-money laundering software for bitcoin. "We have positively identified that the inputs and outputs of that transaction are controlled by a single bitcoin exchange," Levin said in an email. The transaction was part of an internal money deposit process at a Korean bitcoin exchange, he said. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment. The tech giant has said that it never suffered any such breach. The stolen login credentials that the hackers obtained appeared to come from breaches at other third-party services, Apple said. Security researchers suspect that's true, and they believe the Turkish Crime Family has exaggerated its hacking claims.   The hacking group also didn't respond to a request for comment.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website six  ×   =  36 Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Saudi Aramco is reportedly worth over $2 trillion, twice the market cap of Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL). Aramco controls 20% of the world's proven oil reserves, or 267 billion barrels of oil, and that has investors eager to buy Saudi Aramco stock. They'll get their chance soon. The world's biggest oil company is planning an initial public offering soon, and it's going to break records. But investors need to approach the Aramco IPO with caution. The big numbers gloss over some serious issues with the company… The Saudi Aramco IPO is projected to be the largest IPO of all time. The company is expected to offer 5% of the company for public sale, and with a total valuation of $2 trillion, the IPO will be worth a record-smashing $100 billion. That's four times bigger than the current record holder, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA), which debuted at a whopping $25 billion. In fact, Saudi Aramco's market cap is very likely to be larger than Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM), Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (NYSE ADR: RDS.A), BP Plc. (NYSE:BP), and Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX), combined. Trending: The Best Stocks to Buy (and When to Sell) for Mega-Profits in 2017 But, at one point, a Saudi Aramco stock offering was supposed to happen already. The Saudi Arabian IPO date has been pushed back by more than a year since it was first announced in January 2016. That's because the Aramco IPO is much more complicated than a typical IPO, and it means potential investors need to pay careful attention to what's going on… When Can I Buy Saudi Aramco Stock? The Saudi Aramco IPO is expected to be the biggest of all time, but its massive size is also making the IPO process difficult. It also means there's no concrete date for the IPO. The company has had to hire firms to manage the IPO, from advisors to underwriters. This is a standard part of a company going public, but the size of Aramco has made the competition fierce. The Aramco IPO could produce over $1 billion in fees for participating banks. Plus, winning a spot in the IPO process could mean future business with the oil giant. "Every bank in the world is going to want to have a role in this," reported the Financial Times in January. That's why it was a shock when Aramco chose a small boutique investment bank to advise on the IPO. Moelis & Co. (NYSE: MC) beat out investment banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) to sign the coveted agreement. But Aramco went with a more expected approach when it chose its underwriters. Saudi Aramco chose JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and HSBC to underwrite its IPO. That means these Wall Street titans will be promoting the stock and committing to buy shares of it if the public doesn't. But the next step in the process for Aramco will be deciding which stock exchange to list the company on, and that's a much bigger hurdle to leap. Must Read: Five Double-Digit Dividend Plays to Secure Your "Second Salary" Aramco will list some shares on the Saudi Arabian stock exchange, but it's also looking to list shares on a major stock exchange with global reach. The company has short-listed exchanges in New York, London, or Hong Kong. But major exchanges like these have public reporting requirements that could open the company up to the public in a way it has never done. If the Saudi Aramco IPO occurred on a stock exchange in the United States, the firm would need to follow U.S. fiduciary laws regarding transparency and public auditing. It would also have to form a board of directors that could take some power away from the Saudi royal family. Money Morning Global Energy Strategist Dr. Kent Moors notes that Saudi Arabia was never keen to sell Saudi Aramco because it could mean having to reveal information about the oil fields it would rather keep to itself. It also means the company will have to disentangle itself from the government. Just last week the Saudi government took a step toward that by announcing it was slashing the tax rate on Aramco from 85% to 50%. That makes Aramco stock more attractive to investors, but shows how deeply reliant the government was on the oil company. The government is expected to make up the difference through dividend payments once the company goes public. But the biggest hurdle to the IPO might be convincing investors it's a good stock to own in the first place… Saudi Aramco Stock Might Be Riskier Than You Think Join the conversation.

Now I need to sell one, and I figured the newest one with the least amount of hours and the most warranty left would be the easiest to sell. So I'm offering this lovely F5 camera body with factory 4k and the very useful ProRes option (a $2,000 option) included. The camera is only 4 months old, so you have plenty of warranty left. And it currently only has 45 hrs. If you only need the body, you can have it for 10k. Do you want a viewfinder to go with it? You can have the DVF-L350 LED for an additional $2,000. Or if you prefer the DVF-EL100 OLED, it would be $3,000. Yes, the camera new is on sale now for 13k with the LED and 14k with the OLED. But that does not include this very useful $2,000 ProRes option, which I put in all my cameras because clients love having it. (The ProRes and DN x HD Codec Board from Sony provides additional support for Apple ProRes and DNxHD with the PMW-F55, PMW-F55LIVE, and PMW-F5 CineAlta cameras. This codec board supports ProRes 4444 12-bit Full HD, ProRes 422 (HQ) 10-bit Full HD, ProRes 422 10-bit Full HD, DNxHD 220x 10-bit Full HD, and DNxHD 145 8-bit Full HD at a variety of frame rates.) Last but not least, for an additional $3,000, you can have the Sony Documentary Dock, a $5,000 option (not including the top handle or the mic holder). So, you can have: body with ProRes option for 10k body with ProRes option and LDC 12k body with ProRes option and OLED 13k body with ProRes option and OLED and Documentary Dock for 16. last but not least, if you decide to go for the 4th option, the full package, and you have good credit (Sony will determine that, not me) you can just take over the Sony 0% lease of 20 payments at $800 a month. It's up to you how you want to do it. Local examination encouraged, I am in Los Angeles/Hollywood area.

Steward Bank CEO Dr. Lance Mambondiani delivered a keynote address encapsulating key statistics and highlighting areas that senior management should address in order to respond to the demands of the digital age. “As long as we are not evolving our businesses to the tune of global trends, we are businesses of the past, not of the future. We have to evolve or die,” he emphasised. With two companies in a race to become the first trillion dollar business: Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and Apple, the digital age is not slowing down. advertisement Every business should be concerned with ‘speed to market’ and ‘costs of distribution’, service, and getting the product to the market. Digital platforms are valuable in the way they allow on-boarding of customers at a cheaper cost. Dr Mambondiani quoted Bill Gates as saying “banking is necessary. Banks are not,” asserting that legacy banks are forced to evolve due to market pressure and innovations. Fintech is competing with traditional banks, service by service. Banking is a land of digital opportunities, and while every business will be tested as it evolves in the digital space, it is more important to adapt according to customer needs. “We are not living in the digital ‘era’ because digital is now. Digital is the present and it’s here to stay,” he concluded. Digital Future 2017 will present key speakers from prominent organisations on the continent, further elaborating on ideas introduced at the CEO Megabyting Session. Tumi Chaka, an Analytical Lead at Google, will present experience working in data analytics to highlight best practice analysis techniques for brand marketers. His expertise enables businesses to leverage their data and derive strategic insights for marketing strategies. Sonia Sengupta, Marketing Executive for MNet’s Eastern and Southern African channels, will bring insights from her experiences as a Market Researcher for GfK, specialising in telecoms, consumer electronics and gaming sectors for the Angolan, Mozambican and South African markets. Kalay Maistry, Business Unit Head at Magna Carta Reputation Management Consultants (South Africa), will present specialised knowledge drawn from over 20 years’ experience as a journalist and broadcast technical advisor. With experience as a Southern African correspondent at organisations such as Al Jazeera English, SABC, Talk Radio 702, ETV among others, Maistry will provide invaluable knowledge for media practitioners. A host of local content producers and distributors will also be in attendance sharing their insights to local market dynamics and how best practitioners can get their hands wrapped around doing business online in Zimbabwe. share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: Agrippa Mugwagwa, Digital Future 2017, Lance Mambondiani, TBWA ZImbabwe, Vincent Kahiya Follow us on Facebook Techzim Previous Post « U-Report Zimbabwe: Leveraging SMS for research Next post #EcoCash zero rates merchant payments on Thursdays, Government imposes 5% health tax on Telecoms Operators Ep22 » Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

We’re not even a quarter-way through the year and Samsung has already shown us three phone options: the surprisingly impressive Galaxy A5 and now the Galaxy S8 and S8+. The Samsung Galaxy S series are high-end smartphones with equally high price tags, hitting the plus $1,000 CAD range when not purchased on a contract in Canada. The mid-range Samsung Galaxy A5, released back in January 2017, is almost half that cost at $525. Many consumers hear “Galaxy S” and immediately jump for Samsung’s latest flagship offering. Samsung’s S series is synonymous with high-quality Android devices and is often compared directly with Apple’s iPhone. However, just like the iPhone, each year the price of Samsung’s S Series Galaxy devices increases. The same $500 spent years ago on a Galaxy S4 will not even get you half way to purchasing an S8. If you can’t shake yourself away from the grip of the Galaxy S series, or Samsung in general — MobileSyrup still contends that the $599 OnePlus 3T is one of the top and most affordable high-end android devices out there — Samsung’s roughly a year old, but still very current, the S7 is also a viable option. So lets take a look at the S8, S8+ A5, S7, and examine each device’s strengths and weaknesses. After looking at the above technical specifications comparison chart (you can find it above), it might appear to some that the A5’s 16-megapixel camera is better than shooter feature in both the S7 and S8. However, the 12-megapixel camera featured in the S8 has a smaller aperture, coming in at f/1.7, allowing the phone to take better pictures in low-light than the A5’s f/1.9 aperture lens. It’s also likely that Samsung saves some of the magic that powers the company’s highly-regarded image processor for its key flagship devices. The S8’s 8-megapixel front facing camera is also the first ‘selfie’ camera with auto focus, allowing for better front-facing camera quality than the A5’s 16-megapixel camera. The S7 has the same dual-pixel 12-megapixel rear-facing camera as the S8. However, like the A5, the S8’s front-facing selfie camera beats out the S7 if we’re focusing purely on megapixels. The 8-megapixel front facing camera is superior to the 5-megapixel front-facing camera on the S7. For the simple reason of it having the same f/1.7 aperture, additional megapixels and auto focus functionality. The A5 and the S7 also may have an edge when it comes to battery life when compared to the S8. The S8, A5 and S7 all feature 3,000mAh batteries, though with the smaller display featured in the S7 and A5, these devices will most likely last longer than the S8 (you could also say the same thing about the S7 Edge to a lesser extent). Don’t be alarmed though, the S8 does have a new 10nm chipset designed to improve improve the smartphone’s battery performance. According to various publications, the S7’s battery beats out the A5’s by at least six hours of usage, with a more power efficient processor and slightly smaller screen being the likely reasons. The S8’s display measures in at 5.8-inches, while the S8+ measures 6.2-inches. Samsung isn’t giving their consumers very many options with their S series phones this year. 5.8-inches might be too large for the small hands of many consumers and the 5.2-inch A5 or 5.1-inch S7 could be a better fit for many people who prefer smaller phones. The A5 is an impressive device and despite its mid-range categorization, it has no problems multi-tasking and performs burdensome functions without any sort of crashing or overheating. No one will disagree Samsung’s S8 and S8+ are better phones than both the S7 and A5, however, you may not need everything the S8 offers. In that case, value-minded buyers could do a lot worse than look to the Samsung S7 for $100 on a two-year contract or less (with most carriers). For those consumers that don’t want to be tied down, the A5’s $525 price tag looks more favourable than the $780 cost of the S7. If you’re not looking to spend too much money and don’t want or need a phone with Bixby or an iris scanner, than the S7 or the A5 could possibly be the Galaxy smartphone for you.

Credit: Getty By Daniel Kreps 2 days ago More News Five Ways Occupy Wall Street Is Still Fighting Inside DEA Ban on Marijuana Extracts All Stories David Peel, the subversive New York folk singer, street musician, counterculture icon and one-time John Lennon crony, died Thursday at the age of 73. Related Poll: Fighting Marijuana Legalization Is Bad Politics New poll suggests candidates who are pro-states' rights as far as marijuana is concerned may connect with key primary voters Peel's death came less than a week after the artist suffered a massive heart attack, Peel's former bandmate Jeff S. Levy told Billboard. The singer, born David Rosario, first came to notoriety in the late Sixties when he and his band the Lower East Side – named after the New York City region where they routinely performed on the streets – scored an offbeat hit with "I Like Marijuana," off the group's 1968 debut Have a Marijuana. That album, recorded live on the streets of New York, also featured counterculture anthems like "Up Against the Wall," an ode to the anarchist group, and "Show Me the Way to Get Stoned." Peel and the Lower East Side's first studio album, 1970's The American Revolution, also boasted pro-pot tracks like "Legalize Marijuana" and "I Want to Get High," but also examined more social issues of the era, including his anti-Vietnam War stance ("I Want to Kill You," "Hey, Mr. Draft Board") and a song about "bad cops" ("Oink, Oink"). A year later, while Lennon and Yoko Ono walked around Union Square Park after relocating to New York, the pair witnessed one of Peel's street performances. Lennon became fascinated by Peel, with the former Beatle saying of the folk singer, "He can't sing, or he can’t really play. Picasso spent 40 years trying to get as simple as that." Lennon would soon sign Peel to Apple Records, and along with Ono, produce Peel and the Lower East Side's 1972 LP The Pope Smokes Dope. Lennon also took part in Peel's street performances as well as other higher-profile appearances, including a spot at 1971's John Sinclair Freedom Rally and a pair of performances on The David Frost Show, where Lennon played on a tea-chest bass: Lennon also immortalized his first encounter with Peel in the first verse of "New York City," a track off 1972's Some Time in New York City. "Up come a man with a guitar in his hand / Singing, 'Have a marijuana if you can' / His name was David Peel / And we found he was real," Lennon sang. "He sang, 'The Pope smokes dope every day' / Up come a policeman, shoved us to the street / Singing, 'Power to the People today.'" The Pope Smokes Dope was the lone album Peel recorded for Apple, but the folk singer continued to pay tribute to Lennon and the Beatles throughout the Seventies, first with 1977's Bring Back the Beatles (featuring Peel's punk-fueled rendition of "Imagine") and then 1980's John Lennon for President, an album released just months before the Beatle legend was murdered. Peel continued to be a prolific performer in subsequent decades. In 1994, Peel was recruited to pen the campaign theme for Howard Stern's gubernatorial run in New York, with the singer performing "Howard Stern for Governor" on the radio show: Recently, Peel resurfaced as a street musician during the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York, where he was a regular at the Occupy stronghold of Zuccotti Park; he refashioned his "Up Against the Wall" into "Up Against the Wall Street" for the protests. Peel also recorded a song titled "I Can't Breathe," a response to Eric Garner's death. “A lot of people come up to me and say, ‘Peel, I thought you were dead,'" he told the New York Times in 2012, adding that he would continue to perform in public "until the day I drop dead and go to rock & roll heaven."

Lisa Felepchuk - Apr 6 Facebook Twitter Pinterest + Linkedin WhatsApp Email SHARE THIS Facebook Twitter Pinterest Linkedin WhatsApp Email We loved Melanie Griffith alongside Sigourney Weaver in the ’80s classic Working Girl. The big hair and big-shouldered business suits made us long for a spot on the corporate ladder in the Big Apple, and Griffith’s character Tess McGill was ambitious and stylish on screen. But the face of the 30-year-old actor we knew in the late ’80s has changed. Obviously, right? Age comes for us all. But Griffith, living within the social pressure cooker that is Hollywood, opted to undergo cosmetic procedures that she would come to regret. In a new interview with Porter magazine, the actress opens up about bad work she had done by a doctor. “I didn’t [realize] until people started saying. ‘Oh my god, what has she done?!'” Griffith tells Porter magazine. “I was so hurt, I went to a different doctor and he started dissolving all of this s— that this other woman doctor had put in. Hopefully, I look more normal now.” The now 59-year-old had been moving from “aging gracefully” into “plastically preserved” territory. It’s a look we’ve seen on more than a few Hollywood faces; too much filler in the cheeks creating unnatural puffiness, and a heavy-handed injection of Botox in the brow that raises the eyebrows into a permanently surprised look. To a degree, it can look good — and more importantly, if it makes you happy then all the power to you — but sometimes we take it too far. Here’s Griffith in 1990, at the age of 33. Getty Images And here she is in late 2015. GettyImages And now, here she is in the latest issue of Porter looking fabulous, healthy and beautiful. Annabel Mehran/Porter magazine We think the more natural look suits Griffith well, and we hope the eligible bachelors of Los Angeles agree. In the Porter interview, Griffith also admits it’s been ages since she’s has a night on the town with a suitor. “I’m shy with men now, very reticent … nobody has asked me on a date [for almost two years],” she says. This kind of story from a woman we respect is great to read — it’s brave of Griffith to speak about such personal issues, and we’re all a little better off for it.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars APPS Some people are saying Facebook Messenger looks like iMessage now Jordan Novet@jordannovet April 7, 2017 5:53 PM Tags: Apple, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, iMessage, messages, Messenger Above: Messenger now. Look familiar? Yeah. Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Yesterday Facebook made a pretty significant update to its Messenger app for messaging and voice and video calls: It finally started letting people access its M virtual assistant in conversations. But there’s more to it than that. Facebook also adjusted the design of the app in a way that makes Messenger look like Apple’s Messages app, which uses the iMessage protocol. Facebook’s head of Messenger, David Marcus, even showed off the redesign in the course of announcing the M news on his page, but what dominated the headlines yesterday was M, not Messenger’s iMessageness. What’s changed is that Messenger has shrunk down the default size of the text box that you tap on when you want to type out a message to someone and given it an oval outline. It’s now less than half as wide as it was, because there are now buttons on the left of the text box for using the camera, sharing a photo, or recording an audio message. It expands once you start typing, and from there you can hit the new right arrow button to jump back to the photo and audio message buttons. Previously, you could get to those options and others with just one tap while composing a new message. So now, basically, it takes just a bit longer to send a photo or video. In Messages for iOS 10, you’ve had a rounded and miniaturized text box, along with short cut buttons to the camera, your heartbeat, and new iMessage Apps. Once you jump into the text box, it expands just like the new version of Messenger, and you can tap a right arrow icon on the left side — like on Messenger — to get back to those camera, heartbeat, and iMessage App buttons. Above: Messages for iOS 10. Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat On Twitter, people are definitely noticing the similarity.

Now, it has its sights set on poaching top talent from life sciences and health care. Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have stressed in the past that Google will not become a health care company, in part because of the regulatory complexity associated with the field. But today, three of Alphabet's "Other Bets" are focused on the $3 trillion sector. Both of its venture arms, GV (formerly Google Ventures) and CapitalG (formerly Google Capital) are also investing in the space. Sidewalk Labs is perhaps the most surprising. The Alphabet subsidiary, which aims to use technology to solve "big urban problems," this month posted new job listings for health care positions, including engineers, a chief health officer (a primary care physician) and a head of community health for an effort called "Care Labs." Not much has been shared publicly about Care Labs, aside from a Medium post that spells out a big vision to imagine "how care delivery might look in the digital era." Alphabet's Calico, a drug development shop focused on longevity, and Verily, which was Google's life sciences arm, and have also hired heavily from life sciences and health care. The company's star talent in the field so far includes Arthur D. Levinson, former CEO of Genentech and an Apple chairman, who is Calico's CEO; Tom Insel, the former head of the National Institute of Mental Health, who is at Verily; and Jessica Mega, a star cardiologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, now at Verily. Alphabet is currently looking to hire computational biologists, robotics experts and top academic researchers, which are among the most competitive positions to hire. Competitors in the life sciences industry have mixed feelings about Alphabet's recruiting. "Of all the tech companies, Alphabet has been most prominent in establishing new operations in life sciences," says Cynthia Yee, a principal at health-focused fund Windham Venture Partners. "In the short-term, we'll see some biotech and health startups struggle to match the salary and compensation that an established company like Alphabet can offer," Yee said. She said several of the startups in her firm's portfolio have already lost key talent to Alphabet, but she declined to provide specifics. It might benefit the industry in the long-run, she says, if Alphabet steps up to acquire life sciences startups or seeks out partnerships. Verily has already announced a string of partnerships with industry giants, including GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, and Sanofi. Steve Kraus, a biotech investor at Bessemer Venture Partners says the life sciences industry will get more nervous if Alphabet starts recruiting heavily in their backyard. Alphabet's companies are headquartered in Silicon Valley, rather than in Boston and Cambridge where life sciences companies have deep connections to the science and engineering departments at Harvard and MIT. "I worry about the war for talent," he says. "Alphabet will make a real go of it, but if there's power in a cluster." Others, like biotech executive and geneticist Sabah Oney from start-up Alector believe that Alphabet's interest in the space is a "net positive" overall. "I've seen so many smart scientists get offers to consult or join Google for real money," he says. "Scientists are so underpaid and undervalued, so the competition can only be a good thing."

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Immigration and talent: the Brexit policy response By Naomi Hanrahan-Soar, Neil Jennings Feature  Future immigration policy is arguably the most important factor on the table for the tech industry. Shares On 29 March 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May sent the official letter formally invoking Article 50 and beginning the two-year Brexit divorce process. Despite being dynamic, innovative and resilient, techUK President Jacqueline de Rojas is clear that the tech sector is not ‘immune’ to the risks and challenges post-EU Britain will bring, with the outcome of the various trade agreements and commercial considerations critical for future success and growth.   However, future immigration policy is arguably the most important factor on the table for the tech industry. Brexit Secretary David Davis has said a ‘sustainable system’ of immigration will take into account different industries’ needs including, it is to be hoped, technology and IT which relies on a stream of international talent to remain at the global cutting edge.    The sector, more so than many others, needs international workers to bring the skills and experience that companies require to maintain their competitive advantage and continue to be successful.  Tech accounts for approximately 24 per cent of total UK exports and currently employs around 3 million people, roughly 18 per cent of whom were not born in the UK. One third of those are European nationals.  Despite many varied approaches to plugging the skills gap more locally through apprenticeships, re-skilling, return to work schemes and programs within schools to encourage interest in tech careers, these mechanisms won’t address the problem in its entirety and will need time to take full effect. Access to international talent will, therefore, remain key for the industry’s continued success. A possible immigration renaissance?  Retro is cool. From Nintendo to Nokia, brands are making a habit of returning to their roots to come up with products and services that meet the demands of new generations. In similar fashion, might the UK Government release an updated version of its previous immigration system and apply it to EEA nationals? Or, will the government take an Apple-esque approach and launch a brand new and futuristic immigration system?  The variables involved in the Brexit negotiation are enormous, and reach far beyond agreeing what happens to EEA nationals in the UK and what happens to UK nationals in the rest of Europe. Just on immigration on an internal, United Kingdom, front there are many areas of concern to be resolved, including: The Labour Party’s Brexit tests, one being for any deal to demonstrate a ‘fair migration system for UK businesses’. Scottish independence and the prospect of more borders to manage politically and practically. The question of Northern Ireland’s sensitive border issues and whether home rule may be restored to the only part of the UK that has a land border with Europe. These are only a few examples of the internal battles to be fought.  Alongside extending this to negotiating with individual European countries who each want their own chance to contribute to filling skills gaps with their own migration agenda, there are also Australia, China and India, among others, to be considered, which could turn negotiations into a quagmire of complexity.   As a result, the Home Office is unlikely to be either retro or futuristic in practice. Instead of the Nokia 3310 or the iPhone-8, the Home Office is likely to take the existing system, with all its flaws, hurdles and delays, and expand it with more categories, caps and complexity. To continue the metaphor, a bit like taking the exploding Samsung Galaxy and remarketing it as version 2.0. What does it mean for the tech industry? Most immediately, the fact that the UK has handed in formal notification to withdraw from the UK does not currently affect the rights of EEA nationals.  Home Secretary Aber Rudd has made assurances that EEA nationals’ rights will not change without the approval of the UK Parliament. Looking ahead, although it is impossible to predict what the immigration system will look like post-Brexit, it could be broadly similar to the UK’s non-EEA work permit mechanism.   The current system for non-EEA nationals is the Points Based System and has been in place since the end of 2008. This sees employers taking full responsibility for any migrants they sponsor, with the implications for non-compliance ranging from revoking the ability to sponsor skilled workers at all, to hefty fines or even prison terms in some circumstances.  There are many ideas being touted for how a transition to a similar points-based system could be implemented more broadly, some more realistic than others. At the very least, though, it seems likely that there will be separate rules for lower and higher skilled workers and potentially across different industries.  Overall, one thing does seem clear; free movement of people was top of the referendum agenda and Theresa May has confirmed it will not proceed unchecked. This means that hundreds of thousands of people already in the UK will need to be documented and hundreds of thousands of people will need to be prioritised and accommodated by an immigration system going forward. All employers, including in the tech and IT sectors, therefore need to know which of their employees are affected by the changing European regulations and which already have a right to permanent residence. Now that Brexit is upon us, more and more businesses are supporting their employees to submit applications for evidence of their right to live and work in the UK, where they have not felt the need to do so in the past. Furthermore, in the very near future, some Europeans and their families will have to do more than just show their passport at the airport in order to gain residence rights in the UK. Practically then, those that were here before the coming changes will need a mechanism to differentiate themselves from those coming after.  Over the coming months, it is critical that the tech industry has its voice heard and informs this debate and the development of legislation that recognises the contribution that tech and IT, and its globally mobile workforce, make to the UK economy. When the post-Brexit lines are drawn, we all want to look back and at least be able to say that we were part of the discussion and contributed to the formation of a system that, with whatever flaws it might have, is built with the interests, needs and ambitions of the sector at heart.   Naomi Hanrahan-Soar, Senior Associate at law firm Lewis Silkin Neil Jennings, Associate at law firm Lewis Silkin Image Credit: D Smith / Flickr Topics brexit immigration policy tech industry GET YOUR FREE MAGAZINE NET: The Money Issue worth £5.99 Join over 7000 ITProPortal subscribers!

PHOTO | JUSTIN TALLIS | AFP   In Summary Foxconn, the Taiwanese manufacturing giant behind Apple’s iPhone and many other major electronics devices, aims to automate away the vast majority of its human employees. Foxconn is beginning by replacing the work that is either dangerous or repetitive. Donald Trump’s policies are going to create higher prices for American consumers; and less work for the workers he’s trying to protect by choking off trade. Advertisement By SUNNY BINDRA More by this Author Donald Trump wants to bring basic jobs back to America. He thinks assembly-line workers, coal-miners, and others, should be Americans. His grand idea seems to be that the jobs will come back by slapping tariffs on foreign products coming into the country. If only he’d ever done Econ 101… The people who have taken the most jobs off everyone else are in Asia. So what are they up to? Foxconn, the Taiwanese manufacturing giant behind Apple’s iPhone and many other major electronics devices, aims to automate away the vast majority of its human employees. It is currently one of the world’s biggest employer, with an estimated 1.2 million workers. Foxconn is beginning by replacing the work that is either dangerous or repetitive. And it plans to move to almost fully automated factories. Last year, it said it had replaced 60,000 employees with robots in one factory. BUILDING ROBOTS In India, GreyOrange is a startup that’s building robots for a very specific purpose: warehousing. As shopping goes increasingly online, the world needs efficient warehouses. GreyOrange says it has taken 90 per cent of the online warehousing robot market in India, and now has offices in five countries. Back in Trumpland: the President also lent his support to cheering truckdrivers recently. There are 3.5 million of them in America. And yet, the future is very clear: self-driving trucks are already on the roads. There will be a transition period in which humans will work alongside automated systems, after which the automation will be near-complete. Donald Trump’s policies, if seen through, are going to create higher prices for American consumers; and less work for the workers he’s trying to protect by choking off trade. What the President (and all of us) should in fact be thinking of is a world in which we have to co-exist with robots and bots. EARLY INVESTMENTS Those who make early investments in understanding the balance between human and automated labour will be the winners, not those who try to return us to a past world that’s never coming back. One of my former colleagues at PwC, John Hawksworth, suggested recently that a third of all British jobs could go to robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) by 2030, starting with waste management, transportation and manufacturing. He also thinks no industry is immune. I agree wholeheartedly: how we are going to work with technology is a matter for every board, every CEO, every executive and every parent in the world. Right now. As I have suggested on this page before, this will mean the rethinking of society itself. We will have to change our ideas on work and reward when such a huge chunk of jobs go to machines. ECONOMIC SAFETY We will very likely have to provide some economic safety nets simply for peace to prevail, for instance by giving people a liveable income without working for it. But that will be part of the broader brush strokes on the canvas of the near future. What about you and your life? Eric Brynjolfsson, Professor of Management Science at MIT and co-author of 2014’s epic The Second Machine Age, warns that the predictions made then are already accelerating beyond expectations. AI is creeping rapidly into professions that once seemed immune to automation, such as law, education, and journalism. Prof Brynjolfsson suggests in a recent issue of the Sloan Review that technological advances will displace or augment human minds, not just muscles. CHANGING WORK The challenge, he points out, is not a “world without work” but a world with rapidly changing work. We have to not just replace the lost income for a bunch of workers; we have to prepare to do the new jobs that the technology will undoubtedly throw up. We can’t freeze in denial; we have to create a new prosperity that involves man and machine. For you: think hard about the things that you and your children can do, but which machines can’t. Think about the role of creativity, empathy, teamwork, anticipation, problem-solving, and leadership in your daily work. We humans still have the advantage there, and may continue to do so. Does your work involve those skills? If not, it needs to. What you don’t want to hear, but will have to: if your work is robotic and repetitive right now, it will be done by a robot pretty soon. You don’t have more than a few years to prepare your organisation, your career and your family for a heavily automated world. www.sunwords.com email print In the headlines New vehicle fraud scheme hits insurers Others thought to be involved include the police, garage owners and spare part dealers.

Huawei's latest strategy is to partner with color authority Pantone to come up with a variety of eye-catching hues for its latest flagship. The Huawei P10 (and the slightly larger P10 Plus) will be available in a slew of colors and finishes. But, while that's nice for people looking to personalize their phones, it's not particularly useful. Popular Searches Western Pacific Minerals WPMLF = 0.0000 0.0000 0.00% PepsiCo Inc PEP ▲ 111.61 +0.03 +0.03% DryShips Inc DRYS ▼ 0.7000 -0.3300 -32.04% Citigroup Inc C ▼ 59.43 -0.46 -0.77% What's actually useful about the new flagship are its powerful camera and reliable performance wrapped in an understated, elegant frame. And although the phones won't officially be coming to the US for now (they'll sell in Europe starting at €649), they're still a tantalizing preview of what Huawei might have in store. Huawei has already proven it is capable of building premium, good-looking handsets, and the P10 is further evidence of that. Its slim, 6.98mm (0.27-inch) profile and gently curving edges aren't just pleasant to look at, they're a pleasure to hold as well. Many of my friends have pointed out the P10's resemblance to the iPhone. And indeed, that's true of the basic white/gold version I tested. If you aren't feeling the Apple-esque look, you can opt for one of many customization options that Huawei offers. Pick a different color -- there are seven hues, including Pantone-approved "Dazzling Blue" and "Greenery," to choose from. Or try a different finish. You can get a smooth, sandblasted back, a glossy coat or a gritty texture that's reminiscent of ridged, holographic lenticular cards. That last option is popular with a couple of my coworkers, and it does help the P10 stand out. The colors and textures available vary between countries, though, so you might not be able to get the exact combination you want. The P10's 5.1-inch full HD display is sharp and colorful, and while It won't wow you with richly saturated images or deep blacks like Samsung's flagships do, it's good enough for my Instagram and Netflix binges. The same can be said for the P10 Plus' 5.5-inch WQHD panel, which offers more space for gaming and reading. I just wish both phones were a tad brighter so I could read more easily in strong sunlight. While we're on the subject, the P10 and P10 Plus come with screen protectors out of the box. It didn't bother me, but might annoy people who want direct access to the display. The trouble for these folks is it appears the protector was applied in lieu of an oleophobic coating on the screen, which other phones have to avoid fingerprint grease and water damage. When we asked about the reported lack of this coating, Huawei said "The P10 is the world's first smartphone with capacitive under-glass fingerprint sensor for seamless navigation." In layman's terms, that all but confirms that Huawei did away with the coating to prevent interference with its under-glass fingerprint sensor. The company also said, "For screen protection, we have used premium materials such as Gorilla Glass 5 and include a screen protector as part of the integrated product." Basically,if you want to remove the screen protector (which by the way is incredibly difficult), do so knowing you risk damaging the display. Below the screen sits a pill-shaped home key that houses the fingerprint sensor. Think of this as an etched-out touchpad. It doesn't depress or click; it simply senses your touch. There aren't separate Back and Recent Apps buttons on its sides; You'll have to tap once on the sensor to go back, hold down to go home and swipe sideways to multitask. This takes a bit of getting used to, but it's worth learning now, since Huawei is not the only company implementing this method (the Moto G5 uses a similar format). If that's too much trouble, you can still opt for a set of onscreen navigation keys, which is the default setting for the larger P10 Plus. This feels more intuitive, but makes the physical sensor redundant and confusing since I still keep hitting it instinctively to go to the home screen. Just like it has with the recently released Mate 9, Huawei has integrated artificial intelligence into the P10's system. Thanks to the company's custom octa-core Kirin 960 processor, the smartphone can learn your habits over time and divert resources like RAM and power to preparing the apps it predicts you will next open. During my month of testing, I most commonly used the P10 for taking pictures, looking at them in the gallery, and sharing them either on Instagram or to Google Drive. Switching between these apps is zippy, which could be a sign that Huawei's algorithm is working well here (or, you know, that the processor and RAM are more than adequate for how I used the phone). Like I noted when I reviewed the Mate 9, though, this isn't something you'll notice until it doesn't work. And it's not like the phone stuttered when pulling up apps I didn't use as frequently; In general, the P10 is responsive and multitasks well. Capable performance and pleasant aesthetics are important basics to nail, but Huawei has come far enough that delivering those is no longer surprising. What I wasn't expecting, though, is the P10's ability to take stunning pictures. When Huawei first teamed up with Leica to co-engineer the P9's cameras in 2016, the result was underwhelming. Now, the collaboration finally seems to be paying off. I'd actually reach for the P10 over my iPhone 6s every time I want to snap a pretty picture (or a gratuitous selfie). The P10 Plus has newer Leica sensors and a larger f/1.8 aperture than the regular P10's f/2.0 setup, but I didn't notice a significant difference in image quality other than more-saturated colors on the larger handset. Both cameras performed similarly well. The P10's rear features a 12-megapixel RGB sensor and a 20-megapixel monochrome sensor, similar to the setup on a handful of Android phones from ZTE and Xiaomi. Together, the cameras capture crisp, colorful photos with pretty bokeh, thanks to software that applies an artificial depth-of-field effect to pictures. From my experience, though, the iPhone 7 Plus is more accurate at identifying outlines of faces while the P10 tends to be more muddy with its boundaries. It causes parts of my head, like my hair, to be blurred out along with the background. Still, the pictures look lovely, and the accuracy is already an improvement over the P9. Plus, it could easily be fixed with a software update. What the P10 does that the iPhone can't though, is apply that same soft focus to selfies. I was won over the instant I saw the results -- they're almost pretty enough to make me switch to Android. It sounds vain, but the front-camera integration makes getting the bokeh effect much easier, and is a bonus for anyone who wants better selfies. The P10's front camera also has a handy tool for group selfies that detects faces in the shot, and zooms in or out to accommodate them. This feature was finicky in my testing and didn't always work. When it did kick in, it did a good job of providing enough room for everyone in the picture, but it's too unreliable right now to be useful. Software is a big reason the P10's pictures are superb. Its camera app features a trio of color profiles -- standard, vivid and smooth, that let you take richer, more saturated images that are Instagram-ready without any edits. These sometimes result in slightly overexposed photos because of the high contrast, but you can always shoot in standard mode to avoid that. The P10 is also impressive in low light. Pictures of buildings at night displayed almost no noise -- details were clear and colors were vivid. Portrait mode can introduce noise, but even there it's minor. There is very little to dislike about the P10 -- even its battery life is satisfying. The regular P10 has a 3,200mAh cell while the Plus packs a 3,750mAh one. During my testing, both phones easily lasted about a day and a half of average use. But, any time I started playing games or watching videos on YouTube, that runtime drops to a day at best. That's still impressive, though, and recharging the phone is speedy enough, thanks to quick-charge support. I was surprised to see the P10 go from zero percent to 25 percent charged in a mere 15 minutes. Ultimately, the P10 and P10 Plus are good-looking, responsive phones with excellent cameras. But they're not perfect. I'm not a fan of the home key navigation, nor do I like the limited availability of Huawei's unique color options. Plus, the handsets won't officially be coming to the US. If you get your hands on one and stick an AT&T or T-Mobile SIM card in there, the phone will work, though you may not get full LTE speeds since the radio isn't optimized for US spectrums. Huawei has only just begun bringing its popular handsets stateside, so hopefully the P10 will make its way here soon.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Apr 8, 2017 at 12:16PM The semiconductor sector can be a volatile space: Companies are constantly shifting their products, managing fast-paced product cycles, and offering race-to-the-bottom prices in order to win spots for their chips in the world's top devices.  Those uncertainties can make the industry highly cyclical, and they make predicting which companies will perform well over the long term even more difficult. Investors seeking the best players have likely come across Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Let's take a closer look at each, and attempt to figure out which one has the better long-term prospects. Image source: Getty Images. The case for Himax Himax is a fabless chip designer of semiconductors for TVs, laptops, smartphones and tablets, and makes controllers for things like touch-sensor displays. It breaks its revenue down into three main segments: large-sized panel drivers, small and medium-sized panel drivers, and non-driver sales.  The company made some gains in the fourth quarter of 2016, with large panel driver revenue grew growing 21.8%, small and medium-sized panel drivers ticking up 9%, and non-driver sales increasing 6%, year over year. Many investors see two key sources of potentially significant growth for the company -- namely, augmented reality (AR) devices, and the possibility of earning a spot for its products in Apple's next iPhone. The AR opportunity is predicated on rising demand from Himax's customers for liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) and wafer-level optics (WLO) designs. Himax believes that growing demand in these two product areas could help the company in the long term, though those big gains probably aren't imminent. "It is worth noting that despite the near-term headwinds, we remain positive on the long-term prospect of our WLO and LCOS product lines, judging by the expanding customer list that covers some of the world's biggest tech names," CEO Jordan Wu said on the Q4 earnings call. Additionally, there's the chance that the company's 3D sensing technologies may be chosen for the next iPhone iteration. Morgan Stanley's Charlie Chan believes that not only will the iPhone incorporate Himax's 3D sensor tech, but that its adoption in that device will spur other smartphone makers to follow suit. Chan believes this could end up contributing 20% of Himax's 2018 revenue. The case for NVIDIA NVIDIA is by far the leader in the graphics processing unit market, with more than 70% of the discrete desktop GPU market share right now. That's great news for the company, as 62% of its revenue in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2017 came from sales to GPUs for the gaming market. The company had a tremendous Q4 (which ended in Jan. 29): Its gaming revenue increased by 66% year over year, data center revenue spiked 205%, automotive revenues jumped 37%, and professional visualization revenue ticked up 10%. That growth is flowing from NVIDIA's accurate belief that it can take its class-leading GPUs and apply their power to other uses, and new markets. That mentality has, for example, allowed the company to expand into the driverless car segment with its Drive PX 2 supercomputer, and into artificial intelligence with its DGX-1 server. Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs believes that NVIDIA could take $5 billion to $10 billion in the AI space with its GPUs, and the company has already proved it can hold its own in the semi-autonomous car market -- 80 automakers and suppliers are already using the company's Drive PX computer. The verdict  If you step back and a take a high-level view of these companies, there's not much of a comparison. Sure, Himax has some prospects within AR, and winning a spot in the next iPhone could certainly help the company. But Himax seems to playing the same tune that it always has -- trying to win a place in the next great device -- and that strategy has left investors disappointed in the past.   The first bet was on Google Glass, which caused Himax's stock to pop -- and later, to crash. Then it was the prospect of making huge gains because of Microsoft's Hololens, which has since fizzled (at least, for now). Now, according to Morgan Stanley, it's the iPhone. The potential of gains from a victory with that already hugely popular device may seem less speculative than betting on the success of an AR device, but the story of small companies flying too close to Apple and then getting burned is all too familiar.  Meanwhile, NVIDIA is consistently growing its core GPU gaming business, while successfully expanding its footprints in new markets. Sure, the company's 181% share price jump over the past 12 months might scare off some investors who think that the stock has little room left to rise. But adriverless cars and AI systems are only beginning to take off, and I think NVIDIA's solid prospects in those markets easily make it a better long-term play than Himax.

Just like the last time he took to the Apple mic, though, Ocean finished his show up with a new single, this one titled “Biking” and featuring appearances from Jay Z and Tyler, The Creator The rappers’ performances bookend a crooning wail from Ocean, filled with longing and reminders that “God gives you what you can handle.” Even when the song builds to a shouting climax, though, it still keeps hold of that dream-like quality that makes Ocean’s work such an easy vibe to drift into. The artist has been releasing a new episode of Blonded Radio roughly every month, so hopefully it won’t be long before he’s back again with new material. Meanwhile, you can listen to the full program via iTunes, or see the playlist for last night’s show right here. [via Noisey] Submit your Newswire tips here.

In this post, I’m going to use a tweet from one of my favorite influencers, Larry Kim, to illustrate all the marketing, sales, and PR possibilities we can uncover if we just keep an eye on online discussions in our industry. Ready? Grab a coffee and start listenin’. So earlier this year, Larry Kim tweeted: Apparently, he’s not alone in that opinion - the tweet got liked by almost a hundred people and sparked heated discussions about other ad platforms. Regrettably, none of the brands mentioned stepped in and joined the conversation. We don’t know if they were even listening at all, but as a marketer of a social media listening tool, I can’t help but notice all these wasted opportunities to engage. Because Larry Kim didn’t @mention Facebook or Google AdWords, they may have simply missed the tweet - a problem that they wouldn’t have if they were using a monitoring tool for their brands. . So, here are some of the things - in my humble opinion - these ad platforms could’ve and should’ve done in this situation: 1. Monitor negative feedback for reputation management Customers complain on social media because they want to be heard. They want an explanation, if not a resolution - otherwise, people would’ve just written their complaints in their diaries. Given that it’s a direct criticism on their bid management settings, Facebook could’ve at least come out and said “Sorry we’re so lame. We heard you and will try to do better.” It might be scary to face dissatisfied customers - especially on social media where your every move is under public scrutiny - but not responding makes customers feel like you don’t care. And they'll stop caring too. And nothing kills a business faster than apathy. Of course, you can’t respond to negative feedback if you don’t even know its happening, so the first thing you need to do is to set up alerts for your brand, so that you’ll be notified of any such discussions even when people aren’t tagging you. Pro tip: Set up alerts for your product name and keywords like “issues,” “troubles,” or “problems.” If you’re overwhelmed with mentions, filter them by sentiment. Focus on frustrated customers first. 2. Monitor customer feedback for product improvement Saying sorry is the first step, but real improvements must follow your apology. After putting out the fire and saving face, Facebook should take a deep dive into their bid management settings or interface and actually try to resolve the issue. In this case, for example, Facebook can start by collecting feedback and ideas for improvement from this comment thread: They can then make a tally for the most requested feature to guide their product development roadmap. Customers know what they want and need, so the more you take your customers’ opinions into consideration, the higher chance of success you’ll have for your product. Tracking what features your customers like about your competitors is also a great way to get ideas - so Facebook could also look into how Google AdWords is rocking people’s socks off, for example, and steal a couple of tricks from them. Pro tip: Set up alerts for your product name and keywords like “if only” “I wish” or “please improve,” or your product and feature names. Like “‘Apple’ and ‘Siri’” or “‘Apple’ and ‘3D touch’.” You can then do the same for your competitors. 3. Monitor your competitors for opportunities to out-win them If you’ve paid close enough attention, you’ll see that Facebook isn’t the only brand mentioned here. Google AdWords, a competitor of Facebook’s ad platform, is praised in this tweet. If they had set up alerts for their brand, Google could’ve jumped in and grabbed this perfect opportunity to gloat. First, they could thank Larry Kim for the shoutout and then retweet it to their community. If they want to take it one step further, they could even create campaigns that joke about the drawbacks of Facebook’s interface - which is something that smartphone brands love doing: Obviously, you can’t beat the competition if you don’t know what they’re doing, so don’t just monitor discussions about your own brand, but also those of your competitors. Listen to what your customers think about your competitors, and look out for golden PR opportunities you can leverage. 4. Monitor your industry for lead generation Responding when your brand is mentioned should be an obvious given, but savvy social media marketers or sales reps should listen and hunt for opportunities to speak up, even when they aren’t the focus. In this example, Facebook partners and third party ad platforms could jump in a say “we can help” Because monitoring non-direct competitors or industry leaders is not only a great way to stay on top of trends, but also to generate leads. If you’re a PPC agency, for example, you could monitor discussions about people having trouble with setting up their own AdWords account, or difficulty with Google’s keyword planner, and offer advice and help. That way, even if you don’t score the client right away, you’ll win PR points, and establish your brand on social media, which will likely mean more money in the long run. 5. Monitor discussions to find VIPs for Influencer marketing One of the reasons I picked this tweet for this case study is because Larry Kim isn’t just any ordinary Twitter user. As the founder of Wordstream, and with 648K Twitter followers, Larry is a huge influencer in the B2B tech industry. His opinion carries weight. In the social media world, all tweets are equal, but some tweets are more equal than others, so it’s a huge mistake for Facebook to ignore this tweet, and for Google AdWords to not leverage this influencer marketing opportunity. If you’re using a monitoring tool like Mention, you’ll not only be notified when someone mentions your brand, but you can also filter the mentions by their influencer score to prioritize the VIPs. And when you want to launch an influencer marketing campaign, you can easily find big guns who’ve already talked about you or your industry (depending on what keywords you’re monitoring) and reach out to them. Everybody’s on social media, but most aren’t using it right So by now, you should see all the opportunities you’ll miss if you don’t monitor social media in real time. Most companies are on social media with elaborate social media plans and posting schedules, but you can’t get the most out of social media if you don’t know when people are talking about you and engage with them.

Yesterday GOOG: 824.67 -3.21 Review: Huawei P10 packs excellent optics and good hardware into a forgettable phone [Video] Hayato Huseman - Apr. 8th 2017 9:49 am PT Android Huawei Huawei P10 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Every year, reviewers and tech bloggers have all the same things to say when a new Huawei phone comes out; great hardware and camera performance brought down by less than ideal software. Last year’s Mate 9 attempted to address the software complaints a bit with a new version of the company’s EMUI interface, but with a screen at 5.9-inches it was too big for a lot of consumers. The P10 is Huawei’s latest flagship — in essence a smaller Mate 9 with a more comfortable design — but is it enough to stand out against this year’s aggressive competition? Hardware The P10 is surprisingly compact. With a 5.1-inch 1080p LCD display and average-sized bezels above and below, it’s about the same size as phones like the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, and LG G5. The body is more rounded and comfortable than the P10’s bigger brother the Mate 9, and thanks to its aluminum unibody design it’s less slippery and fragile than phones with a glass back — though as always, a metal back means no wireless charging. Thankfully the P10 does feature fast charging through its USB-C port, and to its sides are a 3.5mm headphone jack and a speaker grill. As is always the case with bottom-firing speakers, it’s tinny and easy to accidentally cover with a finger, but it puts out a decent amount of volume. Fingerprint sensor Fingerprint sensors have always been a strong point for Huawei. Just as we’ve seen on the Mate 9 and other Huawei devices, the P10’s sensor is lightning fast and accurate (even faster than Apple’s Touch ID), though unlike its predecessors the P10’s fingerprint sensor has been moved from Huawei’s typical placement centered around the back of the phone. It’s now located on the front beneath the display in Apple and Samsung fashion, and while some may find this positioning preferable, it feels like wasted space given that it doesn’t function as a button — at least, not by default. Should you want to navigate the P10 using the fingerprint sensor, Huawei has tucked an option into the settings to eliminate the on-screen controls entirely and instead navigate the phone using a series of gestures on the sensor: tap to go back, press and hold to go home, and swipe from right to left for recent apps. It works well enough for the most part, though you do lose the ability to run split screen apps, which is usually triggered by a long press of the recent apps button. The display The P10’s IPS LCD display looks fairly sharp with a 1080p resolution, and it’s protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5. Colors look rich and saturated, but it’s a bit cool-toned by default —thankfully there’s a setting to adjust color temperature. The big problem with the display is its lack of an oleophobic coating. Nearly every phone has this to combat finger oils to keep the display looking clean, but on the P10 your only protection is the preinstalled plastic screen protector. It’s nice that it comes included with the phone, but those that prefer the feeling of glass to plastic may be disappointed. Software The P10 offers Huawei’s best software experience ever, running the company’s own EMUI 5 overtop Android 7.0 Nougat. As previously mentioned, Huawei has received a lot of flack for its user interface over the years, but EMUI 5 (first introduced on the Mate 9 and Honor 5X) offers much better performance than before, and adds some nice features as well — most mentionable is the long-requested option to enable an app drawer to the home screen. Nougat enables natively running two apps simultaneously in split screen view, and the Kirin 960 chipset and 4GB RAM ensure that you’ll run into no performance troubles. One thing to note is that there’s quite a lot of bloatware and preinstalled apps on the P10. Luckily most can be uninstalled, and they’re not all bad — Huawei partnered with GoPro to include its Quik video editing software. Some minor annoyances… There are still some annoyances with using the P10 though. It may be a problem with the software or the display, but it seems to struggle with swiping gestures. Dismissing notifications often takes multiple attempts, and I suspect that could be due in part to another problem with the phone: Huawei’s knuckle sensing technology is meant to help take screenshots, but it often leads to finger input being erroneously read as knuckles — this could be why it doesn’t always respond properly to swiping, and there’s no way to turn the feature off. The P10 also has aggressive battery-saving features, constantly notifying you about power-hungry apps and reducing processing power at certain battery thresholds (though the latter is an opt-in feature, not default). This isn’t a bad thing, but it can be overly aggressive at times; far too often, Bluetooth will turn off on my phone after a few hours without a connected device, which is especially annoying if you step into your car after a day of work and it doesn’t automatically connect. Camera The cameras on the P10 make taking photos one of the most enjoyable experiences about the phone. There’s a Leica-branded dual camera layout on the back, consisting of a primary 20MP sensor and a secondary 12MP monochrome sensor that helps fill in detail and measure depth for artificial bokeh effects. There’s optical image stabilization built in, along with 4K video capabilities and many different photo settings and manual controls. With an f/2.2 aperture the P10 takes in a good amount of light, though in darker environments it’s not quite able to keep up with wider aperture cameras found on phones like the Galaxy S7. Still, shots taken on the P10 are detailed and nicely saturated without looking unnaturally vibrant. The artificial bokeh is fun and often looks more realistic than the portrait mode on the iPhone 7 Plus, and you certainly get more manual control than on the iPhone, but bear in mind that unlike Apple’s implementation the P10 doesn’t save an original/natural version of the photo, so you’ll want to use caution not to go overboard and drown a shot in blur. Other details Battery life In my experience, battery life on the P10 has been average to poor. Its 3,200 mAh lithium-ion battery matches or bests many other phones of roughly the same physical size, but in my three weeks of testing it’s never lasted a full day without needing topped up by the evening. Endurance will range depending on your exact usage, and EMUI’s power-saving features do help as long as you don’t mind the tradeoff in performance, but altogether the phone hasn’t quite met my battery expectations when compared to phones with roughly the same battery capacity like the Galaxy S7 or even the much cheaper Moto G5 Plus. No water resistance Unlike many other flagship devices these days, the P10 disappointingly wields no water resistance. Given its unibody enclosure and placement of all ports at the bottom of the device, it should be fine in the face of light rain or an accidental splash, but be weary not to jump in the pool with this phone. Final thoughts The P10 feels a lot like most other Huawei phones. Its great hardware and excellent camera performance make it feel worth the money, but the software holds it back a bit and leaves it feeling like a good phone launching at a time full of great phones like the LG G6, Galaxy S8, and even the Honor 8 Pro from Huawei’s sister company Honor. A year ago, the P10 might’ve been a much stronger recommendation, but in 2017 it just doesn’t bring anything unique or remarkable to the table.

It suggested states should be given more time to adapt to changing rules.Addressing the ministers, Moscovici opposed Malta's view and said the biggest source of uncertainty would be to maintain a "status quo" where EU states compete with each other on corporate tax policy.Many large U.S. corporations have set up their headquarters in smaller EU states, allowing them to cut their tax bills due to more lax tax rules. Following recent revelations, such as the Panama Papers, of widespread tax evasion and avoidance by big corporations and wealthy individuals, the European Commission has made several legislative proposals to close legal loopholes. However, some of the most ambitious plans have yet to be approved by EU states.Multinationals, including Apple, Amazon.com, McDonald's and Starbucks Corp, are under investigation or have been sanctioned by the EU executive for their excessively low tax bills in some EU states."We must finish what we have started," Moscovici urged ministers, according to his speaking notes circulated to the media. The pace of reforms should remain "fast", he said. He told states to move "with ambition and determination" to agree on proposals for a common tax base at EU level that would put an end to the wide range of corporate tax exemptions and deductions currently applied by EU countries, and which are exploited by big companies to lower their tax bills. He faced opposition from some smaller EU states. On his arrival to the meeting, Belgian finance minister Johan Van Overtveldt said Malta was right in stressing that the pace of reforms should not be "too fast" and that the EU should adapt its speed to other major economies worldwide. His remarks were echoed by Luxembourg's finance minister Pierre Gramegna, who called for a "level playing field in terms of taxation worldwide".Moscovici said the EU should lead the world on tax reforms, especially at a time when the U.S. tax policy is unclear and may further slow down reforms.Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem sided with Moscovici. "Let's not get soft on tax avoidance," he told reporters on his arrival to the meeting.Calls for more tax certainty "cannot be an excuse" to slow down the EU fight against tax avoidance, German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told reporters at the end of the meeting.

Postepic is an app for elegantly sharing book quotes Posted 15 hours ago by Natasha Lomas (@riptari) 0 SHARES Next Story The hoverbikes are coming It’s fair to say the smartphone camera has become the digital tool of most use, rendering the average person’s camera roll essentially a memory buffer where carefully composed photographs rub up against snaps of receipts, funny stuff you saw on the street and fancied sharing with friends, and, sometimes, snippets of text you came across in a (paper) book and wanted to make a note of. Snapping a photo in that moment is a stand in for the lack of real-world copy and paste. And it’s the latter kind of photo (text quotations) that the founders of smartphone app Postepic want to liberate from this unstructured jumble of visual data. Indeed, the first version of the app, released last year as a bootstrapping side-project by a bunch of book-loving friends after they graduated from university in Poland, was just a basic way for them to organize and share photos of the quotations they had cluttering their camera rolls. “We started this project as we wanted to build something together,” says co-founder Łukasz Konofalski. “We all share a passion for books and were used to sharing quotes and books recommendations between each other. We came across some reports that showed that in Poland in 2016 only half a book will be read on average, so we also wanted to support readership in general by building a bridge between traditional books and mobile world. “Two things really surprised us when we finally launched it in June 2016: the number of new books worth reading we discovered by simply sharing quotes with each other; and a very warm reception we received from the developers and users communities alike. We have received volumes of valuable feedback from them — and got back to work.” Version 2 of the app, which launched this week, turns a basic idea into an app that has enough form and function to feel appealing to use. The core additional feature is optical character recognition (OCR) — meaning that instead of uploading and sharing ugly-looking (and hard to read) chunks of raw page text, i.e. in their original photo form, Postepic users can now lift the words off the page, capturing and editing the text and its visual presentation by choosing from a selection of fonts and backgrounds. The final result presents the text snippet inside a square frame, in a way that’s both easy to read and visibly pleasing (for an example of how utilitarian quotes looked in v1 of the app see the image at the bottom of this post). So Postepic basically lets people turn a favorite quote into an easily shareable unit of digital social currency. Aka, an ‘Instagram for book quotes’. Last year Facebook added a feature aimed at enhancing the impact of the text statuses being shared via its platform, giving users the ability to add colored backgrounds to their text updates to make them more visual. And with so much visual noise being injected into messaging and communications apps, this is hardly surprising. Point is, if you want something to stand out in the age of Instagram Stories (Snapchat Stories, Facebook Stories, WhatsApp Stories… etc etc), it has to look right as the bar for being noticed keeps getting higher. And with all this visual noise clamoring for our attention, it can feel like the written word is being forgotten or overlooked as people ditch a thousand words in favor of sharing a few photos. Yet a well-turned phrase has the power to be both arresting and enlightening, as well as a hint of greater depths lurking within the full work. So given how much attention has been (and continues to be) lavished on visual forms of communication — from photo filters to selfie lenses to style transfer — there’s arguably space for a clever social sharing app that brings the power of the written word back into focus. Notably, Apple’s new social video sharing app Clips includes an auto-captioning feature. That’s great for accessibility, but also a reminder that words-as-text still have power and — with a little technological automagic — can be effortlessly edited back into the selfie frame. Postepic is not the first app to take a shot at wordy snippets, though. Others have tried to build an ‘Instagram for book quotes’ — Quotle, for example — but no one has yet managed to generate significant momentum for the concept. It might be because sharing book snippets is inherently more niche than sharing photos (it’s certainly more bounded, given language barriers). Or because no one has made a slick enough version to attract more mainstream appeal. Postepic’s v2 app seems to beat Quotle on OCR speed. And because it’s chosen to fix the sharing format as a square its content inherently feels better groomed for social sharing vs the more wordy/text-heavy Quotle. (Although, on the flip side, Postepic’s ease of use and more formulaic format might attract a flood of cliché sharers and drive down the quality of discoverable quotes.) But clearly the founders’ hope is that the uniform sharing format sets Postepic up to benefit from viral uplift if users share watermarked quotes to their larger follower bases on platforms like Instagram (as other apps have). Time will tell if they can make it catch on. It’s certainly still a fairly unformed thing at this stage, especially given the size and nature of its early adopter community — having only clocked a few thousand downloads for its MVP v1 via a launch on Product Hunt. So even though the team has curated a bunch of quotations themselves to populate the app, you’re more likely to find quotes about scaling a startup than lines from a Shakespearean sonnet. But the core function of v2 has been executed well, within a clear app structure. So it’s super simple to capture, edit and share nicely presented quotes. Quotation length is capped at 600 characters to ensure readability (and curtail any copyright concerns). Photo backgrounds are also limited to a handful of generic shots and textures offered within the app — at least for now, to avoid users uploading inappropriate imagery, says Konofalski (on that front, remember Secret?). While the OCR tech supports ten languages at this point: Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. The app also lets you tag quotations for subject matter and to add sources (a requirement if you’re making a quote public). Using these labels you can then browse and search quotes, while a favorites feature lets you curate a like-list if you spot quotes shared by others that you like. And if you don’t want to share the quotes you create with the crowd you don’t have to — you can keep individual quotes private and just use the app to create an organized, visual library of the best bits from the books you’re reading. On the community front, the main feed of Postepic is an assorted jumble for now, showing a stream of non-topic sorted ‘trending’ quotes that Konofalski says turns over every few hours based on what others are liking. Currently there’s no way to follow other users to customize what you see here but that’s down to how nascent the community is. “Our goal is to offer a solution that many content and photo sharing apps use: to give users a choice to pick their favorite genres and authors to adjust their feed,” he says. “Additionally, we want to launch a functionality of following other users, so their posts show up in user’s feed… [but] decided to postpone the functionality… until we reach a community size that would warrant this.” Postepic does also support social sharing to other platforms, as you’d expect. Though this doesn’t always work as you’d imagine. For example, testing sharing to WhatsApp the app merely created a generic text message with a link to view the quote in Postepic, rather than including the visual form of the quote in a WhatsApp message template (though this is likely a WhatsApp restriction on sharing from a third party app). A basic workaround is obviously to screengrab a quote and upload it manually where you like as a photo. Sharing to Twitter incorporated both the image and a text message with a link when I tested it. Konofalski says that with most “well known apps” it will automatically import/drop an image into the other app. The app is free to download (and iOS only for now), and while the team says it has a few ideas for potential monetization down the line — such as hosting pre-launch book campaigns, or offering writers a subscription-based platform to connect with fans — the focus for now is fully on building up the size of the community to try to reach a “critical mass” of readers.

As the protection of data becomes more critical, an increasing number of companies are turning to this method to secure their customers' important information. Matthew Cochrane (CMFCochrane) Apr 8, 2017 at 11:12AM Sometimes we read certain words and have only a vague notion of what they mean but, not willing to invest the time necessary to understand their full import, we gloss over them. Personally, I know I do this while reading industry publications for background research. I'll encounter a word and just zip by it without fully understanding the context or implications of what the author is trying to say. The term "tokenization" has become exactly this type of buzzword, and it stands at the intersection of several important industries. It is an important term for both investors and consumers to learn. There are few concepts more important today than tokenization when it comes to protecting sensitive data like our personal identification information and credit card numbers. Image source: Pixabay What is tokenization? Put simply, tokenization is the process of substituting an important and sensitive piece of data with a non-sensitive equivalent. The new non-sensitive data now being used in the sensitive data's place is the "token". The token is usually a randomly or algorithmically generated alphanumeric code. Retail and payment industry businesses are turning to tokenization to protect important pieces of information like your credit card's primary account number (PAN), because it offers important advantages over other protective techniques like encryption. Tokenization is especially valuable considering the number of data breaches that have occurred at businesses and banks in recent years. If a hacker breaks into a company's database where your credit card information is stored, the thief will be able to use your information to make all kinds of purchases. Even worse, the crook can sell your information on the web to other fraudsters. However, if the same hackers break into a database and only find tokens instead of credit card numbers, they are worthless to the thieves and your personal data is still safe. Consider this over-simplified illustration: Imagine a thief breaking into a Chuck E. Cheese location and stealing a bag full of tokens. It would be absolutely pointless! The tokens are worthless outside of the establishment's location and can't be used to purchase goods or services anywhere else. The same is true with tokenization. The tokens stored in a database representing your PAN or other piece of sensitive data, are worthless to anyone else. This diagram, provided by Square Inc and reproduced here with permission, also illustrates the concept well: Image source: Square Inc. The advantages of tokenization With data encryption, this same kind of protection isn't available. Even with end-to-end encryption, there are several places within the system where data has to be de-encrypted and reencrypted. These data transfer points are all susceptible to a system hack. There is also a possibility with encryption that the cryptogram key could be compromised, leaving all encrypted data vulnerable to being stolen. Tokenization also makes it much cheaper and easier for retailers to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). The PCI DSS is a standard established and maintained by the major payment networks including American Express, Discover, JCB International, Mastercard, and Visa. The standard was created to expand the acceptance of credit cards and decrease fraud. Any merchant wishing to accept card payments must meet this standard. However, since no card or bank account data is stored by retailers with tokenization, not all the regulations apply. Finally, tokenization can be universally used with any type of payment, technology, or piece of information. So it not only works when credit cards are swiped or inserted at the point-of-sale, but can also be used with NFC payments like Apple's Apple Pay and Alphabet's Android Pay, gift cards, and ACH payments. Applications of tokenization There are several ways merchants and consumers use tokenization today to make transactions more secure. For instance, when a credit card is loaded into either Apple Pay or Android Pay, Apple or Google sends the information to the issuing bank or payment network to ensure the card is legitimate. The payment network or card issuer then send Apple or Google back the token in place of your credit card's PAN. Once this takes place, the fraudster cannot use the information stored on the app for fraudulent purposes. Merchants can also use tokenization for online purchases. If your credit card is stored on a retailer's website, and that website suffers a data breach, no information can be compromised and then fraudulently used if only tokens were kept by the retailer in place of the actual credit card information. Furthermore, if this were to happen, the consumer would not have to order a replacement card because their card was never compromised. Tokenization is becoming an increasingly important tool to prevent fraud and materially affects companies spread out across the retail, payments, and financial industries. No one wants to be a shareholder in a company when it becomes the latest example on the nightly news of a corporation that didn't take the proper safeguards to protect its customers' data. As consumers, its important to know how the companies we conduct business with plan to secure our important personal information. That's why understanding what tokenization means and how it works can help us become better investors and consumers.

Now, the SNL crew is taking a step forward (backward?) and creating real ads. The first of the real ads will be broadcast during the April 8 show. The ad, for Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), was written by SNL’s “Weekend Update” anchor Colin Jost and will feature cast member Kenan Thompson according to a report in Variety. SNL has also struck a deal with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) to create real ads that are expected to be broadcast within a few weeks. While the content of the ads hasn’t been revealed, the idea behind them, from SNL’s point of view, is to attract eyeballs for the live show. Lorne Michaels, executive producer of SNL, put it this way: Everyone is struggling now in a world where there is so much media. We are all competing for sponsors, and everything is being reinvented. ‘SNL’ has been reinventing itself from season two. SNL is having a resurgence as a result of its political satire. The show will broadcast the last four episodes of its current season live all across the country, beginning with the April 15 broadcast. According to zap2it.com, SNL has posted its best ratings in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic since 2008-2009 and its largest total audience since the early 1990s. Michaels told Variety, “We are doing what we always do, but the difference is that everyone is paying attention.” Variety noted the impact on SNL’s ad rates: The cost of a 30-second spot in “Saturday Night Live,” which is enjoying its highest-rated season in more than two decades, soared 43.5% in February, to $110,000, according to Standard Media Index, a tracker of ad expenditures, compared with $76,900 in the year-earlier period. The show captures around $115 million in advertising each year, according to Kantar Media. For Apple and Verizon, hitching their wagons to a mass media property that is hugely popular with the age group they want to address is an idea worth taking a gamble on.

UK company, David Brown Automotive (DBA), also responsible for the Speedback GT, has added a new model to its line-up, simply named Mini Remastered. Packed with modern features and engineering, it retains its famous old-school looks. Inspired by Sir Alec Issigonis’ iconic design, DBA is keeping as close to the original as possible. “Our story is simple. Embrace the DNA of a design classic, then skillfully and respectfully remaster it to meet the demands of modern day life,” the company says. Making the Mini (relatively) modern is its in-car technology, which includes Apple Carplay and Android Auto, with USB and AUX points. Replacing the original large speedometer in the centre of the dashboard is a 7.0-inch touchscreen with satellite navigation. The cabin has chrome air-conditioning vents and knobs and is finished with a woodgrain steering wheel. DBA also offer many ways to personalise the car, including wheels, paint and upholstery. The exterior has a completely new structure with newly-formed body panels, making the body shell even stronger. Powering the Mini is a 1275cc petrol engine, and DBA claim it’s 50 per cent more powerful than the original Mini. It produces 78kW of power and 91Nm of torque, with an option to upgrade to 1300cc to stretch it to 98kW. Like the Mini of old, a four-speed manual transmission is standard. Stopping power comes from front disc brakes and rear drum brakes, while you can also tick the upgrade box for all-round performance disc brakes. Each car is hand-made and takes 1400 hours to build, with 400 spent just on perfecting the paint. While DBA is moving premises to Silverstone, only 50-100 cars will be produced annually. If you’re not a fan of the BMW Mini of today, the Mini Remastered could be an alternative, but at a price. They start at £50,000, approximately AUD $82,000.

Settings on Windows 10 is the place that allows you to personalize your experience, change system and networking options, customize features, such as the Start menu, notifications, taskbar, and Lock screen, and configure Bluetooth devices, printers, your mouse, and a lot more. Although the Settings app is still a work in progress, and you won't be able to customize every feature on Windows 10, the Creators Update brings a slew of new changes that will significantly reduce the number of trips you make to Control Panel. On version 1703, the Settings app gets more options, new settings sections, interface tweaks, and it migrates a number of features from the old Control Panel experience. In this Windows 10 guide, we'll give you an overview of everything that has changed and improved inside the Settings app for the Creators Update. What's new in Settings Once the Windows 10 Creators Update installs on your device, and you open Settings, you'll notice that the main page now is a little more crowded than before. The reason is that Microsoft has reorganized a lot of the settings and added a bunch more. For example, starting with version 1703, Windows 10 removes all the app-related settings from System and creates a dedicated Apps section for "Apps & features," "Default apps," "Offline maps," and "Apps for websites." Gaming is also a new section where you can customize your gaming-experience features, such as Game Mode and Game bar, among other settings. There is also a Mixed reality section, but it won't appear on the main page of Settings unless you set up the experience on your computer. Throughout Settings, you'll also find small tweaks, including the fact that related links now appear on the right size, instead of at the bottom of the page. When scrolling, the page title will always show, which helps you to remember where you are inside Settings. And some features, such as "USB" inside Devices, include a check box to enable certain options, instead of a toggle switch. Here are all the new changes found in the Settings app in more detail. System Devices Network & internet Personalization Apps Accounts Time & language Gaming Ease of Access Privacy Update & security Mixed reality System On System, you'll no longer find app-related options, because they have been moved to the new Apps section, and you'll come across these changes. On Settings > System, the Display page gets a complete overhaul reducing the steps to change your screen resolution, and a new drop-down menu makes it easier to change your scaling settings. You can even click the new Custom scaling link to set a custom scaling size if the default options don't suit your needs. You'll also find a "Multiple display" section with a button to detect other displays. Or you can click the Display adapter properties link to access Control Panel's monitor properties. But the most exciting feature is Night light, which can be found under "Brightness and color." Similar to Apple's Night Shift and Android's Night mode, Night light on Windows 10 helps to reduce the amount of blue light your display emits. As a result of less blue light, you'll see warmer colors in your display to prevent eye strain and improve sleep quality. You can turn on or off Night light within the Display settings, but you can click the Night light settings link to change the color temperature, set up a schedule to lower the blue light automatically, and turn the feature on of off on-demand. On Settings > System, the Notifications page remains the same, but there is a new option to turn off the welcome experience after installing feature updates highlighting new changes. Also, Quick actions now includes a new Night light button, which you can quickly disable by clicking the Add or remove quick actions link and turning off the toggle switch for the feature. On Settings > System, the Battery page has been updated with a new drop-down menu to optimize battery life when you're watching videos under the "More saving options." Options available, include "Optimize for battery life" and "Optimize for video quality." On Settings > System, the Storage page no longer includes the option to change where your apps and files are saved by default. Instead, the Creators Update introduces Storage sense. This is a new feature that allows Windows 10 to automatically free up space on your device by deleting temporary files and those items you sent to the recycle bin. You can customize Storage sense by clicking the Change how we free up space link, and there is also a Clean now button to make more room on-demand if you're running low on storage space. It should be noted that you can always click the Change where new content is saved link, under "More storage settings," to change where files and apps are saved by default. Windows 10 also revamps the Storage usage page with new visual elements to display how space is being used for each data type. On Settings > System, the Shared experiences page allows developers to create experiences on apps that work across multiple devices. For example, if a developer builds a news-reader app using "Shared experiences," you can start reading an article on your Android phone and continue on your Windows 10 PC. You have control over whether apps use this feature or not, but developers must build the functionality first. Devices On Devices, the "Bluetooth" page has been renamed to Bluetooth & other devices, and it combines the settings found in the old "Bluetooth" and "Connected devices" pages. In addition, the "Mouse & touchpad" page now splits into separate pages. Now you'll get one page for Mouse and another for Touchpad. On Settings > Devices, the Bluetooth & other devices page now groups related devices accordingly using the new "Mouse, keyboard, & pen," "Audio," or "Other devices" list, depending on its category. Whether you need to set up a new Bluetooth mouse or USB webcam, you now only need to click the Add Bluetooth or other device button and follow the on-screen directions to configure the new device. On Settings > Devices, the Touchpad page now includes a number of improvements for Precision touchpad technology. In version 1703, Microsoft is introducing new adjustments for gesture-and-click detection using a Precision touchpad, including better detection and disambiguation of left and right clicks, and using two fingers to tap and click should be easier. These new improvements also help to reduce false positives on two-finger, and they improve pinch-to-zoom detection. And there are new changes to reduce inadvertent zooming when panning. In the Touchpad section, you can enable or disable the feature, decide whether to keep the touchpad enabled when connecting a mouse, and change the cursor speed. Taps allows you to customize the touchpad sensitivity, and enable different actions using your fingers, such as "tap twice to drag to multiple select" and "press the lower right corner of the touchpad to right-click." Scroll and zoom lets you control scrolling direction, drag two fingers scroll, and pinch to zoom. In addition, you can customize gestures using three fingers with the "Swipes" drop-down menu, and change what happens when using three-finger taps (for example, Search with Cortana, Action Center, Middle mouse button, Custom, and more). The Touchpad settings page also includes a button to reset settings and gestures to defaults. Network & internet On Settings > Network & internet, the Status page doesn't add new options, but now you'll see a message that recommends you use a metered connection if you're using a limited data plan, and you will see a new link to change connections properties. On Settings > Network & internet, the Wi-Fi page has been updated and now combines "Wi-Fi Sense" and "Paid Wi-Fi Services" into a new section called "Wi-Fi services." While you'll no longer see the mention for "Wi-Fi Sense," the feature continues to be there as "Connect to suggested open hotspots." Windows 10 version 1703 also introduces the ability to turn off a wireless connection and set a schedule to turn it back on automatically. If you turn off your Wi-Fi connection, you'll now see a drop-down menu that lets you connect again after one or four hours, one day, or manually (default), which allows you to keep your Wi-Fi connection off until you decide to turn it back on. Additionally, clicking the Manage known networks link, you can now add new wireless networks manually. On Settings > Network & internet, the Ethernet page remains virtually the same, but you can now access the properties of the adapter and configure an Ethernet connection as metered if you're using a limited data plan. On Settings > Network & internet, the Data usage page has been updated with new visual elements to display how space is being used for each data type. And inside the usage details page, you can now change the view to show usage per network adapter. Personalization On Settings > Personalization, the Background page includes the ability to set a custom solid background color. Just select the Solid color (or Picture) option from the Background drop-down menu, and click the Custom color button to pick the color you want. You can click More to add a particular color using RGB, HSV, or hexadecimal color annotation. On Settings > Personalization, the Colors page on the Creators Update receives a number of tweaks. For example, the Settings app now saves the last five colors you have recently used, in case you want to revert changes. Under the More options section, instead of having three toggle switches, you'll now get a toggle switch to make Start, Taskbar, and Action Center transparent, and check boxes to enable or disable accent colors on title bars, Start, Taskbar, and Action Center. You can also click the Custom color button to pick virtually any accent color you want. As you select your color, the preview will let you know if a color you choose will be hard to read or if the color is not supported. Clicking on More, you have the ability to enter specific colors using RGB, HSV, or hexadecimal color annotation. Also, the Automatic pick an accent color from my background option has been relocated to the top of the Colors page. On Settings > Personalization, the Themes page gets updated, and now you can customize your Windows 10 experience using themes within the Settings app. The new page displays the current theme information with options to customize different settings, including background, color, sounds, and mouse cursor. Under "Apply a theme," you'll find a list of all themes installed on your device. And there is a link to get more themes from the Store, where you'll find additional free and paid themes. (At the time of this writing there are more than 180 themes, and we expect more to show up in the future.) Apps Apps is a new section that appears in the Creators Update, and it houses all apps-related settings (Apps & features, Default apps, Offline maps, and Apps for Websites), which previously were found inside of System. On Settings > Apps, to the Apps & features page Microsoft adds new changes to keep pushing Windows Store apps. Starting with version 1703, you can now block users from installing apps that aren't from the Store, which helps to keep your device protected and running at peak performance. The new feature gives you three choices: Allow apps from anywhere: This is the default option, and it allows you to keep installing apps as you would normally do from any source. Warm me before installing apps from outside the Store: When you select this option, you'll still be able to install any app, but you'll get a warning letting you know the app isn't from the Store. If there is an equivalent app, you'll also see a link to get it from the Store. Allow apps from the Store only: As the option suggests, choosing this option will prevent anyone from installing any application that isn't from the Store. One small, but interesting addition also appears when you click the Advanced options link of an app, which now includes Sort by and Filter by controls for app add-ons. Accounts On Settings > Accounts, the Sign in options page now includes a new feature called Dynamic Lock. Dynamic Lock is a part of Windows Hello that when enabled detects when you're away and automatically locks your computer. This feature is particularly useful for organizations to add an extra layer of security for employees who may have to work with sensitive information. To configure this feature, you must first pair your phone using Bluetooth, and then go to Settings > Accounts > Sign in options, and turn on the Allow Windows to detect when you're away and automatically lock your device option. Time & language On Settings > Time & language, the Date & time page hasn't changed significantly, but now you have a drop-down menu that allows you to follow the Simplified and Traditional Chinese lunar calendars in the taskbar. Gaming The Creators Update for Windows 10 also introduces a new Gaming section identified with the Xbox logo with a slew of options to configure Game bar, Game DVR, Broadcasting, and Game Mode. On Settings > Gaming, the Game bar page features a number of new options related to the Game bar feature, including options to enable game recording, screenshots, and broadcast using Beam. You can configure Game bar to open using a button on your controller and decide whether to show the bar when playing games in full-screen. In addition, the page includes a section to let you change the keyboard shortcuts to use the Game bar on Windows 10. On Settings > Gaming, the Game DVR page includes options to control game clips and screenshots settings. In this page, you can change where to save by default your game clips and screenshots. The "Background recording" section allows you to configure game and audio recording settings, such as sound quality and video frame rate, and there is an option to set the maximum length for the "record this" feature. On Settings > Gaming, the Broadcasting page is the place you'll go to configure how your games appear when you broadcast using Beam. On this page, you can set audio quality, whether to use a camera, and there is an option to block the mouse cursor from appearing in broadcasts. On Settings > Gaming, the Game Mode page includes an option to enable Game Mode, which is perhaps the most exciting feature for gamers in the Windows 10 Creators Update. Game Mode is a feature that has been designed to optimize your computer performance by prioritizing CPU and GPU resources for an improved gaming experience. To use this feature, you need to turn on the Use Game Mode toggle switch. Then when you're playing a game, use the Windows key + G keyboard shortcut to open Game bar, click the Settings button, and make sure to check the Use Game Mode for this game option. Ease of Access On Settings > Ease of Access, the Narrator page now includes the ability to download and install braille support on Windows 10. After installing the new components, you'll see a new Braille (beta) section, which you can use to enable or disable the feature, add braille display, change language and table grade. Privacy On Settings > Privacy, the General page doesn't introduce new options, but the number of choices gets cut down to three. On Settings > Privacy, the Speech, inking, & typing page remains virtually the same, but the page has been updated with new information and a new button to turn off speech services and typing suggestions. On Settings > Privacy, the Feedback & diagnostics page removes the drop-down menu, and now there are two options (Basic and Full) you can choose from. Additionally, the page now includes a new option to let Microsoft provide more tailored experiences with relevant tips and recommendations using diagnostic data. On Settings > Privacy, the Tasks page is new, and it's intended to help you control whether or not certain apps can access your tasks. However, apps like Mail and Calendar always have access to your tasks. On Settings > Privacy, the App diagnostics page is new, and lets you control whether apps can use diagnostic information from other apps on your computer to work as intended. Diagnostic information may include the name of apps, user account name, processor, hard drive, and memory usage. Update & security On Settings > Update & security, the Windows Update page has been updated to make it easier to see if your device has the latest update at a glance with a new green badge in the bottom-right corner of the Windows Update icon. On the Advanced options page, you now get an option to pause updates on your device for up to seven days. If you use Active hours, you'll notice a new interface experience that is more consistent with the Settings design language, and now Windows 10 lets you set up active hours up to 18 hours. In Restart options, you now have the choice to get notification reminders about a pending restart to apply new updates. Microsoft is also making some additional changes to the update process logic, and it'll detect if you're actively using your device with a projector or another device, to prevent restarting to apply new updates. In addition, starting with the Creators Update, Microsoft is introducing the Unified Update Platform (UUP), which is a new mechanism to make updates smaller and faster to install. According to the company, updates will be up to 35 percent smaller. On Settings > Update & security, the Windows Defender page no longer includes the antivirus settings, as Windows 10 now includes a new Windows Defender Security Center dashboard to control antivirus and other security settings. On Settings > Update & security, the Troubleshoot page is new, and it adds a number of troubleshooters to help you troubleshoot and fix common Windows 10 problems. These troubleshooters are nothing new as they were part of the Control Panel for a long time, but now Microsoft is migrating them to the Settings app. The new page provides the following troubleshooters: Internet connections. Playing Audio. Printer. Windows Update. Blue Screen. Bluetooth. Hardware and Devices. HomeGroup. Incoming Connections. Keyboard. Network Adapter. Power. Program Compatibility Troubleshooter. Recording Audio. Search and Indexing. Shared Folders. Speech. Video Playback. Windows Store Apps. Mixed reality Mixed reality is a brand-new section in the Settings app, and it's only available when you setup the Mixed Reality Portal app or connect a new virtual reality headset. On Settings > Mixed reality, the Audio and speech page includes options to configure which speakers and microphone to use while in mixed reality mode. Under "Speech," there is an option to enable speech recognition while in mixed reality. On Settings > Mixed Reality, the Headset display page has the settings to calibrate the value and improve the quality of the experience. The page also includes a Default button to go back to the predefined settings. On Settings > Mixed Reality, the Uninstall page allows you to uninstall Mixed Reality if you're having issues, or because you simply don't use it anymore, and you want to free up some space on your device. Removing the Mixed reality components only requires that you click the Uninstall button, and while the Mixed Reality Portal app will remain on your computer, you can always right-click the app and select Uninstall from the Start menu. At any time, you can install the components again and run the setup to start over. Wrapping things up Although the Settings app is still a work in progress, the Creators Update introduces a lot of new improvements and tweaks that make the experience a little more complete. And with all the new features that Windows 10 now migrates over to Settings, you'll have to make fewer trips to Control Panel. What do you think about the new changes for Settings?

I wasn't able to get the upgrade to work as it would get to 99% and then just stop, so I had to go to the media folder within the upgrade installation media itself and run the setup from there, forcing the upgrade.

There was no way to fix this, and recovery wouldn't repair it, CMD prompt couldn't reach my C:\ system drive from recovery because it was rooted in X:\, and I couldn't boot into safe mode because every time I tried, Windows would force the last tidbit of setup on me, asking me to set up my privacy settings and Cortana, killing the safemode boot.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Xiaomi becomes India's most preferred smartphone brand: 5 major tips other OEMs must take to succeed Xiaomi's effective pricing and premium offering mainly drove the company towards success. Sami Khan   April 8, 2017 19:39 IST People stand near a logo of Xiaomi ahead of the launching ceremony of Xiaomi Phone 4, in Beijing, July 22, 2014.REUTERS/Jason Lee Xiaomi has been long enough in India to make itself one of the most popular smartphone brands. The company's foundation was based on affordable and premium smartphone it once offered to disrupt the market and slowly moved towards flagship phones with a higher price range. Ever since its entry into the smartphone business, Xiaomi had a fair share of fame, but it is not without struggles and competition. Several other Chinese smartphone brands followed Xiaomi's lead to prioritise India as one of the key markets to sell their phones. The formula worked well in their favour. As the competition got stern, brands like OPPO and Vivo took lead and recorded a substantial growth in the industry not just in India but also on a global level. But Xiaomi used a smart approach to remain in the competition despite the uphill battle it faced with its rivals, which also include giants like Samsung. A new survey by Strategy Analytics comes with some promising news for Xiaomi. According to the report, which was published earlier this week, Xiaomi was ranked the most preferred smartphone brand in India. This was fuelled by the majority of Android device owners' intention to upgrade their devices to one of Xiaomi's smartphones in 2017. The surprising element here is that Xiaomi outbid the industry's leaders Samsung and Apple to earn the respectable position in the Indian market. As per the report, 26 percent users prefer Xiaomi for their next smartphone purchase, which is higher than Samsung's 12 percent and Micromax's 2 percent share. What is the secret behind Xiaomi's brand value, you might ask? Here are a few key elements that Xiaomi did better than others in the market to earn its rightful place.  Pricing Xiaomi has always ensured that its products are priced effectively to attract consumers. It is the affordable pricing of the smartphones that got Xiaomi where it is right now. For a market like India, where consumers demand value-for-money products, Xiaomi set a new benchmark for other OEMs to follow. If any smartphone brand in India has to succeed, it has to spend extra time on pricing its products right. Premium hardware Even with low pricing, Xiaomi has managed to pack premium hardware. Even the company's budget smartphones priced under Rs 10,000 pack high-end looks and mid-range specs that consumers cannot turn down. Xiaomi delivered on the demands of Indian consumers by giving them a good camera, high-resolution screens, faster performing chipsets, 4G capabilities and ample storage. XiaomiENMIUI ( Xiaomi's Official English Blog) User experience There are several Android handset makers, but hardly some of them manage to stand out in the crowd. Xiaomi is definitely one of them and it made sure to promote its MIUI custom ROM to consumers and made it one of the top selling points for its phones. The level of customization and ease of access offered in MIUI software gives users a refreshing Android experience in an Android smartphone, which is something other OEMs must seriously consider. MIUI 8Xiaomi India via Twitter Online and offline presence Xiaomi started off as an online-only brand, where it successfully sold hundreds and thousands of smartphones through e-commerce websites. In fact, Xiaomi popularized the idea of flash sales in India by selling thousands of units in a matter of few seconds. But the company did not stick to just that. It arrived in offline stores as well by partnering with retailers and distributors to give consumers access to its phones from stores. XiaomiXiaomi via Twitter Marketing strategies While following the regular marketing stints such as advertisements, Xiaomi also connected with fans through social media platforms. It is one of the few smartphone brands that have a strong social media presence. It helps Xiaomi connect with customers and fans directly and get immediate feedbacks on what's working and what's not. This approach helps the brand grow by correcting its mistakes and delivering a comforting assurance to its customers any time of the day. Xiaomi Mi Fan FestivalXiaomi India official page (screen-shot) Xiaomi's strong fan following on social media has also earned a name for its fans and they call themselves "Mi Fans." The company hosts Mi Fan Festivals among other sales to keep its presence felt across board.  Related Will Xiaomi Mi 6 be a flagship killer? Xiaomi Mi Max 2 to be released after Mi 6?

CalAmp, Intel, and Fitbit are all making big bets on the IoT -- but investors waiting for these stocks to turn around should read this first. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Apr 8, 2017 at 9:19AM There are plenty of companies that are already benefiting from the Internet of Things (IoT) trend, and this year is shaping up to be a great time to invest in this market. But not all of the companies that are betting on IoT are doing so hot. Namely, Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and CalAmp (NASDAQ:CAMP) are trailing the S&P 500 over the past year. So does their current bad fortune translate into opportunities for investors? Let's take a look. Image source: Getty Images. The wearable-tech play Fitbit is a leader in the wearable-technology space -- which is part of the broader IoT market -- right now, but its position hasn't translated into gains for its investors. The company's share price has fallen 62% over the past 12 months, as you can see from the chart below. Fitbit data by YCharts. A terrible holiday quarter had a lot to do with Fitbit's share-price drop. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 fell 19.4%, from $711.6 million down to $573.8 million. That fall forced a net income loss of $146.3 million in the quarter and an earnings per share (EPS) loss of $0.56. The collapse of the top and bottom line came as sales for the company's fitness devices hit just 6.5 million in the quarter, down 20.7% year over year. Gross margin also tumbled from 48.9% in the year-ago quarter to just 22.1% in Q4 2016.  Fitbit didn't paint a rosy picture for the current quarter or the rest of 2017, either. Revenue will be between $270 million and $290 million in the first quarter, down from $505 million a year ago. And non-GAAP EPS will be a loss between $0.18 and $0.20. Topping it all off, the company expects full-year revenue to be between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, down from $2.17 billion in 2016.  There's no denying Fitbit's place in the wearable-tech market, but if investors are looking for a solid IoT bargain, they may want to look elsewhere. Wearables competition is only getting more intense, and as Fitbit is already failing to deliver solid gains when it has a dominant position in the space, I don't have much faith that the company will deliver when Apple and others are taking even more market share. That's why I'd be comfortable leaving this stock right where it is.  The emerging IoT player Investors keeping up with Intel may wonder why the company makes it onto the battered IoT stock list, considering the company's share price is up more than 13% over the past 12 months. The problem for Intel's stock is that over that same period the S&P 500 has gained about 15%. Intel data by YCharts. This failure to beat the market lands Intel on the beaten-up IoT stock list, but it may not be all bad news for long. Intel recently made a bid to purchase Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), an Israel-based company that makes advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for automakers around the world.  Mobileye currently has about 70% of the ADAS market, and Intel is looking to add the company into its fold to help it boost its position in the driverless-car space. Connected cars and semi-autonomous vehicles are part of the broader IoT market, and Intel is betting that its $15 billion bid for Mobileye will give it a lot of runway in the space to sell more of its chips.  Intel's been focusing more on IoT as it looks for more revenue growth in the wake of the dwindling PC market. The company's IoT business was its fastest-growing revenue segment in 2016 (popping 15%), though it accounted for just 4.4% of total revenue. The Mobileye acquisition, expected to close later this year, would be a huge step in the right direction for Intel as it would allow the company to boost sales of its processors and get its foot in the door of the driverless-car market, which is expected to be worth as much as $77 billion by 2035. With its strong IoT revenue growth and its Mobileye purchase, I think Intel's opportunities outweigh its recent misses -- making this stock a solid IoT bargain right now.  The IoT pure play CalAmp makes equipment and software to connect industrial equipment -- like Caterpillar's earth-moving equipment -- to the internet. But CalAmp's stock has suffered for a while, dropping about 27% in 2016 and falling more than 7% over the past 12 months. CalAmp data by YCharts. But there are signs of life in this IoT pure play. The company made some modest revenue gains of 11.6% in fiscal third quarter 2017, and management is forecasting revenue growth of 15.7% year over year at the midpoint in the current fiscal fourth quarter. The company believes some of the macro headwinds it faced last year are now behind it, and it's looking at revenue growth from one of its key customers, Caterpillar, in the coming year. Caterpillar contributed $6 million to Q3 revenue, and that figure is expected to increase to $7 million to $8 million in Q4 and into the next fiscal year.  CalAmp may be beaten-down now, but it's hard to ignore the company's potential in the Industrial Internet of Things. This market is expected to be worth $195.4 billion by 2022, according to research and consulting company MarketsandMarkets. There's certainly some risk with CalAmp's business being a pure play on the IoT, but that also means there's a lot of upside if the company can anticipate the market correctly. For that reason, I remain cautiously optimistic that CalAmp could be a strong long-term IoT play. Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Chris Wilkinson - Apr 8, 2017 2:00 pm UTC Enlarge Chris Wilkinson reader comments 80 Share this story Limited to an anachronistic 1200 bits per second, it took several moments for the green-phosphor ASCII art to scroll from the bottom to the top of the screen. A login prompt and a blinking cursor invited me to continue deeper: Enter GUEST for a quick look around.) Enter your ID#, HANDLE, NEW or ‘?’:_ What would David Lightman think? I found myself at the guarded gates of an online community that had been disconnected for decades. This was mid-2016, but for all intents and purposes, it might as well have been 1986. Today, many can be forgiven for thinking that the digital communications revolution kicked off during the mid-1990s, when there was simply an explosion of media and consumer interest in the World Wide Web. Just a decade earlier, however, the future was now for the hundreds of thousands of users already using home computers to communicate with others over the telephone network. The online culture of the 1980s was defined by the pervasiveness of bulletin board systems (BBS), expensive telephone bills, and the dulcet tones of a 1200 baud connection (or 2400, if you were very lucky). While many Ars readers certainly recall bulletin board systems with pixelated reverence, just as many are likely left scratching their heads in confusion ("what exactly is a BBS, anyway?").  Further ReadingModems, wArEz, and ANSI art: Remembering BBS life at 2400bps It’s a good thing, then, that a dedicated number of vintage computing hobbyists are resurrecting these digital communities that were once thought lost to time. With some bulletin board systems being rebooted from long-forgotten floppy disks and with some still running on original 8-bit hardware, the current efforts of these seasoned sysops (that is, system administrators) provide a very literal glimpse into the state of online affairs from more than three decades ago. And while services such as the Internet Archive are an excellent resource for studying the growth of the World Wide Web as it's frozen in time, these hobbyists are opening portals today for modern users to go places that have been long forgotten. A hybrid hardware affair Just as the BBS culture invokes fond memories for many of its previous subscribers, its rapid fade into obscurity ensured that an entire generation of Internet users would have no idea that it ever existed. For many (including myself, it turns out), it would be easy to mistake a bulletin board system for some kind of first-generation website without understanding the fundamental differences between the two. It’s easy to see why this happened. Many authors have already recounted the meteoric rise of the World Wide Web and the demise of protocols that came before it. Needless to say, the Web offered a significant evolution over what came before it. It was also around this time that hardware obsolescence was becoming a problem. Owners of older 8-bit machines had little reason to maintain their hardware as their userbase migrated to the open pastures of the Web, and the number of bulletin board systems plummeted accordingly. At the dawn of the new millennium, very few systems remained accessible. Despite the threat of extinction, however, it turns out that some sysops never quite gave up on the BBS. In February of 2016, a sysop with the handle "Skip" brought a BBS called Dura-Europos back online after a hiatus of more than 23 years. The BBS had originally run from October 1986 through to April 1993. As you might imagine, getting it up and running again wasn’t easy. “I had tried putting it back online several years earlier after I purchased an Apple IIe Platinum from eBay, but it failed,” explains Skip. Naturally, our interview took place within the Dura-Europos bulletin board system. “The main reason I failed to get it online several years ago is that I was not aware of the Raspberry Pi and TCPser, those were the two missing ingredients.” Further Reading10 Raspberry Pi creations that show how amazing the tiny PC can be Before Telnet and the Internet took over, the only way to connect to a bulletin board was by dialing the correct phone number. The telephone network carried the connection just like a phone call, and the modems on each end of the line would modulate and demodulate the signal for their respective computers. (No Internet required!) While this approach is still possible in 2017, it comes with some caveats. VoIP services are almost entirely out of the question, as the digital compression used doesn’t allow computer signals (or Fax) to reliably travel from point to point. It’s worth noting that very slow speeds, around 300bps or less, are more likely to work over VoIP. There are also very few systems out there that are still connected directly to POTS (plain old telephone system), so even if you did have access to a real copper phone line and were willing to pay the call costs, there’s not much hope of finding a BBS out in the wild. Want to see for yourself?For Windows users, this author recommends using PuTTY to connect to bulletin board systems that have migrated to the Telnet protocol. Mac users can use the inbuilt Terminal, while Linux users have several options available. If you just want a quick look around, however, you can also use the Telnet client through a Web browser at http://sfhqbbs.org/telnet-dura.php. If you are using vintage hardware, the process for connecting to bulletin boards is outside the scope of this article (but it is certainly possible and wholeheartedly recommended). Dura-Europos can be found at: dura-bbs.net, using port 6359. As Skip soon found out, TCPser solves all of these problems by emulating a standard Hayes modem. On one side, it sends and receives data at the correct specifications over a standard serial connection to your preferred vintage computer, just as a real modem would have done. On the other side, it sends and transmits the same data out to the Internet (hence "TCPser"). A similar setup on the other side of the connection completes the route—however, the client has the luxury of using a standard Telnet connection on modern hardware instead of TCPser if they so choose. For the interested client in 2017, it’s simply a matter of "dialing" the BBS using a domain name and port number instead of a phone number in their preferred terminal software. Most software will accept any string of characters, not just numbers. For those that don’t, TCPser can also map any string of numbers to a particular domain name (much like a bookmark in a Web browser) to get around this limitation. So today, instead of using a phone number to connect to Dura-Europos as was the case originally, a user types: dura-bbs.net:6359. Enlarge / We came home with an Apple II Plus recently and obviously missed its true calling—BBS resurrection. Sean Gallagher While TCPser can be run on almost any modern computer, the Raspberry Pi is a low-cost alternative that sits neatly between a vintage computer and the Internet, either over Wi-Fi or ethernet. That was just part of the problem solved for Skip. "I had a complete set of 3.5-inch backup disks I made before taking it down. Actually two sets; I was a believer in backing things up… I used a 3.5-inch drive to restore the disks to the CFFA3000,” he says. The CFFA3000 is a modern peripheral for Apple ][ computers that adds mass storage using flash media and can be used to replace floppy disks and hard disks. For Skip, it’s a viable alternative to the original 32mb hard drive he had with his original setup and those 3.5-inch diskettes. Not only is modern flash storage infinitely cheaper and more accessible than the correct vintage hard drives, the I/O is also a lot faster despite the board still being limited to 4800bps. Further ReadingAfter 23 years, the Apple II gets another OS update Still, much of the hardware is legitimately vintage despite these modern luxuries. “The Apple //e is the only hardware the GBBS Pro software runs on, and it's an excuse to use my Apple //e Platinum," Skip says. "It has two Super Serial Cards, an AE Transwarp accelerator, AE TimeMaster, and a CFFA 3000 compact flash drive.” The Transwarp card boosts the Apple //e’s 65C02 processor from 1mhz to 3.6mhz, adding 256kb of RAM as well. This further increases the bulletin board’s I/O speeds, especially when users are loading games. The TimeMaster card adds a battery-backed real-time clock to Apple ][ systems and helps with the ordering and record-keeping of posts on the bulletin board by adding time stamps. These cards were a relatively common sight in Apple ][ systems, leading to an in-built RTC on the Apple IIgs. With the correct software loaded into the flash storage and TCPser running on the Pi, Dura-Europos started receiving calls. Skip was ready to party like it was 1993 all over again.

If it fails again, all is lost. By Cho Mu-Hyun | April 8, 2017 -- 12:45 GMT (05:45 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Think of an LG phone. What comes to mind? Nothing strikes me immediately, what about you? The South Korean tech giant's G6 is a competently-made smartphone. As ZDNet's Matthew Miller points out, LG came back strong with the G6. Sales in the US began on Friday, where the South Korean tech giant is now focusing its marketing efforts. But LG's biggest problem goes further than a single phone. How the G6 performs and what LG has in-store for its V line in the fall will determine whether the company can survive what is basically a Game of Thrones-style smartphone market. (Houses Nokia, HTC, Xiaomi, and Motorola are all out of the game.) It's all about having a consistent strategy that lets consumers know the company brand will always hold certain values. Latest news on Asia ​Samsung to launch Asiana Airlines edition Galaxy S8 ​LG to post second-highest operating profit for first quarter Samsung boss attends first hearing of bribery trial ​Samsung expects second-highest profits for first quarter Huawei phones facing possible UK ban after High Court decision A brief look at LG's smartphone launch history shows constant flip-flopping in terms of branding, design, and features. First it was the Optimus in 2010, which ended with the Optimus G in 2012 when the company decided to keep the "G" and drop "Optimus". The G2 and G3 were fine phones, but the G4 had a leather backcover option that I don't think anybody particularly asked for, although it was popular with a certain niche. Constant changes have reflected LG's anxiety about its place in the market from the very start. It was late to join the smartphone fray, and it only began to establish its product identity with the G2 in 2013. But by that time, Samsung already established itself as the leader in Android. It is also about positioning. LG always tried to establish itself, and still does, as a peer to Apple and Samsung. It refused to position itself as a mid-tier phone maker competing with Chinese makers, which makes sense since it didn't have much smartphone sway in mainland China to begin with. Its main markets are the US and Korea, where it still has some clout in mobile and is a well-respected brand in other consumer electronics. The decision to make the G5 modular came from this pressure to differentiate its phones from "rivals" Apple and Samsung. I respect that courage, but in the end, it only confused consumers as to what it is an LG phone actually offers. It's no coincidence that LG began losses in the second quarter of 2015 with the launch of the G4 -- losses that got worse with the G5. There is very little core value throughout its flagship line. And that is what the firm needs. Of course, to a certain point, being flexible in the market is important. Samsung dropped its plastic design starting with the Galaxy S6 to go all metal, and bravely dropped the removable battery feature. It was worth dropping one feature for another because clearly Samsung believed there was more to be gained than lost. The Galaxy S8 is a result of this evolution. And, most importantly, it was addressing a consumer demand to drop the plastic design in favour of metal, which was not as "random" as a leather back cover or a modular design. LG should take its cue from rising smartphone vendor Huawei, which has capitalized on its partnership with Leica well to market the P10. Its well-thought-out partnership and marketing plan aims directly at a influential niche group, differentiating itself from Apple and Samsung without going to far. It shows a good focus and is money well-spent. LG clearly has no intention of considering itself lower than the top smartphone maker. In that case, it needs two things: consistency and focus. Apple has its own brand-defining software. Samsung has the best hardware and display. Huawei has the best camera. LG needs its own definition and a consistent strategy. It must stick to the fundamentals, as its mobile boss Juno Cho previously said, while keeping a ear out for what consumers actually want. This year may be its last chance.

It’s called Reachability, but not everyone is a huge fan of it. Here’s how to disable it. Reachability can be accessed by simply double-tapping on the Home button. This is different than double-clicking. Tapping involves just resting your finger on top of the Touch ID fingerprint sensor without actually clicking down on the Home button. By double-tapping on the Home button, the entire screen moves down about halfway, allowing you easier access to the top of the screen. This feature is great for users who are constantly using their iPhone 6 one-handed. However, many people also use their iPhone 6 with two hands, meaning that Reachability is merely useless in this case. While Reachability can be a useful feature for those who need it, here’s how to disable it if you find that you never use the feature in the first place. Turning Off Reachability If you don’t use Reachability that often (or ever), it’s actually really easy to disable it. Just follow these simple steps: Open up the Settings app. Tap on Accessibility. Scroll all the way down to the bottom and you’ll see a settings for Reachability. Turn the toggle switch next to Reachability to Off. Reachability is now turned off and double-tapping on the Home button will no longer activate the feature. If after you disabled Reachability and it still activates with a double-tap, try re-enabling it and then disabling it again to see if that works. If that still doesn’t work, perform a hard reset by holding down the Home button and the Power button at the same time until you see the Apple logo. Let your iPhone 6 reboot and then the problem should be fixed. Other New iPhone 6 Features Reachability isn’t the only new feature on the iPhone 6 and in iOS 8. In fact, there are a lot of new features on the iPhone 6 that make it a worthy upgrade for older iPhone owners. The most notable new feature is the obviously larger screen, with the iPhone 6 sporting a 4.7-inch display, while the iPhone 6 Plus wears a larger 5.5-inch screen. The former has a higher resolution of 1334×750, while the iPhone 6 Plus has an even higher resolution at 1920×1080. Another noticeable aspect about the iPhone 6 is its complete redesign, with a thinner body than the iPhone 5s and rounded edges instead of squared-off edges that have existed since the iPhone 4 was released in 2010. The iPhone 6 also includes Apple Pay, which is the company’s new digital payment platform that lets you buy stuff at retail stores with a wave of the iPhone and a tap of the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. While the user interface on the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 remains largely the same of previous models, the iPhone 6 Plus practically has an all-new UI that’s reminiscent of the iPad, with two-paned windows in some apps and the ability to even use the home screen horizontally, which has never been done on an iPhone before. There’s even independent cut, copy and paste keys on the iPhone 6 Plus keyboard, which is something we could see in iOS 8 for the iPad in the future. The iPhone 6 is also using Apple’s new A8 processor, and while Apple didn’t say what speed it’s clocked at, it’s safe to assume that it offers faster speeds than the iPhone 5s. Apple says that the A8 offers 20% faster performance with 50% faster graphics. The M7 motion processor that was first introduced in the iPhone 5s is also getting an update, only this time Apple is naming it the M8 (not to be confused with the HTC One M8). The new chip can tell the difference between cycling and running, and it can also calculate distance and elevation. It does this with the help from a built-in barometer, which uses air pressure to measure relative elevation. 3 Responses 04/19/2015 JS Reply FYI, You go to Settings, then go to General (you left that part out), then Accessibility then Reachability. Details matter. 07/19/2016 Michael Plaice Reply Thanks so much for the info on turning off reachability. It really bugged me! 04/08/2017 Carol Reply Reacheability was one of the worst features on the iphone 6… Really irritating… I kept triggering it by accident. Good to know it’s possible to turn it off. Too bad it took me 2 years to come look for a solution! Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

 A visually impaired programmer explains how he does it — and what he wishes more tech companies knew Matt Weinberger Apr. 8, 2017, 9:00 AM 1,368 facebook linkedin twitter email print Inmoji Senior Software Engineer Chris Nagle Nagel By the time Chris Nagle enrolled at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst as an undergraduate, his vision had already started to fade. "Going to college, I knew my sight wasn't getting any better, any time soon," Nagle says.  So rather than going into law, or anthropology, or anything else that might require a lot of reading, Nagle chose to study computer science. As a lifelong fan of puzzles and riddles, he saw programming as a way to put his creative problem-solving skills to the test. For him, coding happens more in the mind than it does on the keyboard. "To me, it's much more of a detail-oriented process," says Nagle. After college, Nagle worked for tech firms like e-mail marketing company Constant Contact before landing in his present job as a Senior Software Engineer with Inmoji — a Boston-area startup that creates custom messaging app stickers for brands. In addition to his day job, Nagle also volunteers with Blind New World, working with students and companies to help remove some of the stigma around hiring people with visual disabilities. Nagle calls it the "fear of the unknown," and it's something he's working to fight. Working At work, Nagle's setup is pretty much like everyone else's: He uses the same Mac and the same software as the rest of his colleagues in Inmoji's small engineering team. Nagle says the biggest immediate difference is that he keeps his monitor at an angle closer to his eyes and makes good use of Apple's accessibility features. Inmoji CTO Jarrod McLean praises Nagle's ability to get "the large overall mental picture" of the systems underpinning the company's software. And in customer meetings, McLean says, Nagle has the whole presentation memorized, to the point where nobody notices he's not reading from notes or consulting his slides. Nagle is, by all accounts, very good at his job, and McLean and the rest of Inmoji respect him for it. Which, is the key to the message he's trying to get across: "It's about the respect."  Respect Nagle tells the story of a recent staff meeting of the nonprofit Institute for Community Inclusion, where he volunteers.  At that meeting, he found that the agenda was printed in font so small that he couldn't read it. He couldn't help but laugh at the irony of an organization for the visually impaired that didn't consider the needs of the visually impaired. (They've since fixed it after he pointed it out, he says.) "Even the people who are focused on it can't do it right," Nagle says.  Inmoji makes branded emoji for marketing campaigns. Inmoji Nagle's point: Don't stress too much over doing things right or saying the wrong thing. When he's at the office, it's "more about respect," he says — the recognition that he earned his spot at the company, the same as everybody else, thanks to his skills. Even jokes and teasing are okay with Nagle, he says, as long as nobody forgets that fundamental respect. "Hopefully the parallels to blind and visually impaired people in the workplace, to women and other minorities in tech are self-evident," Nagle says. Nagle knows what it's like to feel a certain degree of paranoia that your coworkers only think you're there to meet a diversity quota.  The best way to keep your workplace from falling prey to that paranoia, says Nagle, is empathy. Because, Nagle says, if you show everybody their due respect, "you can help remove those feelings of unjustness."

The report ranks nearly every county nationwide on 35 factors that affect health, including education, transportation, housing, jobs, diet and exercise. Carver County was ranked second in Minnesota for factors that contribute to health outcomes and determine length and quality of life. Health factors include 30 measures related to health behaviors, clinical care, physical environment, and social and economic factors. It was at the top in graduation rates — now at 95 percent — and jobs. Unemployment in Carver County has dipped to 3.2 percent. Counties on Minnesota's Iron Range, such as Beltrami and Itasca, were ranked lowest on the list due to high rates of obesity, children in poverty and alcohol-related driving deaths. LIZ SAWYER Rosemount Steeple Center to get $290K worth of repairs Rosemount's Steeple Center will receive a $290,000 exterior upgrade to restore its brickwork, windows, walls and trim. The City Council awarded a contract for the work on Tuesday to Versacon Inc., after officials accepted its bid from among five submitted. The work is scheduled to being in May and wrap up in July, and Rosemount will use its capital improvement fund to pay for the repairs. The fixes were recommended by a 2014 exterior maintenance study commissioned by the city. An expansion in 2015 added a catering kitchen, expanded restrooms, a lobby area with cafe-style seating, an outdoor patio area, three multipurpose rooms and a conference room. The Steeple Center opened in 2010 in the former St. Joseph's Catholic Church building, at the north end of downtown. It is open to the public during the week and hosts a variety of senior activities and arts programming, as well as private events. Erin Adler Farmington Caesar, new police K-9, to take over for Bosco The Farmington Police Department's new K-9, Caesar, will start work in May. The dog will replace the department's previous police dog, Bosco, who retired. Caesar began a 12-week training course with detective Chris Lutz in March. The dog's $13,000 initial price tag was paid for with donations. During the month of April, Farmington Liquors will collect supplies and money to go toward Bosco's ongoing vet bills, food equipment and training. For more information, go to http://bit.ly/2nghs3W/. Erin Adler APPLE VALLEY Dakota County to expand gun permit staffing The Dakota County Board is expected to approve a new full-time staffer to process gun permit applications at its Western Service Center in Apple Valley, in response to an ongoing increase in the number of permit applications since 2011. The new hire was approved Tuesday by a board committee. The county also plans to create a new centralized area for processing permits at the service center, where the new staffer and a current employee will process gun permits. The new employee's salary and benefits for the nine remaining months of the year — approximately $45,500 — would be funded through the Permit to Carry revenue fund. Dakota County processed 5,006 gun permit applications in 2016, an increase of 38 percent over the previous year. In 2015, there was a 19 percent increase in permit applications. Cities with the highest number of 2016 applications were Burnsville, 578; Eagan, 574; Lakeville, 569; Farmington, 498; and Apple Valley, 445. With the increasing number of applications come more background checks and the probability of more permit denials and appeals, which must be completed within a specific time and require additional research and paperwork. In 2016, 45 applications were denied in Dakota County, up from 30 in 2015.

Image Credit: Ken Yeung/VentureBeat At its Unpacked 2017 event last week, Samsung unveiled a ton of new hardware and software products. The star of the show, of course, was the Samsung Galaxy S8 / S8+, the latest iterations of the company’s flagship smartphone. As we approach U.S. availability, on April 21, here’s a quick recap of five notable features on the Galaxy S8 / S8+. 1. Chips The Samsung S8 / S8+ comes in two chip variants — the U.S. and Chinese incarnation sports Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835, while elsewhere the devices pack Samsung’s very own Exynos 8895. Without getting into too much detail here, both chips are roughly the same, and consumers won’t experience much difference in terms of performance. However, the most notable facet of both is that they represent the first 10 nanometer (nm) chips on the market, and Samsung is among the first to adopt them in its flagship device. The smaller size gives phone makers more space to include bigger batteries or to make the device thinner, but, more importantly, the chip’s transistors are packed in more tightly, which leads to more efficient running and lower power consumption. Ultimately, it should mean an all-round better-performing device. 2. Smart assistant Above: Bixby home on the Samsung Galaxy S8. Image Credit: Ken Yeung/VentureBeat Amazon gave us Alexa, Microsoft gave us Cortana, Apple gave us Siri, and now Samsung has given us Bixby. Officially unveiled ahead of the S8 launch last week, Samsung’s new Bixby AI assistant is aimed at mobile and the Internet of Things (IoT), but its being debuted on the Samsung Galaxy S8 / S8+. According to Samsung, Bixby differs from the competition insofar as it will support “almost” every task that is available through the touchscreen. This is designed to avoid confusing users so that they’re not left wondering which commands are voice-enabled and which aren’t. At the launch of the Galaxy S8, a number of Bixby-enabled apps are already onboard, including YouTube, Facebook, and Netflix. A software development kit (SDK) will be offered in the future, allowing any developer to build Bixby-enabled apps. 3. Authentication Above: Samsung Iris Scanner As with previous devices, the Samsung Galaxy S8 / S8+ has a finger print scanner, which has been moved to the back of the unit. However, the phones also come with a number of other new biometric authentication smarts, including an Iris scanner and facial recognition. This means that in addition to PIN codes and fingerprints, you can now unlock your Galaxy device simply by looking into its eyes (well, cameras). 4. Virtual reality (VR) Above: Samsung’s new Gear VR headset and Oculus-powered controller. Image Credit: Ken Yeung / VentureBeat Samsung’s new Galaxy-branded flagships will initially only be available through carriers, starting at around $720, but they’re expected to be made available unlocked from May. Best Buy is expected to sell them unlocked for $725 (S8) and $825 (S8+). While the devices are not cheap, it’s worth noting here that they also come bundled with the new Gear VR headset and an Oculus-powered controller, which costs $130 if bought separately. It also comes with a free game pack. This could be construed as Samsung’s way of expediting the hitherto slow uptake of VR by the masses. 5. Bezel Above: The Samsung Galaxy S8+ (left) and S8 (right). Image Credit: Ken Yeung/VentureBeat Samsung has continued chipping away at the bezel on its flagship, and this year it’s providing what it calls an “infinity display.” The display on the S8 and S8+ now covers 83 percent of the entire front of the device. The bezels have been most notably shrunk at the top and bottom of the screen, which also means there is no longer a physical home button. But Samsung has managed to increase the screen size on last year’s unit without making the overall size of the device that much bigger, which is a notable achievement.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7 Plus speed test: Did Samsung finally beat Apple? Image Source: Samsung Zach Epstein @zacharye April 6th, 2017 at 10:22 AM Share Tweet Android vendors used to be obsessed with specs, largely because every smartphone out there was so similar that it was the only way to try to set their handsets apart from the rest. While companies like Samsung, LG and HTC don’t focus on specs quite as much anymore in their advertising and marketing, flagship phones obviously still see big spec bumps each and every year. In recent years, however, an interesting trend has emerged: Apple’s “underpowered” iPhones, which always pack fewer processor cores and less RAM than their Android rivals, regularly obliterate Android phones in real world speed tests. In fact, even year-old iPhones tend to beat brand new flagship Android phones, as we’ve also seen time and time again. Something interesting appears to be happening in 2017, however. We already saw that Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ completely crush the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in multi-core benchmark tests, but it remains to be seen how that translates to real world performance in day-to-day usage. Now, the first speed test video has been posted to YouTube. Don't Miss: 5 features on the LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8 you won’t find on any iPhone We have good news and bad news when it comes to this early real world speed test comparison. The good news is that it’s clear from the video that Samsung’s new smartphones are lightning-fast when it comes to things we do constantly on our phones, such as opening and switching apps. The bad news, however, is that this first speed test was conducted very poorly. As we’ve explain time and time again, these real world speed tests that YouTube vloggers post are very unscientific. This new test conducted by YouTube user “TECH VOICE 2 POHEN Amer” is even less controlled than most, however. While other vloggers set up a “lap” scenario where each phone races through opening and then reopening the same set of apps, the video below merely shows the narrator attempting to tap on one app after the other and then call one phone a winner each time. Long story short, this test does a very bad job of actually comparing the speeds of these two phones in real-world scenarios. What it does do, however, is show that Samsung’s new flagship phones are actually faster than the iPhone when opening some apps, which is something we really haven’t seen before. The full speed test video is embedded below, and we definitely recommend checking it out to see just how impressive the new Galaxy S8 is. As far as actually comparing Galaxy S8 and iPhone 7 Plus performance, we’ll have to wait for some of the more experienced vloggers to get their hands on Samsung’s new flagships before we draw any conclusions.
