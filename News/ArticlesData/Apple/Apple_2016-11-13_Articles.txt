Login Search Tech Stock Roundup: AAPL Upgrade, GOOGL-EU, BABA Singles Day November 14, 2016, 03:04:00 PM EDT By Sejuti Banerjea, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo The election was the biggest event last week, easily blotting out everything else, especially because of the surprise President-elect. But that didn't stop a hot Apple AAPL rumor from KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo; or Alphabet's GOOGL defense of its Android ecosystem; or the gangbuster Singles Day numbers from Alibaba BABA . So read on… Apple May Not Upgrade iPhone SE KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo is famous for breaking Apple product-related news. This time, he's saying that the company may not refresh the budget iPhone "SE" line next year. The rationale is purportedly to boost demand for the more expensive and higher-margin iPhone 7, while also pressuring SE component makers to reduce prices. This pressure may increase because Apple is now selling refurbished, certified iPhones from its online store. The iPhone SE is a very competitive and lighter phone, especially if you can make do with a smaller screen and 64GB storage, don't mind a somewhat weaker front camera and more limited water resistance, and also really want the headphone jack. The analyst feels that not refreshing the SE, weaker China demand and lower 4.7-inch volumes will impact iPhone sales next year. He forecasts an iPhone shipment volume decline to between 35 and 40 million (40.4 million units were shipped in 2Q16). He also has reservations about component price declines. Google Defends Android Google has its rival Yandex to thank for this one, as the leading Russian search engine's (until it was displaced by Google) complaint to the Competition Commission precipitated proceedings. In 2013, Google rivals Microsoft MSFT , Nokia and Oracle ORCL had gone to the EU through an umbrella organization called Fairsearch. But it was hard to pin Google guilty, leading to the case dragging on. But when in Russia, Google required phone makers to pre-install Google search (just as everywhere else) instead of Yandex, the company went to court. In this case, the EU is investigating 3 angles as Techcrunch pointed out so well- that Google is allegedly "requiring and incentivizing" smartphone and tablet manufacturers to exclusively install its own services, and in particular its search engine that it is allegedly bundling certain Google products with other apps & services whether Google is hindering the ability of smartphone and tablet makers to use and develop other OS versions of Android (aka Android forks) If found guilty, Google will have to pay up to 10% of revenue, or around $7.4 billion. The crux of Google's response of more than 100 pages is that Google's practices are with a view to prevent fragmentation of the platform without which Android would be weakened and competition would in fact be impaired. It says that the Commission's decision to omit Apple as a competitor appears arbitrary and partisan. It makes no sense because the Commission's own survey revealed that 89% of respondents consider Apple and Android as competing platforms . Besides, it allows the Commission to conveniently ignore the fact that 39 out of 39 pre-installed apps on iPhone 7 are from Apple, and 39 out of 47 pre-installed apps on the Microsoft Lumia 550 are from Microsoft. Android has allowed phone makers to bring cheaper phones to the market and has helped millions of app developers. A weak platform would be bad for everyone. In the words of Kent Walker Google's general counsel, "The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers, and mobile network operators. Android hasn't hurt competition, it's expanded it." Alibaba Singles Day Alibaba had a record Singles Day with sales of $17.79 billion, up from the record $14.3 billion last year and short of the $20 billion analysts were projecting. But these sales are nothing to scoff at: 2015 sales in the U.S. on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined and from all stores (both online and offline) totaled $19.4 billion. This year, Singles Day moved across the border, with the top markets for Chinese goods being Russia, Spain, Israel, Ukraine and France. Top markets selling to the Chinese were Japan, U.S., South Korea, Australia and Germany. The most popular brands were Apple, Nike, New Balance, Siemens, Philips and Adidas. Around 37% of shoppers bought from international stores with virtual reality creating new experiences like Chinese customers browsing the isles of Macy's store in New York without ever leaving their seats. But clouds are looming for Alibaba with the election of Donald Trump. The company's business hinges on China-U.S. relations, so it will be negatively hit by Trump's decision to charge a heavy tax on Chinese goods. If the Chinese government reacts with similar duty on U.S. goods, Alibaba will be affected very badly. The other concern is with respect to its accounting practices, particularly with respect to its Singles Day sales, for which the company is being investigated both in the U.S. and in China.

Adam Mosseri, VP of product management at Facebook says, "In Newsfeed we use various signals based on community feedback to determine which posts are likely to contain inaccurate information, and reduce their distribution. In Trending we look at a variety of signals to help make sure the topics being shown are reflective of real-world events, and take additional steps to prevent false or misleading content from appearing. Despite these efforts we understand there's so much more we need to do, and that is why it's important that we keep improving our ability to detect misinformation." The company earlier formed an alliance with various media houses for similar reasons although the possibility of potential business partners colluding to suppress or misinform the public for vested interests is a bit unsettling. Singapore Civil Service Chooses Facebook Workplace : Singapore's civil service is adopting the Facebook Workplace platform for its pool of 143K (and growing) public servants by March 2017. The platform is inexpensive at just a dollar per user per month for groups larger than 10K people, so it's a good deal for Facebook as well. In fact, this is the first deal of its kind for Facebook and underscores the platform's popularity in Asia. Legal/Regulatory Irish Finance Minister Will Go to Bat for Apple : The EU Competition Commission has determined that Apple owes taxes to the tune of $14.5 billion for illegally transferring profits generated in Ireland to a titular head office in a tax free zone. Irish Finance Minister Noonan says that the Commission is acting out of its jurisdiction because tax is a matter decided by individual countries and the competition angle is just a back door to meddle in the member nation's internal affairs. The tax breaks enjoyed by Apple are part of state aid that some European countries resort to with the objective of attracting investment in the region. Apple has around 6K employees in Ireland. In September, the cabinet approved Ireland's joining Apple in appealing the EU's demand, and Noonan submitted his appeal last week. LinkedIn Banned in Russia : The professional network faces a ban in Russia because of a law passed in 2014, requiring websites storing personal data of Russians to store it in servers within the country, says Russia's Roskomnadzor communications watchdog. LinkedIn reportedly has 6 million users in the country, so it could be a near-term blow. However, the problem may not be long-lived given its pending acquisition by Microsoft. Amazon Refunds for In-App Purchases : A federal judge has ruled that Amazon AMZN must take the responsibility of informing and then refunding parents, when their kids run up bills related to unauthorized in-app purchases. While judge Coughenour agreed with Amazon that the $26.5 million decided by the FTC was too high, he ruled out lump sum payments and gift cards for the amount as Amazon would collect profit on goods sold through gift cards. In similar dealings, Apple and Google coughed up around $32.5 million and $19 million, respectively. Unauthorized purchasing has been curtailed however, with the help of improved controls since then. New Technology/Products Pre-Owned iPhones Now on Sale : Last September, when Apple introduced the concept of iPhone annual upgrades and AppleCare+ for $32 a month, I had speculated that they wanted to build inventory of phones on which manufacturing cost was already recovered to target emerging markets like India. But competitors protested this in India, so Apple needed a Plan B (which may have also been in the works actually). With the anniversary up, Apple would be receiving these phones about now. So it is selling these refurbished (new battery and outer shell) phones after testing and certifying them at a 15% discount through the app store and making a huge profit. Apple is reportedly selling eight versions, all with a one-year warranty. The decision is also of great strategic importance as it could prevent users from moving away to cheaper phones from competitors. It's also a way for Apple to further expand its user base, enabling it to sell more services. The current rates are $399 for the 4GB model, which sells for $499 at full retail and $499 for the 8GB model, which sells for $599. Facebook App for Emerging Markets : Facebook is determined to eat Snapchat's lunch and the leading social network is doing about all it can to replicate Snapchat-like features such as Instagram stories, "secret" (erased after some time) conversations and more. Now it's launched Flash, a Snapchat-like platform targeted at emerging markets like Brazil, Indonesia and India where the Facebook brand name is very well recognized. This may cap Snapchat's progress in emerging markets while strengthening Facebook versus this picture-sharing networking platform. Intel's New Chip Tech : Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland has called out Intel's high-speed, in-package optical interconnect silicon photonics technology as a product with the capacity to "revolutionize the semiconductor industry". As the analyst says, it will definitely mitigate the effects of a slowing Moore's law by reducing the interconnect time between Intel's Xeon Server CPUs and Altera's FPGAs, i.e. until Intel integrates the technology into a single piece. The analyst also said that Intel has "proof of concept" chips and is looking to improve current low production yields. This could lead to a commercial product just three to five years down the line. Rolland estimates that data transfer rates may start at 50 to 100 gigabits per second with the new chips, but could increase to a half terabit or 2 terabits by early next decade, he said. Google, Apple App Store Updates : Both Google and Apple have huge app marketplaces, which might make it difficult for developers to reach buyers. The two companies are therefore always looking for ways to help developers get their apps seen. Google had many encouraging announcements such as a) allowing developers to offer limited-time discounted subscription pricing for their apps b) a promise to expand the Google Play Store to wearables, VR headsets, and Chromebook laptops for easier distribution from a single marketplace and c) a decision to employ machine-learning algorithms more heavily to provide app recommendations for Google Play users. Apple, which earlier this year promised developers a bigger revenue share and more reviews for new apps, announced that they can now create early-access promotional codes for new apps that can be offered to journalists and reviewers. These should help them generate more publicity for their new apps and in-app purchases. Some Numbers Google Home vs. Amazon Echo : IHS Markit says that Google Home will solidly beat Amazon Echo by 2020, shipping 5.4 million units that year, while Amazon will be stuck at 2.4 million units. Amazon does have a first mover advantage right now, but it will evaporate over the years as Google uses its treasure trove of data to more fruitfully apply artificial intelligence according to the research firm. Apple is also expected to join the fray with a device based on Siri. The Google device is fifty bucks cheaper at $129, but lacks Amazon's skills (app ecosystem). This should be a very short-term hurdle as Google has the wherewithal to more than catch up here. NVIDIA Results : NVIDIA reported solid results this past quarter with its adjusted EPS of 83 cents far outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents on the back of solid revenues that also beat our expectations by a wide margin.

Photo: Apple If you’re itching to get your hands on a new MacBook Pro — and your fingers on its new Touch Bar — the wait will soon be over. Sources have revealed to 9to5Mac that the newly updated MacBook Pro will be available to try and buy at Apple Stores as soon as Thursday. The new MacBook Pro made waves with tweaked specs, including a surprisingly low 16GB ceiling for RAM. It also tosses out traditional function keys in favor of the slim new Touch Bar, a color OLED strip with keys that change according to the program you are using at the. MacBook Pro finally ships Prior to this, the new MacBook Pro was only available via online orders, with an estimated wait of four to five weeks for delivery. Shipping times have continued to slip after orders started, but early birds who pre-ordered started receiving notifications that their Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pros are preparing for shipment last week. The units should start shipping soon. Along with the new MacBook units, Apple stores will start stocking the latest LG UltraFine 4K and 5K displays, which were announced at Apple’s October event. They will be sold exclusively at Apple stores as well as on Apple’s website, where you can already order the 4K model (assuming you’re willing to wait up to six weeks for it to arrive). Plenty of people were scratching their heads at the news that new MacBook Pros would feature USB-C ports exclusively, requiring adapters and dongles for any other type of connection. The backlash led Apple to slash prices on its line of USB-C adapters. The company also dropped prices for a limited time on both the new LG displays. As for the new MacBook Pros, exactly which stores will have them in stock remains unclear. It’s a pretty safe bet that most of Apple’s mainstay locations will roll them out later this week. And if you’re still looking to find out more about the new MacBook Pros with Touch Bar, the first raft of official reviews from sites like The Wall Street Journal, The Verge and CNET have gone up ahead of the launch.

It was going to be my first macbook pro. I have used Dell for years and I am not happy about the windows 10 garbage fire. However, I am extremely disappointed in the new macbook pros. Was there no one at apple that was like “hey, I’ve got a better idea, instead of pissing off all of our customers with expensive dongles to connect ANYTHING to our laptop, why don’t we have a transition model where it is part USB type C and party regular USB”…… At least they kept the headphone jack. I guess I will go buy a razor laptop. It’s only 1/4 of a pound heavier, and has better EVERYTHING. RyanTV You’d let a $9 USB adapter keep you from buying a MBP? Please.

Photo: Apple Donating to your favorite charity or nonprofit organization is now as simple as using Apple Pay. Apple revealed today that it is lifting the ban that kept iOS apps from collecting funds for charities via the secure payment system. With the change, charities like the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders can now place “donate” buttons in their apps to make the payment process faster than ever, which will hopefully increase donations. “So many people want to give, but complicated and clunky donation systems discourage them,” said Scott Harrison, CEO of charity: water. “Integrating Apple Pay makes the giving experience incredibly simple and convenient, and we hope it will encourage more people to join our mission and enable us to transform lives within seconds.” Apple Pay nonprofits To help programs get a jump start, Apple worked with Benevity to launch an online application form for nonprofits looking to accept Apple Pay. Now that Apple Pay is supported on iOS and macOS Sierra, donations can be made quickly via Safari on Mac, iPhone or iPad. The list of of nonprofits supporting Apple Pay at launch includes American Red Cross, American Heart Association, charity: water, Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, COPD Foundation, Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), Doctors Without Borders, Feeding America, GlobalGiving, International Rescue Committee, Red, St.Jude Children’s Research Hospital, The Nature Conservancy, The Water Project, UNICEF, United Way, WNET, World Vision and the World Wildlife Federation. Other organizations such as American Cancer Society, CARE, DonorsChoose.org, Save the Children, and PBS plan to add Apple Pay support soon.

Comments CIO | Nov 14, 2016 8:07 AM PT Like this article? thumbsup +1 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS MacBooks MacOS Hardware Laptops Comments Apple has finally announced the much-awaited upgrades to its Pro line of MacBooks. As expected, Apple made some unorthodox decisions and they are getting beaten up for it. I use a mix of technologies. I have a MacBook, Chromebook, Google Pixel C, Windows 10 PC and I primarily use openSUSE on my main desktop. As a result, I consider myself well educated on the advantages and disadvantages of each platform, without any bias. Although my 2013 MacBook with 8GB of RAM is in great shape and is my go-to device when I am not on my desktop, I am looking at upgrading it to the new MacBook. Should I? In this post I am addressing some of the unfair criticism of the new MacBook Pro and also talking about the facts that make them great devices. First things first: Hardware specs The new MacBooks are running on Intel’s 6th generation Sky Lake processors and not the newly released Kaby Lake. Does that matter? It would have been better if Apple used the latest chips, but for a MacBook user Kaby Lake doesn’t really make a big difference. Both processors are 14nm and are literally identical. The only slight difference you may notice is in the battery life if you watch 4K video. Period. Don’t forget, MacBooks have a long shelf life (Apple claims four years, but they go beyond four years depending on your usecase). Since Intel is moving away from tick-tock model they will probably be releasing a new processor every year. No matter which processor Apple pack into their MacBooks, it’s going to be old by the following year. So don’t keep falling for the newer hardware madness telling you that you should always have the latest and greatest hardware. Is 16GB RAM enough? The short answer is yes. I have the 2013 MacBook Pro that came with 8GB of RAM. Initially I fretted  whether this device is future proof or not. We are approaching 2017 and I am heavily using Adobe Premier, Photoshop, Lightroom and 3d modeling software, and MacBook is serving me very well. In fact it outperformed a high end 2016 laptop with 16GB of RAM. Yes, it would be great to have a 32GB model, but I won’t go over 16GB of RAM for an ultrabook. Why? Because RAM is not a magic potion, you need an equally powerful processor to process the data. USB Type C Thank you Apple for removing all legacy USB ports from the device. USB has been nothing more than a mess. There are at least 7 legacy USB ports. I have to carry around at least 5 types of USB cables  to be able to connect to my devices. My Western Digital external hard drive uses USB B, whereas Nikon d750 uses UC-E17 USB Cable, headphone charger uses Micro USB and Xoom Dictaphone Mini USB, plus USB Type C for my Nexus phone. Yes. That’s legacy USB mess. And don’t forget all those HDMI cables. Please kill the legacy USB!. Get rid of all that mess and everyone, please move to USB Type C. One type to rule them all: from audio video output to charging to data transfers.Needless to say, I am very happy there are no legacy USB ports in MacBooks. Initially I will have to carry 2 adapters, but as soon as the rest of the world moves to USB Type C the better. I am already carrying 5 different cables to survive the legacy USB world. Lack of SD card reader The new MacBooks don’t have a SD card reader. How many people actually use the SD Card reader? The only use case that I can think of is photographers who may prefer SD Card. But it’s not a deal breaker for a professional photographer. Have you seen the bag of a photographer? All you will see is cables, connectors, filters, lenses, SD Cards…one more USB Type C SD Card reader is not going to break their back and chances are they already own one. Missing Magsafe Come on folks. MacBooks are the only devices that offered Magsafe. Do you have MagSafe in your Dell, HP, Lenovo, ASUS laptops? Are you tripping and falling all the time? What do you do with your iPad, iPhone, Android phones? Yes, MagSafe was a good approach but that’s not the end of the world and I am much happier to use the same USB Type C port for charging than MagSafe. Touch bar is a gimmick Finally someone is doing something for those useless function keys. If you are a Chromebook user, you already know how ‘valuable’ those are. All I care about is ‘Esc’ key as I use it heavily in the text editor, and that’s going to stay with the ‘Touch Bar’. Touch Bar is going to expand the functionality of the keyboard and applications and give me more control over features. In fact it creates new ways to interact with apps, without having to lift your fingers from the keyboard area. I love the new Touch Bar. The hidden secrets of MacBook Pro Trackpad Let me say this straight out: Apple is the only company that got the touch pad right. I have yet to come across a non-Apple laptop where trackpad is nothing more than an extension of the mouse. With the new MacBook, the trackpad is doubled in size. In addition, there is a secret that most people don’t know: with the new force field touch pads, you can convert it into a tablet by using a stylus. Apps like Inklet allow you to enjoy pressure sensitivity so all those aspiring graphic artists don’t need to buy expensive tablets. I can’t tell you how excited I am about it. They don't have touchscreen As a Chromebook Flip and Dell XPS 13 user, I can tell you touchscreens on laptops are pure waste. No one uses them. Touch screens do make sense for those devices that lack keyboard and mouse, but not on laptops. Also these touchscreens work more or less like input devices, like a mouse, so unlike iPad or Surface Pro like devices, you really can’t use them for drawing due to lack of palm rejection, it’s counterproductive. So, no, I don’t need touchscreen on my laptop. MacBooks are expensive I often hear people say Apple products are overpriced. May I ask what wasthe price of Chromebook Pixel? You get 32GB of storage for $1600. Check out laptops from Dell, HP, Lenovo … look at any vendor out there  matching the MacBook specs and you are talking about over $2000. You still get the crappy touchpad and Windows 10 that doesn’t scale apps very well for HiDPI monitors….and I won’t get into the 45 minute long downtime every time there is a system update. Yes, you can get a laptop under $300 but don’t complain about creaky hinges, unresponsive touchpad, 3Kg of weight and 4GB of RAM. The bottom line is good hardware is expensive. Just check the price of Pixel XL phone. It’s the same price of MacBook Air. Resistance to change Apple is finally pushing  laptops into new territories. Unlike Ubuntu Linux or Gnome, it’s not creating new interfaces that require users to relearn everything. It’s sticking to the WIMP paradigm and yet making game-changing improvements to hardware. That’s what we need. In all these years, the only innovation that we saw in the non-Apple market was more RAM and new CPUs. Period. Apple is pushing the envelope.

All eyes are also looking at Pangu to release a new iOS 10 jailbreak tool. The Chinese team remains one of the most renowned hacking groups, especially when it comes to Apple jailbreaks. As per the latest iOS Jailbreak news, team Pangu is planning to introduce the most awaited jailbreak tool no later than December. This will be a huge holiday gift to jailbreak fans, but a big setback for Apple, which has been waging war against hackers that tinker with its mobile OS for years now. CNET reported that iOS 10.2, currently in public beta two, will most likely debut around December. It will come with new features and bug fixes that are said to be “worth the upgrade.” However, the jailbreak community is more concerned about the bug fixes. iOS Jailbreak News: Releasing This December The last working tool by team Pangu was iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak which seems like it came out ages ago. Meanwhile, some not-so-renowned individual hackers have claimed to have iOS 10 cracks. Among the other names is Lucas Todesco, but nothing has been made public. Considering that, the claims look nothing more than hoaxes. Todesco tweeted on November 5 and shared the news with their followers. “Updated my stuff so it works on 10.1 too now,” he captioned a photo of his phone. Many of his followers asked him to help Pangu release a mass tool for iOS 10. It cannot be said if Todesco will share his findings with Pangu. Rumors have it that Team Pangu is waiting for next big iOS jump to complete the tool. Since the release did not happen with versions 10.1 and 10.1.1 jailbreak fans are expecting 10.2 to come out in December. Many question if team Pangu is working on a jailbreak for iOS 10. The team showed off Apple’s latest mobile OS being jailbroken months ago. Cydia was demoed running on iOS 10 and that was taken to be a promise that the JB tool will come out soon. Contrary to the expectations, the Chinese hackers maintained quiet until now. Yet people hope that an iOS 10 jailbreak will be released soon. As of now, December is said to be the month when the team is expected to release iOS 10 jailbreak tool to  the public. Do you think team Pangu will come up with the much-awaited tool by this December?  Let us know in the comment box below. For more updates, stay tuned to TechPLZ.

Instant donations can be made in this way to 19 organisations, with more due to accept it soon. Apple Pay offers a secure way to donate to a nonprofit with just one touch. It is similar to contactless payments but with the addition of two-factor authentication for security. It makes the giving process faster and easier by removing the need to enter billing and contact information on web forms. It can be used on a compatible iOS device or on the web with Safari through macOS Sierra. Charity: water accepts monthly gifts to its regular giving programme via Apple Pay. Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay, explained: “Websites and apps tell us they see twice as many people actually completing a purchase with Apple Pay than with other payment methods. We think offering such a simple and secure way to support the incredible work nonprofits do will have a significant impact on the communities they serve.” Apple Pay was announced in September 2014 and initially available only to merchants in the USA. It has been expanded internationally since then, with payments being handled in the UK for the first time in July 2015. Christmas giving The extension to nonprofits comes at an opportune time, as US nonprofits gear up for the Christmas season of giving and the year-end campaigns that typically generate major spikes in giving.   Nonprofits have had to wait behind for-profit merchants for Apple payment systems before. Apple had a policy of not allowing developers to add ‘donate’ functionality to apps, including in-app payments, in its iTunes app store. Aware of the missed opportunity for charities, nonprofit staff and others triggered a petition in 2010, asking the company to change. Now developers will be able to integrate Apple Pay directly within nonprofits’ apps, avoiding the need to direct people to give outside the app on the web or via SMS. First nonprofits to accept Apple Pay donations The first US nonprofits to accept donations by Apple Pay are: American Red Cross American Heart Association charity: water Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals COPD Foundation Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) Doctors without Borders Feeding America GlobalGiving International Rescue Committee (RED) St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital Save the Children The Nature Conservancy The Water Project UNICEF WNET World Vision WWF (World Wildlife Fund) They will be followed by: American Cancer Society CARE DonorsChoose.org PBS and its local stations United Way charity: water and Apple Pay charity: water is integrating Apple Pay across all giving platforms on desktop and mobile to provide a seamless experience for supporters. Donors can use Apple Pay when they join charity: water’s monthly giving program, The Spring, make a one-time donation, or give to birthday or fundraising campaigns. In addition to Apple Pay, donors can also give to charity: water through PayPal, credit card, or linking their bank account directly. Scott Harrison, founder and CEO of charity: water explained how and why the nonprofit was one of the first to use the payment tool: “At charity: water, we’re always looking for new ways to make funding clean water projects easier than ever. We’re thrilled to be one of the first charities that supports donations through Apple Pay. “663 million people around the world live without clean drinking water, but solutions are readily available and clean water transforms lives and communities. By integrating Apple Pay and making giving effortless – whether someone’s making an end of year donation or joining our new monthly giving program, The Spring – we hope to impact more lives than ever before.” Using Apple Pay How significant is Apple Pay for charities? Should UK charities plan to adopt it when it becomes available in the UK? Roger Craven of mobile payment specialists RSM 2000 told UK Fundraising that it was still too early for most UK charities to commit time and resource to this issue. He said: “Each charity needs to make a judgement about the benefits of additional donations that they might turn away versus the disruption and confusion that introducing a new payment mechanism will add. “If Apple Pay is to be seen as purely substitutional for existing payment methods then how does getting involved in Apple Pay further any charity’s objectives? Apple Pay could in the long run be a game changer, but its short term impact will only be significant to the sector if it can be used to solve particular problems that fundraisers face. “Charities should be looking to explore using Apple Pay to open up cost effectively new giving propositions (e.g. unattended) or make existing ones more cost effective (e.g. street fundraising) or tapping into particular donor segments (e.g. elite high rollers).”   When will UK charities be able to accept donations via Apple Pay?

It was only last week that Cuscal announced that it had signed a deal that would see 31 of its partner financial institutions, including a range of smaller banks and credit unions, adopt Apple Pay as a payment processing platform with the promise that Apple Pay would be available "soon". Soon in this context is today, with many of the insitutions on Cuscal’s original list announcing Apple Pay compatibility from today. The move expands the number of institutions offering Apple Pay quite markedly, as previously it had been open only to ANZ and American Express Card customers where the card was issued by American Express itself. The other big three banks are engaged in an ongoing fight with Apple over access to the NFC hardware that enables contactless payments. Apple argues that the big banks aren't interested in competition in the payments space. Not every financial institution initially named by Cuscal (you can check the list here) appears to have jumped on board just yet. While several larger outlets, including Teachers Mutual Bank and Bank Australia, are displaying Apple Pay compatibility notices on their homepages, a number of other smaller financial institutions are not displaying an indication that they’re doing so. That may be because they plan to come on board with Apple Pay at some later stage, or could simply be that they haven't updated their sites. they’re not displaying it directly on the respective web sites just yet. If you're not sure if your bank or credit union has activated the service, the best move would be to contact it directly. Cuscal had already signed a deal that allowed its banks and credit unions to adopt Android Pay as well, which means that customers of those institutions now have access to a wide range of contactless, smartphone-based payment solutions. Check our list of banks offering Android Pay and banks offering Apple Pay to see who is on board.

Unfortunately for people who came up with this speculation, Apple’s vice president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, has revealed that this is not the case. On Monday, Backchannel’s Steven Levy published a story about a conversation he had with Schiller in which the latter revealed that the tech giant did test out touch screens for the Mac devices. “We think of the whole platform. If we were to do Multi-Touch on the screen of the notebook, that wouldn’t be enough — then the desktop wouldn’t work that way,” Schiller said. “Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd.” According to Schiller, creating touch-screen Mac devices would just ruin the user experience of its established computers since optimization for both the touch display and pointer devices would be impossible. “You can’t optimize for both. It’s the lowest common denominator thinking,” Schiller said before confirming that the company’s teams did try creating touch screens for the Mac for a “number of times over the years.” However, by testing the technology, Schiller said that they have understood why it did not make sense for them to come up with MacBooks and Mac computers with touch-screen display.  Related Stories Is The Touch Bar Of New MacBook Pro Worth The Upgrade? The Better One Between MacBook Pro Sans Touch Bar vs. MacBook Air Apple To Replenish Touch Bar Supply For MacBook Pro With The Help Of New Supplier Tackling the issue on whether or not Apple is planning to officially ditch the physical keyboard of its Mac devices, Schiller said that the idea is “not on the horizon right now.” He did not say that this is never going to happen. Instead, he clarified that as of this time, there is no need to do this because Apple is focused more on making a better keyboard and not removing the physical keys of its computers.  Meanwhile, to address the issue on why the Cupertino giant decided to switch to Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports for its new MacBook Pros, Schiller maintained that they are certain about this move because USB-C will soon become the new standard in the tech industry. He said this despite of confirming that they value the feedback of their customers, and many people have since been complaining about the need of purchasing dongles to maximize the use of the Thunderbolt 3 ports. "There are people who want us to innovate faster and when we do there’s people who say, ‘Whoa, whoa, you’re going too fast,'” he said. Despite the controversies that are being thrown at Apple for adding a feature to its new MacBooks that no one asked for and removing ports that consumers have grown accustomed to using, the company’s new premium laptops are expected to perform well in the market. Fortune has learned that the new MacBook Pro has surpassed all of its professional-focused predecessors in terms of the number of preorders the company got from customers since it was announced. Digitimes reported last week that Apple is expected to ship 15 million units of its new MacBook Pros before 2016 ends. Then, the company is expected to ship the same number of units the following year. As of today, the tech giant has satisfied the preorders of the first customers to secure their own MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. However, it isn't clear yet how many units the company delivered for its first round of shipments.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week's election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. "The market is sniffing out the belief that some of these Trump policies may drive some better economic growth but also may in fact be somewhat inflationary," said PNC Chief Investment Strategist Bill Stone. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans' Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. That's a huge move for that benchmark rate. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51. Stone said investors are focused on potential corporate and individual tax cuts, a "wave of deregulation" that eliminates some of the rules governing businesses like energy companies and banks, and more protectionism on trade, which could hurt sales for companies that do a lot of business overseas. Investors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. For example, Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Stone added that corporate dealmaking could increase if Trump's administration takes a looser approach to antitrust regulation. Several companies announced deals or deal offers Monday. South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes electronics for cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.07, or 25.2 percent, to $109.72.

According to Barclays Research analysts, the 5-inch and 5.8-inch bezel-free iPhones with borderless design will allow for the new iPhones to be the same overall size as current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models, MacRumors.com reported. SEE ALSO: Real Life Images of Huawei Mate 9 Pro Leak Online: Dual-Curved Display Revealed "Larger and bezel-less iPhone 8 design did not sound 100 per cent locked down but we believe the move is to a bezel-less design with screen sizes getting larger and curved edges in the original envelope," the report quoted analysts as saying. Of the two prospect releases, only the 5.8-inch model will use OLED display technology, "which can be sharper, brighter, and more energy efficient than LCD technology". Samsung and LG, joined by Foxconn-owned Sharp by 2018, are said to be Apple's primary OLED suppliers. An analyst from KGI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo had in March said that Apple will launch a 5.8-inch iPhone with a curved OLED display and glass casing next year, the research note mentioned. According to Japanese website Nikkei, the larger-screened iPhone will be a premium model, positioned alongside 4.7-inch and 5-inch iPhones with LCD displays. SEE ALSO: Vivo V5 and V5 Max to Sport a 20MP Front-Facing Camera: 5 Things You Should Know There are reports that a bezel-free design by Apple will be achieved by removing the iconic Home button on the next iPhone. Barclays expects that the screen will extend vertically as well as horizontally.

DAVID PAUL MORRIS by Troy Wolverton Apple is looking more and more like it's lost its way. Revenue and earnings are falling. Sales of all its major products are in decline. Numerous individual products are getting long in the tooth, waiting years for updates. Even for products that are getting refreshed, the updates are underwhelming. Some of this might be understandable if the company were focusing on new products that will likely pay off big in the future. But the last new product the company launched — Apple Watch — looks increasingly like a dud. Apple's long-baking TV project has amounted to nothing; the company's never released either an Apple-branded television or TV service. And, with every new report that comes out, the company's "Titan" car project looks more and more like an expensive debacle. Apple established itself as the premium brand, the one everyone envied, with an enthusiastic customer base. Under Steve Jobs, it made a concerted effort to reach out to new customers with lower priced products such as the iPod shuffle or the Mac Mini. Those worked the same way that an entry-level Mercedes does — they get people in the door and attached to the brand. Related Quotes 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating... View full quote Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements Now it seems to have lost touch, and others are passing it by. Windows laptop makers like Razer recently have been releasing the kind of high-powered but elegantly designed machines that we used to expect from Apple. Microsoft just showed off an innovative touchscreen all-in-one desktop computer that's clearly targeted at the kind of creative professionals who have been loyal to Apple for years. And Google, Roku and Amazon are offering digital streaming devices that not only cost less than Apple TV, they support new standards like 4K and high-dynamic range video that it doesn't. During a conference call with financial analysts last month after Apple reported its latest quarterly results, CEO Tim Cook bristled at some pointed questions from Steve Milunovich, an analyst with UBS, about the company's strategy and direction. "We have the strongest pipeline that we've ever had and we're really confident about the things in it, but as usual, we're not going to talk about what's in it," Cook said. When pressed by Milunovich about whether the company had a "strong sense" of how the technology market was changing and how quickly it could respond to those changes, Cook answered curtly: "We have a strong sense of where things go, and we're very agile to shift as we need to." Despite Cook's assertions, Apple, the company that always seemed to know what consumers would want before they knew it themselves, is now making products that may seem cool in Cupertino, but don't offer what customers want and are priced beyond what most can afford. "Apple no longer makes anything I care to buy," Seth Lewin, a self-described longtime Apple customer, posted in a comment on a tech blog. "Apple could care less what its customers think or say or want, it seems." We got a glimpse of this last year when Apple rolled out the new Macbook, a laptop that's both costly, at least for its target audience of consumers, and crippled. The $US1300 ($1720) computer comes with an uncomfortably thin keyboard that's painful to type on and only one port that you can use to plug in things like external drives. You'll almost certainly have to buy some adapters for the computer, because that one port is so new that almost no devices support it yet. Oh, and if the computer's running out of power, you could be in a fix; you have to plug in its charger to the same port. We got another glimpse of Apple's cluelessness more recently when it unveiled the new iPhone, a device that was difficult to distinguish from last year's model, yet still priced the same. One of the few clear differences: Apple in the new model removed the headphone jack, a decision basically no one was calling for. It's a move that ticked off many users, worried others — and promised to make many folks' lives more difficult by making it that harder to connect the iPhone to older audio equipment. But the company's recent press event may be the best indication of how out of touch it is these days. In the past, Apple has used such events to refresh its Mac lineup, roll out new iPads or update its Apple TV streaming device. With many of its products in those categories a year or more old — and sales falling in nearly all of them, as best we can tell — you might have thought Apple would have updated several at least, particularly its lower-priced, consumer-targeted models. Instead the company updated one product — the MacBook Pro. That computer line was certainly due for an update. But the MacBook Pro is a relatively pricey laptop targeted at professional users, an important but niche audience. Even if Apple scored a direct hit with them, a new MacBook Pro line by itself won't revive Apple's flagging computer sales. The new computers have a cool feature: a touch sensitive bar called the Touch Bar that will display different buttons and features depending on what program is being used. But right now, the Touch Bar is only available on models that start at $US1800, a pricey sum even for professionals. And even as Apple was adding the new Touch Bar, it was taking away or excluding features that professionals want and need. Many potential customers criticised the new computers for being underpowered in terms of their graphics processors and the amount of memory they can support. Others hated the fact that the new computers, like the Macbook before them, only have USB-C ports, which means they'd have to buy lots of dongles to attach their older hard drives, external monitors, cameras and the like. Unlike the older MacBook Pro models, the new ones won't have an SD card slot, so users will have to have another dongle to upload photos and videos saved to one. The take of Michael Tsai, a Mac developer, was typical of Apple's core fans. "I was really disappointed with today's Apple event," wrote Tsai on his blog. "It seems like Apple has either lost its way, that it has lost touch with what (some of) its customers want, or that it simply doesn't care about those customers." And, let's be clear, this backlash was against a product that Apple had actually revamped and had, based on its recent standards, been updating regularly. Other products — and their fans — haven't been so lucky. It would be one thing if the rest of the market were standing still or if Apple's products were so far beyond the competition that the company could afford to stand pat or if the company's sales were continuing to grow gangbusters despite its neglect. But none of those things is true. And that's not to mention all the new markets, from smart home products to virtual and augmented reality that Apple is basically ignoring. But, hey, that Touch Bar sure looks neat. I just hope Apple executives aren't shocked when it doesn't spark a rebound for the company.

Written by Monica Savaglia Posted November 14, 2016 It’s true... it happened. Last week, Donald J. Trump was elected America's 45th President. On Tuesday night and very early into Wednesday morning, you saw all of media scratching their heads. They were completely baffled by how close this race was turning out to be. How could this happen? Their polls told them something totally different... Clinton was in favor, and she was on her way to be America's first woman president.  The only logical conclusion the media could come up with was that the American people were seeking revenge on Washington. Their voices weren’t being heard and haven’t been heard in a really long time... And Donald Trump heard them — he would be their beacon of hope. He’s the only president-elect in U.S. history that will be taking over the Oval Office with no political or military experience. His claim to fame has been more or less being a businessman, a TV celebrity, and a man who “tells it like it is.” As a businessman, he’s been openly critical of several big technology companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: APPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). And as a presidential candidate, he’s in favor of policies that will make it difficult for developmental growth within the industry.  He's proposed policies like taxing companies that manufacture products overseas. He believes tech companies need to stop working overseas and depriving Americans of potential jobs. But what he doesn't realize is his direct criticism towards specific tech companies and his vague policies will have a huge influence on technology's growth, along with current and potential American jobs... Which would contradict one of his most stressed promises to his voters: to bring back jobs. Trump's Tech Vendetta Could Affect U.S. Jobs Earlier this year at an event in Pawleys Island, South Carolina, Trump said: What I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until such time as they give that security number. He was calling for a consumer boycott of Apple when Apple refused to help the FBI gain access to the phone of one of the shooters in the San Bernardino, California, terrorist attack. Trump went even further, saying:  First of all, the phone isn’t even owned by this young thug that killed all of these people... Tim Cook (Apple’s CEO) is looking to do a big number, probably to show how liberal he is. Well, if Trump is concerned about jobs in the U.S., he should look at these numbers... According to Apple, in the U.S: Apple directly employs 66,000 people. It has 627,000 jobs that support its iOS ecosystem. In its 265 retail stores, Apple employs about 30,000 people. There are 20,000 construction-related jobs that are needed to build Apple’s retail stores. The company has added 52,000 jobs in the past 10 years prior to 2015. That’s a lot of U.S. jobs being put into jeopardy because Trump isn't particularly fond of certain CEOs or the way these companies conduct business. Another instance was during an interview with Fox News earlier this year. While being interviewed, Trump said: Every hour we’re getting calls from reporters from The Washington Post asking ridiculous questions and I will tell you, this owned as a toy by Jeff Bezos, who controls Amazon. Amazon is getting away with murder taxwise. And he went even further by saying: Amazon is controlling so much of what they’re doing, and what they’ve done is he bought this paper for practically nothing and he’s using that as a tool for political power against me and against people and I’ll tell you what, we can’t let him get away with it. Amazon reported in December 2015 that it has more than 90,000 full-time employees working in its fulfillment and sorting facilities throughout the country. Again, that’s a lot of jobs being put in jeopardy because of what seems like a personal vendetta against the Washington Post and Jeff Bezos. Trump wants to bring back and add more industrial jobs to the workforce, which is all well and good. But his exclusion of another thriving job force won’t be beneficial to the U.S. economy or population, especially to the Americans who have or are currently getting an education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. STEM fields have been at the forefront of innovation while providing jobs to many individuals, especially U.S. citizens. The Department for Professional Employees reported that in 2015, there were 4,360,000 people employed in computer and mathematical occupations, while there were 2,954,000 people employed in architecture and engineering occupations. These professions are the driving force behind advancing technology and enhancing our way of life, and if we want to remain a relevant global leader, we'll need to continue growing in this industry, instead of ignoring it and considering it a “problem” that needs to be fixed by policies that will ultimately hinder global growth. Trump’s policies are kind of up in the air right now, and it’s hard to predict how or if any of them will actually come into fruition. But if they do, technology and the economy could definitely see some changes.

This comes a week after the second build of the future OS upgrade for the Apple TV became available. In tvOS 10.1, Apple finally brings to life Single Sign-On which allows users to sign into their cable provider once and automatically log into all apps that require the credentials. This makes the process of setting up various apps like CBS and NBC much simpler. In addition, we’re also expecting the recently announced TV app to make its was to the public via this software, however the app doesn’t appear to be currently live in this beta. On the other hand, iOS 10.2 beta testers do have access to the app. Finally, additional bug fixes and security improvements are also present in tvOS 10.1 beta 3. If we haven’t mentioned something here you think is worth noting, please email us at mbedded@icloud.com. To install the third beta seed of tvOS 10.1, head over to Settings > System > Software Updates > Update Software on your registered Apple TV fourth generation and hit the download button.   Rate this: Share this post: Tweet Share on Tumblr Print More Email Pocket WhatsApp Like this: Like Loading...

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Business Highlights By Associated Press Published: 18:11 EST, 14 November 2016 | Updated: 18:11 EST, 14 November 2016 e-mail ___ For ECB and Fed, Trump complicates decisions on rate policy FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Donald Trump's surprise election victory has helped solidify expectations for an interest rate increase next month by the U.S. Federal Reserve — but may have complicated a decision for the European Central Bank, which faces a difficult choice over more stimulus. For the ECB, the issue is what to do about its bond-buying program, which pumps new money into Europe's struggling economy each month to try to accelerate growth and inflation. The Fed and the ECB — two of the world's most important central banks — will be making its policy decisions before Trump is inaugurated Jan. 20, while still weighing what he might do as president. ___ Trump set to roll back Obama policies on energy, environment WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump is considering an oil billionaire and a North Dakota lawmaker for top posts as he moves to roll back President Barack Obama's environmental and energy policies and allow unfettered production of oil, coal and natural gas. Trump pledges to sharply increase oil and gas drilling on federal lands while opening up offshore drilling in the Atlantic Ocean and other areas where it is blocked. Topping Trump's to-do list is repealing the Clean Power Plan, Obama's signature effort to limit carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. ___ Siemens to buy Oregon-based Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — German industrial equipment maker Siemens AG says it has agreed to buy U.S.-based software firm Mentor Graphics Corp. for $4.5 billion, broadening Siemens digital capabilities. Siemens said it would pay $37.25 a share in cash, or 21 percent more than Mentor's closing price on Friday. Mentor, based in Wilsonville, Oregon, specializes in software used to design computer chips, technology with broad potential applications to smart and connected devices such as autonomous vehicles. It has customers in industries ranging from aerospace to consumer electronics and 5,700 employees in 32 countries. ___ American Apparel files for bankruptcy protection, again WASHINGTON (AP) — American Apparel is seeking bankruptcy protection for the second time in just over a year, unable to find its footing in a shifting retail landscape and after a fight for control with its founder Dov Charney. Canada's Gildan Activewear is buying the American Apparel brand for $66 million. The retailer first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2015, about a year after it fired Charney for violating its sexual harassment policy. Charney's lengthy legal campaign to retake control of the company was rejected by a bankruptcy court judge in January. ___ US stocks finish level as tech losses cancel out bank gains NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week's election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. ___ Vroom: Gov't to require hybrid, electric cars to make noise WASHINGTON (AP) — New hybrid and electric cars are required to make noise when traveling at low speeds so that pedestrians, especially those who are blind or have poor eyesight, will hear them coming, under a new rule released Monday by the Obama administration. The new rule could help prevent about 2,400 pedestrian injuries a year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The rule requires hybrid and electric vehicles to make audible noise when traveling in reverse or forward at speeds up to about 19 mph. The sound alert isn't required at higher speeds because other factors, such as tire and wind noise, provide warning. ___ Samsung's $8B ticket into the red-hot automotive tech race SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Samsung Electronics' $8 billion acquisition of the U.S. auto electronics company Harman will instantly transform the tech company into a major player in the highly competitive market for auto infotainment, software and connected car technology. Samsung announced Monday that it would pay $112 per share in cash for the company, its largest acquisition by far. Harman International Industries Inc. makes touch screens that control vehicle functions and infotainment systems, and it's dominant in automotive sound systems with brands such as Harman Kardon, JBL, Infinity and Mark Levinson. ___ Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards NEW YORK (AP) — Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. ___ Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway invests in major airlines NEW YORK (AP) — Warren Buffett is changing his mind about airlines and buying stakes in several major carriers including American Air Lines and Delta Air Lines. The billionaire investor has famously avoided the sector in the past, although his Berkshire Hathaway does own NetJets, which sells partial ownership interests in business jets. Buffett disclosed the new investments, which also include United Continental Holdings, Monday in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ___ SEC Chair White leaving at end of Obama administration WASHINGTON (AP) — The Securities and Exchange Commission says the agency's head, Mary Jo White, will leave office at the end of the Obama administration. White, a former federal prosecutor and private securities lawyer, was appointed by President Barack Obama in February 2013. Her term doesn't end until 2019. President-elect Donald Trump is due to take office Jan. 20 and likely will name his own choice to head the market watchdog agency in the near future. ___ PetSmart fined for not reporting injury-causing fish bowls NEW YORK (AP) — PetSmart will pay a $4.25 million civil fine for not quickly reporting defective fish bowls that caused serious injuries at least a dozen times. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday that injuries included deep cuts requiring stitches and severed tendons that required surgery after bowls cracked or shattered. The pet products retailer sold the bowls under the "Grreat Choice" and "Top Fin" brands from March 2010 through September 2013. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,868.69. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.25 points to 2,164.20. The Nasdaq composite slid 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 13 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet.

President Young Sohn said when talking about the South Korean company’s $8 billion deal to buy Harman International Industries Inc. is that the electronics giant has no intention of building a car. The emphasis was intentional. Samsung’s target customers are carmakers who’d love to give their vehicles smartphone-like capabilities but are leery of surrendering unfettered access to their dashboards. They’ve largely kept a distance from Google, which could mine driver data for its own uses, or Apple Inc., which until recently had designs on building its own car. Samsung wants to marry its consumer electronics expertise and the fast 5G cellular network it’s developing with Harman’s presence in dashboards all over the world. If it works, they can offer carmakers a lightning-quick connected system for infotainment, mapping, concierge services and autonomous driving -- and all without the worry that the automakers would be helping a future competitor. “This is not about building a car,” Young said in an interview. Several automakers “came to us and asked us to help with technologies like 5G, or artificial intelligence or memory. We can harness technologies to provide a better experience to automakers.” Samsung offered $112 a share in cash for Harman, which was 28 percent above the Stamford, Connecticut-based company’s closing price of $87.65 in New York on Friday. The stock closed up 22 percent to $109.72, the biggest gain since its 1986 initial public offering. Samsung’s own shares rose on the deal, which was announced after the market closed Monday. The stock climbed as much as 1.8 percent as of 9:45 a.m. in Seoul. The acquisition reverberated through the car business, with Wells Fargo analyst David Lim saying in a research note that the deal could “ignite additional mergers and acquisitions of higher technology auto suppliers.” The shares of automotive electronics maker Visteon Corp. jumped 9.6 percent -- the most since August 2012 -- and larger rival Delphi Automotive Plc gained 2.2 percent. Deals like Samsung’s for Harman could be welcome by automakers, who want to control the revenue from connected car services and the customer data it generates as much as possible, said Jim Hines, a research director at Gartner. ‘Competitive Dynamic’ “There is definitely a competitive dynamic that has emerged between the established automotive industry and these large tech companies that are looking to get a piece of that market opportunity,” Hines said. As automakers have rolled out connected services in their cars, they have been very careful in how they work with Google and Apple. General Motors Co. allows its customers to connect their smartphones into the dashboard through Apple’s Car Play and Google’s Android Auto -- but only with selected apps, and the phones cannot access a car’s data. Toyota Motor Corp. doesn’t allow its cars to connect to either system. The fear among carmakers is that Apple and Google could either mine the data inside the car, tracking everything from driving patterns to engine performance, to either become a new face to the consumer or to help them build cars. The fact that Harman is already a supplier and that Samsung doesn’t have a system that competes with the in-car connected services sold by carmakers could make them a more attractive partner, Hines said. Partner or Threat? “They might be viewed as less of a threat in terms of tech partner for some of these leading automotive brands," Hines said. Samsung wants to become a high-tech supplier capable of building connected systems. Its expertise is making the hardware, like microprocessing units, and a faster 5G network to deliver more data to cars faster. Harman sells -- among other technologies -- 3D navigation, apps for integrating other devices into the car, active safety systems and audio systems that can access the cloud. There are a lot of opportunities once the companies combine, Harman Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dinesh Paliwal said in a phone interview. Imagine a car that that can read a driver’s daily schedule and automatically dial into a conference call, Paliwal said. Autonomous driving will only give drivers access to more connected capabilities for work or entertainment, he said. "We’ll be in the best possible position because we have all the capabilities," Paliwal said. Overcoming Weaknesses Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Assuming the merger goes through, Samsung will need to develop other capabilities, especially in software, said Cyrus Mewawalla, lead analyst at CM Research. Like Google and Apple, Samsung wants to own and provide the servers, the hardware that’s doing all the computing and the memory storage for connected cars. They also want to own the platform that runs the apps, in the way that Apple’s iOS and Android do now. While they have expertise in some things like microprocessors, they don’t have all of those capabilities, Mewawalla said. “They’d need more than just this acquisition,” he said. “The two key weaknesses Samsung has is the software ecosystem and cloud infrastructure, and that’s where it needs to be acquiring." Artificial intelligence, in which Samsung has recently made a deal, should be a particular area of focus in the near future, he added. If it chooses, the company could also have the resources to develop such capabilities on its own once Harman’s 8,000 software engineers and join Samsung, which spends $13 billion a year on research and development and $23 billion in capital expenditures. “Imagine the scale of our R&D," Paliwal said.

For the ECB, the issue is what to do about its bond-buying program, which pumps new money into Europe’s struggling economy each month to try to accelerate growth and inflation.

The Fed and the ECB — two of the world’s most important central banks — will be making its policy decisions before Trump is inaugurated Jan. 20, while still weighing what he might do as president. ___ Trump set to roll back Obama policies on energy, environment WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump is considering an oil billionaire and a North Dakota lawmaker for top posts as he moves to roll back President Barack Obama’s environmental and energy policies and allow unfettered production of oil, coal and natural gas. Trump pledges to sharply increase oil and gas drilling on federal lands while opening up offshore drilling in the Atlantic Ocean and other areas where it is blocked. Topping Trump’s to-do list is repealing the Clean Power Plan, Obama’s signature effort to limit carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. ___ Siemens to buy Oregon-based Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — German industrial equipment maker Siemens AG says it has agreed to buy U.S.-based software firm Mentor Graphics Corp. for $4.5 billion, broadening Siemens digital capabilities. Siemens said it would pay $37.25 a share in cash, or 21 percent more than Mentor’s closing price on Friday. Mentor, based in Wilsonville, Oregon, specializes in software used to design computer chips, technology with broad potential applications to smart and connected devices such as autonomous vehicles. It has customers in industries ranging from aerospace to consumer electronics and 5,700 employees in 32 countries. ___ American Apparel files for bankruptcy protection, again WASHINGTON (AP) — American Apparel is seeking bankruptcy protection for the second time in just over a year, unable to find its footing in a shifting retail landscape and after a fight for control with its founder Dov Charney. Canada’s Gildan Activewear is buying the American Apparel brand for $66 million. The retailer first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2015, about a year after it fired Charney for violating its sexual harassment policy. Charney’s lengthy legal campaign to retake control of the company was rejected by a bankruptcy court judge in January. ___ US stocks finish level as tech losses cancel out bank gains NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week’s election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump’s policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. ___ Vroom: Gov’t to require hybrid, electric cars to make noise WASHINGTON (AP) — New hybrid and electric cars are required to make noise when traveling at low speeds so that pedestrians, especially those who are blind or have poor eyesight, will hear them coming, under a new rule released Monday by the Obama administration. The new rule could help prevent about 2,400 pedestrian injuries a year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The rule requires hybrid and electric vehicles to make audible noise when traveling in reverse or forward at speeds up to about 19 mph. The sound alert isn’t required at higher speeds because other factors, such as tire and wind noise, provide warning. ___ Samsung’s $8B ticket into the red-hot automotive tech race SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Samsung Electronics’ $8 billion acquisition of the U.S. auto electronics company Harman will instantly transform the tech company into a major player in the highly competitive market for auto infotainment, software and connected car technology. Samsung announced Monday that it would pay $112 per share in cash for the company, its largest acquisition by far. Harman International Industries Inc. makes touch screens that control vehicle functions and infotainment systems, and it’s dominant in automotive sound systems with brands such as Harman Kardon, JBL, Infinity and Mark Levinson. ___ Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards NEW YORK (AP) — Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. ___ Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway invests in major airlines NEW YORK (AP) — Warren Buffett is changing his mind about airlines and buying stakes in several major carriers including American Air Lines and Delta Air Lines. The billionaire investor has famously avoided the sector in the past, although his Berkshire Hathaway does own NetJets, which sells partial ownership interests in business jets. Buffett disclosed the new investments, which also include United Continental Holdings, Monday in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ___ SEC Chair White leaving at end of Obama administration WASHINGTON (AP) — The Securities and Exchange Commission says the agency’s head, Mary Jo White, will leave office at the end of the Obama administration. White, a former federal prosecutor and private securities lawyer, was appointed by President Barack Obama in February 2013. Her term doesn’t end until 2019. President-elect Donald Trump is due to take office Jan. 20 and likely will name his own choice to head the market watchdog agency in the near future. ___ PetSmart fined for not reporting injury-causing fish bowls NEW YORK (AP) — PetSmart will pay a $4.25 million civil fine for not quickly reporting defective fish bowls that caused serious injuries at least a dozen times. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday that injuries included deep cuts requiring stitches and severed tendons that required surgery after bowls cracked or shattered. The pet products retailer sold the bowls under the “Grreat Choice” and “Top Fin” brands from March 2010 through September 2013. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,868.69. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 0.25 points to 2,164.20. The Nasdaq composite slid 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 13 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung Aggressively Gets into Apple's Face with Moves into AI and Telematics with Harman Acquisition | Main | Apple Reportedly working on Digital Glasses Supporting Telephony and Augmented Reality » November 14, 2016 MacBook Pro Reviews fly in while Apostle Schiller continues to Warns us of the Evils of a Touch Display on Macs   The MacBook Pro reviews are coming in fast and furious and most generally like the new MacBook Pro, some not, and the new Touch Bar gets mixed reviews. Beyond the reviews, Phil Schiller or Phil the Philosopher is back on his stump preaching the Gospel of Apple about how touch displays are a temptation of the devil. It reminds me of the line in the movie Poltergeist, just don't look into the light! I've always liked Phil Schiller and was glad that Steve Jobs kept him on board as he cleaned house back in 1997. But at times I'd prefer if Phil just focused on what Apple does best without having to preach to me that what I may like is wrong. Apple sometimes reminds me of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats saying that if I'm not for open borders and allowing all illegals to flood into the country and stay, then I must be a racist xenophobe or at best a deplorable. It's what turned off many independents. She should have stayed on message of why to vote for her rather then telling me that I represented the dark side if I happened to disagree with her point of view. Sometimes Apple gets a little too preachy. Many Apple pros are still seething that the new MacBook Pro limits ports and forces them to use dongles. And Apple just decided they no longer wanted to support an SD Slot. Apple's apostles tell us that an SD slot is a tool of the devil and if we wanted it, then we'd surely turn into pillars of salt. So repent and go there no more.   A Few Quick Review Flashes on the Touch Bar   In Mossberg's review he notes that "I have reservations, and you should too. Many pro users are already vocally complaining about issues particular to them. But, even for mainstream Mac users, there are questions about price, ports, the Touch Bar feature, the keyboard and — surprisingly, for a Mac — battery life. Mossberg really slams Apple on battery life. On the Touch Bar, Mossberg notes that "I don't think the Touch Bar is a gimmick, but I don't think it changes much, at least yet, for everyday Mac users. The Touch Bar has potential, but it's not magic." Mossberg finally says that "if you're a Mac devotee ready to move past the Air — not back to a lower-powered MacBook — this is what Apple is offering. Take it or leave it." It's certainly a mixed review that you could fully check out here.   The Wall Street Journal's review by Joanna Stern starts off in your face: "We've been conditioned: Every new Apple Product is the best Apple Product ever… until, of course, the next best Apple Product ever. The exception? The new MacBook Pro laptops.   Even if you have enough spare cash to buy a Tesla for your kitten, it isn't abundantly clear that you should choose one of the new $1,500-and-up models over their predecessors. The new models even defy our expectations on power and pricing. Not only are they missing the newest Intel chipset, they don't even fit in the standard Apple-nomics model where hot new products slot in at last year's pricing.   On the Touch Bar Stern noted that "I can accomplish many shortcuts faster with the keyboard or trackpad. (Example: Cmd-B bolds words quicker than I can lift a finger to hit the Touch Bar's little "B.") Plus, you always have to look up since the controls keep changing and your sense of touch doesn't help at all."   The Bottom Line for Stern is one not to offend. Stern notes "So how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the "old" MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I'm doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out." Click here For more on the WSJ review.   Engadget's review by Dana Wollman was brutally honest. Dana notes that "I'm one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn't quite what I wanted.   For me, this is both a step forward and a step backward. I'm sure Apple disagrees, and not just because its job is to sell lots of computers. Apple seems to earnestly believe it knows how people should be getting work done -- so much so that it has the chutzpah to ask loyal customers to unlearn old habits. Get used to using dongles to attach your existing accessories. Say goodbye to your memory card slot, creatives. Resign yourself to adjusting the brightness or volume with taps and swipes, instead of a simple button press. Accept the risk that your existing Thunderbolt 3 peripherals might not work.   On the Touch Bar, Wollman notes that "What's annoying about this whole setup is that either way, some of the most important system controls are now buried in Touch Bar menus. Want to lower the volume? You can either hit the volume icon and hit the slider, or hit the arrow key and tap the volume up or down key. That's less efficient than just pressing a dedicated volume button in the function row. It's inconvenient enough that I eventually started using my mouse to do things like pause Spotify or raise the volume on a track. Apple made me change my way of doing things, and not necessarily for the better. That pisses me off."   Although Wollman complains, she knows that die-hard Apple will flock to it and it gives it a decent 8 out of 10 score.   On the Touch Bar, the review by The Verge was mixed. "I've been using the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for more than a week now, and I have mixed feelings about what it brings to the MacBook experience. In some cases, the Touch Bar's usefulness is obvious and immediate. But in many others, it's overly complicated or just plain unnecessary. It's an addition that very much can improve every MacBook — but it's going to take some time to get there, if it ever does."   Phil the Philosopher   Back in 2012 Samsung's Phablet had been out for about a year and Apple's VP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller wanted to downplay what many consumers were running to, the Phablet. So Schiller put on his preacher's robe and went into Phil the Philosopher mode. Patently Apple's report at the time noted that "In Describing the new iPhone, Phil Schiller stated that "It is really easy to make a new product that's bigger. Everyone does that. The challenge is to make it better and smaller."   Schiller went on to make an obvious point that Samsung forgot: "What is the design center for a Phone? It's this: it's your hand. A phone should feel great in your hand and more importantly it should be easy to use with a magical device we all carry called the horizontally opposed thumb. It does most of the hard work for us. So when you carry your phone it should feel beautiful in your hand."   As one who liked the phablet idea right out of the gate, I found it funny to listen to Phil having to defend Apple's position. More more importantly, Phil basically tried to convey the message that we just didn't get it, and if we happened to like a phablet, then surely we had lost our way.   According to Phil, my thumb had to be satisfied and that could only happen on a tiny iPhone display. Keep in mind that this isn't me conveniently looking back with 20/20 hindsight. I reported on this back in 2013 after Apple had missed delivering a phablet for a second year in a row in a report titled "Apple Passing on a larger iPhone Display still a Head Scratcher."   Well, Apple is back at it again and Phil the Philosopher is there to just lay down the law and to set us all straight. When it came to dropping ports and the SD slot that Pro users loved, Phil was there to slap them on that back and make it very clear that Apple cares "about what they love and what they are worried about. And it's our job to help people through these changes." Yes, true, at a cost and inconvenience of having multiple dongs on our desks like our cover graphic illustrates. That's helping us through the changes? Ka-ching for Apple.   It's not what Apple fans or pros wanted from a new MacBook Pro, but hey, Phil will help us through these changes because we're all just morons who just don't get it. We just don't see the light of genius in changing every port so that they look alike and are more importantly, nice and neat in a row! You know, it's just so condescending and yet I'm sure it's done with a smile. Thanks Phil.   Of course the biggest in our face position that Apple won't budge on is giving us a MacBook or iMac with a touch display. That argument should be dead by now but the tech community of writers never let it go. It's obvious that these writers and Apple fans would still like to see that come to be. But Apple continues to say that god handed them down the law on stone tablets like Moses. Phil, it's doable because Windows 10 proved it's doable so it just comes down to ideology and not because it's absurd as you claim it to be.    You know, it reminds me of people who have to eat each thing on their plate in a particular order never mixing a damn thing. Their brain isn't wired to enjoy peas and potatoes together in one scoop. It just isn't the order of things in their universe.   In a new report today Phil told Backchannel that "We think of the whole platform. If we were to do Multi-Touch on the screen of the notebook, that wouldn't be enough — then the desktop wouldn't work that way." And touch on the desktop, he says, would be a disaster. Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd."   How many times have I been at my kitchen table in the evening and just leaned over to touch the Safari or iTunes icon on my iMac like I do on my iPad to launch an app, just to laugh at what I was doing because my iMac was of course just too stupid to do that. What was I thinking, that we could have it both ways like on Windows devices?   Yet at the end of the day, most Apple fans will appreciate Apple's MacBook Pro with its new Touch Bar. On the other hand, many reviewers and fans couldn't care less about the Touch Bar, and some like me would still prefer a hybrid notebook-tablet like the invention that Apple's engineers came up with; their intelligent engineers that had their idea stolen from them by Microsoft's Surface Book. But when I get a Surface Book someday in the future, I'll always think of those Apple engineers and say thanks guys, too bad Apple didn't listen to you because it was a great idea.     Roundup of More In-Depth MacBook Pro Reviews   Philosophy aside, if you're trying to decide on whether to pass or buy that shiny new MacBook Pro for Christmas and need a nudge either way, below are a few more interesting and more in-depth reviews that might help you decide:   Ars Technica: Touch Bar MacBook Pros give an expensive glimpse at the Mac's future USA Today: MacBook Pro review: Touch Bar comes at high cost AppleInsider: Review: Apple's late-2016 15" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Gizmodo: The MacBook Pro's Touch Bar Is a Gimmick That's Not Worth the Money (Yet) Mashable: Apple's MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is worth the wait Macworld: MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: The best bits of iOS in a really great Mac --- They love the new Touch Bar as noted below in their overview video.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Per the company's most recent earnings report, Apple now has more than $237 billion in cash and other securities, anchored of course by the company's insanely lucrative iPhone. Though the iPhone only has a thin slice of smartphone marketshare, Apple's iconic smartphone accounted for an astonishing 104% (yes, you read that correctly) of the profits across the smartphone industry last quarter. DON'T MISS: Watch Dave Chappelle’s hilarious SNL opening monologue tackle all things Trump With so much money in the bank, it's only reasonable to ask what the company plans to do with all of growing cash pile. The situation is a bit tricky because the vast majority of Apple's cash (more than $200 billion) resides in overseas accounts. The following chart, compiled by Statista this past August, provides an instructive illustration of Apple's current cash position. View photos apple-cashMore As a result, if Apple were to bring that cash back stateside, it would be subject to the United States' uniquely high 35% corporate income tax rate. Apple, therefore, has opted to let its cash sit overseas rather than take a huge tax hit and bring it back. Apple's strategy in this regard, we should point out, is hardly unique. On the contrary, many large companies -- from Google to Pfizer -- hold billions of dollars in offshore accounts because they too want to avoid a large tax hit. With Donald Trump poised to assume the Presidency this coming January, Apple may be able to repatriate some of its overseas holdings sooner rather than later. Per Donald Trump's tax plan, companies like Apple would be afforded the opportunity to repatriate foreign holdings at a significant tax discount. As detailed on Trump's website, Trump's tax plan for businesses "will provide a deemed repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a one-time tax rate of 10 percent." The language here might also suggest that company's with vast cash holdings overseas will be taxed at 10% regardless of whether or not the cash is repatriated. That said, we'll have to wait and see what Trump's tax plan actually looks like once he assumes the Presidency. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWWB5uhvoYs The savings Apple would enjoy with Trump's tax plan would be immense, to say the least. In a hypothetical scenario where Apple opts to repatriate, say, $50 billion, Apple under Trump's plan would save more than $12 billion. Apple and other large multinational companies have been lobbying for a one-time tax holiday for years now. As a quick example, Tim Cook back in 2013 had this to say on the topic during an interview with the Washington Post. "If you look at it today, to repatriate cash to the US, you need to pay 35 percent of that cash," Cook said. "And that is a very high number. We are not proposing that it be zero. I know many of our peers believe that. But I don't view that. But I think it has to be reasonable." The last time we saw the powers-that-be approve a one-time tax holiday was back in 2004 when companies were allowed to repatriate their offshore holdings with a generous 5.25% tax rate. Strictly speaking, Trump isn't exactly offering a tax holiday if the 10% tax rate is enforced across the board, but the posited rate is low enough such that many companies like Apple would likely bring back their cash happily.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple has always been cagey about the possibility of a touchscreen Mac, and new comments suggest a Surface Pro-like device from the Cupertino company is unlikely to happen. Speaking to Backchannel, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller called a full touchscreen desktop experience “absurd.” “We think of the whole platform,” Schiller said. “If we were to do multi-touch on the screen of a notebook, that wouldn’t be enough—then the desktop wouldn’t work that way. Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try and do things? That becomes absurd.” With a portfolio that includes the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and Surface Studio, Microsoft certainly begs to differ. It’s becoming increasingly clear the companies have two very different visions for what the desktop experience should be. That means Apple will stick to the very old school way of the keyboard and mouse. According to Schiller, making macOS touch-friendly would “ruin the experience for those using pointer devices.” “You can’t optimize for both,” Schiller said. “It’s the lowest common denominator.” Apple previously tested full touchscreen Macs Apple could always change its mind but it sounds as though the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is the closest thing Apple fans will get to a Surface Pro. You either buy the company’s latest MacBook Pro or you buy an iPad Pro; don’t expect Apple to combine the two. Schiller told Backchannel that Apple engineers have tested full touchscreen Macs in the past but concluded, “It isn’t the right thing to do.” Schiller said, “Our instincts were correct.” It’s unclear which company’s approach will win out in the long run. However, recent data suggests Apple’s new MacBook Pro is already selling like hot cakes, so perhaps Schiller’s instincts were right after all.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The Latest iPhone 8 Rumor Will Probably Make You Mad Mark Spoonauer Editor in Chief Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)November 14, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share The iPhone 8 should be a stunner of a phone, with a curved, bezel-free design, but you'll probably have to pay more than you want to get the best screen. While both the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to sport all-glass bodies, Touch ID built into the display, wireless charging and new multi-sensor cameras, Apple could be saving the one feature everyone's been waiting for for the larger plus. Credit: Sam RutherfordMore Credit: Sam Rutherford A report from Mac Rumors, citing four Barclays Research analysts with sources in Apple's supply chain, says that the borderless design of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus will allow Apple to offer larger 5-inch and 5.8-inch screens while keeping the same overall size of the current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models. MORE: Best Camera Phone - Top-Rated Smartphone Cameras That's potentially good news, as you'd get larger panels within the same size chassis as before. A 5.8-inch iPhone would be particularly huge, as it would dwarf most phablets on the market, although there are some 5.9-inchers like the Huawei Mate 9. The gotcha is that these same analysts say that Apple is reserving an OLED display for the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 Plus. The smaller iPhone 8 (and there could be two of them in different sizes) will reportedly use a traditional LCD. As anyone who has seen or used one of Samsung's Galaxy phones in the last several years, you probably already know the advantages of OLED. But just in case you don't, this type of display offers richer colors, deeper blacks and wider viewing angles. Plus, OLED tends to be more energy efficient. This move wouldn't be shocking given the advantages the current iPhone 7 Plus has over the iPhone 7. Only the larger phone has a dual-lens camera, which enables optical zoom and a new portrait mode, and it offers a higher-resolution screen and longer battery life. MORE: 7 Reasons iPhone 7 Plus Beats iPhone 7 Reserving OLED for the iPhone 8 Plus would truly make it pop. The current price difference between the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is about $120, and it could be easier to justify should only the 8 Plus boast an OLED screen. But not everyone wants to carry around a supersized phone, so it would be a real bummer if you couldn't get the best display tech in a one-hand-friendly design. Samsung offers Super AMOLED screens on the smaller 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 and larger 5.5-inch S7 Edge, but Apple doesn't have to follow anyone's lead.

The firm is set to unveil the most radical redesign of its flagship handset so far for the iPhone's 10th anniversary in 2017. The latest rumours claim it will have a radical edge to edge curved screen - and a screen size boost. Scroll down for video  Apple firm is expected to unveil the most radical redesign ever of its flagship handset for the iPhone's 10th anniversary in 2017. Pictured are two concept drawings Barclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O'Malley, and Jerry Zhang says the screens will allow the handsets to maintian the same overall size as the current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models The analysts, citing sources 'within Apple's supply chain' said 'iPhone 8 design didn't sound 100% locked down but we believe the move is to a bezel-less design with screen sizes getting larger and curved edges in the original envelope.  'The iPhone 8 moves to 5' (from 4.7') and the Plus moves to 5.8' (from 5.5').'

Share this article Share 22 shares In the research note obtained by MacRumors, the analysts said only the 5.8-inch model will use OLED display technology, which can be sharper, brighter, and more energy efficient than LCD technology.   It comes days after experts predicted the iPhone 8 will also have wireless charging. Foxconn Technology Group in New Taipei City, Taiwan is making wireless charging modules to go with Apple's next iPhone, due for release in 2017, according to an industry source familiar with the matter, Nikkei has reported. 'But whether the feature can eventually make it into Apple's updated devices will depend on whether Foxconn can boost the yield rate to a satisfactory level later on,' the source told Nikkei.  It is not clear whether Apple would offer a wireless charging plate, along the same lines as the one made by Samsung for its Galaxy S smartphones. But a patent application, filed by Apple with the US Patent and Trademark Office in September showed images of a round charging device with a concave top, similar to the plastic wireless charger used by the Apple Watch.  The patent was first filed in late 2015 but was only just published last month.  While the patent is largely focused on brushing and polishing tools for metallic cylindrical and contoured devices, it also refers to an 'inductive charging station', notes Patently Apple. A patent application, filed by Apple with the US Patent and Trademark Office in September showed images of a round charging device with a concave top, similar to the plastic wireless charger used by the Apple Watch (pictured) It appears that the polishing tools are being developed specifically for a wireless charging station with a metal finish, which would match the iPhone. 'In describing how the tools would work, the application includes multiple illustrations of a charging station used to provide electrical current to another device via inductive power transmission,' notes Mac Rumours. END OF THE HOME BUTTON?  A patent granted to Apple recently revealed technology that places the home button underneath the display. The innovation uses an electrostatic lens that connects the connect the screen and sensors, allowing the device to accurately read fingerprints on the screen. Depending on the position of these lenses, relative voltage and shape, the layer or layers are able to shape or bend the electric field associate with the user's finger, reports AppleInsider. These specially designed lenses would also reduce the spreading of the electric field of a user's finger when placed on the screen, as this type of bending can sometimes offset a fingerprint's natural dispersion. 'An inductive transmitter coil wraps around a metal core and is designed to pair with a receiver coil and charge the battery in the electronic device'.  Previous rumours have suggested new MacBook computers could include a wireless charging module on which the device can be placed to power it up. Last week it was revealed Apple is set to launch three versions of the iPhone 8 next year, including a new 5inch handset. Citing a supply chain source, Nikkei said Apple will release the three iPhones in the following  5.5 inches, 5 inches, and 4.7 inches (14cm, 12.7cm and 11.9cm). Apple recently killed the headphone jack and its next victim could be the home button, according to previous rumours. A patent awarded last month describes technology that is capable of scanning fingerprints almost anywhere on the screen of an iOS device - making the home button obsolete. The latest application suggests using a special lens behind the display that connects the screen and sensors, allowing the device to capture an accurate print reading. Rumours of Apple doing away with the iconic home button are not groundbreaking - many believed the firm would leave it out of the iPhone 7 design. Apple killed the headphone jack and its next victim could be the home button. A recent patent describes a special lens behind the screen that scans fingerprints anywhere on the surface These specially designed lens (pictured) would also reduce the spreading of the electric field of a user's finger when placed on the screen, as this type of bending can sometimes offset a fingerprint's natural dispersion SHOULD YOU WAIT FOR THE IPHONE 8? While details on the iPhone 8 are scarce, new reports suggest it will have a totally different look from previous handsets and will come with better cameras. An unnamed employee at an Apple site in Herzliya, Israel, where hardware is being developed for the iPhone 8, has leaked some details about the new handset. Given that 2017 will be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, it would make sense that Apple has something big planned. But the unnamed employee told Business Insider that the iPhone 8 would be 'different' from previous handsets, which have been critiqued as being too similar. If those rumours are true, the iPhone 8 could rival the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge which came out in February this year. n January, Apple revisited a patent filed in 2013, which proposed a curved 'glass' case made from an intricate fusion of metals melted together. The design - made from Bulk Amorphous Alloy, which is a mix of titanium, nickel, copper and zirconium melted together - is said to have the smooth texture of glass and the rigid sturdiness of rubber. Despite widespread excitement over the unique design, it still hasn't reached the general public. Apple usually releases a new model, and then an 'S' version of that model the next year, so some people were expected an iPhone 7S to be released in 2017. But the worker used the term 'iPhone 8' unprompted during the conversations, suggesting Apple may be skipping the 7S entirely.  Read more: Exclusive: Foxconn tests wireless charging for iPhone 8: source- Nikkei Asian Review Apple Said to Release Curved, Bezel-Free 5-Inch and 5.8-Inch iPhones Next Year - Mac Rumors Share or comment on this article e-mail 22 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background.

Apple Seeds Beta 3 of iOS 10.2, macOS 10.12.2 and tvOS 10.1, Videos App Removed Updated GO The new TV app replaces the old Video application in iOS Nov 14, 2016 22:05 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Today, November 14, 2016, Apple seeded the third Beta versions of its upcoming iOS 10.2, macOS Sierra 10.12.2, and tvOS 10.1 operating systems to developers enrolled in the Apple Developer program, along with the second Beta of Xcode 8.2 IDE. The Beta 3 development builds are here exactly one week after the release of the second Betas of the iOS 10.2 for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices, and tvOS 10.1 for Apple TV (4th generation) devices, and six days after the Beta 2 announcement for the macOS 10.12.2 Sierra operating system for supported MacBook and iMac computers. Also today, Apple seeded the second Beta release of the Xcode 8.2 IDE (Integrated Development Environment) application, which appears to include the SDKs (Software Development Kits) for the newest iOS 10.2, macOS 10.12.2, tvOS 10.1, and watchOS 3.1.1 Betas. Developers should be aware that Xcode 8.2 Beta requires Mac OS X 10.11.5 or later. Old Videos app finally removed from iOS As for the new features and changes, we can mention that starting with today's iOS 10.2 Beta 3 build, Apple removes the old Videos app that no one used, which was replaced by the new TV app unveiled during the "Hello again" event last month. However, as we reported last week, the new TV app won't work for all users in all regions. There are also various other improvements to the new SOS functionality, a new "Send With Love" effect for the Messages app, and lots of bug fixes. As usual, the third Public Beta builds of iOS 10.2, tvOS 10.1, and macOS 10.12.2 Sierra should be seeded to public beta testers in the next few hours or so. Until the iOS 10.2 Beta 3 and macOS 10.12.2 Beta 3 versions arrive for public testing, you can read our "Here's How to Install iOS 10 Public Beta on Your iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch" and "Here's How to Install macOS Sierra 10.12 Public Beta on Your Mac Right Now" if you want to install them.

(Apple) Share Written by Mike Murphy November 14, 2016 After about four years, Apple has finally overhauled its flagship laptop, the MacBook Pro. The new machines are thinner, lighter, and potentially faster than their predecessors. They also come with a fancy new tiny touchscreen sitting atop the keyboard, called a Touch Bar, which replaces the traditional function keys on a keyboard. Reviews for the new machines hit the internet today, and for the first time in years, reviewers aren’t overwhelmingly thrilled by them. Some miss all the ports the older machines had; others bemoan their battery life; and others their price. Quartz rounded up the opinions of some of the major reviewers below, hopefully helping you figure out whether it’s time to get a new laptop. The Touch Bar is gimmicky Apple’s new tiny second screen works well, but isn’t indispensable, at least yet, according to Wired’s David Pierce: “Technically, the Touch Bar works brilliantly. It’s fast and smooth and responsive. The textured glass feels great, and looks fantastic. Using my fingerprint on the Touch ID reader to log in and to pay for stuff is the best. But the implementation feels unfinished.” The screen will change what digital buttons appear based on what programs you’re using at any given moment. “Right now, I’m subject to Apple’s best guess about what I want,” Pierce added. “Apple often guesses wrong.” The Touch Bar, being used to scroll through photos. (Apple) Engadget’s Dana Wollman agreed: “It’s inconvenient enough that I eventually started using my mouse to do things like pause Spotify or raise the volume on a track. Apple made me change my way of doing things, and not necessarily for the better. That pisses me off.” Conversely, Macworld’s Susie Ochs found the Touch Bar to be useful: “The Touch Bar is incredibly handy not only because its controls change to match the app you’re using, but also because it’s so customizable.” (It’s worth noting that the Touch Bar also adds $300 to the price of Apple’s new laptop.) New keyboard The MacBook Pro follows in the new MacBook’s footsteps and removed the chiclet-style keyboard found on old Mac laptops, replacing them with keys that barely move when you press them down. Pierce didn’t mind them: “The keyboard (a refined take on the 12-inch MacBook’s butterfly keys) doesn’t have much travel and takes getting used to, but it’s accurate and crisp and works beautifully.” The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern was a little less impressed: “You will get used to the spring of the keys on the new flat keyboard. You also get used to sleeping on a rock when camping. What won’t the people around you get used to? The loud clacking sound of the keys.” Not a lot of ports. (Apple) No ports The new MacBook Pros only sport four new USB-C ports, meaning that you’re likely going to need adapters to connect any devices that you used to be able to connect to older MacBook Pros with ease. Stern called using the new Macs a “dongle nightmare.” But long-term, Recode’s Walt Mossberg thinks this won’t likely be an issue for the average user: “I honestly don’t think this is a big problem for average Mac users, whose main need will likely be a new Mac-to-iPhone cable ($19 from Apple). And I believe that, over time, most peripherals will switch to USB-C, since other companies—not just Apple—are behind it.” (Mossberg also called the new laptops a “tweener” but I have no idea if that’s a good or a bad thing or even what that means.) There are some advantages to USB-C, however, such as how fast they can transfer data, and the fact that you can’t you won’t spend hours trying to make sure you’re putting your cables in the right way up. As Ochs put it: “That standard is the future, and offers some real benefits like transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps and support for two external monitors up to 5K each. Right now, though, in the year 2016, I would have preferred a mix of USB-C and full-size USB sockets.” Poor battery life The Verge’s Jacob Kastrenakes said the batteries were an issue, and he only get a charge of more than about six hours once: “It turns out, however, that the bigger issue with these machines isn’t the performance, but the battery life. Apple promises 10 hours, but our tests fell far short of that.” Engadget’s Dana Wollman found “inconsistencies” in her battery life tests, only sometimes getting close to the 10 hours Apple promised that the computer would have. Regardless, she said, that’s lower than the 12-ish hours battery life she got on old MacBook Pros she tested. Good design Like just about every Apple product for the last decade or so, most reviewers agree that Apple’s industrial design is still second-to-none. Stern said, “Compared with my rotting MacBook Air and the old MacBook Pro, the new Pros look like they’ve been on a serious juice cleanse.” Kastrenakes agreed: “The hardware is incredible, macOS is a joy to use, and I don’t want to give up this screen and keyboard. It’s a fantastic laptop on build alone.” Many reviewers also commented on the inexplicably massive new trackpad, which is nearly twice as large as the one on last year’s 13-inch model. The new trackpad also has a pressure-sensitive function like the screen on an iPhone 6S or 7, which allows you to access different functions if you press harder. Stern said that “Apple makes the best trackpad on any laptop, regardless of operating system,” but did have issues touching by mistake because of its omnipresence. Use your finger to pay for things. (Apple) The price MacBook Pros have never been cheap machines, and the new ones are no different. The 13-inch model with a Touch Bar starts at $1,800, and the 15-inch model at $2,400. The New York Times’ Brian X. Chen said that storage constraints may be an issue for some owners, adding, “The MacBook Pros are also expensive, and some users may end up spending thousands of dollars above the retail price for add-ons like extra storage.” (The new Pros all ship with either 256 or 512 GB hard drives, and only the more expensive models can be upgraded to 1 TB—for an extra $400). Chen’s review even goes as far as to potentially suggest a cheaper Chromebook, or a “Hackintosh”—a standard Windows PC that’s been modified to run macOS—over the new Macs. Kastrenakes called the 13-inch model “Overpriced and underpowered,” and Pierce put it in even simpler terms: “Laptops aren’t supposed to be this expensive, are they?” Read this next: If you don’t want to get the new MacBook Pro, consider these Windows laptops instead Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Depending on the reviewer, the Touch Bar feature is either a gimmick or a productivity-boosting addition. As for performance, the reviews are mixed: some people are saying that a lot faster SSD and RAM make the machine super snappy and others note Intel’s Skylake chips barely push performance forward versus 2013 or later MacBook Pros. Jason Snell, Six Colors The Touch Bar delighted Snell: The Touch Bar is an animated interface through and through. Items don’t just fade in and out, but also slide smoothly back and forth. The arrow pointing from the Touch Bar to the Touch ID sensor during a request for an unlock grows and shrinks, practically begging you to put your finger down. There’s a lot more personality here than I expected. To balance out the design, the Touch Bar’s OLED screen doesn’t extend all the way to the left edge of the glass. As a result, the Touch Bar always appears inset from the rest of the keyboard. It’s a bit weird. Here’s a video of Snell’s thoughts on the Touch Bar. For those wondering, you can hit the ESC key on the Touch Bar without hitting the button itself. Tapping the corner of the Touch Bar blindly triggers an ESC key event, as you can see in John Gruber’s video below. This is great if you’d like to hit ESC without looking down at the keyboard. Jim Dalrymple, The Loop Jim discusses the RAM non-issue: To see how the new 15-inch MacBook Pro would do with audio, I opened a 40-track Logic Pro project. The song had a mix of loops, drums, and live recorded instruments. I played back the track, recorded some more guitars, added effects and did everything I would normally do with a music project. When I looked at the memory usage for Logic Pro, it was using 1GB RAM. The MacBook Pro has 16GB, so I have a lot of room before I ever have to worry about running out of memory. I know that having 16GB RAM is a concern for some people, but you could never put more than 16GB RAM in a MacBook Pro, so I don’t get the problem. Pros and other customers have been successfully using these computers for years. Just because it takes more RAM to use a Windows machine effectively, that doesn’t mean the same thing for a Mac. You have to look at the entire picture, hardware, software, system software, and memory optimizations. Unlike some other reviewers, Jim does not think that the Touch Bar is a gimmick. Most of us are so engrained in our workflow that we do things without even thinking about. However, when you do think to check the Touch Bar, you can see how things can be done simpler and easier. Here’s a small example. Have you ever opened the calculator app and had to choose to type in the numbers or click with the mouse? No matter what you do, it’s a pain just because of the type of app it is. With Touch Bar, all of the calculator functions are in the Touch Bar, directly above the numbers on the keyboard. This is clearly so much easier. There are a lot of examples like this with Apple’s apps and there will be many more when third-party developers add support for Touch Bar in the next few months. Touch Bar is cool, but let’s not neglect Touch ID. When the system wants your password to make changes, or delete an app, you can just place your finger on the Touch ID sensor and you’re done. The same can be done in System Preferences when making changes. It’s so much quicker than typing in your password. It’s a small thing, but it all matters. Susie Ochs, Macworld Susie was impressed with the more powerful speakers. What isn’t a bummer are the new speakers, my favorite non-Touch Bar feature of the new machines. Apple explained that since they are connected right to the battery with no transformer between them, the speakers can get twice the peak power—and you can really hear the difference. Music sounds great when you turn the volume all the way up, and the speakers are powerful enough to provide satisfying sound while watching movies, TV, and sports. The 15-inch model’s speakers seem to have more oomph than the 13-incher’s, but both can ably fill a hotel room with music, if you should want to leave your portable Bluetooth speaker at home. Her hands-on video is available at the source link. I’m not embedding it here due to Macworld’s ill-practice of auto-starting videos in the background. Should you buy the new Pro now or later? These new MacBook Pros have a lot going for them. Their biggest weakness, across the whole Touch Bar line, is price. These prices could come down a little bit next generation, but if you need a MacBook Pro right now, the late 2016 models are solid performers. If I were buying one for myself, I’d go with the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and max out the storage, although the 15-inch model is even better. Or simply wait (if you can) until prices of the new Pros inevitably fall next year as Apple refreshes them around Intel’s Kaby Lake chips. Walt Mossberg, The Verge WSJ’s former technology columnist took his 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for a spin, deciding that the notebook that was once mainly aimed straight at people who do especially taxing work like professional video editing or serious design is “now being stretched to suit a much larger audience.” He experienced some problems with the inconsistent battery life: On my rigorous test, which I’ve used for years, the machine actually exceeded Apple’s claim of up to 10 hours of battery life. The test involves setting the screen at 100 percent, keeping it on and undimmed constantly, playing an endless loop of music, and leaving Wi-Fi on to collect email, tweets, and Facebook posts in the background. Result: 11 hours and 38 minutes. I ran a second test with all of Apple’s default energy-saving settings on, the screen at 75 percent and a perfectly normal (for me) mix of tasks like web browsing, email, a few short videos, Twitter, Facebook, some light writing, and Slack. The Pro died at 8 hours and 22 minutes. To make things worse, Apple’s built-in prediction of how much time the battery had left before dying fluctuated a lot and was mostly wrong. According to Mossberg, Apple says this is a known problem caused by the fact that modern processors can power up and down rapidly over a much wider range than in the past, making estimates much more difficult. In conclusion, he wrote: The new 13” MacBooks—even the base model without the Touch Bar—are costly. And they may make pros unhappy. But, for everyday Mac lovers—users of the Air or maybe the older low-end Pro—they are now your only thin, modern, option with a full-fledged processor. The Touch Bar has potential, but it’s not magic. The battery isn’t likely to deliver on Apple’s claims. You can’t count on liking the keyboard. But, if you’re a Mac devotee ready to move past the Air—not back to a lower-powered MacBook—this is what Apple is offering. Take it or leave it. The new MacBook Pro is a “fast, slim tweener,” wrote Mossberg. Joanna Stern, The Wall Street Journal Even with the faster chips and new hardware features like the Touch Bar and Touch ID, you’ll get the same performance and battery as in the older model, notes WSJ. So how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the “old” MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I’m doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out. Here’s her video hands-on. Brian Heater, TechCrunch Brian likes the speed bump provided by faster chips, SSD and RAM, saying these features make the new MacBook Pros worthy upgrades, “particularly for those who have been suffering through their old system’s death rattles (or fan buzzing, at least), waiting for a significant update” from Apple. Better processors, more storage, a brighter display and better speakers are all wrapped up in a sleeker and lighter package than before. The Touch Bar feels like a nice bonus for the time being. It’s a compelling new input device that has the potential to alter the way we interact with applications on a laptop. In conclusion, the author wrote: For those who have been holding out on buying a new MacBook, the time is right, with an upgrade that should be sufficiently future-proof to take on the next few years — or however long it takes for the next major upgrade. Hopefully you’ve been saving up in the meantime. Brian X. Chen, The New York Times Brian calls the new MacBook Pros light and fast—“probably powerful enough for most professionals”—but notes these machines aren’t for everyone because the Touch Bar so far “feels gimmicky” and “not many devices or accessories come with USB-C connectors yet.” One thing is sure: For casual users or anyone buying their first laptop, who may just want a computer for web browsing and lightweight apps, the MacBook Pro is overkill. So if you aren’t ready to make the jump to USB-C and you don’t want to spend a big chunk of your savings, it’s reasonable to wait for the new Apple notebooks to realize their potential or drop in price. Dan Ackerman, CNET Dan thinks Apple’s new mainstream MacBook Pro is going to be liked by a whole lot of new customers. On the downside, he notes that the Touch Bar itself “isn’t a must-have” right now. In his opinion, the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar is likely going to be the default mainstream choice for price-sensitive consumers. While the five percent of the laptop buyers who consider themselves true creative professionals may take various issues with the machine, the remaining 95 percent should see it as a compelling choice. It’s far and away Apple’s most-advanced laptop. The touchpad has double the surface area of the previous model, it’s about as light as a MacBook Air but much thinner (14.9mm versus 18mm), and the flatter butterfly style keyboard has been subtly tweaked to work better here than it does in the 12-inch MacBook. Andrew Cunningham, Ars Technica Andrew notes that folks who use their notebook connected to an external display most of the time with its lid closed won’t have much use for the Touch Bar shortcuts. If it’s being used as a desktop with an external keyboard a significant amount of the time, the Touch Bar does nothing for you. When I went out of my way to use Apple’s apps, I liked the Touch Bar a lot. It just takes one or two useful buttons—creating a new tab in Safari, looking up a main page in Terminal, changing font sizes or creating checklists in Notes—to make you glad the Touch Bar is there. However, a typical day for me is spent mostly in Word, Outlook, Slack, Tweetbot, and Chrome. Microsoft is bringing Touch Bar support to Office, but if other app makers don’t start adding in support, a big chunk of that bar is going to end up sitting empty most of the time. Moving on to graphics, Apple states that the discreet Polaris-based AMD chip (Radeon Pro 450, Radeon Pro 455 and built-to-order Radeon Pro 460) inside the new Pro can drive up to four 4K external displays at 60 Hz simultaneously or two 5K displays at 60 Hz simultaneously (alongside the built-in screen). This is possible thanks to a technique called Multi-Stream Transport (MST) which permits the machine to push two DisplayPort 1.2 streams to the monitor over the single Thunderbolt 3 cable. When you hook one of LG’s 5K monitors to one of the new MacBook Pros, what you’re actually seeing on the screen is two pictures stitched together to make a single seamless image. This is because the version of the DisplayPort specification supported by Intel’s GPUs and almost all monitors these days—version 1.2—doesn’t have enough bandwidth to drive a 5K display at 60Hz all by itself. There’s nothing wrong with this method, except that it cuts down on the number of external displays your computer can support. Intel’s integrated GPUs can drive a total of three displays, but you use up two of those three streams to drive one 5K monitor and one of them to drive the laptop’s internal display. AMD’s GPUs support up to six displays, so you can use two of those connections for one 5K monitor, two of them for the other 5K monitor, one for the laptop’s internal display, and still have one left over for yet another monitor if you really wanted to use one. Switching from Intel’s integrated Iris Pro graphics in favor of dedicated AMD GPUs has resulted in significant graphics performance improvements over previous models, Andrew observes. In his tests, the mid-range 2.7GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro model with AMD’s built-in Radeon Pro 455 graphics chip showed a “significant boost” over this year’s revised twelve-inch MacBook and older 2012-2015 MacBook Pros dedicated GPUs (Nvidia’s built-to-order GeForce GTX 650M and GeForce GTX 750M, plus AMD’s Radeon R9 M370X). Omg the flip side, the new Pros lack the oomph required for high-end gaming and VR. Is it disappointing that Apple didn’t decide to push the envelope a little more? Sure. Is it too bad that performance and power efficiency were apparently sacrificed in the name of external display support? Yes. Are these midrange GPUs in any way inconsistent with any MacBook Pro released in the last decade? No. Here’s how the new Pro scored in the GFXbench synthetic GPU benchmark. Apple says that the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch ID has 130 percent faster graphics and up to 2.5x more computing power per watt versus the previous-generation 15-incher, but keep in mind that Apple’s numbers are based on AMD’s built-to-order Radeon Pro 460 chip. Andrew doesn’t think Apple should have used Nvidia’s Pascal-based GPUs instead of AMD’s even though Nvidia chips do provide support for the latest DisplayPort 1.3 specification. That’s because Thunderbolt 3 and external displays currently max out at DisplayPort 1.2 and are yet to implement support for DisplayPort 1.3. Apple will have more flexibility again when DisplayPort 1.3 becomes more common. Those future laptops will be able to drive two 5K screens plus a laptop’s internal screen using just three DisplayPort streams instead of five. For now, though, if pushing two high-end 5K screens at once was a design goal for Apple, AMD was the only way to go. Fun fact: Pascal GPUs from Nvidia cannot drive dual 5K displays via MST. Does he recommend buying the new Pro? If you’ve got a MacBook Pro that you bought in 2012 or earlier and if you’re convinced of the potential utility and novelty of the Touch Bar, these 2016 MacBook Pros were just about worth the wait. Replace a four- or five-year-old laptop with one of these and you’ll get a great new design, a respectable performance boost, a nice screen, the single most versatile port you can get in any computer, and a new input device…The main problem at this point isn’t that the Touch Bar is a bad idea, but that these laptops cost a whole bunch of money. Great, premium PC laptops are available for half this price, even if Apple still maintains an edge when it comes to graphics and SSD speeds. It really feels like the Touch Bar needs to be included in the $1,499 model, and that versions of the new designs without Touch Bars should be the entry level systems—right now, Apple’s entry-level Mac laptops were all released in mid 2015, and that’s only going to get more embarrassing as time moves on. Lance Ulanoff, Mashable On the removal of all the legacy ports from the new Pro and the Dongle Hell: Removing all those ports was certainly a risky move for Apple, but, in truth, the most you could fault them for is maybe leaping a little too far into the future. Apple is not the only company adopting USB-C. It’s a standard, after all, and just like USB spelled the end of the line for parallel and serial ports, USB-C will eventually be the port to rule all ports, and those peripherals you’re clinging to will someday, in the not too distant future, be deemed too slow or feature-poor to keep you competitive. Is “Dongle Hell” a real thing? In the short term, yes. In the long term, a single multipurpose port will always be the winner. src=&#8221;http://mashable.com/videos/embed?video=qBSPfJH2&#038;player=offsite&#8221; width=&#8217;593&#8242; height=&#8217;333&#8242; Lance criticizes the new Pros as being a bit on the expensive side, but they’re still “an excellent upgrade with a fascinating and highly extensible new Touch Bar.” Dana Wollman, Engadget I’m one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn’t quite what I wanted. For me, the ideal MacBook Pro is actually a mashup between this and last year’s model. She disliked the fact that some system controls are buried within Touch Bar menus: What’s annoying about this whole setup is that either way, some of the most important system controls are now buried in Touch Bar menus. Want to lower the volume? You can either hit the volume icon and hit the slider, or hit the arrow key and tap the volume up or down key. That’s less efficient than just pressing a dedicated volume button in the function row. It’s inconvenient enough that I eventually started using my mouse to do things like pause Spotify or raise the volume on a track. Apple made me change my way of doing things, and not necessarily for the better. That pisses me off. Touch ID and a thinner design are nice, but she wants her ports back. There’s lots to like about the new MacBook Pro: its slimmed-down design, brighter screen, improved audio, faster graphics and disk speeds. But by doing things like removing full-sized USB ports, the memory card reader and even the Function row, Apple seems to forgotten how many of us actually work. An even better MacBook Pro would be one that doesn’t require users to make “drastic changes to their workflow,” she says. Then, of course, there would be no progress if Apple didn’t challenge the status quo. Christina Warren, Gizmodo To Christina, the new MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar is currently a gimmick that’s not worth the money until more third-party applications support it. It’s somewhat useful, but it’s still so undersupported for apps beyond Apple’s that, at least for right now, the Touch Bar is not reason enough to get a new MacBook Pro. Particularly if you’re already satisfied with the performance of your existing machine. If you need a new MacBook Pro and you can’t wait for the Kaby Lake refreshes already rumored, the benefits of the internal specs matched with the cool-factor of the Touch Bar make this a good Mac. For everyone else this is a gimmick on a very good, way too expensive laptop. Third-party support for the Touch Bar is sparse but growing. Expect apps focused on design and coding to adopt first. My favorite Touch Bar app so far is 1Password, largely because it uses the Touch Bar and Touch ID. I really hope Google chooses to support the Touch Bar. It could be very useful, especially with extensions. On the other hand, she totally loves Touch ID and thinks it’s an “awesome” addition to the Mac, but is also  ”bummed” about the lack of a rose gold color option. Dongle Hell? To use your old peripherals, you’ll be in dongle hell for the short term, but the 4 Thunderbolt 3 ports at least give lots of connectivity options for the future. As for the performance, her review states that both the base 13-inch model without Touch Bar and the base 15-inch model with Touch Bar were performant across Gizmodo’s benchmarks. Christina offered a word of advice to would-be buyers: “If you’re getting the 13-inch, consider spending the extra $200 on 16GB of RAM now, since you cannot upgrade later.” Harry McCracken, FastCo Beyond the svelter design, Touch Bar, and new ports, the new MacBook Pros shows multiple refinements that, on their own, wouldn’t prompt anyone to splurge on a new computer. They just make that new computer better once you have it, and are the sort of improvements that Apple never gets enough credit for making. The MacBook Pro’s high-resolution Retina display would have been one of the biggest reasons to upgrade from a MacBook Air no matter what. But it’s also brighter than previous screens—at full blast, it makes my eyeballs tingle—offers better contrast, and has a wider color gamut for more accurate reproduction of photos. Edward C. Baig, USA Today Edward likes using Touch ID to get into the computer and approve purchases. He’s not too concerned about the removal of legacy ports in favor of USB-C. In fact, USB-S, he writes, at least gives consumers more choices in terms of the chargers. You can use pretty much any USB-C charger to juice up your Mac, though if you try a cellphone charger as I did, it might not charge quite as fast as using the supplied USB-C power adapter, which incidentally replaces the old MacSafe adapter. He’s a fan of the redesigned speaker system that Apple says provides twice the dynamic range of earlier MacBook Pros (“What I can say is that the speakers are loud and crisp, and the overall audio quality is excellent”) and likes the new low-profile keyboard: I never fully cozied up to the “butterfly” style Qwerty keyboard on Apple’s MacBook notebook and was worried when I first learned that the MacBook Pro keyboard was based on the same technology. But the refined second-generation butterfly mechanism used here represents a marked improvement. The keys are responsive. I felt perfectly comfortable, for instance, typing this column out on the keyboard. Like many other reviewers, he balked at the MacBook Pro’s high price which makes the powerful notebook pricier than it’s ever been before and out of reach of many notebook buyers like myself. Chris Davies, Slashgear In dropping almost all legacy ports in favor of Thunderbolt 3, ignoring the Windows 10 style of touchscreen in favor of supplementary Touch Bar and adopting the low-profile butterfly keyboard, Apple has created a pretty “contentious machine,” Chris writes. In his opinion, Apple has not really forgotten the “professional” in recreating the MacBook Pro as other commenters have claimed before him. Has Apple forgotten the professionals which are arguably its most vocal advocates? I don’t think that’s true, though I do suspect that group now finds itself at the fringe of MacBook Pro users. Such is the side-effect of a user group in general expanding. Like Touch ID, the Touch Bar as a brand new hardware feature is currently in infancy and will need some time to take off and realize its potential in full: Ergonomically, I’m among those still content with a non-touch primary display. My experience with the Touch Bar, meanwhile, has left me mighty curious to see what comes next as third-party developers get to grips with the potential of the added interface. Right now, a large part of its usefulness is in replicating keyboard shortcuts: that’s handy if you’re unfamiliar with them, but it’s no great surprise that longtime Mac users have been less wowed. The new MacBook Pros have huge trackpads, but Chris saw no issues resting his hand on them due to flawless palm rejection. All that extra room makes macOS gestures easier, and there’s less swipe-and-lift involved in general navigation. I was a little worried about palm-rejection, given the size of the trackpad means there’s a reasonable chance some part of your hand or wrist might be resting on it at times, but Apple’s improved algorithms there have seemingly done the trick, and I’ve not noticed any issues. The sheer size of the trackpad makes him wish that Apple had added Pencil compatibility for repurposing the trackpad as a graphics tablet. Now, that’s a clever idea!

Apple's list includes 14 apps that now work with the Touch Bar, like Day One, OmniGraffle 7, PocketCAS, Mail Designer Pro 3, Focus, and 1Password. Some of the apps, like Final Cut Pro and djay Pro, were previously shown off by Apple on stage when the MacBook Pro was announced. The scope of Touch Bar support varies by app, but in many apps, once-buried settings and frequently used shortcuts are now available in the Touch Bar, allowing users to speed up their workflows. In djay Pro, for example, the Touch Bar can be used for full music manipulation, while in 1Password, it offers options for quickly adding or finding passwords. One of the chief complaints in MacBook Pro reviews released today was the lack of support by third-party apps, but that should soon improve as developers finish updating their apps with Touch Bar compatibility. Many apps, including popular titles like Pixelmator, Photoshop, Affinity Design, and Microsoft Office, will be introducing Touch Bar support in the coming weeks.

Comments By Mike Elgan Follow Computerworld | Nov 14, 2016 12:10 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Wearables Mobile & Wireless Comments Where did wearables go wrong? Futurists promised a "wearable computing" world in which you could buy gadgets that could perform a thousand functions and live anywhere on your body. Instead, the vast majority of wearables are biometric wristwatches, measuring mostly heart rate and bodily movement. The top-selling wearables come from Fitbit, Apple, Xiaomi, Garmin and Samsung -- all watches that measure movement and heart rate. The overwhelming predominance of fitness watches is problematic in four ways that hardly anybody talks about. 1. You can wear only one. If you're inclined to own a smartwatch, you already have one. Your wrist is taken. So the hundreds of new smartwatches on the market are unusable and irrelevant to you as a consumer. 2. Wrist-worn biometrics don't work well. The most heavily touted feature is heart rate monitoring. A JAMA Cardiology study found that the Apple Watch is the most accurate heart rate monitor among the popular fitness wearables they tested, and its accuracy was only around 90%. Others grouped into the low 80% range, according to the report. (No watch comes close to the accuracy of chest straps for heart rate monitoring because they can track the heart's electrical activity, which suggests a promising future for heart-rate-monitoring sports bras for women.) 3. Fitness watches don't boost fitness. Separate from the inaccuracy of wrist-based heart rate monitoring, the general idea of using biometrics to boost fitness probably doesn't work for most users. Take weight loss, for example. A two-year clinical trial conducted at the University of Pittsburgh put hundreds of people on a behavioral weight loss program. Half the participants were given consumer fitness wearables. But the group without wearables lost more weight. (My guess is that fitness trackers tend to make you feel like you're getting more exercise than you're really getting.) 4. People lose interest in fitness watches. More than half the fitness wearables purchased end up in a junk drawer, according to a survey by Endeavour Partners. (Over the next two years, that situation will improve with the entry of choice in smartglasses and hearables.) Despite all this, biometric-capable smartwatches get most of the wearables attention, and most of the sales. But what about those of us who aren't in the market for another wristwatch, and already have a way (or don't want) to track our heart rate or movement? Are there any interesting consumer wearables beyond biometric fitness watches -- and glasses and earbuds, for that matter? Turns out the answer is: Yes! Here's the world of innovative wearables you never hear about that don't go on your wrist, face or ears and which don't primarily track biometrics. Jewelry An Indian startup called Leaf Wearables sells a line of smart jewelry that includes a $60 pendant, bracelet and key chain. Each device revolves around a big fake jewel. By squeezing the jewel twice, Leaf Wearables (working through a Bluetooth-connected smartphone app) notifies your list of emergency contacts with a text-based "SOS" telling them you're in danger and giving the location. They can track you on a map over time as well. If you look at your phone, you can see the nearest hospitals and police stations. The Leaf battery lasts a week between charges. Wearsafe Labs The Wearsafe tag is a panic button that places your emergency contacts into a chat room, where they can hear a live audio stream of your situation -- and call 911 if necessary. Another panic-button wearable comes from a Connecticut-based startup called Wearsafe Labs. Their wearsafe is a clip-on device called the Wearsafe Tag, and works with a smartphone via Bluetooth. By pressing a large button on the device, you alert your network of family and friends about your location via text and email. It also streams audio, so they can hear what's going on. (It also has an optional auto-DVR function, which means it's constantly buffering audio, then streams the audio beginning 60 seconds before you pressed the button.) When alerted, your contacts are linked to a dedicated "chat room" where they can talk to each other about your situation and decide what to do. The Wearsafe is free, but requires a $4.99 monthly subscription fee. Pins Collective The Pins Collective pin is like any sort of promotional badge you might wear, but it can display anything, from a photo to text to a GIF.  A Swedish startup called Pins Collective is crowdfunding what is effectively a $69 smart badge. It's a screen for communicating with the world using graphics, including motion graphics, which you can set on the accompanying app. You can use your words, or upload a graphic or photo. You can use it as a nametag, or to support a cause or campaign. Advertise your website or business. Make yourself easy to identify when you're meeting strangers. Pins Collective reportedly intends to launch a PinOS platform and a SDK this year, and the product should ship in February. Senstone Inc. The Senstone can be worn just about anywhere, and records your voice notes with the push of a button. The Senstone is a pendant that can be worn as a clip-on, necklace, bracelet or carried as a keychain. By pressing the button or snapping your fingers, you record voice memos, which are translated into text on the app and automatically organized, according to the company, Senstone Inc. Like most wearables, it connects to an app. But unlike most, it still works even if your phone is off or elsewhere. It can record up to two hours of your yammering, which are transferred and processed later when the phone is in range. The company expects to ship in the spring. Orion Labs offers a vaguely similar device, which you wear as a clip-on or necklace. But instead of recording your voice, the Onyx conveys it to another person. Like the Star Trek communicator, the Onyx conveys your voice instantly when and while you push the button. When you're done talking, let go to let the other person speak (like a walkie-talkie). The Onyx has actually been around for a couple of years, but will gain Alexa support by the end of this year, according to a representative for the company, which means you'll be able to interact with Amazon's virtual assistant as if you owned an Echo. The Onyx costs $199.99 for a pack of two or $129.99 for a single unit, and you can customize the colors. Jacket and shirt When Google sold Motorola to Lenovo, it kept Motorola's groundbreaking research group, called Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP). One of its signature initiatives is Project Jacquard, which weaves smart sensors directly into fabrics. The first consumer product to come out of this initiative is a Jacquard-enabled jacket, which should go on the market next year. The jacket sleeve functions as a touch controller for your smartphone. A USB-chargeable tag snaps on the jacket and communicates to your phone. That enables sleeve gestures (tapping and swiping) to affect apps on your phone, such as music playback and phone call control. Levi's says the smart jacket will cost the same as dumb jackets, probably under $200. A product called the Fan Jersey from an Australian company called Wearable Experiments is a shirt for football fans (either the international football, a.k.a. soccer, or American football varieties), which delivers real-time haptic feedback while you're watching a game. You can feel the heartbeat of specific players, or feel the impact of a kick or tackle high on your chest along the collarbone. (The shirt connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth.) When your team scores a goal or touchdown, you'll feel the roar of the crowd. These are just a few of the hundreds of wearables that you can buy now or sometime soon. Best of all, they don't involve biometrics, fitness or require you to replace whatever it is you currently have on your wrist, on your face or in your ears.

Courtesy of Lenovo via AP, File Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email NEW YORK -- Can the venerable laptop keyboard get more touchy-feely — and in a good way? We’re about to find out. Higher-end models of Apple’s MacBook Pro now come with a narrow touch screen above the regular keyboard for quick access to common settings and tasks, while Lenovo’s Yoga Book laptop loses the physical keyboard entirely. The traditional keyboard has never struck me as needing much improvement, although people who’ve grown up on touch screens might well feel differently. These touch innovations, in fact, may mostly be aimed at luring such users to laptops. So how do the new touch features improve typing and computing? Touch screens, not keyboards Many Windows laptops and tablets with physical keyboard accessories have long had touch screens. You still type primarily on a traditional keyboard, but you can poke screen icons and menus directly with your finger instead of navigating with a mouse or trackpad. This can be useful for basic tasks such as opening apps, moving the cursor to the search bar and rebooting the machine. But when fixing typos in documents, selecting email to delete and even editing photos, my trackpad is generally more precise than my fat fingers on the screen. A stylus helps, but I’m prone to misplacing it. It’s also generally faster to just keep your fingers on the keys. Touch keys Largely for these reasons, Apple has shunned touch screens on its notebooks. But its high-end MacBooks are getting a separate, narrow strip that replaces the top row of function keys you’ll find on most keyboards. This Touch Bar offers the same functions, but instead of hitting F11 or F12 to change volume, for instance, you tap the speaker icon to bring up a volume slider. Play Video CBSN Apple unveils upgraded MacBook Apple is rolling out an upgraded version of its popular MacBook laptop computer. CBSN's Reena Ninan has more. You can fix up to four icons in place; the initial defaults are brightness, volume, mute and the Siri voice assistant. The rest of the strip changes based on context. When you’re using the Safari browser, for instance, you typically get thumbnails of individual tabs for easy switching between websites. But that changes to play and pause if you’re watching Netflix, while your name and address pop up as choices when filling out online forms. Apple’s Maps app offers one-touch access to nearby businesses or directions. Mail and Messages offer auto-complete suggestions as you type, plus a button for emojis, similar to what you’d find on iPhones and iPads. You get touch access to system controls, such as “cancel” and “save,” so you don’t have to move your cursor. Third-party apps can add their own functionality, too, though the ones I use regularly have yet to do so. Habits and discoveries The new volume and brightness sliders are much easier to use than tapping the appropriate function key multiple times to get the level I want. In Photos, I can scroll through my library more quickly than using arrow keys. And the Touch Bar does make it easy to include emojis in messages. Because I use it frequently, I made the screenshot function a default icon. No more opening Grab, navigating a menu and returning to the window I’m trying to preserve. I’ve also discovered functions I never knew existed, such as the ability to highlight text in Preview with different colors. This may matter less if, like me, you’re a pretty good typist with a command of keyboard shortcuts. The Touch Bar will be more useful for those who look down at the keys when typing. One suggestion: The mute icon stays the same regardless of whether the Mac is already on mute. How about a distinct icon to unmute, now that the options are dynamic? Fingerprints The Mac now turns on automatically when you open the lid. In place of a power button is a fingerprint scanner, similar to what’s found on mobile devices. You still have to type in my password occasionally as a security measure, but you can avoid doing so most of the time when resuming a session or installing new software. People sharing a computer can instantly switch profiles with their own fingerprints. What else The MacBook Pro has a larger trackpad and is lighter and thinner than previous models, thanks in part to shorter keys that don’t feel awkward. You no longer get regular USB ports or an SD memory card slot for photos. That means buying adapters to connect older printers, scanners and your iPhone to the new USB-C ports. On the plus side, you can now connect the power charger on either side, depending on where the outlet is. And the MacBook retains a headphone jack, something the latest iPhones dropped. If you don’t need the Touch Bar or the fingerprint scanner, you can save $300 with an entry-level MacBook Pro, but it is slower and has ports only on one side. The Touch Bar models start at about $1,800 for a 13-inch screen and $2,400 for 15 inches. Disappearing keyboard Meanwhile, the 10-inch Yoga Book (about $500 for Android, $600 for Windows) retains the clamshell design of a laptop but has a second touch screen where the keyboard normally goes. Unlike pop-up touch keyboard in tablets, this one doesn’t block the main display as you type. Without physical keys, the device is just 0.38 inch thick, or about two-thirds the thickness of the new MacBooks. The touch keyboard also doubles as a handwriting pad for notes and doodling with the included stylus. The Yoga provides both tactile and audio feedback when you hit the keys, although it’s still easy to miss the ones you’re aiming for. It takes longer to type because of all the typos, which gets annoying very quickly. You would think that with a touch keyboard, the Yoga could reconfigure the keys to toggle between upper and lower cases and switch languages, much the way a touch keyboard on a phone or tablet does on the screen. But the keys themselves always appear in standard English and in upper case, even when you’re typing in Thai. Call it a missed opportunity. An Australian startup called Sonder is already planning to ship such a keyboard for $199 this year, but who wants to carry around an extra accessory? If it makes it onto a future laptop, it could mark a true revolution that goes well beyond the minor changes the Touch Bar and the second touch screen offer. © 2016 The Associated Press.

The app, which works in conjunction with AppleTV, plays recordings of various classic children's stories and shows images of the pictures from those same books. StoryTime for tvOS uses a new feature on Apple's iBooks called 'Read-Aloud.' While all the books' narrations are read by actual humans (to reduce the uncanny effect of robotic voices,) Read-Aloud couples the books with subtitles running at the bottom of the screen. The hope is that StoryTime will not only provide a soothing way for parents and kids to read their favorite stories, but it will also help kids to learn to read thanks to the clear fonts.

The 15-inch MacBook Pro hooked up to some external 5K displays. Andrew Cunningham The 15-inch Pro and the 13-inch Touch Bar model. Andrew Cunningham The new Pro comes in both space gray and silver. Andrew Cunningham The glowing Apple logo on the back is no more. Andrew Cunningham The new 15-inch model has a big trackpad and big speaker grilles to the left and right of the keyboard.

Other Ars staffers who saw the Touch Bar were impressed that it had the same amount of color and detail as any old Retina display. Andrew Cunningham Buttons have, by and large, been replaced by sliders. Andrew Cunningham Customizing the Touch Bar buttons in software. The new design of the MacBook Pros is nice, and Apple’s decision to put in nothing but Thunderbolt 3 ports has prompted a fresh wave of dongle talk, but the signature feature of the new MacBook Pros was always going to be the Touch Bar. This little touch-enabled strip represents a bunch of things. It’s a melding of Apple’s traditional Intel-driven software platform and the company’s own homegrown chips and its touch-driven iOS platform. It’s Apple’s answer to the touchscreen, a model that Apple steadfastly resists in its computers even as Microsoft and its partners embrace it. And it's the biggest thing about these Macs that’s truly new—Macs in the last half-decade have gotten thinner and lighter and have better battery life than before, but, Touch Bar aside, they all still run basically the same software in basically the same way. So, yes, these new laptops have new CPUs and GPUs, new designs, new ports, and new screens. We’ll spend plenty of time with all of those things. But the biggest question for buyers is whether the Touch Bar is worth it and what it adds to the experience that you can’t already get if you keep the latest version of macOS installed on your laptop. Differences between all three MacBook Pros Specs at a glance: 13-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro (Four Thunderbolt 3 ports) Screen 2560×1600 at 13.3" (227 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.9GHz Intel Core i5-6267U (Turbo up to 3.3GHz) RAM 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered, upgradeable to 16GB at purchase) GPU Intel Iris 550 (integrated, 64MB eDRAM) HDD 256GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 2x Thunderbolt 3, 2x Thunderbolt 3 with reduced bandwidth, headphones Size 11.97" × 8.36" × 0.59" (304.1 mm × 212.4 mm × 14.9 mm) Weight 3.02 lbs (1.37 kg) Battery 49.2Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $1,799.99 Price as reviewed $1,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics We've been over this a few times, but let's list the differences between the $1,499 MacBook Pro and the Touch Bar model. There are a couple of new details I can confirm now that I’ve actually been able to use both models. The low-end Pro uses a 15W Core i5-6360U CPU with an Intel Iris 540 GPU; the high-end model uses a 28W Core i5-6267U CPU with an Intel Iris 550 GPU. The difference, aside from small boosts to CPU and GPU clock speeds, is that the 28W model can run faster for longer and throttle less frequently. The 15W model can also consume less power. The low-end Pro uses a single “Alpine Ridge” Thunderbolt 3 controller from Intel, while the high-end Pro uses two Thunderbolt controllers. The two ports on the right side of the MacBook Pro have "reduced PCI Express bandwidth," which Apple says means they have two PCIe 3.0 lanes’ worth of bandwidth at their disposal instead of the four lanes dedicated to the ports on the left side (Intel’s mobile Skylake chipsets include a total of 10 PCIe lanes, four of which are already being used by the SSD). You can connect all the same things to both ports—displays, storage, power adapters—but especially high-performance storage arrays should be plugged in on the left side to maximize the available bandwidth. The low-end Pro uses 1866MHz LPDDR3 RAM while the high-end Pro uses 2133MHz LPDDR3. Apple has said it’s using LPDDR3 to save power, but it’s also the reason the systems max out at 16GB. The low-end Pro actually has a larger battery than the high-end one: 54.5Whr compared to 49.2Whr. Apple says both laptops have 10 hours of battery life, but the lower-power processor, the larger battery, and the lack of a little second screen above the keyboard all mean that the low-end model actually lasts a bit longer than the Touch Bar model. The low-end model includes two integrated mics, while the high-end model includes three. The low-end Pro’s 802.11ac Wi-Fi tops out at 867Mbps, while both the Touch Bar MacBook Pros can do a maximum of 1.3Gbps just like last year’s models. And here are a few further differences between both 13-inch models and the 15-inch models, all of which include Touch Bars. 15-inch Pros have enough thermal headroom to fit in quad-core Skylake processors. The base model includes a 2.6GHz (3.5GHz Turbo) Core i7-6700HQ, while our review unit uses a 2.7GHz (3.6GHz Turbo) Core i7-6820HQ. Either model can be configured with a 2.9GHz (3.8GHz Turbo) Core i7-6920HQ. All models use their processors’ Intel HD 530 integrated graphics when possible to save power, but they also include dedicated AMD Radeon GPUs. The Radeon Pro 450, 455, and 460 are all based on AMD’s latest Polaris architecture—we’ll go into more detail about each component later in the review. The trackpad in the 15-inch model is larger than in the 13-inch models. All four Thunderbolt 3 ports in the 15-inch Pros offer the same amount of PCIe bandwidth, since Intel’s quad-core CPUs add more PCIe 3.0 lanes to the amount that the chipset includes (in total, Apple is using four lanes for the SSD, eight lanes across all four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and another eight lanes for the dedicated GPUs). Using the 15-inch model Specs at a glance: 15-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro Screen 2880×1800 at 15.4" (220 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-6820HQ (Turbo up to 3.6GHz) RAM 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered) GPU AMD Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB RAM, Intel HD 530 HDD 512GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 4x Thunderbolt 3, headphones Size 13.75" × 9.48" × 0.61" (349.3 mm × 240.7 mm × 15.5 mm) Weight 4.02 lbs (1.83 kg) Battery 76.0Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $2,399.99 Price as reviewed $2,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics The reduced size and weight of the 15-inch Pro are both really nice when you’re carrying the machine around. At just four pounds, it actually weighs less than the 4.5 pound 13-inch MacBook Pros did before the jump to Retina, and it’s a pound-and-a-half lighter than the pre-Retina 15-inch models (there’s a less consequential but still nice half-pound reduction compared to the older Retina models). When you're using it, though, it’s still very much a 15-inch laptop. I use 13-inch laptops almost exclusively these days, and the more cumbersome size and larger palmrest make the 15-inch models just a little unwieldy compared to what I’m used to. In other words, even with the size and weight decreases, the 15-inch model isn't small enough to be a good replacement for a 13-inch notebook. I will say that my minor palm rejection problems with the 13-inch Pro’s larger trackpad aren’t really problems here. It may be because the trackpad is larger, so the corners of my hands are always firmly placed on the trackpad as I type rather than hitting it intermittently. Beyond this, the experience of typing and of using the trackpad is identical. The 2880×1800 screen has the same resolution as the older Retina models, albeit with the added brightness and contrast and the wide color support. But like the MacBook and the 13-inch Pros, the screen’s default resolution is 1680×1050 mode. As with the previous models, you can also select 1024×600, 1280×800, 1440×900, and 1900×1200 modes depending on what’s the most comfortable for you. Finally, the speakers here are much larger than the ones in the 13-inch model, and they sound pretty good for laptop speakers. They have respectable bass and dynamic range. While they aren’t as good as the speakers in a desktop like an iMac or some good dedicated speakers, they’re good enough for movies and TV, and they aren’t bad if you need to fill a room with music for a small party.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Trader Gordon Charlop works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016. Stocks are opening modestly higher on Wall Street, led by gains in banks as interest rates continue to rise. (Richard Drew/Associated Press) By Marley Jay | AP November 14 at 4:46 PM NEW YORK — U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week’s election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump’s policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. “The market is sniffing out the belief that some of these Trump policies may drive some better economic growth but also may in fact be somewhat inflationary,” said PNC Chief Investment Strategist Bill Stone. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump’s spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans’ Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. That’s a huge move for that benchmark rate. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51. Stone said investors are focused on potential corporate and individual tax cuts, a “wave of deregulation” that eliminates some of the rules governing businesses like energy companies and banks, and more protectionism on trade, which could hurt sales for companies that do a lot of business overseas. Investors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. For example, Trump’s election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Stone added that corporate dealmaking could increase if Trump’s administration takes a looser approach to antitrust regulation. Several companies announced deals or deal offers Monday. South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes electronics for cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.07, or 25.2 percent, to $109.72. German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor’s stock rose $5.61, or 18.3 percent, to $36.29. Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.75, or 15 percent, to $13.40 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it’s too low. Belden stock added $1.52, or 2.2 percent, to $71.22. The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.51 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0726 from $1.0845. Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Verizon fell 51 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.18 and American Electric Power lost $1.27, or 2.1 percent, to $58.72. Oil prices bounced back from a big loss early on. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped just 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 13 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $2.60 to $1,221.70 an ounce. Silver lost 49 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $16.89 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.52 a pound. France’s CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent and Germany’s DAX added 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 0.3 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan’s economic growth. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent. ____ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

SUBSCRIBE Microsoft execs share plans for making Bing ‘pervasive,’ say search is about to become very different At an event in Redmond, Microsoft shared its vision of the future in which Bing is at the heart of day-to-day experiences without users even realizing it. Ginny Marvin on November 14, 2016 at 2:03 pm More In a day of high-level presentations that included Microsoft’s global branding initiatives, HoloLens and the future of an algorithm-driven economy, Bing Ads executives conveyed the strengthening embrace of Bing across Microsoft. No longer a sideline money loser, Bing is now a revenue-positive, rich data source for the company. Bing has been bundled into flagship Microsoft products like Office and Xbox and is being positioned at the forefront of the machine learning and artificial intelligence developments Microsoft is betting on. At the fourth annual Bing Ads Next event in Redmond on Thursday, Rik van der Kooi, corporate vice president of the Microsoft Advertising Business Group, built on his declaration last year that Microsoft was “all in on search.” Calling Bing an “intelligence fabric” that is now woven into Windows 10, Xbox, Cortana and other products, van der Kooi said “Bing is going to be pervasive.” Beyond the Microsoft ecosystem, Bing is also the search engine for Apple’s Siri and Amazon assistant devices, and more partnerships are expected to come. There will be integrations with LinkedIn after the acquisition deal by Microsoft closes next year. The future of search “When we think about the future, search is going to change pretty dramatically,” said van der Kooi, adding, “We are going to collectively define with our customers what the new business models are when people talk to their devices and we go beyond 10 blue links on a page.” Gurpeet Singh Pall, partner director of program management for Bing and Cortana, said, “The future of Bing is going beyond the search box to a personal, pervasive and predictive experience in which it might not be obvious users are even interacting with the search engine. Consider product search on the Hololens in which users test couches from a product catalog looks in their living rooms, for example.” Current initiatives While most of the corporate presentations focused on the somewhat-near-future rather than present-day feature development for Bing Ads, the company did touch on a few current initiatives: Dynamic native ads pilot: Bing Ads introduced native ads on MSN.com inventory over a year ago. A pilot for dynamic native ads is now running with a small set of advertisers and publishers. The aim is to build what the company is calling an Intent Network to differentiate it from standard display networks — and more specifically, the expansive Google Display Network. Bing’s focus is on developing a curated network of sites around key commercial verticals such as automotive and financial services. The company is planning to make more announcements about the intent network in the beginning of next year. Ads are matched using a variety of dynamic signals from publishers and advertisers and Microsoft data that users opt in to share.” Growing mobile share: According to comScore data, the Bing Network has grown  to 31.9 percent of US search share on desktop. On mobile, however, Bing’s share is minuscule. Bing Ads executives acknowledge they can’t grow mobile share on the backs of Microsoft’s first-party platforms alone. “We think of it first in terms of partnerships like Apple and think about Bing in those kinds of partnerships for mobile supply opportunities,” said Steve Sirich, general manager, marketing for search advertising. “We will continue to build experiences like the Cortana apps and Bing apps, but the first priority is on building the third-party supply chain and partnerships.” Machine Learning & AI Will Underlie Everything From a vision-of-the-future perspective, Microsoft shared updates on several products that are further away in terms of having direct practical applications for advertisers: Decision Service: Microsoft introduced its testing and optimization product called Decision Service to the audience. Currently, it is only being deployed with a small set of customers in Azure, but Decision Service has use cases for content optimization, ad optimization, product recommendation optimization, pricing optimization and so on. From an ads standpoint, Decision Service could be layered on top of an ad server or eventually integrate directly with Bing Ads. Cortana & Conversation As a Platform (CAP): This is where Microsoft sees the new opportunity for developers, where bots are the monetization drivers for developers, not apps. “You can interact more naturally and search without searching” because bots surface information to you in a predictive manner, said Singh Pall. Cortana, Microsoft’s digital assistant, is on Skype, Office, Outlook and Windows 10 and is powered by Bing. Microsoft says Cortana now has 133 million monthly users. The Cortana SDK is being released soon, and the developer focus will be on improving personal productivity. Singh Pall spoke of Bing and Cortana integrations with third-party APIs, noting 2,000 developers have signed up to use Microsoft’s augmented services. “What we are aiming for with Cortana is native skills that will continue to grow, but the third parties are going to be integrating skills into it,” said Singh Pall. “When it comes to work productivity, Microsoft has the context that a lot of others don’t have. We will bring more into the fold to enhance that and grow the life aspect of it.” HoloLens: Margeau Veenstra, who oversees HoloLens commercial strategy and Windows experiences at Microsoft, said that consumer applications for the augmented reality device are not far off. “It will rapidly become the expected way to engage with content and become part of our everyday device experience,” she expects. For example, Microsoft is working with Houzz to help users see how furniture options can look in their homes. A new vision for digital success In this new framework in which bots replace apps, machine learning powers our engagement with technology (and that includes ad management and optimization) and artificial intelligence fulfills its promise to increase productivity, the days when businesses base their digital presence on a website are numbered. The question now, says Microsoft, is: How do you take what you’ve already invested in — apps, websites — and shift? Businesses need to meet customers anywhere and cannot expect users to leave wherever they are to go to your website “Going forward, it is going to be about whether you are helping me be more productive. Consumers don’t mind paying when there is convenience included in the process,” said Singh Pall in discussing the new paradigm of customer engagement. Gurpreet Singh Pall discusses changing methods of customer engagement. This vision is reflected in Bing’s own plans. When asked about  driving mobile share and engagement, David Pann, general manager for search advertising, explained in an interview on Thursday, “Our strategy is we have to be everywhere and have a multi-pronged approach instead of just a singular focus of getting the default on devices. We also realize mobile experiences are going to dramatically evolve over the next three to five years to the extent that consumer intent won’t be typed in — it may be location-based, it may be understanding what’s on your schedule. The notion of search could move to a more passive approach. We don’t know, so our strategy is we have to try it all … We believe that this multi-pronged approach will be a way to aggregate sufficient mobile supply that is interesting and will provide great sticky experiences for consumers and great experiences for advertisers.” Given Microsoft’s “be everywhere and reward productivity first” viewpoint and the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, one can begin to envision a significantly more complex ad auction that can ingest and react to a wide ranging and ever-changing set of signals. This is the future in which humans efforts at optimization can’t possibly keep up. Microsoft wants to make sure we don’t have to. Bing Ads itself was conspicuously missing from most of these discussions, however. The platform has come a long way, but it still has challenges that keep more advertisers from adopting it and current advertisers from spending more with it. This vision seems to demand more than block-and-tackle improvements — instead, a wholesale rebuilding of the Bing Ads platform that puts it on the leading edge of this new near-future.

Opinion | 14 Nov 2016 | Print  | Comment (0) Four Reasons Why Apple Should Bid on Time Warner by Josh Centers Telecom giant AT&T is seeking to purchase content giant Time Warner (which is no longer affiliated with Time Warner Cable, see “AT&T Aims to Buy Time Warner for $84.5 Billion,” 24 October 2016). However, the deal could run into regulatory obstacles, with politicians on both sides of the aisle questioning the merger. It also doesn’t help that the Department of Justice is suing AT&T subsidiary DirecTV. There might be an opportunity for Apple to swoop in and outbid AT&T, which is something I’ve been shouting from the social media rooftops since it became clear that Apple’s new TV app wouldn’t support Netflix or Amazon Prime Video (see “Apple’s TV App Seeks to Unify the Apple TV Experience,” 27 October 2016). I’m not alone: Goldman Sachs is reportedly pushing Apple to make a competing bid for Time Warner, but Apple is resisting. However, I think Apple should consider the possibility. Here are four reasons why: Content Is a Unique Form of Currency -- If Apple wants to play in the content arena, and it does, the company has to own content that it can use as a negotiating chip with other content providers to expand its library. You’d be right to ask: “Apple has nearly $238 billion in cash. Can’t it afford to license or create any content it wants?” Yes… in theory, but it’s not that simple. Let’s say Apple wants to sell new episodes of Amazon’s award-winning show “Transparent” in iTunes. You can buy the first season there, but the second season is still exclusive to Amazon Prime Video. If Apple really wanted to get access to those new episodes as they drop, it might be able to pay Amazon for that privilege, but not necessarily, because “Transparent” is more to Amazon than merely a popular, award-winning TV show. “Transparent” sells Amazon Prime memberships, Fire TV boxes, and helps reward partners who fit into Amazon’s overall strategy, like Sony, whose video players usually offer an Amazon Prime Video app. It doesn’t matter how much money you have if the other party doesn’t want to sell. With most goods, negotiations come down to money, but content is special, because it’s impossible to predict. For instance, the recent movie “Inferno” was a flop, despite being directed by Ron Howard, starring Tom Hanks, and being based on a Dan Brown story — on paper, “Inferno” should have been a huge hit. Meanwhile, one of the biggest hits of the year has been “Deadpool,” a low-budget superhero movie helmed by an inexperienced director and starring Ryan Reynolds, who, despite good looks, charisma, and talent, spent years starring in flops. Content is unique. Because you can’t just buy good content, content has become a form of currency. Since no company can make all the content it wants to provide to customers, the best way to get content can be to trade. An example: Right now, one of Amazon Prime Video’s biggest selling points is that it streams HBO shows for free. Time Warner owns HBO, and if Apple bought Time Warner, Apple would own HBO, which might encourage Amazon to create an Amazon Prime Video app for the Apple TV. Likewise, Time Warner owns “Arrow” and “The Flash,” which are popular Netflix exclusives (Time Warner owns DC Comics, which originated the characters and Time Warner owns half of the CW network that airs those shows). If Netflix wanted to keep those exclusives, it might be more inclined to support Apple’s new TV app. So why shouldn’t Apple buy Netflix, as analyst Ben Thompson recommends? Buying Netflix Would Be Dangerous -- Thompson correctly points out that owning content would give Apple a seat at the table it wouldn’t otherwise have, but I fear that owning Netflix would only make the problem worse. Netflix’s catalog has shrunk by half in the past four years, for the simple reason that Netflix scares the hell out of Hollywood. The studios don’t want to be beholden to Netflix, so they’re seeking deals with Netflix competitors like Hulu to make their content available to streamers, which limits piracy while reducing Netflix’s power. Apple engenders the same sort of fear in Hollywood, which still holds Apple responsible for ruining the music business. That’s nonsense — if anything, Apple saved the music industry — but TV and movie studios are desperate to avoid becoming dependent on Apple. Companies like Amazon and Sony can cut deals that Apple can’t because Apple frightens content owners. Apple disrupts existing business models, and the last thing these companies want is disruption. Hollywood’s nightmare is that Netflix becomes the next Apple, and if Apple buys Netflix, that fear comes true in spades. “But Netflix makes its own content,” you might counter, and that’s true. Netflix makes a lot of great content, but you only ever see it on Netflix. Netflix hasn’t been willing or able to share its content as a negotiating chip. Instead, it’s a way to make sure Netflix is relevant even if some content owners abandon it entirely. Apple could potentially turn Netflix’s content into bargaining chips, but there hasn’t been much precedence for that, and Time Warner offers better chips anyway. Despite owning some tasty Marvel franchises like “Daredevil” and “Jessica Jones,” Netflix has nothing to compare with Time Warner’s catalog, which includes the likes of Batman, Superman, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones. Time Warner is a much, much bigger player than Netflix, owning Adult Swim, CNN, Cartoon Network, DC Comics, HBO, 10 percent of Hulu (more leverage), Looney Tunes, NBA TV, TBS, the CW, and TNT. Again, I’m just scratching the surface. The full list of stuff owned by Time Warner is staggering. Time Warner has a lot to offer, and Apple is in a position where it can afford it. It’s Time to Spend that Money, Apple -- AT&T is offering $84.5 billion in cash and stock for Time Warner. Apple has $238 billion in cash. Apple could easily outbid AT&T with plenty of money to spare. But is that a good deal? On paper, maybe not. Time Warner’s market cap is only about $68 billion, less than even AT&T’s bid. But, since content is a form of currency, measuring in terms of cash value is tricky. Besides, Time Warner is a healthy business. It saw a profit of $1.5 billion in its most recent quarter, which, while dwarfed by Apple’s Q4 $9 billion in profits, isn’t chump change. However, Apple may not be able to spend its money freely, given that much of it is held offshore. But even those opposed to the deal, such as Mashable’s Kerry Flynn, agree that money isn’t the problem. Many have speculated over the years that Apple clings to its cash out of a sort of survivor’s trauma after it nearly closed its doors in the 1990s. But content is going to be key to Apple’s long-term prospects. Time Warner is a profitable business with a wealth of content to offer Apple, but most importantly… Time Warner Can Take Care of Itself -- One of the more compelling arguments against Apple acquiring Time Warner is that there would be a culture clash between the companies. But here’s the thing: Time Warner can take care of itself. It’s a profitable, growing business that doesn’t need a babysitter. Tim Cook wouldn’t have to run that show — Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes seems to be doing a fine job — nor would he have to be on the set of “Game of Thrones” every day (though that might be tempting for other Apple executives, who shall remain nameless). Another counter argument is that owning a movie studio and a record label doesn’t seem to be doing Sony any favors. It’s true: the hardware and content divisions of Sony are notoriously hostile. One of the reasons Sony lost the music player market is because Sony Music objected to the adoption of MP3 for Sony’s music players. However, Apple isn’t Sony, and more importantly, Apple and Sony are from countries with very different corporate cultures. Japan’s business culture places a heavy emphasis on consensus — that is, not making a decision until all parties are in agreement. This is often smart, but it backfired in Sony’s case because some of Sony’s units had conflicting goals. When Sony got into the music and movie businesses in the late 1980s, it did so to feed its core hardware business. But at some point, the company lost sight of that goal, so content became the tail wagging the dog. I can’t see Apple suffering a similar fate. Apple has never been a consensus-based company, but rather a benevolent dictatorship. Cook might rely more on his lieutenants than Jobs did, but there’s no question about who’s in charge. The key to success in an Apple/Time Warner merger would be maintaining a firewall between the two businesses, with Apple leaving Time Warner alone unless it needed a content deal. However, that’s not to say there wouldn’t be risks involved with Apple purchasing Time Warner… Potential Dangers -- The biggest risk for Apple would be competing with and thus alienating long-time ally Disney. That would be a tricky relationship to maintain. Some have asked why Apple just doesn’t buy Disney. I think that would be an ideal scenario, but who’s to say that Disney is even for sale? Bidding on Time Warner might also tick off AT&T, which hopes to have Time Warner for itself. AT&T might respond by trying to find ways to undercut the iPhone. But AT&T isn’t the only cellular carrier, and Apple now offers its own iPhone installment program, so it’s unclear how much leverage AT&T would have. But here’s the bottom line: Apple wants to be in the content business. Apple needs to be in the content business if it hopes to grow its increasingly important Services category. And there are only two ways to achieve that goal: Create content, such as Apple is doing with its upcoming “Planet of the Apps” and “Carpool Karaoke” shows. But this is a difficult, risky business with no guarantee of success, and it won’t make Apple any friends either. Buy existing content that is known to have an audience. Apple is currently just dabbling in the content-creation business, but the major content companies are watching it with an eagle eye. If Apple appears to be encroaching on their turf, they’ll be quick to put pressure on Apple to back off. Apple’s best hope for content is a quick move that would make it a major player overnight, and buying Time Warner is currently the best path toward that. Or at least the most dramatic.   READERS LIKE YOU! Support TidBITS by becoming a member today!

Macs & Mac OS X | 14 Nov 2016 | Print  | Comment (3) iMac Gets Competition from Microsoft’s New Surface Studio by Julio Ojeda-Zapata Apple has recently been taking heat for its Mac line, which is seen by some as moribund over the past few years. The Touch Bar built into the new MacBook Pro notebooks is a bright spot, but the machines otherwise struck many as lackluster (see “New MacBook Pros Add Context-sensitive Touch Bar,” 27 October 2016). Then there are the Mac Pro and Mac mini, which haven’t seen significant upgrades in years. What about the iMac? That desktop machine has seen a consistent stream of upgrades over the years — including improvements in screen resolution and under-the-hood revisions. But its basic design — a tiltable display on a metallic base — has remained essentially unchanged since the iMac G5 in 2004. The iMac would appear to be the target of Microsoft’s latest product reveal: a new desktop PC with a 28-inch touchscreen that can be lowered to a 20-degree angle for use as a “drafting table” of sorts for stylus-driven creative projects. This computer, called Surface Studio, was unveiled the day before Apple showed its laptops, causing a flood of commentary about how Microsoft is supposedly out-innovating Apple. That’s open to debate. Tiltable touchscreens on Windows desktop machines aren’t new, though the PC world has never seen anything quite like the Surface Studio. Microsoft’s first-ever desktop machine raises questions. Why has the iMac’s design evolved so little over more than a decade? Can a case be made for Macs with touchscreens, regardless of the existence of the iPad? Has Microsoft conjured up a fresh approach to desktop computing that will lure creative professionals from Apple… or is the Surface Studio an overpriced dud? New Surface Surfaces — The Surface Studio is a departure for Microsoft’s hardware division, which until now has focused on mobile computers. These include four generations of the Surface Pro, a laptop/tablet hybrid with a flip-out stand and a keyboard cover, and two generations of the Surface Book, a laptop with a touchscreen that can be removed for tablet-style manipulation (see “Microsoft Surface: A Tale of Two Computers,” 11 March 2014). Microsoft has enjoyed some success with its Surface computers — enough, it would seem, to keep expanding into form factors that increasingly resemble and compete with Apple’s Macs. The Surface machines are a shift for the once software-focused Microsoft, as it aspires to become a dominant hardware purveyor. The Surface Studio is unquestionably an iMac competitor, though a pricey one, starting at $2999. In comparison, Apple’s top-of-the-line 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display is seemingly a steal at its base price of $2299. Microsoft, which will sell its new machine this year in only limited quantities, is positioning the Surface Studio as a tool for creative professionals with deep pockets. It’s not a product for the frugal masses. For creatives, the Surface Studio has a host of enticing features. It includes a 28-inch display that shifts effortlessly on two metallic arms and what Microsoft calls a Zero Gravity Hinge from an upright position to its drafting-table mode. It sports a low-profile base unit that users can drag across a desktop nearly effortlessly when repositioning is required, which is often. Microsoft also offers a cylindrical accessory called the Surface Dial that adheres magnetically to the display and operates as a controller for certain apps. Artists can employ a stylus in conjunction with the Surface Dial for sketching, drawing, and photo-editing projects. The keyboard features a numeric keypad and is a dead ringer for the classic Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, though with grayish keys. Finally, the Surface Studio’s mouse is far more comfortable than Apple’s Magic Mouse 2. All but the $99.99 Surface Dial are bundled with the Surface Studio — but those who buy before 1 December 2016 will get the Surface Dial for free. Speeds and Feeds — In terms of specs, the iMac and Surface Studio aren’t far apart. Both machines offer sixth-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 chips, between 8 and 32 GB of RAM, 1 or 2 TB “Rapid Hybrid Drives” — Microsoft’s answer to Apple’s Fusion Drive — a quartet of USB 3.0 ports, and an SD-card reader. The iMac boasts two Thunderbolt 2 ports while the Surface offers a single DisplayPort without added Thunderbolt capabilities. Both have stereo speakers, dual microphones, a headphone jack, and support for Bluetooth 4.0 and the latest Wi-Fi. Both weigh 21 pounds (9.5 kg). The Surface Studio’s 28-inch PixelSense display has 4500 by 3000 pixels (13.5 million pixels at 192 dots per inch), but the 27-inch iMac retains the edge here with a Retina display that has 5120 by 2880 pixels (14.7 million pixels at 218 dots per inch). Despite the nominal sizes, the screens have different proportions. The Surface Studio’s screen measures 25.09 by 17.27 inches (63.73 cm by 43.87 cm), whereas the iMac’s screen is 20.3 by 25.6 inches (51.56 cm by 65.02 cm). Apple’s unholy fascination with thickness has apparently infected Microsoft as well, since the company says the Surface Studio display is the thinnest ever at this size. Whatever. Touch or No Touch? — In terms of hardware, the Surface Studio’s major difference from the iMac is touch. Microsoft has it; Apple does not. It’s unclear if that gives the Surface Studio an edge over the iMac and positions Microsoft to take a bite out of Apple’s iMac revenue. The Mac’s lack of touchscreen technology has been long-running discussion fodder, with some believing it makes zero sense, and others lamenting how it puts Apple at a disadvantage. Mac users having to diagram, draw, paint, or sketch need to seek workarounds — such as graphics tablets — to compensate for their machines’ lack of touchscreens. Even the iPad has been retrofitted into a graphics tablet courtesy of apps such as Astropad that permit Macs and iPads to work in unison for visual, stylus-driven projects. But while Apple has kept its non-touch Macs and its touch-focused iPads separate, PC screens have increasingly incorporated touch. This is most common on mobile machines, but it’s also true of many desktop PCs. In some cases, those screens are even designed to flatten on a desk or table. The Surface Studio is therefore not breaking new ground, but it offers the most advanced such implementation yet. With the screen at its 20-degree angle, users can lean over the computer with their arms on the display while working with the stylus, and the Surface Studio is smart enough to ignore pressure from elbows and wrists. The Surface Dial — when used with apps that support it — is a useful sidekick. In the app Sketchable, for instance, spins and presses of the dial provide instant access to color palettes and more. Alas, in my brief tests, the Surface Dial tended to slide down the tilted display, instead of sticking in place as intended. My Surface Studio tests revealed another shortcoming that could be a deal-breaker for many potential buyers. That glossy display, when lowered to drafting-table mode, shows a reflection of the ceiling — which invariably incorporates lighting fixtures. What office does not have ceiling lights? How usable will a Surface Studio be under such conditions? The Surface Studio does have a major supporter in Mike Krahulik, co-creator of the famed Penny Arcade Web comic, and a longtime Surface devotee. Writing as usual as his Jonathan “Gabe” Gabriel cartoon alter ego, Krahulik gave the Surface Studio a big thumbs-up after being allowed to use the PC for a week. The iMac’s Future? — The release of the Surface Studio raises important questions: Could Apple radically improve the iMac design, much as Microsoft is trying to do with the Surface Studio? If so, does (or should) the Surface Studio offer inspiration for Apple? I’m a journalist, not a product designer, so I can’t answer those questions. But I can’t deny that I felt a shiver of excitement when I used the Surface Studio for the first time. It was marvelous to use a computer that takes risks and pushes boundaries — though at an exorbitant price and with an, um, glaring shortcoming. The 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display is gorgeous, and a wonderful Mac, but it’s also a little boring. Apart from adding the Retina display and keeping up with CPU and connectivity specs, the iMac hasn’t really changed in years. If the Surface Studio is a hit with creative professional, perhaps Apple will feel some pressure to think different again.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Microsoft is trying to one-up Apple’s iMac with its first-ever desktop computer, called the Surface Studio. This Windows-based PC boasts a touchscreen that drops to a 20-degree angle for use as a drafting table of sorts… along with a stratospheric price tag. Could Apple draw inspiration from the Surface Studio for future iMacs? Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Grant  2016-11-14 17:09 My comments represent only that of a simple Mac desktop user since 1984. I think the touch screen is cool, but in my dream iMac desktop I really have simple requests: a keyboard with a 10-key numeric key pad; as much RAM as I can self-install, and the fastest processor available. Sure, a nice clear, high resolution screen is nice as is an internal SuperDrive. A "nice to have" is more external ports on the back of the iMac. I do not keep up with technology like most folks do, but recently I spent two days with an Apple Engineer from Cupertino. One comment that really struck me was that "innovation is hard when you're already 5-7 years ahead of much of the competition." The other statement (true/false -- I do not know) is that the "fundamental underpinnings of technology, networks, security, wifi, BlueTooth...has not changed a heck of a lot in the last 5 years." Please do not misinterpret the preceding quotes as my position. I just think we're going to hit a few plateaus between great surges in technological advancement. The iPod, iPhone, and iPad weren't even sold 11-12 years ago. Give me a top of the line iMac with memory, speed, and longevity for the same price point we are used to seeing (or lower). My iMac of the future doesn't have to be the coolest desktop sold, just the best in terms of performance and integration with my other products. Apple strives for seamless integration in its product lines. Perhaps that is its appeal and advantage. Just my thoughts. Reply Michel Angelo  2016-11-15 06:16 Putting your fingers on the screen is a magnificent ways of acquiring a gorilla arm, a sickness derived from the effort in your shoulder, which is not easy to cure. Poorly used, the mouse itself, or a keyboard located too high, is already a cause for gorilla arm. I am retired, have witnessed numerous instances of that gorilla arm sickness, simply with mouse heavy usage by secretaries. A sensitive screen is a "no thanks" for me. For sensitive screens, I use my ipad, on a couch, for short periods and with nearly no inputs. Reply Rene Albert  2016-11-15 07:40 Microsoft has no innovation skills, and must now resort to being an iMac wannabe... Plus, only Bill Gates can afford to buy the new Surface Studio. It should focus instead on fixing their Windows 10 software which has been a disaster according to user reviews online! Reply  Search   Cached.

"When you focus in on Apple in particular, the concern is that if we have a trade war with China, that Apple is going to suffer — and it will suffer more so than the other multinational tech companies," Colin Gillis, senior technology analyst and director of research at BGC Financial, told CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Monday. Shares of Apple have fallen more than 4 percent over the past week, as technology companies like Amazon and Alphabet have also tumbled. After the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency, Chinese media warned that any tariffs on Chinese goods would be met with higher prices, especially for iPhone, which is made with parts that are Chinese-made and assembled. Trump has vowed to drive a hard bargain with the Asian superpower. There could be positives in a Trump presidency for Apple, Gillis said. But one factor — a tax holiday for repatriation of Apple's overseas cash — has already been "factored in" to the share price by investors, he said. Gillis said that unlike rival Google, Apple has fewer products, and thus fewer opportunities to monetize their users. Plus, Gillis said, Apple faces growing competition from local Chinese smartphone makers. "It's a one-product company," Gillis said. "So does it deserve to trade at a premium? No, it doesn't." To be sure, Gillis is in the minority among analysts. At $85 a share, his target price for Apple's stock is by far the lowest of any analyst listed in FactSet. Gillis dropped his price target in July, maintaining a "sell" rating despite a 16 percent rise in Apple's shares in the past six months, according to FactSet data. Apple saw revenue fall 30 percent from a year ago in the fourth quarter in Greater China, its third-largest market based on its financial reporting. In the second calendar quarter, Chinese companies Oppo and Vivo saw year-over-year worldwide smartphone shipments increase 136.6 percent and 80.2 percent, respectively, according to IDC. Apple CEOTim Cook has said he's still very bullish on China's long-term prospects. CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. But Gillis said that unless Apple can grow beyond its main source of revenue, the iPhone, it's simply "GoPro on steroids." "There are risks embedded in China, both for consumer tastes and government regulation," Gillis said.

You can also create your own Memories, turning any Memory into a slideshow, which you can share with friends and family. RELATED ARTICLES How to Create Quick Slideshows and Projects with Photos How to Make Sure Your Mac and iPhone’s Photos Sync to iCloud Memories are different from albums. Albums are just folders you put photos into. But you can create Memories from any album or group of photos in your collection. Photos will also create Memories automatically from photos you take, based on a time period or location, turning them into “best of” collections. You might think of Memories as a sort of day-by-day scrapbook collection. For example, if you go to a party and take a bunch of snaps of you and your friends, they’ll appear the next day as a Memory. It’s then up to you what you want to do with it, by saving it, creating a slideshow, sharing it, or just letting it fade away. To use Memories on your Mac, you must first at least be running macOS Sierra. In order to make sure Memories works across all your Apple devices, you will need to set up iCloud, sign in with the same Apple ID, and turn on iCloud Photo LIbrary for each device on which you want to view your Memories. If you want to see your memories on a 4th generation Apple TV, then you need to make sure it is updated to tvOS 10 or later. Viewing Memories in the Photos App You can view Memories on your Mac by opening the Photos app and then clicking Memories in the sidebar and double-clicking on any Memory. When you view a Memory in Photos, it will slowly cycle through the contents, allowing you to preview it before you save it, convert it to a slideshow, or share it. In the example below, we how Memories created a “Best of Last Month” collection. Creating Your Own Memories The Photos app will automatically create Memories based on photos you’ve recently taken. You can create your own Memories, however, from any album. Simply open the album and click “Show as Memory” in the top-right corner. Alternatively, if you’re browsing from the All Photos tab, you can click the group title and it will automatically be converted to a Memory. Save Memories for Access Later The Photos application is always creating new Memories based on new photos you add. In order to preserve Memories so that they’re not overwritten by new ones, scroll all the way to the bottom and click “Add to Memories”. When you want to look at your Memories more closely, simply double-click to open one and then scroll down to check out a summary of photos contained within a particular Memory. Clicking “Show All” will display all the photos in a Memory. Scroll all the way to the bottom of a Memory and you can select a person or group to see more photos like it, click on a place to view more photos taken nearby, or discover other related Memories, which are sorted by events, scenes, places, and people. Turning Any Memory into a Slideshow for Sharing As we mentioned at the beginning, you can turn your Memories into slideshows, which you can share with your friends and family. Once you’re happy with the photos you’ve gathered into your Memory, click the slideshow arrow in the Photos’ toolbar. From there you can choose a theme and accompanying music (the iOS version has a few more options and calls them Movies).   If you want to share a Memory you or the app has created, click the Share button in the top toolbar. As you can see, you can share your Memories through iCloud Photo Sharing, Facebook, Messages, and more. The Memories feature is a great way to distill your photos into something accessible and meaningful. Whether it’s a day at the beach, a vacation to Europe, or just a barbeque with friends, it lets you rediscover photos that might have otherwise gotten lost in the crush of new photos.

Home Industry Companies Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay offer rewards Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay offer rewards Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. By: Associated Press | New York | Published: November 15, 2016 1:44 AM The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. (Reuters) Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services – until now. The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. Apple Pay can speed up transactions because people don’t have to re-enter card and contact information. Separately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, redeemable for gift cards and products.

Apple announced today that Apply Pay now supports donations to non-profit charities, removing some barriers to contributing money. There’s no waiting between the announcement and roll out, as Apple Pay’s donation functionality is live from today. Obviously, not all charities will support Apple Pay from launch, but there are around two dozen that do. Those include Doctors Without Borders, charity: water, the American Red Cross, Children’s Miracle Network, and the Make-a-Wish Foundation. Apple lists a few that will be coming online shortly, such as the American Cancer Society and PBS. Apple and the charities involved hope that this will encourage more people to give. Since those who are giving can now use Apple Pay, it means that they no longer need to create accounts or fill out forms with contact information. By removing those steps and making the transaction a little more seamless, more people may be encouraged to donate. At this early stage, there seems to be a good range of charities that now support Apple Pay. Whether you’re looking for charities that are centered around conservation or getting help to sick children, this starting roster has those bases covered. Have a look at the full list below: Nonprofits bringing Apple Pay to supporters today include: – American Red Cross – American Heart Association – charity: water – Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals – COPD Foundation – Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) – Doctors without Borders – Feeding America – GlobalGiving – International Rescue Committee – (RED) – St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital – Save the Children – The Nature Conservancy – The Water Project – UNICEF – WNET – World Vision – WWF (World Wildlife Fund) Nonprofits soon to offer Apple Pay include: – American Cancer Society – CARE – DonorsChoose.org – PBS and its local stations – United Way Apple hasn’t said when those last five on the list will launch integration for Apple Pay. It did say, however, than a number of others will be going online in the coming months, so it sounds like we have some additions to look forward to as we transition into 2017.

KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent to 3,204.31 points and Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 was flat at 17,670.77. Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 tumbled 0.5 percent to 5,320.60 and Seoul’s Kospi was almost unchanged at 1,974.27. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.4 percent to 22,314.62. Benchmarks in Southeast Asia and New Zealand were mixed. WALL STREET: Tech companies including Apple and Microsoft took big losses on concern Trump’s policies might hurt their sales in China and other global markets. Bank stocks surged as bond yields rose, which allows them to make more money from lending. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. RISING DOLLAR: The dollar climbed as high as 108.30 yen from Monday’s 107.87 yen as expectations of a U.S. rate hike rose. Trump’s surprise election initially raised expectations the Federal Reserve might put off a rate hike until his plans were clear. But analysts say the latest comments from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan indicate the Fed is sticking to plans to act in December. “There appears no stopping the U.S. dollar’s recent ascent based on the current interest rate trajectory,” Stephen Innes of OANDA said in a report. TRUMP WATCH: Investors were watching for signs of what Trump, who gave few details of his plans on the campaign trail, might do in office. Analysts say his promises of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending could boost economic growth but also spur inflation. His threats of sanctions against China and other trading partners that he accuses of acting unfairly have rattled trade-dependent Asian economies. ANALYST’S TAKE: “Moving forward, the spotlight could shine on the contentious trade policy proposals that the president-elect had raised during his campaign,” said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. “The latest soundbite from outgoing President Barack Obama seems to suggest that the incoming president is ‘ultimately pragmatic’,” said Pan. “It is without a doubt that emerging Asian markets would be negatively impacted should a trade war break out between US and China, although the delayed address could mean that the President-elect may indeed be more pragmatic than we have known.” CURRENCY: The euro was little-changed at $1.0752. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 89 cents to $44.21 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract shed 9 cents on Monday to close at $43.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 75 cents to $45.19 in London. It lost 32 cents on Monday to $44.43.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Nov 14, 2016 at 1:21PM What if you could simultaneously tap into a meaningful dividend yield, dividend growth, and an undervalued stock all in a single investment? With Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, this is what you get. Image source: Apple. Here's why Apple is one of my favorite dividend investments, especially after the stock's recent pullback. Solid dividend payments For any investor looking to give his portfolio a boost from a dividend stock, a decent dividend yield is likely a requirement. Fortunately, Apple's stock's dividend yield, or annual dividend payments as a percentage of the stock price, has moved higher in the past 30 days thanks to the stock's 10% pullback during this time. AAPL data by YCharts. Today, Apple's dividend yield is about 2.1%, a meaningful jump from a 1.9% dividend yield just one month ago. Dividend growth potential While some investors may gloss over Apple's 2.1% dividend yield, which is about in line with the average dividend yield of stocks in the S&P 500, it starts to get interesting when investors look at the dividend's growth potential. The prospects for Apple's dividend growth are evident both by the dividend's recent growth history and a look at the cash flow supporting the tech giant's dividend payments. Apple's recent annual dividend increases, along with management's admission that it plans to continue to increase the dividend every year, highlight a rapid growth trajectory for dividend payouts. Since 2012, for instance, Apple's quarterly dividend payments have increased by about 51%, or a compound annual growth rate of 10.8%. Further, Apple's most recent dividend increases remain robust, with 10.6% and 9.6% hikes in 2015 and 2016, respectively. AAPL Dividend data by YCharts. And perhaps making an even stronger case for Apple dividend's growth potential is the company's strong free cash flow. In the trailing 12 months, Apple generated an incredible $52.3 billion in free cash flow, yet paid out only $12.2 billion in dividends. Clearly, the company has plenty of room to maintain its annual dividend hikes. Another way to look at Apple's room for further dividend increases is with the payout ratio, or dividend payments as a percentage of earnings. Apple's payout ratio is just 24.8%. For comparison, dividend stocks McDonald's, IBM, and Microsoft have payout ratios of about 67%, 44%, and 69%, respectively. An undervalued stock Finally, one of the best reasons to buy this dividend investment is that the stock is arguably undervalued. Trading at about 13 times earnings, Apple stock looks considerably cheaper than the average P/E ratio of companies in the S&P 500 of approximately 24.  Sure, Apple's earnings per share is down 10% in the trailing 12 months, suggesting there may be some merit to a conservative valuation. But with the tech giant's pricing power intact and customers as loyal as ever, Apple is likely to return to EPS growth over the long haul, making today's low P/E multiple irrational. Investors who buy Apple stock today get a meaningful dividend, dividend growth, and a low-risk stock. Opportunities like this don't surface every day. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

Here's how to get your perfect choice Shares Update: The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have just landed in our best iPhone round up, but where does each place? You've woken up, looked out the window and then looked down at the crumbling smartphone that you've been using for what feels like ever. Some part of your mind decides that it's time for an upgrade, and if you're set on owning an iPhone, then you've got some big choices to make. You can spend a fortune on the powerful iPhone 7 Plus that's a part of our best phones list, or spend some time in the secondhand market looking for a cheap iPhone - but will get you just what you need? With a bewildering selection of different specs, screen sizes and price points each of these handsets has something to offer every type of Apple fan - so we've boiled down the choices for you in a simple-to-read format. From the superpowered iPhone 7 to the affordable 4-inch iPhone 5S, these are the best iPhones for a variety of budgets and requirements. 1. iPhone 7 Plus The best iPhone money can buy Weight: 188g | Dimensions: 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm | OS: iOS 10 | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels | CPU: Apple A10 Fusion | RAM: 3GB | Storage: 32/128/256GB | Battery: 2900mAh | Rear camera: 12MP+12MP | Front camera: 7MP Heaps of power for slick performance Excellent camera Very expensive No headphone jack The iPhone 7 Plus is the best iPhone Apple has ever made. It's large though, so if you're after a smaller phone this won't be the best choice for you with its 5.5-inch 1080p display. The big upgrades are the waterproof design and a phenomenal new dual-lens camera that allows you to snap with two 12MP lens at the same time. It allows for better optical zoom as well as a Bokeh mode to blur the background of your photos and put the main focus on the foreground. Battery life on the iPhone 7 Plus is much improved upon the iPhone 6S Plus too, plus it comes stocked with iOS 10 software right out of the box. You probably already know there's no 3.5mm headphone jack. It means you'll have to use Bluetooth headphones or the Lightning cable converter, which comes in the box with the iPhone 7 Plus. The biggest problem you'll likely have will be the price. It's a costly option, but the upgrades are worth the extra money and this is the phone to go for if you're looking for the best iPhone in 2016. Read the full review: iPhone 7 Plus 2. iPhone 7 Your first waterproof iPhone? Weight: 138g | Dimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm | OS: iOS 10 | Screen size: 4.7-inch | Resolution: 750 x 1334 | CPU: Apple A10 Fusion | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 32/128/256GB | Battery: 1960mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 7MP Good low light camera Water resistant Lacks clear upgrades Same design for last three years Don't fancy the large iPhone 7 Plus above? Why not opt for the iPhone 7, which comes in at position number 2 on our best iPhone round-up. Again there's no headphone jack on the iPhone 7, but it does come with a waterproof design that means your phone is likely to survive the odd dip in the sink rather than just being frazzled right away. There's no dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7, but you can still take some absolutely incredible photography with the 12MP sensor. If you own an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6S, you may not see much difference with the new phone but the new processor and camera tech may be enough to entice you to buy the latest iPhone from Apple. Read the full review: iPhone 7 3. iPhone SE Compact, relatively affordable and very powerful Weight: 113g | Dimensions: 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6mm | OS: iOS 9.3 | Screen size: 4.0-inch | Resolution: 1136 x 640 pixels | CPU: Apple A9 | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16GB/64GB | Battery: 1624mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 1.2MP Great power Lower price Tired design Old screen technology As the first 4-inch iPhone since 2013's iPhone 5S the iPhone SE has been a long time coming, but although it's slotting in at the bottom of Apple's range, it's in many ways more a successor to that phone than to the cut-price iPhone 5C. Because, despite the iPhone SE's small size and relatively modest price tag, it's very close to being a flagship. It has the same boxy, yet premium design as the metal-clad iPhone 5S and the same powerful Apple A9 processor and rear camera as the iPhone 6S. It lacks the 3D Touch features and higher-resolution front-facing camera of the iPhone 6S. The screen is also less impressive all round, thanks in large part to a lower contrast ratio. But it compares well to many mid-range handsets. It's the most powerful 4-inch iPhone you can get, so for fans of compact form factors this is an obvious choice. But while it's not as cheap as the discontinued iPhone 5S, it's also still something of a bargain by Apple standards, so it's worth considering if you're on a budget too. Read the full review: iPhone SE 4. iPhone 6S The best iPhone of 2015 Weight: 143g | Dimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm | OS: iOS 9.3 | Screen size: 4.7-inch | Resolution: 1334 x 750 pixels | CPU: Apple A9 | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16GB/64GB/128GB | Battery: 1715mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP Great design 3D Touch impresses Battery life low Price high for a low-res screen The iPhone 6S, as you probably know, is Apple's flagship from 2015. The Apple A9 processor and a chunky 2GB of RAM, up from 1GB on the previous model, make it far superior in raw power to 2014's model, and it's got some other tricks too. It's got a 12MP rear camera and an tried-and-true 8MP front-facing camera, making it the best selfie shooter Apple's put on a phone. It does sport largely the same design and screen as the iPhone 6 though and the latter in particular is starting to feel a bit dated in the face of super sharp QHD screens from rivals. Apple has at least added a new feature to the display, in the form of 3D Touch, which makes it pressure sensitive and offers new tricks for enhanced emailing and shortcuts around the homescreen. Ultimately the iPhone 6S is the best 4.7-inch iPhone available and is likely to remain a compelling choice for years to come. Specifically, you'll pay $549/£499/AU$929 and up, which is a lot, but not actually any more than the iPhone 6 Plus. Read the full review: iPhone 6S 5. iPhone 6S Plus A good iOS phablet Weight: 192g | Dimensions: 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm | OS: iOS 9.3 | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 pixels | CPU: Apple A9 | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16GB/64GB/128GB | Battery: 2750mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP 3D Touch has exciting potential Bright, vibrant display Big and heavy Expensive The iPhone 6S Plus comes in at upwards of $649/£599/AU$1,079, but for that money you get everything the iPhone 6S has with a bigger and sharper 5.5-inch screen. That makes it more unwieldy than the iPhone 6S, but a big screen also has a number of advantages, making movies and games more immersive - and the extra resolution really helps make apps look even better. It also has a bigger and longer-lasting battery, matching the iPhone 6 Plus in terms of longevity. It's big, powerful, feature-packed and going to last the longest of all the iPhones, making it the best Apple handset for phablet fans with money to burn. Plus, as it comes in sizes of up to 128GB you can store your entire movie collection on it, if that's your thing. Read the full review: iPhone 6S Plus 6. iPhone 6 A good phone with a great design Weight: 129g | Dimensions: 138.1 x 67 x 6.9mm | OS: iOS 9.3 | Screen size: 4.7-inch | Resolution: 1334 x 750 pixels | CPU: Apple A8 | RAM: 1GB | Storage: 16GB/64GB/128GB | Battery: 1810mAh | Rear camera: 8MP | Front camera: 1.2MP Great design Better battery than previous models Still pricey Screen too low-res The iPhone 6 was a big change for Apple. Not only did it sport a curvier chassis than the last few models - complete with a change from metal and glass to all-metal - but it was also bigger, with a 4.7-inch screen. Even that's not massive by smartphone standards, but it's substantially larger than the 4-inch iPhone 5S, bringing Apple into line with the trend of bigger screens that the rest of the competition was peddling. The iPhone 6's screen is sadly no more or less sharp than the 5S though, as the resolution went up in line with the size, where rivals were shovelling in pixels at a rate of knots. It is, however, far more powerful than the iPhone 5S, with an A8 processor giving it extra grunt. It's since been beaten by the iPhone 6S, iPhone 7 and even the iPhone SE, but the iPhone 6 is still one of the slickest performers around for most top apps. Apple also packed in a better battery to help get you through the day. It's still not stellar, but it will keep you going through a day of moderate use, making it a better fit for any phone addicts than Apple's older handsets. You can expect a few years of software updates too and while the design may not be to everyone's tastes we'd argue that the curvy look is an improvement on the angular iPhone 5S. Read the full review: iPhone 6 7. iPhone 6 Plus Apple's first phablet has a stunning design Weight: 172g | Dimensions: 158.1 x 77.8 x 7.1mm | OS: iOS 9.3 | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 pixels | CPU: Apple A8 | RAM: 1GB | Storage: 16GB/64GB/128GB | Battery: 2915mAh | Rear camera: 8MP | Front camera: 1.2MP Great full HD display Strong camera Too big to use one handed Expensive If 4.7 inches isn't enough for you - you're in luck. Apple launched the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus alongside the iPhone 6 to give the phablet market something to chew over. The extra size makes it a better option for watching movies, browsing the web and generally wasting time on your phone with. It's also sharper than the iPhone 6, with a 1080 x 1920 401ppi screen, in place of a 750 x 1334 326ppi one. In most other ways it's a match for the iPhone 6, with the notable addition of optical image stabilization for the camera offering better snaps, and the improved battery life is something a lot of iPhone owners crave. Read the full review: iPhone 6 Plus 8. iPhone 5S An affordable alternative to the iPhone SE Weight: 112g | Dimensions: 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6mm | OS: iOS 9.3 | Screen size: 4.0-inch | Resolution: 1136 x 640 pixels | CPU: Apple A7 | RAM: 1GB | Storage: 16GB/32GB/64GB | Battery: 1560mAh | Rear camera: 8MP | Front camera: 1.2MP Touch ID Good camera Battery suspect Dated screen tech Apple followed up the iPhone 5 with the iPhone 5S. It has the same size and resolution screen, so it's a compact 4-inch phone, making it ideal for anyone who doesn't like lugging around an undersized tablet. The premium design is much the same too, with a two-tone metal and glass construction. But it's a little more powerful, with a newer processor under the hood. We're still not in top-end territory here, (not by 2016 standards anyway), but it's slightly nippier under the finger. The camera was also rather improved over the iPhone 5, with the 8MP snapper still taking decent photos despite its age. But perhaps the biggest change from the iPhone 5 is the addition of Touch ID, allowing you to secure the phone with your fingerprint. Plus, as a newer handset it should still have a little bit of life in it, as Apple is likely to keep the OS updated for a while longer. If you don't fancy upgrading again a year or two down the line, that's worth factoring in as you should get to 2018 (or even 2019 if you're a light user) before finally having to give in and upgrade. All this comes at a cost though. You can't get the iPhone 5S direct from Apple any more, but it can be found in other stores from around $335/£270/AU$425. That makes it a fair bit pricier than the iPhone 5, but if you have the money to spare it's probably worth it for the extra power, future-proofing and fingerprint-scanning credentials of the iPhone 5S.

X Court to fast-track legal challenge to Apple data centre in Athenry Brian McDonagh challenging decision to allow Apple build €850m facility in Co Galway about 23 hours ago Aodhan O'Faolain A march and rally held earlier this month in support of Apple’s €850 million data centre project for Athenry. Photograph: Joe O’Shaughnessy         A second legal challenge to permission for an Apple data centre in Co Galway is to be fast-tracked in the Commercial Court. In judicial review proceedings, Brian McDonagh is challenging An Bord Pleanála’s decision last August to allow Apple build the data centre, one of eight such proposed developments at Toberroe, Palmerstown, Derrydonnell and Athenry. Among various claims, Mr McDonagh alleges the decision breaches EU directives on forestry. On Monday, lawyers for Apple Distribution International, a notice party to the case as proposed developer of the data centre, applied to have the action admitted to the Commercial Court. Mr McDonagh opposed the transfer application on grounds including the timescales provided for would not allow him enough time to get documentats from the EU necessary for his case. Representing himself, Mr McDonagh, Unit 1, Ballymount Cross Business Park, Dublin, said he “did not oppose Apple coming to Athenry” but wanted to ensure compliance witbh “proper planning procedures”. Media publicity He said he wanted the case heard either by the High Court or in Europe. He had been subjected to adverse media publicity since bringing his action, he added. Rory Mulcahy SC, for Apple, said Mr McDonagh was previously refused permission by the High Court to include arguments about an alleged breach of the forestry directive in his action but has appealed that ruling to the Court of Appeal. Mr McDonagh had made no submissions to Galway County Council in respect of the original planning application and nor had he appealed to the board, Mr Mulcahy said. Mr McDonagh “only came on the field after the board made its decision”. Mr Justice Brian McGovern said he was satisfied the case was appropriate for admission to the list. Last week, a separate action by Sinéad Fitzpatrick and Allan Daly challenging An Bord Pleanála’s permission was admitted to the Commercial Court. Both cases will be heard in March. ADVERTISEMENT Environmental impact Ms Fitzpatrick and Mr Daly, of Lisheenkyle, Athenry, which is close to the proposed centre, claim the permission is invalid on grounds including the board failed to carry out a proper environmental impact assessment of the development. In seeking to have the cases fast-tracked, Apple argued the proposed centre is a critical piece of infrastructure required to support the worldwide demand for global storage necessary to cater for rapid expansion in wireless electronic communication, entertainment and work. Apple says it needs the centre to deal with the exponential growth in demand for data processing and storage. The cost of the overall proposed plan to build eight data centres in Athenry is some €850 million. If given the go-ahead, the development will create hundreds of jobs directly and indirectly, the company said.       Topics: Allan Daly Aodhan O Faolain Brian Mcdonagh Justice Brian Mcgovern Sinead Fitzpatrick An Bord Pleanála Court Of Appeal High Court Apple Athenry Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Commercial Property Pick-up in pub market as consumer confidence returns Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of International 1:28 RWC 2023: Ireland ready to stage a tournament ‘like no other’ Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Three sees revenues jump in first full reporting year since O2 buyout 17:41 UK insurer Aviva appoints John Quinlan as new CEO in Ireland 17:37 Pick-up in pub market as consumer confidence returns 17:35 Samsung to buy car tech company Harman for $8bn 17:16 Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway backs big US airlines 17:07 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Much has not been disclosed officially yet on Apple's iPad Pro roster since Apple Inc. has announced its other flagship variants such the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus along with the redesigned MacBook Pro in October. And while most are purely coming from a speculated standpoint, the rumors about the upcoming iPad Pro model 9 (or models) are nevertheless still worth a try — but not until as of late. According to Barclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O'Malley and Jerry Zhang, Apple is set to unveil three new iPad Pro variants on March 2017. The launching will reportedly include a refreshed 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch versions along with the much-awaited, bezel-free 10.9-inch model.   Furthermore, MacRumors has shared via a research note that the analysts have revealed that the 10.9-inch version's borderless design will enable the device to be similar to the physical size of the current-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro model. An indication that the display will have an edge-to-edge design, eliminating the home button. The speculations about the arrival of new iPad Pro models have also surfaced previously with an apparent difference on the models' sizes. Noted KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had stressed months ago that a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro will be launched in 2017. Moreover, Mac Otakara, an established Japanese website, has shared that a new 10.1-inch iPad Pro is slated to be revealed in early 2017. Meanwhile, the analysts from Barclays, along with Kuo, have revealed that the purported 9.7-inch iPad Pro model would be priced at a low price, akin to its 7.9-inch iPad Mini variant. According to the analysts, the Cupertino-based firm will extend the production and marketing of the current iPad Mini 4 which was launched in 2015.  All the upcoming iPad Pro models will be equipped with quad microphones and will still be sporting the 3.5mm headphone ports.  Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Go to the Home Page Top News Christians unhappy as Colorado approves legalization of assisted suicide Professor admits misquoting Christian governor in Jakarta after blasphemy protests turn violent ISIS separates families by abducting newborn babies, virgin girls, says Catholic priest Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

It has been over a month since Apple launched its latest flagship smartphones – the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. A recent report suggested that the latest smartphone has become the best selling device in US within a month’s time. Meanwhile, there are already speculations being made regarding the company’s future device. With next year’s launch, Apple will be celebrating its tenth-year anniversary and in order to make this occasion special, the company is expected to make some major changes. Latest report from Barclays’ analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn suggests that the supposed iPhone 8 will feature a bezel-less design with curved edges on all sides. The analysts claim that the iPhone 8 models will come in the same sizes and that the displays of the smartphone will increase to 5 and 5.9-inches, thanks to the bezel-less design technology. The analysts further stressed on Apple’s shift to OLED display panels which are said to be more battery-efficient and offer a better colour accuracy. The OLED display panels are also reported to allow the iPhone 8 screen to bend at the edges thereby, introducing an all-new, curved-edge design on the sides of the future iPhone. The analysts further suggested that Apple’s 3D Touch will witness a new ‘film-based solution.’ There have been numerous leaks regarding the iPhone 8 in the past. One of them even pointed towards how the iPhone 8 will come with an advanced wireless charging technology that will allow users to charge their devices even from 15ft of distance.

Comments CIO | Nov 14, 2016 8:00 AM PT Like this article? thumbsup +1 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS Mobile MacBooks Hardware Comments Apple’s recent announcement of new MacBook Pros with a Touch Bar caught the attention of many Mac users who have been waiting a long time to upgrade their laptops. Potential buyers of these new MacBook Pros have been wondering if the new Touch Bar feature is worth the money Apple is asking for the new computers. That's a very valid concern considering that the MacBook Pros with Touch Bar start at $1799 for the 13-inch model and $2399 for the 15-inch model, and go for $1999 for the higher-end 13-inch model and a whopping $2799 for the higher-end 15-inch version. Fortunately, reviews have started to come out of the MacBook Pros with Touch Bar and I’ve compiled a helpful roundup to assist you in making your buying decision. The Verge: A touch of the future Jacob Kastrenakes at The Verge noted that the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is a taste of the future but that that future isn’t quite here yet: I may come off sounding quite critical of the new MacBook Pro, but the truth is that I really do like it. The hardware is incredible, macOS is a joy to use, and I don’t want to give up this screen and keyboard. It’s a fantastic laptop on build alone. But everywhere I look, it feels like this incarnation of the MacBook Pro is shooting for a future it can’t quite reach. One where it can be impressively thin and powerful enough for the pros. Where it can be super light and have all-day battery life. Where its ports and keyboard morph and adapt perfectly to the needs of every user. I have little doubt that in a couple years, the technology Apple has been waiting for will arrive and this vision, or something closer to it, will be complete. Apple just released this machine too soon, or was too aggressive in the decisions it made. That future is almost certainly out there. But it’s not in this machine. Not yet. More at The Verge Ars Technica: Touch Bar, Touch ID, dedicated GPUs, more ports, and a whole lot more Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica indicated that the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has much to offer certain users but that it comes with a high price tag: If you’ve got a MacBook Pro that you bought in 2012 or earlier and if you’re convinced of the potential utility and novelty of the Touch Bar, these 2016 MacBook Pros were just about worth the wait. Replace a four- or five-year-old laptop with one of these and you’ll get a great new design, a respectable performance boost, a nice screen, the single most versatile port you can get in any computer, and a new input device that tries to combine the good stuff about PC touchscreens (fast response, malleable button layouts) while avoiding the bad stuff about PC touchscreens (adapting a mouse-and-keyboard driven operating system to finger input, blocking the screen by poking at it with your hand). The main problem at this point isn’t that the Touch Bar is a bad idea, but that these laptops cost a whole bunch of money. Great, premium PC laptops are available for half this price, even if Apple still maintains an edge when it comes to graphics and SSD speeds. It really feels like the Touch Bar needs to be included in the £1,450 model, and that versions of the new designs without Touch Bars should be the entry level systems—right now, Apple’s entry-level Mac laptops were all released in mid 2015, and that’s only going to get more embarrassing as time moves on. The other problem, and one that resonates for the rest of the PC industry, is that if you bought a MacBook Pro in 2013 or later there’s really very little reason to consider a new MacBook Pro. Intel’s processors deliver much better battery life than they used to, but the company’s new CPU architectures barely push performance forward and there are ever-wider gaps between new releases as it gets more difficult to move to better manufacturing processes. I like these laptops a lot. I bought one to replace my 2013 MacBook Air, which still performs basically fine but doesn’t have the sharp screen or design chops of the PC laptops that have come out in the last two-or-so years. But the rest of the Mac lineup—all of the desktops and the more affordable laptops—are still stuck in the past. It feels like Apple might have a comprehensive vision for the future of its computers, but that it’s only ready to show us a small, expensive peek right now. The sooner the Touch Bar and USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 can spread across the entire lineup and end this awkward transitional phase, the better. The good Nice new designs that are thinner and lighter than their predecessors. Four Thunderbolt 3 ports each, two on each side—this is super convenient for charging, especially. Low-travel keyboard still isn't for everyone, but it's a marked improvement over the first-generation version in the MacBook. Good battery life. Industry-leading storage performance. Non-terrible laptop speakers. 1.3Gbps Wi-Fi, unlike the £1,450 version. The bad 13-inch Touch Bar model doesn't have the same battery life as the non-Touch Bar model. Extremely limited repairability and upgradeability. Intel's CPU speed increases in the last few years have been discouraging. Need for dongles will be inconvenient, especially at first. The ugly Expensive, even for Macs. More at Ars Technica Engadget: A step forward and a step back Dana Wollman at Engadget found that the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar wasn’t quite what she wanted, and that she missed her function keys: I’m one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn’t quite what I wanted. For me, the ideal MacBook Pro is actually a mashup between this and last year’s model. Let me keep my full-size USB ports, and my function keys, and my longer battery life, but stick with this thinner and lighter design. Stick with this improved display, Touch ID sensor, fast disk performance and more robust audio quality. For me, this is both a step forward and a step backward. I’m sure Apple disagrees, and not just because its job is to sell lots of computers. Apple seems to earnestly believe it knows how people should be getting work done – so much so that it has the chutzpah to ask loyal customers to unlearn old habits. Get used to using dongles to attach your existing accessories. Say goodbye to your memory card slot, creatives. Resign yourself to adjusting the brightness or volume with taps and swipes, instead of a simple button press. Accept the risk that your existing Thunderbolt 3 peripherals might not work. As I said, there’s ultimately a lot to like about the new MacBook Pro. But it’s designed for someone who I’m not sure exists outside Apple’s fantasies of how professionals use computers. The MacBook Pro I want to see is built around real people’s work habits. I still recommend it, and I imagine many of you who have been waiting patiently will indeed buy this. But I’d enjoy it more if it were designed for people like us. More at Engadget Six Colors: A keyboard chameleon Jason Snell at Six Colors was initially skeptical about the Touch Bar in the new MacBook Pro but warmed up to it after using it for a while: I was skeptical of the Touch Bar when it was first rumored, but it’s obvious that Apple has taken great care in refining the concept to focus it on being a contextual extension of the keyboard rather than a very squat iPad. Apple’s implementation of the Touch Bar interface in its apps vary from incredibly detailed to more generic, but I expect that over the next year or two we’ll all learn more about what makes an effective Touch Bar interface and what doesn’t. My gut feeling is that some of the more ambitious, complex interfaces will prove to be less useful than quick shortcuts, and that customization will be invaluable. But we won’t know until we try. If the Touch ID sensor is a little less exciting, that’s because it’s so familiar from iOS that it doesn’t seem that unusual to encounter it on the Mac. And I do like reducing the number of times I need to type in my password. I’m also happy that this is brand-new Apple hardware that’s immediately accessible by third-party software developers, which should limit the really awkward period where early adopters rush to a new feature only to find it supported by Apple but with no hope for more until the next year’s OS update. So who says there’s nothing new under the sun? Here’s a new dimension added to the Mac, with a debt owed to iOS, but undeniably its own approach. It never forgets it’s a companion to the keyboard and trackpad, but adds more flexibility than a static keyboard ever could. I’m looking forward to seeing how it evolves—and I have to admit, I kind of want one to place above the top row of my own external Mac keyboard now. I never felt that way about function keys. More at Six Colors TechCrunch: The Touch Bar is a nice bonus Brian Heater at TechCrunch liked the Touch Bar but noted that the spec bump in the new MacBook Pro was the biggest draw for him: The less celebrated spec bumps are what make the new Pro a worthy upgrade, particularly for those who, like me, have been suffering through their old system’s death rattles (or fan buzzing, at least), waiting for a significant update from the company. Better processors, more storage, a brighter display and better speakers are all wrapped up in a sleeker and lighter package than before. The Touch Bar feels like a nice bonus for the time being. It’s a compelling new input device that has the potential to alter the way we interact with applications on a laptop. In this early stage, it’s a cool feature that further distinguishes the Pro from other similarly spec-ed laptops, proving most useful in the consumption and creation of media like video, audio and images — all part of the creative professional demographic that has long served as one of the company’s core user bases. As Apple and third-party developers continue to play around with the form, its usefulness will only continue to grow. And perhaps it won’t be too long before we start seeing desktop applications built with the Touch Bar in mind, rather than adding such functionality in hindsight. The addition of Touch ID, however, has some immediately welcome functionality, including more secure startups and purchasing. And, as ever, the new MacBook Pro doesn’t come cheap, with a starting price of $1,799 (for the 13-inch Touch Bar version) all the way up through the fully packed model that goes well north of $4K. But let’s be honest, users have never bought Macs because of their rock-bottom prices. For those who have been holding out on buying a new MacBook, the time is right, with an upgrade that should be sufficiently future-proof to take on the next few years — or however long it takes for the next major upgrade. Hopefully you’ve been saving up in the meantime.

Nov 14, 2016 07:43 AM EST | By Godswarrior010 email print Sign Up for GamenGuide's Newsletter and never miss out on our most popular stories. HP is announcing new notebooks at CES 2016, and its star is undoubtedly the EliteBook Folio G1. It’s a super-slim Windows laptop with a 4K touchscreen display that’s going to be in stores this March. (Photo: The Verge/YouTube) The HP EliteBook Folio G1 breaks the conventional mold of mobile laptops and brings many things in store for HP. The notebook unveiled in a CES conference just recently was patterned similarly to Apple's 12- inch MacBook. It also looks sleek and stylish but can it compete with the long-standing reputation of the MacBook Pro? Here's what we know. HP Elitebook Folio G1 Vs. MacBook Pro 2016: Specs HP EliteBook Folio G1 maybe a new kid on the block but it is a solid laptop that is thinner than the MacBook and is built with a silver aluminum chassis. It is slightly heavier than Apple's notebook but is lighter than some of the laptops within its range. Unlike MacBook Pro 2016's Intel Core i5 processor, HP is run by the latest Intel Core i7. The Apple notebook and Elitebook both has an 8 GB memory upgradeable to 16GB. The MacBook Pro 2016 comes along with an Intel Iris Graphics 540, 2,560 x 1,600 Retina display, 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports, a 3.55mm headphone jack and 256GB PCle SSD. HP Elitebook Folio on the other hand boasts of a 2,840 x 2,160 4k Touchscreen display, 2 USB-C Ports, 256GB PCle SSD, 8GB RAM and a full-HD non-touch display. As for the laptop's battery life, HP Elitebook Folio G1 lasts for seven hours while the MacBook Pro 2016 can be used for up to ten hours prior to charging. HP Elitebook Folio G1 Vs. MacBook Pro 2016: Price The Apple Notebook starts at the price of $1,799 while the lowest-end model of HP Elitebook Folio only comes in at $999. The HP Elitebook has 128GB of storage and a 1,920 X 1,080 pixel resolution non-touch display while MacBook has a bigger storage space of 256GB storage with 2,500 x 1,600 pixel resolution non-touch display.   HP Elitebook Folio G1 Vs. MacBook Pro 2016: The Verdict Like the MacBook Pro 2016, HP Elitebook uses Intel's latest Core M-series processors. Both the HP Elitebook Folio G1 and MacBook Pro 2016 are good choices for people looking for a slim, light, portable and powerful device. The two laptops have amazing specs and features that can lure anyone in. The only difference would be their price. HP Elitebook Folio is for those who want an outstanding laptop at an economical price while the MacBook Pro 2016 is for people can afford a superior laptop at a premium price. HP Elitebook Folio G1 is expected to be released on March 2017 while the MacBook Pro 2016 is readily available in Apple stores all over the world.        TagsHP Elitebook Folio G1, MacBook Pro 2016 You May Like These Related Articles 'HTC 10' Latest News & Update: Android 7.0 Nougat Update Will Be Available Soon?

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Blackbaud Speeds the Pace of Giving with Apple Pay Blackbaud Merchant Services is an end-to-end payment processing solution designed exclusively for nonprofits. The addition of Apple Pay as a new checkout option within Blackbaud’s solution allows nonprofits to offer their donors an easy and secure way to pay — all within the secure, simple and affordable donation processing system they have come to rely on from Blackbaud.  “At Blackbaud, we’re innovating to power every moment that helps nonprofits better understand and engage supporters,” said Kevin McDearis, chief products officer at Blackbaud. “This also means building solutions that create frictionless, integrated and secure experiences across devices and platforms to support the work of philanthropy—from cultivation, to fundraising, donation processing and more. Integrating Apple Pay into our digital payments solution is a great example of how we’re working to help nonprofits provide their donors with a modern, agile checkout experience that mirrors the convenience and mobility they enjoy as consumers.”  Many well-known charities using Blackbaud Merchant Services are already live today with Apple Pay, including American Heart Association, Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), Feeding America, The Nature Conservancy, WNET and World Wildlife Fund (WWF).  “Donor behavior is constantly changing and we want to be able to quickly respond to those changes. Apple Pay lets Feeding America offer our donors a checkout experience that is as easy and fast as the best e-commerce experiences,” said Liz Nielsen, senior vice president of Direct Marketing & Digital Engagement at Feeding America. “It is critical that we stay on the front-end of mobile technology if we want to continue to grow support for Feeding America and ultimately get more food to more people facing hunger in our country.” Nonprofits have signaled that offering Apple Pay as an option for donors will increase conversion rates from mobile and website visitors, simplify the donation process and reduce the information required for donors to give; potentially even increasing donation frequency as a result.  “We are excited to be among the first nonprofit organizations to offer the ability to donate with Apple Pay,” said Michael Osso, president and CEO of Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America. “CCFA has always been on the forefront of technology to ensure a smooth donor experience. Offering fast and convenient technology that enhances our ability to raise crucial funds, especially during the end-of-year giving season, will help us deliver on our mission to improve the lives of patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.” David Glass, senior director of online marketing for World Wildlife Fund added, “Giving donors new and simple ways to contribute to World Wildlife Fund’s mission to protect the future of nature is critical to our work.” Apple Pay is available today for organizations using Blackbaud Merchant Services to process donations in Luminate Online™. In 2017, Blackbaud will expand Apple Pay functionality across the portfolio. For more information, visit www.blackbaud.com/apple-pay.

Mossberg: New MacBook Pro is a fast, slim tweener The Verge 1 day ago Walt Mossberg © Provided by The Verge Apple is realigning its familiar laptop line, dramatically reshaping and in some ways merging the favorite options for both heavy-duty “pro” users and everyday customers. And the poster child for this more muddled future is the pricey new MacBook Pro, which appears in stores this week. Apple wants you to focus on the new Pro’s boldest feature, called the Touch Bar. It’s a touch-operated strip of buttons and sliders displayed on a thin screen at the top of the keyboard that changes functions depending on what you’re doing. It injects a bit of iPhone and iPad feel into the Mac. And it’s well worth noting. But, the bigger story here to me is that the Pro, once mainly aimed straight at people who do especially taxing work like professional video editing or serious design, is now being stretched to suit a much larger audience. That’s especially true of the 13-inch model (there’s also a 15-inch variety.) It’s thinner and lighter, and is the only modern, easily portable Mac laptop with both a high-res Retina display and a relatively recent, first-class processor (the 6th generation Core i5 or i7). Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 106.44 +0.73 +0.69% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 58.74 +0.62 +1.07% So, I’ve been testing the 13” Touch Bar-equipped Pro for about 10 days, looking at it from the point of view of mainstream users, not pros. Mainstream Mac lovers must assess whether the Pro, now much thinner and lighter, is a good replacement for the brilliant MacBook Air, which Apple will still sell (starting at $999) but which has apparently been consigned to Cupertino’s special purgatory for products it can’t quite kill yet, but won’t upgrade. The Air was the best laptop ever built, in my opinion, but it was never given a high-res Retina display and has fallen behind in processor technology. And Apple’s other Mac laptop, the much newer 12” MacBook, while beautiful and portable, has a weak processor, a small screen, a single port, and a high base price of $1299. The new Pro definitely trounces my three-year-old MacBook Air in power and screen quality. Running the normal set of apps and browser tabs I use every day, my old Air blasts its fans a lot to keep up. The Touch Bar Pro barely notices. But, I have reservations, and you should too. Many pro users are already vocally complaining about issues particular to them. But, even for mainstream Mac users, there are questions about price, ports, the Touch Bar feature, the keyboard, and — surprisingly, for a Mac — battery life. The Basics This new 13” Pro comes in two flavors. One, the base model, costs less (it starts at $1499) but lacks the Touch Bar and Touch ID, the fingerprint-scanner which can be used to log into the computer and to make online purchases. Instead, it has a standard, but severely squished, row of function keys. The 13” Touch Bar model starts at $1799 but can be configured to more robust specs that bring it to $2899. The 15” model, which isn’t the focus of this review, starts at $2399. Design A big part of what makes the Pro double as a successor to the Air is that it has been made much thinner and lighter, even at the cost of enraging some pros, whose favorite ports may have been ditched because they took up too much room. The new 13” Pro is now 12” thinner than the Air, and weighs the same 3 pounds. It’s as if Apple had shrunk the 13” Air, kept the same screen size, added Retina, upgraded the processor, and added the Touch Bar and Touch ID. The screen is just fabulous, even better than the previous 13” Pro’s Retina display. And way better than the display on the Air. The keyboard isn’t anything like the old Air’s or Pro’s. It’a revised version of the flat, limited-travel keyboard introduced on the MacBook. I hated the first one on the smaller computer, yet I like this second generation just fine. For me, it took no time at all to get used to. It’s clicky and responsive. I suspect you’ll like it. But keyboards are a personal thing, so I urge you to try it in a store before ordering. Battery Life The biggest surprise in my tests was just how inconsistent the Touch Bar Pro’s battery life was. I have tested hundreds of laptops over the years and Macs have almost always excelled at meeting or beating their promised battery lives, both in my longtime battery test regime, and in typical daily use. But the 13” MacBook Pro with Touch Bar wasn’t as reliably consistent as previous Macs. On my rigorous test, which I’ve used for years, the machine actually exceeded Apple’s claim of up to 10 hours of battery life. The test involves setting the screen at 100%, keeping it on and undimmed constantly, playing an endless loop of music, and leaving Wi-Fi on to collect email, tweets and Facebook posts in the background. Result: 11 hours and 38 minutes.   Normally, that battery test is an understatement, because people typically do let the screen go dark periodically and they don’t use it at 100% brightness. But, in this case, after hearing that a colleague was seeing much lower results in general use, I ran a second test with all of Apple’s default energy-saving settings on, the screen at 75% and a perfectly normal (for me) mix of tasks like web browsing, email, a few short videos, Twitter, Facebook, some light writing, and Slack. The Pro died at 8 hours and 22 minutes. To make things worse, Apple’s built-in prediction of how much time the battery had left before dying fluctuated a lot and was mostly wrong (Apple says this is a known problem caused by the fact that modern processors can power up and down rapidly over a much wider range than in the past, making estimates much more difficult.) So, my best advice is that even a mainstream, non-pro user can’t count on this laptop lasting the promised maximum of 10 hours — even in light to moderate use — let alone the 12 hour maximum a new Air can pull off. And you won’t have an accurate estimate to go by. The Touch Bar © Provided by The Verge The big innovation Apple touts for the new Pro is the Touch Bar. Some regard it as Apple’s lame substitute for the full touch screen it refuses to install in the Mac. But I see it as an effort to replace the keyboard’s ancient function row with a bit of the touch screen simplicity that’s the magic behind iOS. (The function keys, like brightness and volume, are still there, in virtual form, but they temporarily contract when an app displays its customized keys and sliders.) And, yes, there’s still an Escape key, but it’s virtual. For pros, the Touch Bar holds promise as quick way to scroll through photos, or audio wave forms, or video frames, or color choices. The trouble is, that, right now, I don’t think it does much for mainstream users. For instance, in Safari and Photos, it presents thumbnails of open tabs and photos that are so tiny you can barely recognize them. You mainly just scroll through them.   In Safari, a Touch Bar button allows you to quickly open a new tab. Another starts a search. In Mail, you can do things like start a new message, reply to one, or trash one. None of this is very exciting or creative, especially since you have a gigantic, buttery-smooth Trackpad below the keyboard. You can’t even use the Touch Bar in Apple Mail to move to the next unread message or jump back to the top of a list. The single most useful feature of the Touch Bar, in my view, is that it provides a home for predictive text selections and emojis when you are writing in almost any app or web page that permits text entry. This includes Apple’s word processors, Microsoft Office (coming), Facebook, Messages and more. It’s kind of like a wedding of iPhone and Mac text entry, and I like it. (If you don’t you can ignore it.) Alas, although I wrote this whole column on a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I couldn’t use this predictive text feature because I was writing in Google Docs running in a Safari tab. That’s right: while text entry in any number of web pages works with the Touch Bar, it fails with one of the world’s most widely used web apps. An Apple official said: “Google Docs uses a different model of text entry than the standard text entry used by most websites. This affects the functionality of Touch Bar features. We are working with Google to support these features.” I don’t think the Touch Bar is a gimmick, but I don’t think it changes much, at least yet, for everyday Mac users. Luckily, third party app developers can design ways to use it, and users can customize it to some extent. So it may have a more productive future. But, right now, it’s unlikely to improve most users’ life dramatically when working on their laptops. Ports © Provided by The Verge The new MacBook Pros dispense with traditional SD card, USB and long-standard video connectors. Even the genius, breakaway MagSafe power connector is gone. In their place are simply four of the new USB-C ports, which also work with Thunderbolt 3. These connectors are fast, and highly versatile. They can be used for charging, data transfer, video output and more. And they are likely the future. But you’ll need to buy dongles (adapters) to connect them to most monitors, external storage, and flash memory cards. I fully understand the outrage over this switch from people who make their living on current MacBook Pros and legacy peripherals, like monitors or external storage; and from photographers and editors who rely on flash memory cards. Nobody likes dongles or adapters and some brands are unreliable or unsafe. Apple slashed its adapter prices temporarily in the wake of the complaints. But I honestly don’t think this is a big problem for average Mac users, whose main need will likely be a new Mac-to-iPhone cable ($19 from Apple). And I believe that, over time, most peripherals will switch to USB-C, since other companies — not just Apple — are behind it. Price For everyday Mac users, especially, the new Pro is a costly machine. Even the non-Touch Bar model is $500 more than the Air (at $999) and the cheapest Touch Bar edition is $300 more than that. But Apple has always been a premium PC maker, and its new models have often started off at sky-high prices. People forget that, when it debuted in 2008, the MacBook Air with the then-revolutionary, but puny, 64GB solid state drive cost a breathtaking $3100. You can get a terabyte of solid-state storage in the costliest 13” new model, and pay less. If you’re a mainstream Mac lover who isn’t bothered by its limitations, you can save money with the 12” MacBook, or even buy a new Air, if it works well for you. Or, if those MacBook Pro prices are too high for you, and your current Mac is doing OK, you could wait for them to come down next year. Bottom line  The new 13” MacBooks — even the base model without the Touch Bar — are costly. And they may make pros unhappy. But, for everyday Mac lovers — users of the Air or maybe the older low-end Pro — they are now your only thin, modern, option with a full-fledged processor. The Touch Bar has potential, but it’s not magic. The battery isn’t likely to deliver on Apple’s claims. You can’t count on liking the keyboard. But, if you’re a Mac devotee ready to move past the Air — not back to a lower-powered MacBook — this is what Apple is offering. Take it or leave it.

Apple Pay Will Now Let Users Donate To Charitable Organizations Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Pay Will Now Let Users Donate To Charitable Organizations November 14, 2016 1:47 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk here you go charity charities charitable donations donations apple pay As we head into the holidays, giving to charitable organizations might be something you’re thinking about. You’ll have another option for how you can do that, with Apple announcing today that Apple Pay now supports donations to non-profits. As of today, U.S. users can donate — either online or from a mobile app — to 19 organizations, with another five charities coming on board in the near future, Apple said. “We’re making it incredibly easy to give back with Apple Pay,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay. “Websites and apps tell us they see twice as many people actually completing a purchase with Apple Pay than with other payment methods. We think offering such a simple and secure way to support the incredible work nonprofits do will have a significant impact on the communities they serve.” When donating on your phone, you’ll be able to use TouchID to authorize a payment. If you’re sending money on the web, clicking the Apple Pay donate button will send a confirmation request to your iPhone or Apple Watch. It makes sense for charities to accept donations this way, of course, considering how much time millennials spend with their eyes glued to their technological devices. If they don’t have to put down their phones to donate, perhaps they’ll be more willing to give. Non-profits that now have Apple Pay support: • American Red Cross • American Heart Association • charity: water • Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals • COPD Foundation • Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) • Doctors Without Borders • Feeding America • GlobalGiving • International Rescue Committee • (RED) • St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital • Save the Children • The Nature Conservancy • The Water Project • UNICEF • WNET • World Vision • WWF (World Wildlife Fund) Nonprofits soon to offer Apple Pay include: • American Cancer Society • CARE • DonorsChoose.org • PBS and its local stations • United Way November 14, 2016 By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk here you go charity charities charitable donations donations apple pay Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related give wisely How To Not Suck… At Charitable Giving Where's The Money?

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple released iOS 10.2 beta 3 on Monday, again moving closer to the final launch of one of the larger iOS beta updates coming down the road. It packs the new “TV” application, which was announced during Apple’s MacBook event just a few weeks back. The TV app will allow you to find content across a variety of services, though Netflix and Amazon Prime Video aren’t supported. It’ll be a particularly compelling experience for folks who also own an Apple TV. There are other software tweaks in iOS 10.2 including new emoji, a new celebration animation inside Messages and more. iOS 10.2 beta 3 available now Developers should find the update now and, if things go as usual, we should see the public preview of iOS 10.2 beta 3 hit sometime tomorrow.

Late last month, the company launched new MacBook Pros that have an OLED Touch Bar that sort-of adds a touch interface to the Mac by way of replacing the existing function row. Apple exec Phil Schiller explains Apple’s reasoning behind not doing a touch screen Mac (via Backchannel). Apple came to this conclusion by testing if touch screens made sense on the Mac. “Our instincts were that it didn’t, but, what the heck, we could be wrong—so our teams worked on that for a number of times over the years,” says Schiller. “We’ve absolutely come away with the belief that it isn’t the right thing to do. Our instincts were correct.” While some reviewers question the usability of the Touch Bar, Schiller is confident that it’s the best approach on a notebook. “Watch, iPhone, iPad, Macbook, iMac,” he said. “They really are all computers. Each one is offering customers something unique and each one is made with a simple form that perhaps is eternal. People in the industry may question them — we don’t, for some very simple reasons.” What this translates to is you shouldn’t be expecting an iPad/MacBook hybrid any time soon, countering Microsoft’s Surface line of products. This is mostly because Apple wants a unified experience across its notebooks and desktops. “We think of the whole platform,” he says. “If we were to do Multi-Touch on the screen of the notebook, that wouldn’t be enough — then the desktop wouldn’t work that way.” And touch on the desktop, he says, would be a disaster. Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd.” It’s pretty clear that you shouldn’t expect a Touch Bar on iOS devices any time soon. Rather, expect iPads to continue excelling down the path they already are while getting more dynamic (like Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard) support. Though Schiller’s careful choice of words does suggest that iMacs will be seeing the Touch Bar in the future. If MacBooks have it, then iMacs, Mac minis and Mac Pros will be getting them soon, right?

Gray Skies Distillery, at 700 Ottawa Ave. NW, will begin selling its Michigan Single Malt Whiskey and Apple Brandy this week. The spirits will be on sale Tuesday and can be pre-ordered on the company’s website. Both spirits are being released in packages for Cocktail Week GR. A package includes a bottle of liquor, four slate coasters and a set of tasting glasses. The spirits are the result of the distiller's 500-gallon batch process, using whole Michigan grains that are milled into flour on site, said Steve Vander Pol, co-owner, Gray Skies Distillery. Whiskey Gray Skies started the process for the Scotch-style whiskey with malted barley from Pilot Malt House, and the distillery said it is the first to use the malt house’s Peanut Butter Toast malt. The whiskey is aged six months in 15-gallon barrels to "smooth the edges but not cause the unique grain flavors to recede,” said Brandon Voorhees, co-owner, Gray Skies Distillery. The company's Cocktail Week GR package with the whiskey is $60. Brandy Normally made with a base of hard apple cider from cider yeast, Gray Skies' Apple Brandy starts with rum, yeast-fermented apples. “Many distilleries partner with a hard cider company and bring in someone else’s hard cider to distill,” Voorhees said. “We wanted to have full control over the flavors of the finished product and fermented the apple juice ourselves.”  The base cider was distilled twice, then aged in rye whiskey barrels. The company's Cocktail Week GR package with the brandy is $55. Gray Skies Gray Skies Distillery opened its distillery and tasting room this spring. The company has grown its lineup from two spirits to seven, including varieties of gin, vodka, whiskey and rum.  Pat Evans Pat Evans is a Grand Rapids Business Journal staff reporter who covers real estate, construction, architecture and design, retail, beverages, technology and county government.

Yesterday AAPL: 105.71 -2.72 RIP Videos app as Apple replaces it with more capable TV in iOS 10 beta 3 Zac Hall - 24 hours ago @apollozac TV iOS 10.2 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple appears to be retiring the built-in Videos app on iOS in favor of the new TV app coming next month. The behavior is introduced with today’s iOS 10.2 beta 3; iOS 10.2 beta 2 included both apps separately. Apple could still change this behavior in a future version of iOS 10.2, although there isn’t much need for both apps for most users. The change should only be present for iOS 10.2 users in the United States as Apple’s new TV app won’t be available outside of the US at launch. Videos does include some features like Home Sharing that do not yet appear to be available in TV. It’s also unclear how TV will handle home videos which suggest Videos could stick around in future betas. For now, Videos remains available to re-install from the App Store like Apple’s other built-in apps that can be hidden which may be the answer for users looking for these specific features. To be clear, the new behavior going forward appears to be that Videos will be hidden by default in the United States (and where TV becomes available) with users needing to manually enable it going forward. It also likely means the (rather barebones) app won’t receive any major features going forward as attention moves to the TV app. Aside from Home Sharing, the new TV app includes features like loading viewing movies and TV shows purchased from the iTunes Store, synced from iTunes, and via iCloud. TV also includes curated movies and TV shows from various services like HBO, Hulu, Starz, Showtime, and The CW. Apple’s TV app will also work with the upcoming single sign-on feature for jumping to paid video apps from channels like Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, and more.

Yesterday AAPL: 105.71 -2.72 You can now make donations to nonprofit organizations with Apple Pay Zac Hall - 23 hours ago @apollozac Apple Pay View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple Pay is now a payment option when making online donations to several nonprofit organizations. Apple announced that its mobile payment service can be used to donate to over a dozen nonprofits starting today with at least five more groups joining the list soon. “We’re making it incredibly easy to give back with Apple Pay,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay. “Websites and apps tell us they see twice as many people actually completing a purchase with Apple Pay than with other payment methods. We think offering such a simple and secure way to support the incredible work nonprofits do will have a significant impact on the communities they serve.” Apple Pay lets you make payments online securely using tokenization rather than your actual credit card number. Apple Pay on the web is possible for the compatible nonprofit organizations thanks to the new feature joining iOS 10 and macOS Sierra in September. There are some limitations to using Apple Pay for donations for some nonprofits currently. For example, Apple Pay does not support the ability to make your donation reoccurring every month for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. However, the convenience of using Apple Pay is greatly superior (and more secure) than manually entering credit card information so it should encourage one-off donations. Other nonprofits including ‘charity: water’ do allow for monthly donations at checkout so it’s not specifically an Apple Pay limitation as it’s possible. Apple has also partnered with several retailers to promote Apple Pay on the web with special holiday promotions when using the mobile payment service to checkout online. The feature works on iPhone and iPad (where previously specific apps were required to be installed) and on the Mac. Apple’s new MacBook Pros with Touch ID let you use Apple Pay without a second device to authenticate. Apple says these groups currently support donations using Apple Pay: American Red Cross American Heart Association charity: water Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals COPD Foundation Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) Doctors without Borders Feeding America GlobalGiving International Rescue Committee (RED) St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital Save the Children The Nature Conservancy The Water Project UNICEF WNET World Vision WWF (World Wildlife Fund) These five are coming soon: American Cancer Society CARE DonorsChoose.org PBS and its local stations United Way Apple Pay on the web requires the latest software update and Safari.

Blackbaud Nov 14, 2016, 13:00 ET Share this article CHARLESTON, S.C., Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Blackbaud, Inc. (NASDAQ: BLKB), the world's leading cloud software company powering social good, announced today it has added Apple Pay® to Blackbaud Merchant Services™ so its nonprofit customers can offer donors an easy, secure and private option for digital checkout, just in time for holiday giving.  This news comes in conjunction with Apple's announcement that Apple Pay now supports charitable donations, and now Blackbaud has made Apple Pay available as part of its integrated digital payments solution, which already services tens of millions of users for charitable giving.  Blackbaud Merchant Services is an end-to-end payment processing solution designed exclusively for nonprofits. The addition of Apple Pay as a new checkout option within Blackbaud's solution allows nonprofits to offer their donors an easy and secure way to pay -- all within the secure, simple and affordable donation processing system they have come to rely on from Blackbaud.  "At Blackbaud, we're innovating to power every moment that helps nonprofits better understand and engage supporters," said Kevin McDearis, chief products officer at Blackbaud. "This also means building solutions that create frictionless, integrated and secure experiences across devices and platforms to support the work of philanthropy—from cultivation, to fundraising, donation processing and more. Integrating Apple Pay into our digital payments solution is a great example of how we're working to help nonprofits provide their donors with a modern, agile checkout experience that mirrors the convenience and mobility they enjoy as consumers."  Many well-known charities using Blackbaud Merchant Services are already live today with Apple Pay, including American Heart Association, Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), Feeding America, The Nature Conservancy, WNET and World Wildlife Fund (WWF).  "Donor behavior is constantly changing and we want to be able to quickly respond to those changes. Apple Pay lets Feeding America offer our donors a checkout experience that is as easy and fast as the best e-commerce experiences," said Liz Nielsen, senior vice president of Direct Marketing & Digital Engagement at Feeding America. "It is critical that we stay on the front-end of mobile technology if we want to continue to grow support for Feeding America and ultimately get more food to more people facing hunger in our country." Nonprofits have signaled that offering Apple Pay as an option for donors will increase conversion rates from mobile and website visitors, simplify the donation process and reduce the information required for donors to give; potentially even increasing donation frequency as a result.  "We are excited to be among the first nonprofit organizations to offer the ability to donate with Apple Pay," said Michael Osso, president and CEO of Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America. "CCFA has always been on the forefront of technology to ensure a smooth donor experience. Offering fast and convenient technology that enhances our ability to raise crucial funds, especially during the end-of-year giving season, will help us deliver on our mission to improve the lives of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis." David Glass, senior director of online marketing for World Wildlife Fund added, "Giving donors new and simple ways to contribute to World Wildlife Fund's mission to protect the future of nature is critical to our work." Apple Pay is available today for organizations using Blackbaud Merchant Services to process donations in Luminate Online™. In 2017, Blackbaud will expand Apple Pay functionality across the portfolio.

Perhaps more interestingly, the switch to AMD provides expanded external display support that desktop users have patiently waited for. As Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica explains, AMD's Polaris-based Radeon Pro 450, Radeon Pro 455, and built-to-order Radeon Pro 460 GPUs in the new 15-inch MacBook Pro support up to six displays, whereas Intel's integrated GPUs affixed to the logic board can drive a total of three displays. The expanded support enables the new MacBook Pro to drive two of Apple and LG's new UltraFine 5K displays at 60Hz simultaneously. Intel's GPUs can't because, due to bandwidth limitations of the DisplayPort 1.2 spec, the two 5K displays technically function as four displays. This method is known as Multi-Stream Transport (MST). When you hook one of LG's 5K monitors to one of the new MacBook Pros, what you're actually seeing on the screen is two pictures stitched together to make a single seamless image. This is because the version of the DisplayPort spec supported by Intel's GPUs and almost all monitors these days—version 1.2—doesn't have enough bandwidth to drive a 5K display at 60Hz all by itself. […] Apple is actually pushing two DisplayPort 1.2 streams to the monitor over the single Thunderbolt 3 cable. There’s nothing wrong with this method, except that it cuts down on the number of external displays your computer can support. Intel’s integrated GPUs can drive a total of three displays, but you use up two of those three streams to drive one 5K monitor and one of them to drive the laptop’s internal display. AMD’s GPUs support up to six displays, so you can use two of those connections for one 5K monitor, two of them for the other 5K monitor, one for the laptop’s internal display, and still have one left over for yet another monitor if you really wanted to use one.Apple could have used Nvidia's faster Pascal-based GPUs, which support DisplayPort 1.3, but Thunderbolt 3 and most monitors do not support the higher-bandwidth spec yet. In the meantime, Nvidia's GPUs can only drive up to three displays beyond the main MacBook Pro screen — not enough for dual 5K displays over MST. Apple will have more flexibility again when DisplayPort 1.3 becomes more common. Those future laptops will be able to drive two 5K screens plus a laptop’s internal screen using just three DisplayPort streams instead of five. For now, though, if pushing two high-end 5K screens at once was a design goal for Apple, AMD was the only way to go.In terms of performance improvements, Cunningham benchmarked the mid-range 2.7GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro with the Radeon Pro 455 graphics chip to determine just how much faster the notebook truly is compared to the 2016 12-inch MacBook and older MacBook Pros released over the past few years. He found the Radeon Pro 455 to be a "significant boost" over the built-to-order dedicated GPUs available in the 2012-2015 MacBook Pro models, namely the Nvidia GeForce GTX 650M, Nvidia GeForce GTX 750M, and AMD Radeon R9 M370X respectively, but said the new MacBook Pro remains unsuitable for high-end gaming and VR. Is it disappointing that Apple didn’t decide to push the envelope a little more? Sure. Is it too bad that performance and power efficiency were apparently sacrificed in the name of external display support? Yes. Are these midrange GPUs in any way inconsistent with any MacBook Pro released in the last decade? No.Apple officially says the 15-inch MacBook Pro offers up to 130% faster graphics performance, and up to 2.5x more computing power per watt, compared to the previous-generation 15-inch MacBook Pro, but those stats are based on the built-to-order Radeon Pro 460 chip that costs between $100 and $200 extra.

[doublepost=1479149816][/doublepost] How is that perspective? It's a desktop GPU. Unless you're talking about the 1080M, in which case you're looking at a laptop that's only portable on wheels. And just for perspective, the 2012 Cray Titan outFLOPs a dual Xeon workstation. there is no 1080m all current gen laptop have desktop gpu in them. since the 16nm gpu is efficient enough to be not cut back like all the previous gen. so hes not wrong when he say to put in perspective.

Wouldn't Iris Pro graphics be just as fast, if not faster than a Radeon Pro 450 then? Makes me wonder why they'd waste money/battery life on discrete graphics if they don't really provide anything on the base model. Rating: 13 Votes keysofanxiety 23 hours ago at 11:11 am Sorry, I didn't realize that for you a 17" 0.88" thick 4k computer weighing 7.8 pounds was only portable on wheels for you. I thought it was a pretty light and sleek machine for a 17" when I saw it. http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-systems/razer-blade-pro Yeah, that already weighs more than the 2011 17" MBP (6.6 pounds). Let alone thinness and battery life. Great argument. Let me be blunt, since a lot of people really don't understand this: historically, Apple portables have prioritised thinness, battery life, design, performance, and specs. In that order. Nothing is new. Nothing has changed. What you have quoted is the complete antithesis of what an Apple portable is. Windows laptops have always had better specs. Better CPUs, better GPUs, more RAM, bigger screens — this isn't anything new. For what the new rMBP is, which is the best spec/weight/thinness compromise, it again is unmatched in the industry. Part of the trouble with the naysayers is that they completely ignore history. It doesn't much help them if they want to sound like they know what they're talking about. Rating: 13 Votes keysofanxiety 23 hours ago at 10:55 am Just for a little perspective, the GTX 1080 does T-Rex at 1190fps (windows and DirectX). How is that perspective? It's a desktop GPU. Unless you're talking about the 1080M, in which case you're looking at a laptop that's only portable on wheels. And just for perspective, the 2012 Cray Titan outFLOPs a dual Xeon workstation. Rating: 12 Votes theitsage 21 hours ago at 01:17 pm "Up to 2.5x more computing power per watt" is the carefully chosen marketing bs to disguise the overall GPU performance was not a significant improvement. The top of the line GPU in a Late 2016 MBP is slower than a $100 budget GPU RX 460.

Life Buy/Sell U.S. Business AP Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay offer rewards 22 hrs ago (…) NEW YORK (AP) — Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. Apple Pay can speed up transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information. Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid Separately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, redeemable for gift cards and products.

News New Music Culture Features Lists The Archives Share < br />this article: News \ Apple Still Hasn’t Announced When Its Delayed AirPods Will Hit Stores Taylor Berman // November 14, 2016 Share < br />this article: Credit: Stephen Lam/Getty Images Back in September, Apple announced that its AirPods, the wireless ear buds the company designed to accompany its new headphone jack-less iPhone 7, would begin shipping sometime in late October. Halfway through November, AirPods still aren’t in stores, and Apple still hasn’t announced a new shipping date. On October 26, around the time the AirPods were supposed to be hitting stores, an Apple rep told Tech Crunch that “we don’t believe in shipping a product before it’s ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.” As Pitchfork notes, that was the last official update from Apple, though last week MacRumors reported that a note from investment bank Barclays indicates that the Pods are set to begin production in early December. From MacRumours: Barclays said the initial production run will be “fairly small,” totaling between 10 million and 15 million AirPods to start. Depending on demand, the limited supply could result in a scenario where AirPods stock is quickly depleted upon launch, resulting in extended shipping estimates akin to a new iPhone launch. If the Barclays note is true, then the earliest the easily losable $159 cordless headphones could hit stores is just before the holidays, though early January 2017 is more likely.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | November 6, 2016 -- 22:39 GMT (14:39 PST) | Topic: PCs No Apple iPad deals in the Staples Black Friday ad this year. As Black Friday draws within three weeks, the ad leaks are starting to pick up in pace. For tech buyers, the Staples Black Friday ad leak may be the biggest so far, and it provides further evidence of an early trend: It's the latest retailer not to promote any deals on that former Black Friday stalwart -- Apple's iPad tablet. Part of that is due to Apple's stinginess on discounts in general, and part is due to the fading appetite of consumers for new tablets. Nevertheless, Staples still has the most tablet deals we've seen from a Black Friday ad this year, including matching BJ's Wholesale with a $33.33 special on the Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. It goes one better by also having an Amazon Fire HD 8 slate on sale, but this is a case where a little research shows it's not as good a deal as advertised. Staples hypes the sale price of $79.99 as $50, but there are two oddities in the listing. First, Amazon itself lists the price of the Fire HD 8 as $89.99, not the $129.99 regular price Staples is claiming. Even more egregiously, the Fire model shown in the ad has only 8GB of storage, whereas the current base Amazon version comes with 16GB. In other words, Staples is trying to sell an older model with less storage for a mere $10 less than the current version, but touting massive savings. You've been warned. Black Friday 2016 CNET 2016 Holiday Gift Guide Hhgregg ad has 12.9-inch iPad Pro deal Office Depot/OfficeMax ad features $119 Windows 2-in-1 tablet, $169 HP laptop Best Buy ad reveals $100 Windows laptop deal, $125 iPad Air 2, Pro savings Walmart ad features $199 Apple iPad mini 2, $119 Chromebook deals Target ad has iPad Pro for $449, iPad Air 2 for $274 HP ad leaks with PC deals from $250 Staples ad leaks with laptops, tablet deals Costco ad leaks with laptop, desktop, tablet deals Ads for Dell Small Business leak BJ's Wholesale ad features $33.33 Amazon Fire tablet Sam's Club ad leaks with HP laptop, desktop deals Dell's ad leaks with $100 laptop, desktop deals Instead of iPads, the stores with Black Friday ad leaks have thus far listed Samsung Galaxy Tab discounts. Unfortunately for Staples, its specials are undercut by rivals: Its $99.99 price on the 7-inch Tab A is $10 more than in BJ's ad (and BJ's also throws in a 16GB microSD card), while its $129.99 price on the 8-inch Tab A is $10 more than in Costco's ad. Unlike its competitors, however, Staples has a sale on the budget-friendly 7-inch Galaxy Tab E Lite; at $69.99, it's actually $50 off the current price Samsung has on its site. But it's less successful with its $799 Surface Pro 4 pricing, which is $50 more for the same configuration as BJ's (though still $200 less than Microsoft's current price). As with Costco, Staples has a large number of Windows laptop deals for Black Friday, highlighted by a $229.99 HP 15-ay061 with Intel Pentium N3710 CPU, 8GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, and 15.6-inch display. That's $90 less than the current price, not $190 as the ad states. In fact, this is the case with many of the PC sales Staples list: The price currently on its website is already reduced, meaning the savings are less whopping than its ad suggests. While there is no $100 laptop like Dell has for a doorbuster, there are four additional notebook specials for under $300: The Dell Inspiron I5555-0012 (AMD A8 processor, 6GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, 15.6-inch display) for $269.99; a Dell Inspiron (Pentium CPU, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, 11.6-inch display) for $299.99, the HP 15-ay065 (Core i3-5005U, 6GB of RAM, 1TB hard drive, 15.6-inch display) for $299.99, and the Lenovo IdeaPad 100 (also Core i3-5005U, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, 15.6-inch display) for $299.99. In addition to those sales, there are 11 further laptop deals that Staples is advertising: $349.99 -- Dell Inspiron i5559-1350SLV (Core i3/6GB/1TB/15.6-inch) $389.99 -- HP Pavilion 14-al062 (Core i5/12GB/1TB/14-inch) $399.99 -- HP 14-al061nr (Core i3/8GB/1TB/14-inch) $399.99 -- HP 17-x061 (Core i3/8GB/1TB/17.3-inch) $449.99 -- Dell Inspiron 13 I5368-2405GRY (Core i3/8GB/500GB/13.3-inch full HD touchscreen) $449.99 -- Dell Inspiron i5559-3349SLVV (Core i5/8GB/128GB SSD/15.6-inch) $479.99 -- HP Pavilion 15-au062 (Core i5/8GB/1TB/15.6-inch-inch) $499.99 -- HP Pavilion 15-au063 (Core i7/12GB/1TB/14-inch) $499.99 -- Lenovo Flex 4 (Core i5/8GB/256GB SSD/14-inch full HD touchscreen) $599.99 -- Lenovo Ideapad 510 (Core i5/8GB/1TB/15.6-inch full HD) $629.99 -- HP Pavilion x360 15-bk010nr (Core i5/8GB/1TB/15.6-inch full HD touchscreen) There are also a half-dozen desktop deals split between towers and all-in-ones. The tower sales start at $279.99 ($70 less than current price) with the HP Slimline 260-p026, which comes with a Core i3-6100T processor, 8GB of RAM, and terabyte hard drive. Jumping up to $399.99 ($180 off) is the HP Pavilion 510-p026 with Core i5-6400T quad-core CPU, 12 gigs of RAM and 1TB hard drive, while the Dell Inspiron 3650 features a faster Core i5-6400 chip, 8GB of RAM, and 1TB of hard drive space for $449.99 -- though note you can get it for that price right now from Staples. As with the towers, the three all-in-one PC specials comprise a pair of HPs and a Dell. The HP 22-b016, with Intel Pentium processor, 4GB of RAM, terabyte hard drive, and 21.5-inch full HD display, is $299.99, or $80 off the current price, while the Pavilion 24-b016 comes a Core i3-6100T, 8 gigs of memory, 1TB hard drive, and 23.8-inch full HD screen for $449.99, or $50 less than the current price. Finally, the Dell Inspiron 5459 also includes a 23.8-inch display, but adds touchscreen capabilities, along with a Core i5-6400T processor for $699.99, or $200 off the regular price.

The third macOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta is available for download through the Apple Developer Center and through the software update mechanism in the Mac App Store, but the Mac App Store appears to be having trouble updating apps for some people at the moment. macOS Sierra 10.12.2 includes new emoji, introducing Unicode 9 characters like clown face, selfie, face palm, fox face, owl, shark, butterfly, avocado, pancakes, croissant, bacon and more, plus many profession emoji available in both male and female genders. Apple has also updated the artwork on many existing emoji, adding detail and making them look less cartoonish and more realistic. There are few other changes aside from the addition of new emoji, but the 10.12.2 update also likely includes many bug fixes and performance enhancements to address issues that have popped up since the release of macOS Sierra 10.12.1. Available since September, macOS Sierra is the latest Mac operating system. It includes Siri support, Apple Pay for the web, Universal Clipboard, Apple Watch auto unlocking, improved iCloud Drive integration, Picture-in-Picture multitasking, and dozens of smaller features that can be found in our macOS Sierra roundup. Update: macOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta 3 is also available for public beta testers.

The upcoming software update so far has included early hooks for Apple’s new single sign-on feature which lets you authenticate with your cable provider to unlock all compatible paid video apps. tvOS 10.1 is also expected to include Apple’s new TV app when it launches in December. The update follows the feature-packed tvOS 10 update in September, and the minor bug fix release of tvOS 10.0.1 last month. Everything new in tvOS 10: Smarter Siri, dark mode, HomeKit, more tvOS 10.0.1 software update for Apple TV is now available for everyone Aside from recent software updates, Apple also recently introduced a new app for Apple TV called iBooks StoryTime. While Apple introduced its TV app on iPhone and iPad with the second iOS 10.2 developer beta last week, tvOS 10.1 did not include its version of the same TV app at the time. Single sign-on, however, was made available through the Settings app under Accounts for certain service providers. Paid video apps will need to update to take advantage of this feature as Apple adds more service providers before the feature launches next month. We’ll update with any changes discovered in the latest tvOS 10.2 beta below.

Folks enrolled in Apple’s developer program can install the update via the over-the-air mechanism in the Settings app, or from the dev center. Today’s release comes just one week after beta 2, which added Apple’s new TV app. In fact, iOS 10.2 features a lot of new stuff including emoji, wallpapers, settings, and improvements related to Emergency SOS. Apple has also released third betas of macOS 10.12.2 and tvOS 10.1 to developers. These appear to be more maintenance updates, though tvOS 10.1 does add support for Single Sign-on and will likely include new TV app. We’ll update this post if any significant changes are discovered in today’s releases. If you see something new we’ve missed, let us know in the comments below! Update: here are some of the changes spotted in today’s iOS 10.2 beta thus far: SOS feature removed – it looks like Apple has removed the SOS feature in beta 3 that allowed you to call emergency services by pressing the power button. Videos app removed – we saw some instances of Apple hiding the Videos app in beta 2, but it appears much more widespread in beta 3, due to the arrival of the TV app. New features for TV app – in Settings, as with most streaming apps, you can now choose whether to use cellular data for playback or not and the video quality.

Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. Apple Pay can speed transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods. Separately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. Americans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it's not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Designed for the fourth-generation Apple TV, the third tvOS 10.1 beta can be obtained by connecting the Apple TV to a computer with a USB-C to USB-A cable, downloading and installing the software from a registered developer account via iTunes or Apple Configurator. Once a beta profile has been installed on the device through iTunes, new beta updates will be available over the air. Many Apple TV owners are eagerly awaiting a promised Single Sign-On feature that will allow Apple TV users to sign in once with their cable credentials to access all available live cable content, and the feature was introduced in the first tvOS 10.1 beta. The new "TV" app that was announced at Apple's October 27 event was not included in the first two tvOS 10.1 betas, but it was introduced on iOS devices in the second iOS 10.2 beta, suggesting it could come to tvOS users soon. "TV" is meant to be a TV guide-style app that provides users with recommendations on what to watch and an easy way to discover new television content. tvOS 10, for those unfamiliar with the operating system, brings features like improved search, expanded Siri capabilities, a dark mode, a Continuity option for using the iPhone for text input, automatic app downloads, quicker access to live TV, and more. Update: Some users are having difficulty downloading the update, as their systems are reporting that an update is available but are stuck waiting to connect to the update server to download.

I don't game much on it, but I use it hours a day to browse. I see no need for this. Just charge it overnight when it gets to 20%. Exactly my point. Rating: 1 Votes RadioGaGa1984 16 hours ago at 06:13 pm I wonder if the newly released USBC-Lightning cable will let people "finally" charge their Siri Remotes directly from their TV. Not something that appeals to me (I have several Lightning-equipped chargers already in the living room), but many were asking and/or complaining about this early on in the life of the ATV4. TBT the only reason people were wanting and complaining about it, was most likely just due to the fact it couldn't be done. While in reality they would never actually use that solution.

Fortunately, Apple has already confirmed many apps that will get support for Touch Bar, the new contextually sensitive touchscreen panel embedded into the MacBook Pro’s keyboard, and many others app developers are announcing updates.  Head below for the full list. There are a handful of apps that you can already use with Touch Bar, and many more that are scheduled to get support in update’s coming this month and in the months to come. Some utilize quick shortcut buttons, sliders and other functions depending on the task you’re performing, while others, like password manager 1Password, tap into the Touch ID fingerprint sensor for authentication too.  We’ve noted expected release timeframes for apps that have specified and we’ll add more as developers announce support.

Customers should be receiving their notebooks early this week. So how does the flagship Touch Bar work in the real world? And does Apple’s hardware upgrades warrant a price hike? Fortunately, most enjoyed the Touch Bar saying that it has potential when more developers get on board. However, when it comes to overall performance and battery life, it seems like a mixed bag. Here are some reviews: WSJ A Touch Bar, Touch ID and new design are tempting, but you’ll get the same performance and battery with the older model… So how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the “old” MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I’m doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out. The Verge (Walt Mossberg) The new 13” MacBooks — even the base model without the Touch Bar — are costly. And they may make pros unhappy. But, for everyday Mac lovers — users of the Air or maybe the older low-end Pro — they are now your only thin, modern, option with a full-fledged processor. The Touch Bar has potential, but it’s not magic. The battery isn’t likely to deliver on Apple’s claims. You can’t count on liking the keyboard. But, if you’re a Mac devotee ready to move past the Air — not back to a lower-powered MacBook — this is what Apple is offering. Take it or leave it. Engadget Touch ID and a thinner design are nice, but give me back my ports. (And my Function keys.)… I’m one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn’t quite what I wanted. For me, the ideal MacBook Pro is actually a mashup between this and last year’s model. Mashable Apple will never wins awards for affordability. This 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, Core i5 system starts at $1,799 — $300 more than the entry-level, traditional function-key sporting MacBook Pro. There are cheaper Windows 10 systems out there that offer better specs and full touchscreens. A 13-inch Core i7 HP Spectre x360, for instance, lists for $1,149.99 (the Mac offers slightly better graphics, an Intel HD Graphics 550 as opposed to the 520). If, however, you are a Mac fan, this is an excellent upgrade with a fascinating and highly extensible new Touch Bar.

Strategy Analytics Nov 14, 2016, 12:00 ET Share this article BOSTON, Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The increased reliance on mobile LBS continues to be fueled by mobility apps which enable taxi-hailing, car-sharing, and car-pooling, in addition to the integration of multimodal routing in popular mobile map applications like Apple Maps, Google Maps and HERE WeGo, according to Strategy Analytics' Wireless Media Strategies (WMS) report "Mobile LBS: Status Check & Platform Assessment." In emerging markets the growth of mobile LBS is being boosted by a growing penetration of GPS on lower priced handset tiers. Furthermore, for the third year running, location platform HERE has come top in Strategy Analytics' location platform benchmark study, and is placed well for future growth opportunities as the mobile location services market continues to evolve. Click here for the report:  http://sa-link.cc/MobileLBS Continue Reading Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161114/438754 Rising adoption of smartphone-centric mobility apps, including Uber, Lyft, and Didi, among others, and the meteoric rise of the location-based augmented reality game, Pokémon Go, have provided a welcome boost to the mobile LBS sector during 2016. Nitesh Patel, Director, Strategy Analytics noted "Mobile location services are benefitting from the shift in demand for urban transport towards on-demand, mobile-centric services, where the smartphone plays an increasingly important role for both journey planning and the administration of these services. Ride-hailing and car-sharing will be further boosted by their integration into major mobile journey planning applications, such as Apple Maps, Google Maps and HERE WeGo, which are evolving into one-stop-shops for journey planning and support."   The report assesses the strengths and weaknesses of global LBS players, Apple, Google, HERE, and TomTom, across eight important metrics, including map and navigation coverage, indoor venue capabilities, reach across major mobile device platforms, map data visualization, in-vehicle connectivity, offline usage, local search and crowd sourcing. The race to provide the most fresh, up-to-date and accurate maps in real-time is being driven by a combination of the trend towards autonomous driving, and greater consumer dependence on smartphones for journey planning and execution in outdoor, and increasingly indoor environments. David Kerr, Senior Vice President at Strategy Analytics, noted "For the third year in the row HERE has maintained its leadership in mapping and location capabilities, followed by Google, TomTom and then Apple. HERE's ownership by car-makers enables it to leverage its strength in the automotive industry across all digital platforms, including mobile. Google maintains its leadership in business –to-consumer (B2C) LBS applications, as it benefits from preloading on most Android handsets, and is the most widely used map, navigation and local search app. Both Apple and TomTom remain in catch-up mode with TomTom aiming to improve its support of multi-modal routing and navigation, including ramping its coverage of indoor venues in 2017."

Apple is realigning its familiar laptop line, dramatically reshaping and in some ways merging the favorite options for both heavy-duty “pro” users and everyday customers. And the poster child for this more muddled future is the pricey new MacBook Pro, which appears in stores this week. Apple wants you to focus on the new Pro’s boldest feature, called the Touch Bar. It’s a touch-operated strip of buttons and sliders displayed on a thin screen at the top of the keyboard that changes functions depending on what you’re doing. It injects a bit of iPhone and iPad feel into the Mac. And it’s well worth noting. But, the bigger story here to me is that the Pro, once mainly aimed straight at people who do especially taxing work like professional video editing or serious design, is now being stretched to suit a much larger audience. That’s especially true of the 13-inch model (there’s also a 15-inch variety). It’s thinner and lighter, and is the only modern, easily portable Mac laptop with both a high-res Retina display and a relatively recent, first-class processor (the sixth generation Core i5 or i7). So, I’ve been testing the 13-inch Touch Bar-equipped Pro for about 10 days, looking at it from the point of view of mainstream users, not pros. Mainstream Mac lovers must assess whether the Pro, now much thinner and lighter, is a good replacement for the brilliant MacBook Air, which Apple will still sell (starting at $999) but which has apparently been consigned to Cupertino’s special purgatory for products it can’t quite kill yet, but won’t upgrade. Apple The Air was the best laptop ever built, in my opinion, but it was never given a high-res Retina display and has fallen behind in processor technology. And Apple’s other Mac laptop, the much newer 12-inch MacBook, while beautiful and portable, has a weak processor, a small screen, a single port and a high base price of $1,299. The new Pro definitely trounces my three-year-old MacBook Air in power and screen quality. Running the normal set of apps and browser tabs I use every day, my old Air blasts its fans a lot to keep up. The Touch Bar Pro barely notices. But, I have reservations, and you should too. Many pro users are already vocally complaining about issues particular to them. But, even for mainstream Mac users, there are questions about price, ports, the Touch Bar feature, the keyboard and — surprisingly, for a Mac — battery life. The Verge The Basics This new 13-inch Pro comes in two flavors. One, the base model, costs less (it starts at $1,499) but lacks the Touch Bar and Touch ID, the fingerprint-scanner which can be used to log in to the computer and to make online purchases. Instead, it has a standard, but severely squished, row of function keys. The 13-inch Touch Bar model starts at $1,799 but can be configured to more robust specs that bring it to $2,899. The 15-inch model, which isn’t the focus of this review, starts at $2,399. Design A big part of what makes the Pro double as a successor to the Air is that it has been made much thinner and lighter, even at the cost of enraging some pros, whose favorite ports may have been ditched because they took up too much room. The new 13-inch Pro is now 12 percent thinner than the Air, and weighs the same three pounds. It’s as if Apple had shrunk the 13-inch Air, kept the same screen size, added Retina, upgraded the processor and added the Touch Bar and Touch ID. The screen is just fabulous, even better than the previous 13-inch Pro’s Retina display. And way better than the display on the Air. The keyboard isn’t anything like the old Air’s or Pro’s. It’s a revised version of the flat, limited-travel keyboard introduced on the MacBook. I hated the first one on the smaller computer, yet I like this second generation just fine. For me, it took no time at all to get used to. It’s clicky and responsive. I suspect you’ll like it. But keyboards are a personal thing, so I urge you to try it in a store before ordering. Battery Life The biggest surprise in my tests was just how inconsistent the Touch Bar Pro’s battery life was. I have tested hundreds of laptops over the years and Macs have almost always excelled at meeting or beating their promised battery lives, both in my longtime battery test regime and in typical daily use. But the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar wasn’t as reliably consistent as previous Macs. On my rigorous test, which I’ve used for years, the machine actually exceeded Apple’s claim of up to 10 hours of battery life. The test involves setting the screen at 100 percent, keeping it on and undimmed constantly, playing an endless loop of music, and leaving Wi-Fi on to collect email, tweets and Facebook posts in the background. Result: 11 hours and 38 minutes. Normally, that battery test is an understatement, because people typically do let the screen go dark periodically and they don’t use it at 100 percent brightness. But, in this case, after hearing that a colleague was seeing much lower results in general use, I ran a second test with all of Apple’s default energy-saving settings on, the screen at 75 percent and a perfectly normal (for me) mix of tasks like web browsing, email, a few short videos, Twitter, Facebook, some light writing and Slack. The Pro died at eight hours and 22 minutes. To make things worse, Apple’s built-in prediction of how much time the battery had left before dying fluctuated a lot and was mostly wrong (Apple says this is a known problem caused by the fact that modern processors can power up and down rapidly over a much wider range than in the past, making estimates much more difficult). So, my best advice is that even a mainstream, non-pro user can’t count on this laptop lasting the promised maximum of 10 hours — even in light to moderate use — let alone the 12-hour maximum a new Air can pull off. And you won’t have an accurate estimate to go by. The Touch Bar The big innovation Apple touts for the new Pro is the Touch Bar. Some regard it as Apple’s lame substitute for the full touchscreen it refuses to install in the Mac. But I see it as an effort to replace the keyboard’s ancient function row with a bit of the touchscreen simplicity that’s the magic behind iOS. (The function keys, like brightness and volume, are still there, in virtual form, but they temporarily contract when an app displays its customized keys and sliders.) And, yes, there’s still an Escape key, but it’s virtual. For pros, the Touch Bar holds promise as a quick way to scroll through photos, or audio wave forms, or video frames, or color choices. The trouble is that, right now, I don’t think it does much for mainstream users. For instance, in Safari and Photos, it presents thumbnails of open tabs and photos that are so tiny you can barely recognize them. You mainly just scroll through them. Apple In Safari, a Touch Bar button allows you to quickly open a new tab. Another starts a search. In Mail, you can do things like start a new message, reply to one, or trash one. None of this is very exciting or creative, especially since you have a gigantic, buttery-smooth Trackpad below the keyboard. You can’t even use the Touch Bar in Apple Mail to move to the next unread message or jump back to the top of a list. The single most useful feature of the Touch Bar, in my view, is that it provides a home for predictive text selections and emojis when you are writing in almost any app or web page that permits text entry. This includes Apple’s word processors, Microsoft Office (coming), Facebook, Messages and more. It’s kind of like a wedding of iPhone and Mac text entry, and I like it. (If you don’t, you can ignore it.) Apple Alas, although I wrote this whole column on a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I couldn’t use this predictive text feature because I was writing in Google Docs running in a Safari tab. That’s right: While text entry in any number of web pages works with the Touch Bar, it fails with one of the world’s most widely used web apps. An Apple official said, “Google Docs uses a different model of text entry from the standard text entry used by most websites. This affects the functionality of Touch Bar features. We are working with Google to support these features.” I don’t think the Touch Bar is a gimmick, but I don’t think it changes much, at least yet, for everyday Mac users. Luckily, third party app developers can design ways to use it, and users can customize it to some extent. So it may have a more productive future. But, right now, it’s unlikely to improve most users’ lives dramatically when working on their laptops. Ports The new MacBook Pros dispense with traditional SD card, USB and long-standard video connectors. Even the genius, breakaway MagSafe power connector is gone. In their place are simply four of the new USB-C ports, which also work with Thunderbolt 3. These connectors are fast and highly versatile. They can be used for charging, data transfer, video output and more. And they are likely the future. But you’ll need to buy dongles (adapters) to connect them to most monitors, external storage and flash memory cards. The Verge I fully understand the outrage over this switch from people who make their living on current MacBook Pros and legacy peripherals, like monitors or external storage, and from photographers and editors who rely on flash memory cards. Nobody likes dongles or adapters, and some brands are unreliable or unsafe. Apple slashed its adapter prices temporarily in the wake of the complaints. But I honestly don’t think this is a big problem for average Mac users, whose main need will likely be a new Mac-to-iPhone cable ($19 from Apple). And I believe that, over time, most peripherals will switch to USB-C, since other companies — not just Apple — are behind it. Price For everyday Mac users especially, the new Pro is a costly machine. Even the non-Touch Bar model is $500 more than the Air (at $999) and the cheapest Touch Bar edition is $300 more than that. But Apple has always been a premium PC maker, and its new models have often started off at sky-high prices. People forget that, when it debuted in 2008, the MacBook Air with the then-revolutionary, but puny, 64 gigabyte solid-state drive cost a breathtaking $3,100. You can get a terabyte of solid-state storage in the costliest 13-inch new model, and pay less. If you’re a mainstream Mac lover who isn’t bothered by its limitations, you can save money with the 12-inch MacBook, or even buy a new Air, if it works well for you. Or, if those MacBook Pro prices are too high for you and your current Mac is doing okay, you could wait for them to come down next year. Bottom line The new 13-inch MacBooks — even the base model without the Touch Bar — are costly. And they may make pro users unhappy. But, for everyday Mac lovers — users of the Air or maybe the older low-end Pro — they are now your only thin, modern option with a full-fledged processor. The Touch Bar has potential, but it’s not magic. The battery isn’t likely to deliver on Apple’s claims. You can’t count on liking the keyboard. But, if you’re a Mac devotee ready to move past the Air — not back to a lower-powered MacBook — this is what Apple is offering. Take it or leave it.

Technology Trump, China's Xi Talk Trade; But Apple, Boeing Warned President-elect Trump's stance on China's currency could hurt Apple and Boeing, says a report by a state-run China media outlet. (AP) REINHARDT KRAUSE 11/14/2016 Reprints A Chinese state-run newspaper has warned that companies such as Apple (AAPL) and Boeing (BA) would be the first to be punished if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand China a currency manipulator. During his election campaign, Trump also spoke of a 45% import tariff on all Chinese goods. The communist-party controlled newspaper, Global Times, is not as well known as China's People's Daily or Xinhua News. "If Trump wrecks Sino-U.S. trade, a number of U.S. industries will be impaired," the newspaper said in an unsigned editorial. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S." IBD'S TAKE: Apple and the so-called FANG internet giants — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet  — have not joined in the postelection stock rally, while bank, drug, defense and basic material stocks have gained. See how some are doing at IBD Stock Checkup. Boeing recently received a $3.2 billion order for twelve 787 Dreamliners from China Southern Airlines. Amid tougher competition from local smartphone makers, Apple's revenue from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan fell 30% in fiscal Q4 to $8.8 billion. The Global Times editorial was published shortly after Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping by telephone on Monday. Xi told Trump that cooperation was the only correct choice for ties between the world's two largest economies, said a Bloomberg report. Xi and Trump agreed to meet soon, according to state broadcaster China Central TV. "China and the U.S. -- as the world's biggest developing country and the biggest developed country, and the top two global economies — need to and can cooperate on many issues," Xi said, according to CCTV. "At this moment, there is an important opportunity and massive potential for China-U.S. cooperation so that both sides need to strengthen coordination." Alibaba (BABA) Vice Chairman Joe Tsai last week said Trump would run a risk by harming China relations, the Wall Street Journal reported. "China is going to be and already is the source of consumer demand and the source of capital for America," Tsai reportedly said at an event to kick off the company's big Singles Day event on Friday. "So if you're the American president, you have to pay a lot of attention to that because your job is to create a lot of jobs in American society. "And if you don't have Chinese consumers being engaged and buying American products, and Chinese investors can't invest in the United States, and create more American jobs, then you'd be in trouble." Apple shares closed down 2.5% in the stock market today, though they did find support at their 200-day line intraday. Boeing stock, though, climbed 1% to 149.99.

"China will take a tit-for-tat approach" if Trump were to declare China a currency manipulator -- as Trump claimed he could do -- the Global Times wrote in the column. "US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted." The Global Times is a subsidiary of People's Daily, a newspaper group owned by the ruling Communist Party of China. Apple was contacted for comment but did not immediately respond. Related stories Trump's win reveals social media's blind spot What does a Trump presidency mean for tech? Trump says he intends to be 'very restrained' on Twitter Apple has had a tough enough time in China as it is. Despite investing heavily in the populous nation, its growth has dramatically slowed. Sales in the second calendar quarter in the Greater China region plummeted 33 percent year over year, shifting it from Apple's second-biggest market to third place, now behind both the US and Europe. The company has done much to win favor with China's people and government including investing $1 billion in ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, known as the Uber of China, and earlier this year debuting the smaller, cheaper iPhone SE. Despite this, Apple has faced trouble in China, including the shuttering of services and lots of legal drama. Responding to Trump's statement that he "liked" the idea of a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports, the publication noted: "Not long after Barack Obama took office, US trade and commerce authorities announced a 35 percent import tariff on Chinese tires. In response, China took retaliatory steps of imposing tariffs on US chicken and automotive products. Both China and the US suffered losses as a result."

E.S.T. Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story BEIJING — Asian stocks were mostly lower Tuesday as expectations of a U.S. rate hike boosted the dollar and investors watched President-elect Donald Trump for signs of policy direction. KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent to 3,204.31 points and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 was flat at 17,670.77. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 tumbled 0.5 percent to 5,320.60 and Seoul's Kospi was almost unchanged at 1,974.27. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.4 percent to 22,314.62. Benchmarks in Southeast Asia and New Zealand were mixed. WALL STREET: Tech companies including Apple and Microsoft took big losses on concern Trump's policies might hurt their sales in China and other global markets. Bank stocks surged as bond yields rose, which allows them to make more money from lending. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. RISING DOLLAR: The dollar climbed as high as 108.30 yen from Monday's 107.87 yen as expectations of a U.S. rate hike rose. Trump's surprise election initially raised expectations the Federal Reserve might put off a rate hike until his plans were clear. But analysts say the latest comments from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan indicate the Fed is sticking to plans to act in December. "There appears no stopping the U.S. dollar's recent ascent based on the current interest rate trajectory," Stephen Innes of OANDA said in a report. TRUMP WATCH: Investors were watching for signs of what Trump, who gave few details of his plans on the campaign trail, might do in office. Analysts say his promises of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending could boost economic growth but also spur inflation. His threats of sanctions against China and other trading partners that he accuses of acting unfairly have rattled trade-dependent Asian economies. ANALYST'S TAKE: "Moving forward, the spotlight could shine on the contentious trade policy proposals that the president-elect had raised during his campaign," said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. "The latest soundbite from outgoing President Barack Obama seems to suggest that the incoming president is 'ultimately pragmatic'," said Pan. "It is without a doubt that emerging Asian markets would be negatively impacted should a trade war break out between US and China, although the delayed address could mean that the President-elect may indeed be more pragmatic than we have known."

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile This 13-Port Thunderbolt 3 Dock Brings Back ‘Pro’ in 2016 MacBook Pro By Uzair Ghani Posted 1 day ago 12Shares Share Tweet Submit Four USB-C ports, no USB-A and sans SD card slot. The new 2016 MacBook Pro doesn’t sound like a ‘Pro’ notebook for many. But you can regain all your lost ports (and more) with a single dock from OWC. OWC’s 13-Port Thunderbolt 3 Dock Brings Back Everything You Lost & Adds a Lot More to 2016 MacBook Pro When it comes to adapting new technologies, Apple goes all-out with its final decision. Rather than making a smooth transition to USB-C while keeping a couple of USB-A ports in place, the Cupertino giant ditched the latter completely in favor of the former with the new MacBook Pro. This essentially means you will need a dongle or two if you’re going to use your existing devices with the new notebook. But the story doesn’t end there either – Apple axed the SD card reader on 2016 MacBook Pro as well. The reason for this is rather mind boggling, but Apple still went ahead with it. But worry not, OWC has you well covered with their new Thunderbolt 3 Dock. See, there are a lot of docks you can purchase that will, in some way, fulfill your needs one way or the other. But what OWC is offering is completely off the scale. It features 13 ports. Yes, that’s thirteen! Not only you regain the ports which Apple axed with the release of new MacBook Pro, you gain a ton of them as well. So what exactly can you expect in terms of ports once you get your hands on the new Thunderbolt 3 Dock? Here’s the complete rundown: Advertisement 2 Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C ports. 5 USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports. 2 ports dedicated to charging devices faster. FireWire 800 port. Gigabit Ethernet port. Mini DisplayPort. SD Card reader. Audio combo port for headphones and microphone. S/PDIF digital audio port. Here's Everything We Expect to See at Apple's October 27 Event Those are a lot of ports if you’re asking us. But if you want something absolutely overkill, then OWC has you covered. The good news is that the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock will be available to pre-order right now from MacSales, with the accessory shipping out in February 2017. The dock even comes with a free 0.5 meter long Thunderbolt 3 40Gb/s USB-C cable, which in itself is valued at $24.95. The overall pricing of the dock might put off a lot of people though. It will cost $279, which is very, very steep. But if you look past that price and think for a moment what you’re getting in return, the value isn’t that bad either. And in the long run, this dock will serve its purpose quite well. Essentially, it’s an accessory that puts to shame every other dongle and cable which you might need to carry around.

Apple is realigning its familiar laptop line, dramatically reshaping and in some ways merging the favorite options for both heavy-duty “pro” users and everyday customers. And the poster child for this more muddled future is the pricey new MacBook Pro, which appears in stores this week. Apple wants you to focus on the new Pro’s boldest feature, called the Touch Bar. It’s a touch-operated strip of buttons and sliders displayed on a thin screen at the top of the keyboard that changes functions depending on what you’re doing. It injects a bit of iPhone and iPad feel into the Mac. And it’s well worth noting. But, the bigger story here to me is that the Pro, once mainly aimed straight at people who do especially taxing work like professional video editing or serious design, is now being stretched to suit a much larger audience. That’s especially true of the 13-inch model (there’s also a 15-inch variety). It’s thinner and lighter, and is the only modern, easily portable Mac laptop with both a high-res Retina display and a relatively recent, first-class processor (the sixth generation Core i5 or i7). So, I’ve been testing the 13-inch Touch Bar-equipped Pro for about 10 days, looking at it from the point of view of mainstream users, not pros. Mainstream Mac lovers must assess whether the Pro, now much thinner and lighter, is a good replacement for the brilliant MacBook Air, which Apple will still sell (starting at $999) but which has apparently been consigned to Cupertino’s special purgatory for products it can’t quite kill yet, but won’t upgrade. Apple The Air was the best laptop ever built, in my opinion, but it was never given a high-res Retina display and has fallen behind in processor technology. And Apple’s other Mac laptop, the much newer 12-inch MacBook, while beautiful and portable, has a weak processor, a small screen, a single port and a high base price of $1,299. The new Pro definitely trounces my three-year-old MacBook Air in power and screen quality. Running the normal set of apps and browser tabs I use every day, my old Air blasts its fans a lot to keep up. The Touch Bar Pro barely notices. But, I have reservations, and you should too. Many pro users are already vocally complaining about issues particular to them. But, even for mainstream Mac users, there are questions about price, ports, the Touch Bar feature, the keyboard and — surprisingly, for a Mac — battery life. The Verge The Basics This new 13-inch Pro comes in two flavors. One, the base model, costs less (it starts at $1,499) but lacks the Touch Bar and Touch ID, the fingerprint-scanner which can be used to log in to the computer and to make online purchases. Instead, it has a standard, but severely squished, row of function keys. The 13-inch Touch Bar model starts at $1,799 but can be configured to more robust specs that bring it to $2,899. The 15-inch model, which isn’t the focus of this review, starts at $2,399. Design A big part of what makes the Pro double as a successor to the Air is that it has been made much thinner and lighter, even at the cost of enraging some pros, whose favorite ports may have been ditched because they took up too much room. The new 13-inch Pro is now 12 percent thinner than the Air, and weighs the same three pounds. It’s as if Apple had shrunk the 13-inch Air, kept the same screen size, added Retina, upgraded the processor and added the Touch Bar and Touch ID. The screen is just fabulous, even better than the previous 13-inch Pro’s Retina display. And way better than the display on the Air. The keyboard isn’t anything like the old Air’s or Pro’s. It’s a revised version of the flat, limited-travel keyboard introduced on the MacBook. I hated the first one on the smaller computer, yet I like this second generation just fine. For me, it took no time at all to get used to. It’s clicky and responsive. I suspect you’ll like it. But keyboards are a personal thing, so I urge you to try it in a store before ordering. Battery Life The biggest surprise in my tests was just how inconsistent the Touch Bar Pro’s battery life was. I have tested hundreds of laptops over the years and Macs have almost always excelled at meeting or beating their promised battery lives, both in my longtime battery test regime and in typical daily use. But the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar wasn’t as reliably consistent as previous Macs. On my rigorous test, which I’ve used for years, the machine actually exceeded Apple’s claim of up to 10 hours of battery life. The test involves setting the screen at 100 percent, keeping it on and undimmed constantly, playing an endless loop of music, and leaving Wi-Fi on to collect email, tweets and Facebook posts in the background. Result: 11 hours and 38 minutes. Normally, that battery test is an understatement, because people typically do let the screen go dark periodically and they don’t use it at 100 percent brightness. But, in this case, after hearing that a colleague was seeing much lower results in general use, I ran a second test with all of Apple’s default energy-saving settings on, the screen at 75 percent and a perfectly normal (for me) mix of tasks like web browsing, email, a few short videos, Twitter, Facebook, some light writing and Slack. The Pro died at eight hours and 22 minutes. To make things worse, Apple’s built-in prediction of how much time the battery had left before dying fluctuated a lot and was mostly wrong (Apple says this is a known problem caused by the fact that modern processors can power up and down rapidly over a much wider range than in the past, making estimates much more difficult). So, my best advice is that even a mainstream, non-pro user can’t count on this laptop lasting the promised maximum of 10 hours — even in light to moderate use — let alone the 12-hour maximum a new Air can pull off. And you won’t have an accurate estimate to go by. The Touch Bar The big innovation Apple touts for the new Pro is the Touch Bar. Some regard it as Apple’s lame substitute for the full touchscreen it refuses to install in the Mac. But I see it as an effort to replace the keyboard’s ancient function row with a bit of the touchscreen simplicity that’s the magic behind iOS. (The function keys, like brightness and volume, are still there, in virtual form, but they temporarily contract when an app displays its customized keys and sliders.) And, yes, there’s still an Escape key, but it’s virtual. For pros, the Touch Bar holds promise as a quick way to scroll through photos, or audio wave forms, or video frames, or color choices. The trouble is that, right now, I don’t think it does much for mainstream users. For instance, in Safari and Photos, it presents thumbnails of open tabs and photos that are so tiny you can barely recognize them. You mainly just scroll through them. Apple In Safari, a Touch Bar button allows you to quickly open a new tab. Another starts a search. In Mail, you can do things like start a new message, reply to one, or trash one. None of this is very exciting or creative, especially since you have a gigantic, buttery-smooth Trackpad below the keyboard. You can’t even use the Touch Bar in Apple Mail to move to the next unread message or jump back to the top of a list. The single most useful feature of the Touch Bar, in my view, is that it provides a home for predictive text selections and emojis when you are writing in almost any app or web page that permits text entry. This includes Apple’s word processors, Microsoft Office (coming), Facebook, Messages and more. It’s kind of like a wedding of iPhone and Mac text entry, and I like it. (If you don’t, you can ignore it.) Apple Alas, although I wrote this whole column on a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I couldn’t use this predictive text feature because I was writing in Google Docs running in a Safari tab. That’s right: While text entry in any number of web pages works with the Touch Bar, it fails with one of the world’s most widely used web apps. An Apple official said, “Google Docs uses a different model of text entry from the standard text entry used by most websites. This affects the functionality of Touch Bar features. We are working with Google to support these features.” I don’t think the Touch Bar is a gimmick, but I don’t think it changes much, at least yet, for everyday Mac users. Luckily, third party app developers can design ways to use it, and users can customize it to some extent. So it may have a more productive future. But, right now, it’s unlikely to improve most users’ lives dramatically when working on their laptops. Ports The new MacBook Pros dispense with traditional SD card, USB and long-standard video connectors. Even the genius, breakaway MagSafe power connector is gone. In their place are simply four of the new USB-C ports, which also work with Thunderbolt 3. These connectors are fast and highly versatile. They can be used for charging, data transfer, video output and more. And they are likely the future. But you’ll need to buy dongles (adapters) to connect them to most monitors, external storage and flash memory cards. The Verge I fully understand the outrage over this switch from people who make their living on current MacBook Pros and legacy peripherals, like monitors or external storage, and from photographers and editors who rely on flash memory cards. Nobody likes dongles or adapters, and some brands are unreliable or unsafe. Apple slashed its adapter prices temporarily in the wake of the complaints. But I honestly don’t think this is a big problem for average Mac users, whose main need will likely be a new Mac-to-iPhone cable ($19 from Apple). And I believe that, over time, most peripherals will switch to USB-C, since other companies — not just Apple — are behind it. Price For everyday Mac users especially, the new Pro is a costly machine. Even the non-Touch Bar model is $500 more than the Air (at $999) and the cheapest Touch Bar edition is $300 more than that. But Apple has always been a premium PC maker, and its new models have often started off at sky-high prices. People forget that, when it debuted in 2008, the MacBook Air with the then-revolutionary, but puny, 64 gigabyte solid-state drive cost a breathtaking $3,100. You can get a terabyte of solid-state storage in the costliest 13-inch new model, and pay less. If you’re a mainstream Mac lover who isn’t bothered by its limitations, you can save money with the 12-inch MacBook, or even buy a new Air, if it works well for you. Or, if those MacBook Pro prices are too high for you and your current Mac is doing okay, you could wait for them to come down next year. Bottom line The new 13-inch MacBooks — even the base model without the Touch Bar — are costly. And they may make pro users unhappy. But, for everyday Mac lovers — users of the Air or maybe the older low-end Pro — they are now your only thin, modern option with a full-fledged processor. The Touch Bar has potential, but it’s not magic. The battery isn’t likely to deliver on Apple’s claims. You can’t count on liking the keyboard. But, if you’re a Mac devotee ready to move past the Air — not back to a lower-powered MacBook — this is what Apple is offering. Take it or leave it.

All Rights Reserved. Home Apple News Monday, November 14th, 2016 MacBook Pro Touch Bar review roundup – Not as cool as everyone originally thought Kevin Raposo 1 day ago MacBook Pro Touch Bar / Image: iMore Share to Facebook Share to Twitter A ton of reviews were just published for Apple’s new MacBook Pro laptop featuring its new Touch Bar. Here’s what the critics have to say about it. The new MacBook Pro is finally here. Well, at least one of them. The other, which features Apple’s latest innovation, the Touch Bar, is making its review rounds at some of the biggest tech publications and we rounded up their thoughts into one quick digestible post. Here’s some highlights from the reviews around the web for the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar. The Verge When it comes to reviewing Apple products, The Verge is one of the best at it. Their previous review of the latest MacBook Pro dived deep into the hardware and performance. This review is mostly dedicated to the Touch Bar: The good news is that the Touch Bar’s interface is all software. It can be updated and refined and improved. I suspect it’ll take a little while before Apple and third-party developers find the best use for each of their specific apps, but I hope they’ll learn quickly that there’s a fine line between presenting helpful options and overwhelming their users. Apple and developers will also have to decide who the Touch Bar is for: pros or amateurs. Many of us are already familiar with keyboard shortcuts in the apps we’re using, and so far I’ve found that forcing myself to use the Touch Bar tends to slow me down. The Wall Street Journal When it comes to recommending the new MBP to new or existing potential buyers, Joanna Stern cuts straight to the point: So how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the “old” MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I’m doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out. CNNMoney A lot of people are planning to purchase the new MBP just because of the new Touch Bar, however, Samantha Murphy Kelly has some wise words to potential buyers: Overall, the latest version of the MacBook Pro is all about the Touch Bar. Is the novel concept reason enough to purchase the new MacBook Pro? No. But it’s a sweet bonus to arguably the best performing laptop on the market. If you’re debating whether the extra $300 for the Touch Bar and TouchID is worth it, it depends what kind of user you are. Sure, both features are handy, but they’re more of a bonus than a necessity. The pricier model will also give you a faster processor and two more Thunderbolt ports (a plus if you need to connect to more displays). Then again, if these qualifications aren’t appealing and you’re not doing a ton of intensive work, such as video or photo editing, you’re probably better off with a cheaper MacBook Air. Engadget Dana Wollman is someone who’s been waiting to upgrade to a new MacBook Pro for quite some time. Unfortunately, this new laptop isn’t what she was hoping for: I’m one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn’t quite what I wanted. For me, the ideal MacBook Pro is actually a mashup between this and last year’s model. Let me keep my full-size USB ports, and my function keys, and my longer battery life, but stick with this thinner and lighter design. Stick with this improved display, Touch ID sensor, fast disk performance and more robust audio quality. For me, this is both a step forward and a step backward. SlashGear If you’re a performance hog, Chris Davies of SlashGear recommends waiting another year: I can’t help but imagine a 2017 MacBook Pro with Kaby Lake processors and several months of developers getting to grips with the potential of Touch ID and the Touch Bar. As it stands today, though, the dongle frustration and the fact that you really need to pay $1799 or more – the entry-level 13-inch misses out too much, in my opinion, to be worth considering – are outweighed by the improvements in graphics, the excellent build quality, and the promise its unique hardware coupled with macOS represents. Gizmodo Christana Warren doesn’t hold back when calling the new Touch Bar a gimmick. Actually, she goes in hard on it: In the end, real story with the MacBook Pro is the Touch Bar. It’s somewhat useful, but it’s still so undersupported for apps beyond Apple’s that, at least for right now, the Touch Bar is not reason enough to get a new MacBook Pro. Particularly if you’re already satisfied with the performance of your existing machine. If you need a new MacBook Pro and you can’t wait for the Kaby Lake refreshes already rumored, the benefits of the internal specs matched with the cool-factor of the Touch Bar make this a good Mac. For everyone else this is a gimmick on a very good, way too expensive laptop. Mashable In Lance Ulanoff’s review, it essentially all comes down to price: Apple will never win awards for affordability. This 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, Core i5 system starts at $1,799 — $300 more than the entry-level, traditional function-key sporting MacBook Pro. There are cheaper Windows 10 systems out there that offer better specs and full touchscreens. A 13-inch Core i7 HP Spectre x360, for instance, lists for $1,149.99 (the Mac offers slightly better graphics, an Intel HD Graphics 550 as opposed to the 520). If, however, you are a Mac fan, this is an excellent upgrade with a fascinating and highly extensible new Touch Bar There’s a ton of reviews out there and we’ll be updating this post as they come in. If you’re not keen on coming back, a simple Goole search should suffice as well. Leave a comment!

Apple is bringing forth some sweet deals ahead of Black Friday trying to convince people to buy as many of these devices as possible because it’s a full blown out shopping season and this is excellent for OEMs. Most of these deals ahead of Black Friday are refurbished devices, but they’re still great if you want something cheap. A lot of people don’t care about these sort of deals mainly because they involve refurbished devices. We’ve got a MacBook Pro deal coming straight from Apple, and the tech company is offering it for merely $1,099 each from the original price of $1,299. The MacBook Air is another problem which goes for $929 from the original $999, so it’s another significant deal. Keep in mind that although they’re refurbished this doesn’t mean much because they’re not damaged in any way, they usually might have a few scratches, but they work amazingly well. Apple Pre-Black Friday Deals Before Black Friday 2016 Apple has more good deals in store for you. They’ve got the iPad Air 2 going for $319/$379/$419 from the original prices of $429/$489/$529; this is the 16 GB/ 64 GB and 128 GB versions of the Wi-Fi and Cellular versions of the tablet. Now last but not least we have the iPhone 7 which is getting a substantial reduction as well. Refurbished iPhone 7 devices go for around $529 and $589 depending on storage option which is great. Check out all these deals if you have an Apple device in mind because it’s worth it.

(Photo : ToyLab101 / Youtube) Apple is definitely up to something big as they prepare for the upcoming release of not one but three new iPad models. The technology giant is about to reveal the latest innovation of the iconic iPad, and release a model which will feature the largest screen in Apple history. Advertisement Express says Apple's iPad series has been left-out as the technology giant focused on the development and marketing of its iPhones and MacBooks. But for a company made famous by its brilliant innovations, it seems like Apple has a game plan. We may recall Parent Herald's article on the rumored specs and updates of the upcoming iPad Mini 5. Rumors now claim that Apple is about to relaunch the iPad Pro series in the most incredible built ever. Three new iPad models, each piece remodeled to feature the latest innovations in the iPad history. Apple's new iPad line-up includes three models with unique and innovative features. Speculations claim that the first model will be Apple's biggest iPad yet, which will come with an enormous 12.9 inches display. The largest iPad will be backed up by two other straightforward iPad Pro models which will come in a 9.7 inches and 10.9 inches respectively. The 10.9 inch-model is rumored to launch Apple's bezel-free feature where the iPad's screen entirely takes over the front display. With the bezel-free design of Apple, the 10.9-inch model will level with the physical measures of the existing current generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro models. Rumors drop even more interesting updates on Apple's new toys. Upgrades include the installation of quad microphones which will give the iPads a major sound quality boost. Also, the new iPads will retain the 3.5mm headphone jacks that were removed from the latest iPhone installment. Speculations further claim that the new iPad models will feature Apple's latest technologies that were patented early in 2015. These include ultrasonic imaging that is more advanced than the current fingerprint sensors. Stay updated for more news on Apple's latest iPads.

More than just technology news Home Tech Reviews Science Games Culture Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Updated Hot Tags Pokemon Go Apple Pokemon Go Update Science Donald Trump Is Apple's iPhone 8 Going To Be A Really Amazing Device? Victor Thomson First Posted: Nov 14, 2016 02:44 AM EST Over the past months many rumors have already accumulated, suggesting that the iPhone 8 expected to be released next year will be a really amazing device. Credit:ZONEofTECH / YouTube In the second half of 2017, Apple is anticipated to launch its 10th anniversary edition iPhone 8. Online emerging rumors related to the smartphone have suggested that this will be a really amazing device. iPhone 8 Anniversary Edition According to Value Walk, next year will mark ten years since the tech giant Apple launched its first iPhone. Because of that anniversary, there are high expectations surrounding the upcoming iPhone 8. According to tech experts, this next generation iPhone will be a game changer, implementing technology that will disrupt the smartphone scene forever. However, right now all of these speculations about the iPhone 8 are unsubstantiated rumors and the company did not confirm them yet. With the iPhone 8, Apple is expected to deliver something really special that will mark the 10th anniversary in style and will surprise the market. But the high-tech giant is facing a lot of competition from rival companies. All these brand names have something to prove. Among them is Samsung that needs to produce something spectacular to overcome its image crisis due to the failure of the Note 7. Wireless Charging Technology According to a report published by Pocket-lint, one of Apple's main production partners, Foxconn, has been working on wireless charging modules. Among the latest buzz related to the upcoming iPhone 8 is a claim that the next generation mobile device will support wireless charging technology, according to Tech Times. Apple is rumored to implement a new module into the upcoming iPhone 8 that will connect to a transmitter plugged into a wall outlet. The iPhone 8 will be able to charge via wireless charging as long as it's within 15 feet of the transmitter, according to PhoneArena. For this new technology, Apple is reportedly partnering with Energous, the company behind WattUp. The wireless charging technology that will be implemented by Apple in its iPhone 8 is reportedly far more than the traditional charging mats available today. WattUp is an upcoming wireless charging technology that works based on deployed radio frequencies. The WattUp system uses a Power Router that emanates energy by using radio frequency signals. This signal can be transformed into power able to charge batteries that have a WattUp receiver. OLED display Up to now, Apple has been using LCD panels in its iPhone lineup, but many reports suggest that the high-tech company will be switching to OLED into its upcoming iPhone 8. In fact, Apple already uses OLED displays in its Apple Watch and the new MacBook Pro's Touch Bar. A report published by AppleInsider suggests that Apple made a deal with Samsung to have the South Korean company supply OLED panels for the iPhone 8. Advanced biometrics Ming-chi Kuo, a well-known analyst at KGI Securities claims that the iPhone 8 could benefit from a suite of biometric sensors. They could include tightened security, such as iris scanning and facial recognition. However, MacRumors has added some doubt to the iris scanning feature by publishing an article that explains this tech may not be ready until 2018. 10-nanometer A11 chip According to reports, apparently, TSMC has already started the production of the A11 chip for Apple. The mobile processor is based on a 10-nanometer technology and tech experts expect that Apple will use it in its upcoming iPhone 8. It is believed that TSMC has secured all the required orders for the A11 chip and in the first quarter of 2017 they will be sent to Apple for validation.

In emerging markets the growth of mobile LBS is being boosted by a growing penetration of GPS on lower priced handset tiers. Furthermore, for the third year running, location platform HERE has come top in Strategy Analytics' location platform benchmark study, and is placed well for future growth opportunities as the mobile location services market continues to evolve. Click here for the report:  http://sa-link.cc/MobileLBS Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161114/438754 Rising adoption of smartphone-centric mobility apps, including Uber, Lyft, and Didi, among others, and the meteoric rise of the location-based augmented reality game, Pokémon Go, have provided a welcome boost to the mobile LBS sector during 2016. Nitesh Patel, Director, Strategy Analytics noted "Mobile location services are benefitting from the shift in demand for urban transport towards on-demand, mobile-centric services, where the smartphone plays an increasingly important role for both journey planning and the administration of these services. Ride-hailing and car-sharing will be further boosted by their integration into major mobile journey planning applications, such as Apple Maps, Google Maps and HERE WeGo, which are evolving into one-stop-shops for journey planning and support."   The report assesses the strengths and weaknesses of global LBS players, Apple, Google, HERE, and TomTom, across eight important metrics, including map and navigation coverage, indoor venue capabilities, reach across major mobile device platforms, map data visualization, in-vehicle connectivity, offline usage, local search and crowd sourcing. The race to provide the most fresh, up-to-date and accurate maps in real-time is being driven by a combination of the trend towards autonomous driving, and greater consumer dependence on smartphones for journey planning and execution in outdoor, and increasingly indoor environments. David Kerr, Senior Vice President at Strategy Analytics, noted "For the third year in the row HERE has maintained its leadership in mapping and location capabilities, followed by Google, TomTom and then Apple. HERE's ownership by car-makers enables it to leverage its strength in the automotive industry across all digital platforms, including mobile. Google maintains its leadership in business –to-consumer (B2C) LBS applications, as it benefits from preloading on most Android handsets, and is the most widely used map, navigation and local search app. Both Apple and TomTom remain in catch-up mode with TomTom aiming to improve its support of multi-modal routing and navigation, including ramping its coverage of indoor venues in 2017."

Image 1 of 2 · Next Image… By ANICK JESDANUN, AP Technology Writer Tags: Lenovo, Apple, PC industry Can the venerable laptop keyboard get more touchy-feely — and in a good way? We're about to find out. Higher-end models of Apple's MacBook Pro now come with a narrow touch screen above the regular keyboard for quick access to common settings and tasks, while Lenovo's Yoga Book laptop loses the physical keyboard entirely. The traditional keyboard has never struck me as needing much improvement, although people who've grown up on touch screens might well feel differently. These touch innovations, in fact, may mostly be aimed at luring such users to laptops. So how do the new touch features improve typing and computing? TOUCH SCREENS, NOT KEYBOARDS Many Windows laptops and tablets with physical keyboard accessories have long had touch screens. You still type primarily on a traditional keyboard, but you can poke screen icons and menus directly with your finger instead of navigating with a mouse or trackpad. This can be useful for basic tasks such as opening apps, moving the cursor to the search bar and rebooting the machine. But when fixing typos in documents, selecting email to delete and even editing photos, my trackpad is generally more precise than my fat fingers on the screen. A stylus helps, but I'm prone to misplacing it. It's also generally faster to just keep your fingers on the keys. TOUCH KEYS Largely for these reasons, Apple has shunned touch screens on its notebooks. But its high-end MacBooks are getting a separate, narrow strip that replaces the top row of function keys you'll find on most keyboards. This Touch Bar offers the same functions, but instead of hitting F11 or F12 to change volume, for instance, you tap the speaker icon to bring up a volume slider. You can fix up to four icons in place; the initial defaults are brightness, volume, mute and the Siri voice assistant. The rest of the strip changes based on context. When you're using the Safari browser, for instance, you typically get thumbnails of individual tabs for easy switching between websites. But that changes to play and pause if you're watching Netflix, while your name and address pop up as choices when filling out online forms. Apple's Maps app offers one-touch access to nearby businesses or directions. Mail and Messages offer auto-complete suggestions as you type, plus a button for emojis, similar to what you'd find on iPhones and iPads. You get touch access to system controls, such as "cancel" and "save," so you don't have to move your cursor. Third-party apps can add their own functionality, too, though the ones I use regularly have yet to do so. HABITS AND DISCOVERIES The new volume and brightness sliders are much easier to use than tapping the appropriate function key multiple times to get the level I want. In Photos, I can scroll through my library more quickly than using arrow keys. And the Touch Bar does make it easy to include emojis in messages. Because I use it frequently, I made the screenshot function a default icon. No more opening Grab, navigating a menu and returning to the window I'm trying to preserve. I've also discovered functions I never knew existed, such as the ability to highlight text in Preview with different colors. This may matter less if, like me, you're a pretty good typist with a command of keyboard shortcuts. The Touch Bar will be more useful for those who look down at the keys when typing. One suggestion: The mute icon stays the same regardless of whether the Mac is already on mute. How about a distinct icon to unmute, now that the options are dynamic? FINGERPRINTS The Mac now turns on automatically when you open the lid. In place of a power button is a fingerprint scanner, similar to what's found on mobile devices. You still have to type in my password occasionally as a security measure, but you can avoid doing so most of the time when resuming a session or installing new software. People sharing a computer can instantly switch profiles with their own fingerprints. WHAT ELSE The MacBook Pro has a larger trackpad and is lighter and thinner than previous models, thanks in part to shorter keys that don't feel awkward. You no longer get regular USB ports or an SD memory card slot for photos. That means buying adapters to connect older printers, scanners and your iPhone to the new USB-C ports. On the plus side, you can now connect the power charger on either side, depending on where the outlet is. And the MacBook retains a headphone jack, something the latest iPhones dropped. If you don't need the Touch Bar or the fingerprint scanner, you can save $300 with an entry-level MacBook Pro, but it is slower and has ports only on one side. The Touch Bar models start at about $1,800 for a 13-inch screen and $2,400 for 15 inches. DISAPPEARING KEYBOARD Meanwhile, the 10-inch Yoga Book (about $500 for Android, $600 for Windows) retains the clamshell design of a laptop but has a second touch screen where the keyboard normally goes. Unlike pop-up touch keyboard in tablets, this one doesn't block the main display as you type. Without physical keys, the device is just 0.38 inch thick, or about two-thirds the thickness of the new MacBooks. The Yoga provides both tactile and audio feedback when you hit the keys, although it's still easy to miss the ones you're aiming for. It takes longer to type because of all the typos, which gets annoying very quickly. You would think that with a touch keyboard, the Yoga could reconfigure the keys to toggle between upper and lower cases and switch languages, much the way a touch keyboard on a phone or tablet does on the screen. But the keys themselves always appear in standard English and in upper case, even when you're typing in Thai. Call it a missed opportunity. An Australian startup called Sonder is already planning to ship such a keyboard for $199 this year, but who wants to carry around an extra accessory? If it makes it onto a future laptop, it could mark a true revolution that goes well beyond the minor changes the Touch Bar and the second touch screen offer.

In emerging markets the growth of mobile LBS is being boosted by a growing penetration of GPS on lower priced handset tiers. Furthermore, for the third year running, location platform HERE has come top in Strategy Analytics' location platform benchmark study, and is placed well for future growth opportunities as the mobile location services market continues to evolve. Click here for the report:  http://sa-link.cc/MobileLBS Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161114/438754 Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130207/NE56457LOGO-b Rising adoption of smartphone-centric mobility apps, including Uber, Lyft, and Didi, among others, and the meteoric rise of the location-based augmented reality game, Pokémon Go, have provided a welcome boost to the mobile LBS sector during 2016. Nitesh Patel, Director, Strategy Analytics noted "Mobile location services are benefitting from the shift in demand for urban transport towards on-demand, mobile-centric services, where the smartphone plays an increasingly important role for both journey planning and the administration of these services. Ride-hailing and car-sharing will be further boosted by their integration into major mobile journey planning applications, such as Apple Maps, Google Maps and HERE WeGo, which are evolving into one-stop-shops for journey planning and support."   The report assesses the strengths and weaknesses of global LBS players, Apple, Google, HERE, and TomTom, across eight important metrics, including map and navigation coverage, indoor venue capabilities, reach across major mobile device platforms, map data visualization, in-vehicle connectivity, offline usage, local search and crowd sourcing. The race to provide the most fresh, up-to-date and accurate maps in real-time is being driven by a combination of the trend towards autonomous driving, and greater consumer dependence on smartphones for journey planning and execution in outdoor, and increasingly indoor environments. David Kerr, Senior Vice President at Strategy Analytics, noted "For the third year in the row HERE has maintained its leadership in mapping and location capabilities, followed by Google, TomTom and then Apple. HERE's ownership by car-makers enables it to leverage its strength in the automotive industry across all digital platforms, including mobile. Google maintains its leadership in business –to-consumer (B2C) LBS applications, as it benefits from preloading on most Android handsets, and is the most widely used map, navigation and local search app. Both Apple and TomTom remain in catch-up mode with TomTom aiming to improve its support of multi-modal routing and navigation, including ramping its coverage of indoor venues in 2017."

Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Facebook Twitter RSS Navigate Home News Opinion Regions World Sports Business Special Features SPECIAL REPORTS The Sunday Times You are at:Home»Business»New Parkinson’s treatment device approved by FDA CONTROLLED BY IPHONE OR IPAD New Parkinson’s treatment device approved by FDA 0 By BEN KRITZ, TMT on November 15, 2016 Business Tweet US-based medical device manufacturer St. Jude Medical has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Infinity Deep Brain Stimulator (DBS), a device for the treatment of tremors associated with Parkinson’s Disease, and which can be controlled using an Apple phone or tablet, the company announced in a press release. The device uses electrical current to stimulate areas of the brain to counteract the tremors caused by the deterioration of the nervous system that is characteristic of Parkinson’s. The Infinity device, St. Jude Medical said, has two essential features that are firsts for FDA approval. The first is the use of “directional leads,” which allow doctors to “steer” current to different parts of the brain, tailoring treatment to reduce side effects. The second feature is that the system is designed so that Apple mobile devices can be used as wireless controllers, via a Bluetooth connection; St. Jude claims the system as the only upgradeable DBS platform for movement disorders. Patients using the Infinity system can link it to Apple’s iPod Touch; physicians can program the device using the Apple iPad Mini, according to the company. Dr. Kelly Foote of the University of Florida Center for Movement Disorders & Neurorestoration performed the first Infinity implantation in the US at the UF Health Shands Hospital, St. Jude said. “I’m very happy that the Infinity DBS system and its directional DBS lead are now available in the U.S. I believe that the directional lead represents an important advancement in DBS technology that has the potential to improve outcomes of DBS therapy for many patients. This new system offers the potential to diminish adverse effects of DBS by steering current away from areas of the brain that cause side effects, allowing us to better control the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor,” Foote said in remarks included in the company press statement. “The St. Jude Medical Infinity DBS system and directional lead represent St. Jude Medical’s commitment to the treatment of debilitating movement disorders,” added St. Jude neuromodulation medical director Dr. Allen Burton. “The new St. Jude Medical Infinity system was designed to streamline therapy programming, allowing physicians more time to provide care to more patients. The system was also designed to provide patients with the best possible experience to manage their symptoms in a discreet manner that fits more easily into their lives.” The Infinity system with its directional leads was approved in June for use in Europe, after winning CE Mark approval in the European Union in September 2015, the company said. St. Jude said the device is currently available in ‘select’ international markets, with more countries expected to approve the system next year. Share.

The South Korean company is making its largest-ever overseas acquisition with an offer for Harman International Industries Inc., angling to become the go-to supplier of everything from in-car entertainment to connected-auto services. It comes days after Samsung Group heir-apparent Jay Y. Lee formally ascended to the board of the electronics firm, a move that may shore up his influence over the family-run conglomerate’s prized asset. Jay Y. Lee Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Adding U.S.-based Harman will lift Samsung into the top ranks of auto technology suppliers and give it existing relationships with BMW AG, Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. While Harman became a legendary name in high-end audio equipment, it’s pushed deeper into automotive supplies and now gets 65 percent of sales from the sector. Samsung’s $112-a-share offer was 28 percent above Harman’s closing price of $87.65 in New York on Friday. Harman surged 26 percent to $110 at 11:37 a.m. Monday. With the deal, Samsung hope to marry its fast microprocessor and software technology with Harman’s infotainment and vehicle systems to offer carmakers more advanced connectivity, said Young Sohn, Samsung’s president and chief strategy officer, in a phone interview. “This is not about cost synergies,” Young said. “It’s about taking advantage of what Harman has built. The car will be transformed by connected technology.” The deal is the first since Jay Y. Lee joined the board and shows that his management style is different from his father’s, said Park Kang-ho, an analyst with Daishin Securities Co. “He is an aggressive deal maker,” the analyst said. “In the longer term, Samsung is thinking that life after smartphones is electric vehicles.” The Korean company joins a growing list of global technology companies moving into automobiles. The companies see cars as an industry that hasn’t yet been remade by software and online technologies. Outside of Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors Inc., the efforts haven’t yet reached customers. Google has for years been working on self-driving software but still doesn’t have a product on the market. Apple went on a hiring spree to add staff to build its own car before recently re-calibrating the initiative to focus more on software, leading to job cuts. Uber Technologies Inc. joined the fray over the past year, hiring engineers and making acquisitions to build its own autonomous car technology.  Samsung itself has bought a stake in Chinese electric-car maker BYD Co. and at one point considered an offer for sections of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s parts unit, a deal said to have broken down just weeks ago. With the Harman purchase, it’s taking a different approach that’s more in keeping with its history has a component maker. Rather than designing a car or building a self-driving system, Harman’s technology focuses on the growing number of services available as automobiles get connected to the internet -- navigation, multimedia entertainment, security systems and analytics tools. Sohn reiterated the company’s focus on a conference call Monday. “Samsung will not get in the business of manufacturing cars," Sohn said, while highlighting how the partnership will increase connectivity and introduce new Internet of Things technologies into vehicles. This transformation of the auto into a full-service mobile device adds up to a potential goldmine. Revenue from the data streams and connectivity components could become a 180 billion-euro ($200 billion) market by 2020, McKinsey & Co. estimates. “Samsung may have figured that it can’t become the biggest player in the car component business by itself, so it needs a big brand to get into the market,” said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co.  Read more: Samsung amplifies its auto ambitions Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter For Samsung, establishing a foothold in automotive technology offers the company a chance to shed its reliance on a smartphone market undergoing its worst downturn on record. The company is the world’s biggest supplier of displays and memory for mobile devices -- replicating that dominance in autos will inject new life into the business. It’s now struggling to put the embarrassing death of the fire-prone Note 7 behind it, while searching for its next leg of growth. Samsung said Harman is the market leader in connected car solutions, with more than 30 million vehicles equipped with its connected car and audio systems and telematics. Telematic devices allow in-vehicle access to specific services, including car parks and anti-theft security. The Stamford, Connecticut-based company has an order backlog for the auto market of $24 billion as of June 30. “Harman has a scale and premium in the car-infotainment and audio businesses, so it would definitely help Samsung move faster. But it alone is not enough for Samsung to become the leader in this space,” said Roh. The audio company can trace its roots back to the 1950s, when Sidney Harman teamed with Bernard Kardon to make high-fidelity machines. The company would later acquire brands including JBL and Infinity, among other audio equipment makers, and become a leader in high-end car stereo systems. It also owns the Bang & Olufsen brand for cars after acquiring the business last year. Evercore is serving as financial adviser to Samsung, while JPMorgan and Lazard are advising Harman, according to the statement. Shares of Samsung fell 2.8 percent to 1,553,000 won at the close in Seoul before the announcement was made.  “Harman perfectly complements Samsung in terms of technologies, products and solutions, and joining forces is a natural extension of the automotive strategy we have been pursuing for some time,” Vice Chairman Kwon Oh-hyun said in the statement. “Harman immediately establishes a strong foundation for Samsung to grow our automotive platform.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Products Support Blog Store About Us « Automatic Window Tabbing Introducing Touché November 14th, 2016 When Apple announced the new MacBook Pros, featuring a hardware Touch Bar above the keyboard, I was immediately intrigued. Apple provided a “simulator” to developers, so they can get a sense for how the Touch Bar works, and test their own apps with the Touch Bar, without having to buy a new MacBook Pro. The simulator is cool, but I immediately noticed a few shortcomings: You have to download Xcode to use it. It’s cumbersome to activate and deactivate. Taking screenshots of the Touch Bar is awkward. Touché is my answer to those shortcomings. If you’re an everyday user who just wants to play around with the Touch Bar concept, a developer who wants a an easy way to toggle the virtual Touch Bar off and on, or a designer who needs to share screenshots from the Touch Bar frequently, then I think you’re going to love Touché. Touché is free for all to download and use. I hope you like it. This entry was posted to Red Sweater News, Touché. Feel free to leave a response in the comments area below. Thanks for reading! 7 Responses to “Introducing Touché” Rick Truell Says: November 14th, 2016 at 10:58 pm In case you weren’t aware, Touché got a mention today on Apple World Today ( https://www.appleworld.today/blog/2016/11/14/touch-brings-a-touch-bar-to-any-mac ). Sadly, I suspect that, like me, you’ll experience a little déjà vu when you read the blog post :-( Daniel Jalkut Says: November 14th, 2016 at 11:18 pm Thanks, Rick! That is a little disappointing that they didn’t make more of an effort to differentiate between their original writing and mine. Dave Says: November 15th, 2016 at 2:26 am Just wanted to let you know Appleinsider.com also gave you a mention today. Bill Cheeseman Says: November 15th, 2016 at 8:00 am I just received my new 15-inch Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro. It turns out that Touché actually helps me to remain aware of what is showing on the physical Touch Bar. You could give Touché real usability by making it slide down off the screen when I mouse over it, so that I can still reach onscreen objects that are behind it. The fact that Touché lets me click its touch bar buttons with the mouse is the ultimate irony! — but, since clicking it goes against the expected use of the physical Touch Bar, maybe you should require the Option key be held down to stop Touché from sliding off the screen during mouse-over. Daniel Jalkut Says: November 15th, 2016 at 8:51 am Dave – thanks for the note about AppleInsider.com Bill Cheeseman – that’s an interesting point! I definitely hadn’t thought too much about the possibility utility of the app a Mac with a bona fide Touch bar. I think that the sliding behavior you describe would ONLY be appropriate on such a machine (otherwise there is no way to actually interact with the UI). I’m not 100% sure I can tell whether there is a Touch Bar on the current Mac, or not. I’ll have to consider that, and whether I could make the behavior hinge on that. Or perhaps it should just be a preference toggle and users can opt into that. Mike Says: November 15th, 2016 at 8:56 am I have installed 10.12.1 on MacBook 1″ Retina Mid-2012, but got “Touch Bar Not Supported” message. Daniel Jalkut Says: November 15th, 2016 at 9:04 am Mike it’s important to click the More Info button and read the explanation there. This is an unusual confusion caused by Apple’s decision to ship two releases with the same 10.12.1 version number.

In addition, it decided to end the 11-inch MacBook Air series and to simply move forward with the unchanged 13-inch MacBook Air. What’s worse is that the 13-inch Air now internally competes with the MacBook Pro without Touch Bar for market attention. If you are wondering which Apple laptop is better between the two, this comparison review can help you decide. Performance On paper, the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar easily trumps the 13-inch MacBook Air because the former comes with either a 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor or a 2.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost technology that can speed up the cores for up to 3.4GHz. On the other hand, the the 13-inch MacBook Air only comes with either a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor or a 2.2GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor. When Turbo Boost kicks in, the Air’s cores can speed up to 3.2GHz. Both have 8GB of RAM, so the two devices are expected to do well in handling multiple tasks. When it comes to their tested performance, their Geekbench ratings also show the significant difference on the performance they can deliver. The Core i5 MacBook Air has a single-core score of 2624 and a multi-core score of 5210, while the Core i7 got 3019 and 6320, respectively. Contrariwise, the new MacBook Pro with Core i5 processor has a 3600 single-core score and a 6998 multi-core score. The Core i7 variant, meanwhile, scored 3817 and 7501 for the single-core and multi-core benchmarking tests. In spite of its impressive scores, however, 9To5Mac says those who are planning to buy the MacBook Pro sans Touch Bar should not expect for it to impeccably perform at high speeds for an extended amount of time because of its power-sipping 15W TDP. Display The Cupertino giant is clearly stepping up its display game with its new laptops. Apple lists on its official site the differences between the display technology present on the two laptops. The 13-inch MacBook Air continues to sport the relatively dated LED-backlit Widescreen display with 1440 x 900 screen resolution. It has 300 nits brightness and standard color gamut. On the contrary, the MacBook Pro comes with Retina display that has 2560 x 1600 screen resolution, 500 nits brightness and wide color gamut.  Notebook Check confirmed early November that the new MacBook Pro does have improved brightness. The computer review site even pointed out that the results of its tests showed that the new laptop has over 600 nits brightness at the center of the display panel, but the luminance slightly dropped toward the edges of the screen. Nevertheless, the distribution of brightness is considered remarkable at 89 percent. Notebook Check also claimed that the luminance of the new MacBook Pro’s display stands out among many other devices on the market, with the Dell XPS 13 9360 being the only one to beat the MacBook Pro in terms of contrast ratio.  According to 9To5Mac, the 2016 MacBook Pro is the first laptop from the Cupertino giant to feature wide color display, which it first introduced on the 5K iMac. This advanced display technology is said to give off more vibrant greens and reds, so images appear more real. This is very evident when the new MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air are placed side by side. Without a high-resolution display, the MacBook Air readily falls behind the new MacBook Pro.  Design Just like what previous rumors claimed before Apple’s Oct. 27 launch event, the new MacBooks are redesigned iterations of the Cupertino giant’s famous laptop series. The MacBook Pro without Touch Bar is no exception, since it sports a thinner body and a smaller form. Its chassis even looks like a combination of the 12-inch Retina MacBook and the previous version of the MacBook Pro. It does not have the tapered front like the Air series, so it’s thicker at the front. But at their thickest points, it’s easy to see that the new MacBook Air is the thinner device.  Although both laptops sport 13-inch screens, the MacBook Pro manages to afford a smaller form factor because of the thinner bezels surrounding its display. The commendable thing about the smaller frame of the device is it still managed to feature a full-size keyboard and loud speakers on either side. Speaking of keyboard, it is important to note that the new MacBook Pro comes with Apple’s improved butterfly switches, so the typing experience is improved and more satisfying than with the 12-inch MacBook that debuted with the original butterfly key switches. Each key in the new MacBook Pro also has its own LED, so backlight bleeds are very minimal. The new MacBook Pro sports a larger Force Touch trackpad. Force Touch means the trackpad does not function through a mechanical button anymore. It simply has this force-sensitive technology to identify touch commands and it utilizes haptics and sound to produce clicks that may seem real to the user. Unfortunately, the MacBook Air still has a Multi-Touch trackpad, so clicking anywhere on the trackpad does not feel the same as when pressing the Force Touch trackpad. The main advantage of the latter — aside from saving component space underneath — is how clicks feel the same throughout the entire trackpad. This then allows users to register clicks on any part of the trackpad.  Special Features The new MacBook Pro comes with Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports. These ports are fast, reliable and quite versatile. They can be used for data transfer, charging, video output and other functions for different peripherals. Because the Thunderbolt 3 port is highly versatile, Apple designed its new MacBook Pro to come with only this type of port. Thus, users would need to buy dongles if they need to connect their laptop to monitors, or use external storage and flash memory cards. For consumers who still prefer the traditional ports, the MacBook Air features two USB 3 ports, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, a MagSafe 2 power port and an SDXC card slot.  To state the obvious, the MacBook Air has a glowing Apple logo — the one that was considered the trademark of previous-generation MacBook devices. Given that the new MacBook Pro is excessively thin, it wasn’t possible for Apple to include the glowing Apple logo on its back. Instead, the new MacBooks sport a color-matched inset logo. Since it lacks the trademark glowing logo, however, Apple decided to give the new MacBook Pro a new color variant. So instead of just seeing Silver MacBook Pros in Apple stores, there will be Space Gray units for those who want a premium Apple laptop with a different color. Miscellaneous  Related Stories No Apple AirPods In 2016, Analysts Say Apple To Launch 3 iPads In March 2017 Apple Rolls Out Apple Support App For iOS Storage space for the 13-inch MacBook Air starts at 128GB and can go up to 512GB SSD. As for the MacBook Pro without Touch Bar, its storage option starts at 256GB and can go as high as 1TB of SSD. At this point, it is important to note that the SSD module of the new MacBook Pro is removable, so users can still upgrade it after purchase. MacRumors pointed out in late October that with the smaller form factor of the new MacBook Pro, it seemed impossible for it to come with removable SSD just like the previous models.  The 13-inch MacBook Air is powered by a 54 watt-hour lithium-polymer battery that lasts up to 12 hours of iTunes movie playback on paper. The MacBook Pro, on the contrary, has an 54.5 watt-hour lithium polymer battery that is expected to last for up to 10 hours of iTunes movie playback. However, The Verge’s executive editor Walt Mossberg claims there really isn’t an accurate estimate to go by when it comes to the longevity of both laptops. In fact, when he tested the new MacBook Pro, it only managed to stay on for 8 hours and 22 minutes before totally running out of battery.  In terms of pricing, the 13-inch MacBook Air with 128GB SSD sells for $999, while the 256GB SSD variant is priced at $1,199. The new MacBook Pro without Touch Bar, on the other hand, comes with a $1,499 price tag — more affordable than the base model of the Touch Bar version that starts at $1,799. For Mashable, however, the price of the MacBook Pro sans Touch Bar is too much considering it does not feature the advanced OLED strip, has less processing power than the Touch Bar variant and it doesn’t have Touch ID as well.  Which do you think is the better Apple laptop between the 13-inch MacBook Air and the new MacBook Pro without Touch Bar?

Higher-end models of Apple’s MacBook Pro now come with a narrow touch screen above the regular keyboard for quick access to common settings and tasks. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Can the venerable laptop keyboard get more touchy-feely — and in a good way? We’re about to find out. Higher-end models of Apple’s MacBook Pro now come with a narrow touch screen above the regular keyboard for quick access to common settings and tasks, while Lenovo’s Yoga Book laptop loses the physical keyboard entirely. The traditional keyboard has never struck me as needing much improvement, although people who’ve grown up on touch screens might well feel differently. These touch innovations, in fact, may mostly be aimed at luring such users to laptops. So how do the new touch features improve typing and computing? ___ TOUCH SCREENS, NOT KEYBOARDS Many Windows laptops and tablets with physical keyboard accessories have long had touch screens. You still type primarily on a traditional keyboard, but you can poke screen icons and menus directly with your finger instead of navigating with a mouse or trackpad. This can be useful for basic tasks such as opening apps, moving the cursor to the search bar and rebooting the machine. But when fixing typos in documents, selecting email to delete and even editing photos, my trackpad is generally more precise than my fat fingers on the screen. A stylus helps, but I’m prone to misplacing it. It’s also generally faster to just keep your fingers on the keys. ___ TOUCH KEYS Largely for these reasons, Apple has shunned touch screens on its notebooks. But its high-end MacBooks are getting a separate, narrow strip that replaces the top row of function keys you’ll find on most keyboards. This Touch Bar offers the same functions, but instead of hitting F11 or F12 to change volume, for instance, you tap the speaker icon to bring up a volume slider. You can fix up to four icons in place; the initial defaults are brightness, volume, mute and the Siri voice assistant. The rest of the strip changes based on context. When you’re using the Safari browser, for instance, you typically get thumbnails of individual tabs for easy switching between websites. But that changes to play and pause if you’re watching Netflix, while your name and address pop up as choices when filling out online forms. Apple’s Maps app offers one-touch access to nearby businesses or directions. Mail and Messages offer auto-complete suggestions as you type, plus a button for emojis, similar to what you’d find on iPhones and iPads. You get touch access to system controls, such as “cancel” and “save,” so you don’t have to move your cursor. Third-party apps can add their own functionality, too, though the ones I use regularly have yet to do so. ___ HABITS AND DISCOVERIES The new volume and brightness sliders are much easier to use than tapping the appropriate function key multiple times to get the level I want. In Photos, I can scroll through my library more quickly than using arrow keys. And the Touch Bar does make it easy to include emojis in messages. Because I use it frequently, I made the screenshot function a default icon. No more opening Grab, navigating a menu and returning to the window I’m trying to preserve. I’ve also discovered functions I never knew existed, such as the ability to highlight text in Preview with different colors. This may matter less if, like me, you’re a pretty good typist with a command of keyboard shortcuts. The Touch Bar will be more useful for those who look down at the keys when typing. One suggestion: The mute icon stays the same regardless of whether the Mac is already on mute. How about a distinct icon to unmute, now that the options are dynamic? ___ FINGERPRINTS The Mac now turns on automatically when you open the lid. In place of a power button is a fingerprint scanner, similar to what’s found on mobile devices. You still have to type in my password occasionally as a security measure, but you can avoid doing so most of the time when resuming a session or installing new software. People sharing a computer can instantly switch profiles with their own fingerprints. ___ WHAT ELSE The MacBook Pro has a larger trackpad and is lighter and thinner than previous models, thanks in part to shorter keys that don’t feel awkward. You no longer get regular USB ports or an SD memory card slot for photos. That means buying adapters to connect older printers, scanners and your iPhone to the new USB-C ports. On the plus side, you can now connect the power charger on either side, depending on where the outlet is. And the MacBook retains a headphone jack, something the latest iPhones dropped. If you don’t need the Touch Bar or the fingerprint scanner, you can save $300 with an entry-level MacBook Pro, but it is slower and has ports only on one side. The Touch Bar models start at about $1,800 for a 13-inch screen and $2,400 for 15 inches. ___ DISAPPEARING KEYBOARD Meanwhile, the 10-inch Yoga Book (about $500 for Android, $600 for Windows) retains the clamshell design of a laptop but has a second touch screen where the keyboard normally goes. Unlike pop-up touch keyboard in tablets, this one doesn’t block the main display as you type. Without physical keys, the device is just 0.38 inch thick, or about two-thirds the thickness of the new MacBooks. The Yoga provides both tactile and audio feedback when you hit the keys, although it’s still easy to miss the ones you’re aiming for. It takes longer to type because of all the typos, which gets annoying very quickly. You would think that with a touch keyboard, the Yoga could reconfigure the keys to toggle between upper and lower cases and switch languages, much the way a touch keyboard on a phone or tablet does on the screen. But the keys themselves always appear in standard English and in upper case, even when you’re typing in Thai. Call it a missed opportunity. An Australian startup called Sonder is already planning to ship such a keyboard for $199 this year, but who wants to carry around an extra accessory? If it makes it onto a future laptop, it could mark a true revolution that goes well beyond the minor changes the Touch Bar and the second touch screen offer.

A new ad Apple posted Monday, featuring Karlie Kloss, Young M.A., Brunas Schmitz and Justine Skye, highlights some of the Solo3 Wireless features enabled by the W1 chip, like touch controls and a longer lasting 40-hour battery. Thanks to the in-house designed W1 chip, the Solo3 Wireless features seamless zero-configuration pairing across iCloud devices while delivering up to 40 hours of battery life, with a quick five-minute charge providing three hours of playback. Like Apple’s upcoming AirPods, the W1-enhanced Solo3 Wireless features dual beam-forming microphones and built-in touch controls that let you take calls, play music, adjust volume and activate Siri while on the go. Here’s the new ad. And this is the promotional video for the Solo3 Wireless headphones that Beast posted on its YouTube channel following Apple’s September 7 iPhone 7 event.

clock menu more-arrow Mossberg Mossberg: New MacBook Pro is a fast, slim tweener But the battery’s iffy, the Touch Bar is just okay — and you’ll need dongles by Walt Mossberg@waltmossberg Nov 14, 2016, 8:00am EST share tweet Linkedin Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Recode by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an Executive Editor at The Verge and Editor at Large of Recode. Apple is realigning its familiar laptop line, dramatically reshaping and in some ways merging the favorite options for both heavy-duty “pro” users and everyday customers. And the poster child for this more muddled future is the pricey new MacBook Pro, which appears in stores this week. Apple wants you to focus on the new Pro’s boldest feature, called the Touch Bar. It’s a touch-operated strip of buttons and sliders displayed on a thin screen at the top of the keyboard that changes functions depending on what you’re doing. It injects a bit of iPhone and iPad feel into the Mac. And it’s well worth noting. But, the bigger story here to me is that the Pro, once mainly aimed straight at people who do especially taxing work like professional video editing or serious design, is now being stretched to suit a much larger audience. That’s especially true of the 13-inch model (there’s also a 15-inch variety). It’s thinner and lighter, and is the only modern, easily portable Mac laptop with both a high-res Retina display and a relatively recent, first-class processor (the sixth-generation Core i5 or i7). So, I’ve been testing the 13-inch Touch Bar-equipped Pro for about 10 days, looking at it from the point of view of mainstream users, not pros. Mainstream users should compare the new Pro to the MacBook Air Mainstream Mac lovers must assess whether the Pro, now much thinner and lighter, is a good replacement for the brilliant MacBook Air, which Apple will still sell (starting at $999) but which has apparently been consigned to Cupertino’s special purgatory for products it can’t quite kill yet, but won’t upgrade. The Air was the best laptop ever built, in my opinion, but it was never given a high-res Retina display and has fallen behind in processor technology. And Apple’s other Mac laptop, the much newer 12-inch MacBook, while beautiful and portable, has a weak processor, a small screen, a single port, and a high base price of $1,299. The new Pro definitely trounces my three-year-old MacBook Air in power and screen quality. Running the normal set of apps and browser tabs I use every day, my old Air blasts its fans a lot to keep up. The Touch Bar Pro barely notices. But I have reservations, and you should, too. Many pro users are already vocally complaining about issues particular to them. But, even for mainstream Mac users, there are questions about price, ports, the Touch Bar feature, the keyboard, and — surprisingly, for a Mac — battery life. The Basics This new 13-inch Pro comes in two flavors. One, the base model, costs less (it starts at $1,499) but lacks the Touch Bar and Touch ID, the fingerprint scanner which can be used to log into the computer and to make online purchases. Instead, it has a standard, but severely squished, row of function keys. The 13-inch Touch Bar model starts at $1,799 but can be configured to more robust specs that bring it to $2,899. The 15-inch model, which isn’t the focus of this review, starts at $2,399. Design A big part of what makes the Pro double as a successor to the Air is that it has been made much thinner and lighter, even at the cost of enraging some pros, whose favorite ports may have been ditched because they took up too much room. The new 13-inch Pro is now 12 percent thinner than the Air, and weighs the same three pounds. It’s as if Apple had shrunk the 13-inch Air, kept the same screen size, added Retina, upgraded the processor, and added the Touch Bar and Touch ID. The screen is just fabulous, even better than the previous 13-inch Pro’s Retina display. And way better than the display on the Air. The keyboard isn’t anything like the old Air’s or Pro’s. It’a revised version of the flat, limited-travel keyboard introduced on the MacBook. I hated the first one on the smaller computer, yet I like this second generation just fine. For me, it took no time at all to get used to. It’s clicky and responsive. I suspect you’ll like it. But keyboards are a personal thing, so I urge you to try it in a store before ordering. Battery Life The biggest surprise in my tests was just how inconsistent the Touch Bar Pro’s battery life was. I have tested hundreds of laptops over the years and Macs have almost always excelled at meeting or beating their promised battery lives, both in my longtime battery test regime, and in typical daily use. But the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar wasn’t as reliably consistent as previous Macs. On my rigorous test, which I’ve used for years, the machine actually exceeded Apple’s claim of up to 10 hours of battery life. The test involves setting the screen at 100 percent, keeping it on and undimmed constantly, playing an endless loop of music, and leaving Wi-Fi on to collect email, tweets, and Facebook posts in the background. Result: 11 hours and 38 minutes. Battery life is surprisingly inconsistent Normally, that battery test is an understatement, because people typically do let the screen go dark periodically and they don’t use it at 100 percent brightness. But, in this case, after hearing that a colleague was seeing much lower results in general use, I ran a second test with all of Apple’s default energy-saving settings on, the screen at 75 percent and a perfectly normal (for me) mix of tasks like web browsing, email, a few short videos, Twitter, Facebook, some light writing, and Slack. The Pro died at 8 hours and 22 minutes. To make things worse, Apple’s built-in prediction of how much time the battery had left before dying fluctuated a lot and was mostly wrong (Apple says this is a known problem caused by the fact that modern processors can power up and down rapidly over a much wider range than in the past, making estimates much more difficult.) So, my best advice is that even a mainstream, non-pro user can’t count on this laptop lasting the promised maximum of 10 hours — even in light to moderate use — let alone the 12 hour maximum a new Air can pull off. And you won’t have an accurate estimate to go by. The Touch Bar The big innovation Apple touts for the new Pro is the Touch Bar. Some regard it as Apple’s lame substitute for the full touchscreen it refuses to install in the Mac. But I see it as an effort to replace the keyboard’s ancient function row with a bit of the touchscreen simplicity that’s the magic behind iOS. (The function keys, like brightness and volume, are still there, in virtual form, but they temporarily contract when an app displays its customized keys and sliders.) And, yes, there’s still an Escape key, but it’s virtual. For pros, the Touch Bar holds promise as quick way to scroll through photos, audio wave forms, video frames, or color choices. The trouble is, that, right now, I don’t think it does much for mainstream users. For instance, in Safari and Photos, it presents thumbnails of open tabs and photos that are so tiny you can barely recognize them. You mainly just scroll through them. Predictive text is the single most useful feature of the Touch Bar In Safari, a Touch Bar button allows you to quickly open a new tab. Another starts a search. In Mail, you can do things like start a new message, reply to one, or trash one. None of this is very exciting or creative, especially since you have a gigantic, buttery-smooth trackpad below the keyboard. You can’t even use the Touch Bar in Apple Mail to move to the next unread message or jump back to the top of a list. The single most useful feature of the Touch Bar, in my view, is that it provides a home for predictive text selections and emojis when you are writing in almost any app or web page that permits text entry. This includes Apple’s word processors, Microsoft Office (coming), Facebook, Messages and more. It’s kind of like a wedding of iPhone and Mac text entry, and I like it. (If you don’t you can ignore it.) Alas, although I wrote this whole column on a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I couldn’t use this predictive text feature because I was writing in Google Docs running in a Safari tab. That’s right: while text entry in any number of web pages works with the Touch Bar, it fails with one of the world’s most widely used web apps. An Apple official said: “Google Docs uses a different model of text entry than the standard text entry used by most websites. This affects the functionality of Touch Bar features. We are working with Google to support these features.” I don’t think the Touch Bar is a gimmick, but I don’t think it changes much, at least yet, for everyday Mac users. Luckily, third-party app developers can design ways to use it, and users can customize it to some extent. So it may have a more productive future. But, right now, it’s unlikely to improve most users’ life dramatically when working on their laptops. Ports The new MacBook Pros dispense with traditional SD card, USB and long-standard video connectors. Even the genius, breakaway MagSafe power connector is gone. In their place are simply four of the new USB-C ports, which also work with Thunderbolt 3. These connectors are fast, and highly versatile. They can be used for charging, data transfer, video output, and more. And they are likely the future. But you’ll need to buy dongles (adapters) to connect them to most monitors, external storage, and flash memory cards. I fully understand the outrage over this switch from people who make their living on current MacBook Pros and legacy peripherals, like monitors or external storage; and from photographers and editors who rely on flash memory cards. Nobody likes dongles or adapters and some brands are unreliable or unsafe. Apple slashed its adapter prices temporarily in the wake of the complaints. But I honestly don’t think this is a big problem for average Mac users, whose main need will likely be a new Mac-to-iPhone cable ($19 from Apple). And I believe that, over time, most peripherals will switch to USB-C, since other companies — not just Apple — are behind it. Price For everyday Mac users, especially, the new Pro is a costly machine. Even the non-Touch Bar model is $500 more than the Air (at $999) and the cheapest Touch Bar edition is $300 more than that. But Apple has always been a premium PC maker, and its new models have often started off at sky-high prices. People forget that, when it debuted in 2008, the MacBook Air with the then-revolutionary, but puny, 64GB solid state drive cost a breathtaking $3,100. You can get a terabyte of solid-state storage in the costliest 13-inch new model, and pay less. If you’re a mainstream Mac lover who isn’t bothered by its limitations, you can save money with the 12-inch MacBook, or even buy a new Air, if it works well for you. Or, if those MacBook Pro prices are too high for you, and your current Mac is doing okay, you could wait for them to come down next year. Bottom line This is what Apple is offering — take it or leave it The new 13-inch MacBooks — even the base model without the Touch Bar — are costly. And they may make pros unhappy. But, for everyday Mac lovers — users of the Air or maybe the older low-end Pro — they are now your only thin, modern, option with a full-fledged processor. The Touch Bar has potential, but it’s not magic. The battery isn’t likely to deliver on Apple’s claims. You can’t count on liking the keyboard. But, if you’re a Mac devotee ready to move past the Air — not back to a lower-powered MacBook — this is what Apple is offering. Take it or leave it.

The reviews are in — here's what people are saying about Apple's latest laptop Kif Leswing Nov. 14, 2016, 9:40 AM 41,094 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hollis Johnson/Business Insider The first batch of reviews for Apple's new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar are in, and they're mixed. If you need a new laptop, are a Mac user, and have the money to spend, go ahead and buy the new MacBook Pro, my colleague Steve Kovach writes.  "The latest MacBook Pro model is slimmer, more powerful, and downright attractive," he wrote."It’s the best MacBook you can buy, but it’s also not for everyone." Other reviewers had issues with the laptop's battery life, next-generation Thunderbolt ports, and questioned the usefulness of the laptop's banner new feature, a touchscreen strip that replaces the function keys that Apple calls Touch Bar. The new MacBook Pro comes in three main versions: one with a 13-inch screen without the Touch Bar touchscreen keyboard integration, one with a 13-inch screen and a Touch Bar, and one with a 15-inch screen and a Touch Bar. These reviews focus on the versions with the Touch Bar.  Here's what tech pundits are saying about Apple's latest computer:  View As: One Page Slides Joanna Stern, WSJ: So how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the “old” MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I’m doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out.

And you won’t have an accurate estimate to go by. Dana Wollman, Engadget: Apple rates both the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro for up to 10 hours of battery life, and that's either with web surfing or iTunes movie playback. Even after half a dozen battery tests, I'm still noticing some inconsistencies in my results: 13-inch battery life is sometimes in the seven- to eight-hour range, with some tests hinting at a ten-and-a-half-hour capacity. Testing on the 15-inch model has also been inconclusive. I've generally seen between nine and 10 hours of video playback, but in one instance I exceeded the 13-hour mark by lowering the brightness slightly. I'll be conducting more tests and updating this review with final battery life results. Christina Warren, Gizmodo: And for now, that’s the problem with the Touch Bar: It’s not especially useful for either regular people or for the mythical “pros” the new MacBook line is supposedly designed for. The Touch Bar is most compelling for professionals, but these people live and die by their memorized shortcuts, so for now, the Bar isn’t not going to going to make a big impact. I don’t need Touch Bar in Photoshop because I’ve already memorized how to switch between the Heal and Lasso brushes. Yet the lack of usability for Apple’s former core market could change once third-party developers figure out how to create really customizable tooltips for the Touch Bar. For now, the bigger win is Touch ID. Jan Dawson, Beyond Devices: That’s not to say they’re all intended to be the only computer someone who uses heavy-duty creative apps needs – the Mac Pro and iMac are there at least in part to meet those needs. But these are computers that the vast majority of people who use a Mac for work would be fine to use as their only machine – that’s certainly the case for me. This 15″ version I’ve been testing is slightly less portable than the 13″ version, but can be significantly more powerful, and could handle pretty much any video or photo editing task you’d want to throw at it. Andrew Cunningham, Ars Technica: Apple rates both the different 13-inch MacBook Pro models as having the same battery life on their product page, but in our review of the $1,499 model we noted a few factors that suggested otherwise. The $1,499 Pro has a lower-wattage processor and a battery that’s larger by 10 percent or so, for starters. Our battery testing bears this out. The Touch Bar-equipped Pro’s battery life is by no means bad, but it is quite a bit lower than the $1,499 MBP (and slightly lower than the 2015 MBP) in our light Wi-Fi Web browsing test. Lance Ulanoff, Mashable: Apple built the Touch Bar as an open platform, one that any third party can program to (but not for web apps since there’s no HTML or Web API). There’s also no guarantee that companies like Google will ever write to it. In my tests, Chrome, obviously, has no interaction with the Touch Bar. I somehow doubt that Chrome will ever work with it, but its also clear that many other third-party developers will be happy to tap into the visual touch panel with the ability to accept up to 10 fingers of input at a time. Adobe has already committed to a Touch Bar-ready Photoshop by the end of this year and Touch Bar abilities are also coming to Microsoft Office, Pixelmator, 1Password and Live Home 3D. Dan Ackerman, CNET: In the end, your decision may come down to something much more practical -- ports. Are you ready to move into the USB-C only future, where connecting a USB key, HDMI output, Ethernet cable, or nearly any other accessory will require a special cable or dongle? David Pierce, Wired: People love Apple computers because Apple gets the basics right. The keyboard, the trackpad, the screen, the speakers, all the table-stakes things too many companies get wrong. And in most cases, Apple made the best even better with the new MacBook Pro. Steve Kovach, Business Insider: The upside is battery life on the MacBook is much better, so you likely won't need to charge it during the day. Apple says you'll get up to 10 hours per charge, but I didn't get that close. It was more like eight hours. (Although I tend to keep my screen brighter than most people.)

Copyright Getty Images Advertisement Samsung Electronics Co. (IW 1000/10) is spending $8 billion to buy its way into a burgeoning market for automotive technology alongside Apple Inc. and Google as the smartphone business wanes. The company is making its largest-ever overseas acquisition with an offer for Harman International Industries Inc., angling to become the go-to supplier of everything from in-car entertainment to connected-auto services. It comes days after Samsung Group heir-apparent Jay Y. Lee formally ascended to the board of the electronics firm, a move expected to shore up his influence over the family-run conglomerate’s prized asset. The Harman acquisition will lift Samsung into the top ranks of auto technology suppliers and give it existing relationships with BMW AG, Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. While Harman became a legendary name in high-end audio equipment, it’s pushed deeper into automotive supplies and now gets 65% of sales from the sector. Samsung’s $112-a-share offer stood 28% above Harman’s closing price of $87.65 in New York on Friday. Popular Now Scandal Could Be the Unmaking of India's Bedsheet Industry GE Deepens Silicon Valley Push With $915 Million Cloud Purchase Tesla’s Future in Trump’s World “This is the first deal cut after Jay Y. joined the board and shows his management style is different from his father. He is an aggressive deal maker,” said Park Kang-ho, an analyst with Daishin Securities Co. “In the longer term, Samsung is thinking that life after smartphones is electric vehicles.” The Korean company joins a growing list of global technology companies moving into automobiles. The companies see cars as an industry that hasn’t yet been remade by software and online technologies. Samsung may have figured that it can’t become the biggest player in the car component business by itself, so it needs a big brand to get into the market." — Greg Roh, HMC Investment Securities analyst But outside of Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors Inc., the efforts haven’t yet reached customers. Google has for years been working on self-driving software but its systems haven’t yet reached the market. Apple went on a hiring spree to add staff to build its own car before recently re-calibrating the initiative to focus more on software, leading to job cuts. Uber Technologies Inc. joined the fray over the past year, hiring engineers and making acquisitions to build its own autonomous car technology. Samsung itself has bought a stake in Chinese electric-car maker BYD Co. and at one point considered an offer for sections of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s parts unit, a deal said to have broken down just weeks ago. With the Harman purchase, it’s taking a different approach that’s more in keeping with its history has a component maker. Rather than designing a car or building a self-driving system, Harman’s technology focuses on the growing number of services available as automobiles get connected to the internet -- navigation, multimedia entertainment, security systems and analytics tools. Potential Goldmine This transformation of the auto into a full-service mobile device adds up to a potential goldmine. Revenue from the data streams and connectivity components could become a 180 billion-euro (US$200 billion) market by 2020, McKinsey & Co. estimates. “Samsung may have figured that it can’t become the biggest player in the car component business by itself, so it needs a big brand to get into the market,” said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co. Related Could Investors Prompt Samsung to Restructure? Samsung Seeks ‘New Start’ as Co-CEO Warns of Exposure to Risks For Samsung, establishing a foothold in automotive technology offers the company a chance to shed its reliance on a smartphone market undergoing its worst downturn on record. The company is the world’s biggest supplier of displays and memory for mobile devices -- replicating that dominance in autos will inject new life into the business. It’s now struggling to put the embarrassing death of the fire-prone Note 7 behind it, while searching for its next leg of growth. Samsung said Harman is the market leader in connected car solutions, with more than 30 million vehicles equipped with its connected car and audio systems and telematics. Telematic devices allow in-vehicle access to specific services, including car parks and anti-theft security. The Stamford, Conn.-based company has an order backlog for the auto market of $24 billion as of June 30. “Harman has a scale and premium in the car-infotainment and audio businesses, so it would definitely help Samsung move faster. But it alone is not enough for Samsung to become the leader in this space,” said Roh. The audio company can trace its roots back to the 1950s, when Sidney Harman teamed with Bernard Kardon to make high-fidelity machines. The company would later acquire brands including JBL and Infinity, among other audio equipment makers, and become a leader in high-end car stereo systems. It also owns the Bang & Olufsen brand for cars after acquiring the business last year. Evercore is serving as financial adviser to Samsung, while JPMorgan and Lazard are advising Harman, according to the statement. Shares of Samsung fell 2.8% to 1,553,000 won at the close in Seoul before the announcement was made. “Harman perfectly complements Samsung in terms of technologies, products and solutions, and joining forces is a natural extension of the automotive strategy we have been pursuing for some time,” Vice Chairman Kwon Oh-hyun said in the statement. “Harman immediately establishes a strong foundation for Samsung to grow our automotive platform.” By Jungah Lee and Hooyeon Kim Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

The 15-inch MacBook Pro hooked up to some external 5K displays. Andrew Cunningham The 15-inch Pro and the 13-inch Touch Bar model. Andrew Cunningham The new Pro comes in both space gray and silver. Andrew Cunningham The glowing Apple logo on the back is no more. Andrew Cunningham The new 15-inch model has a big trackpad and big speaker grilles to the left and right of the keyboard. Andrew Cunningham The Touch Bar models have four Thunderbolt 3 ports, unlike the $1,499 model. Andrew Cunningham The Touch Bar displaying emoji. Other Ars staffers who saw the Touch Bar were impressed that it had the same amount of color and detail as any old Retina display. Andrew Cunningham Buttons have, by and large, been replaced by sliders. Andrew Cunningham Customizing the Touch Bar buttons in software. The new design of the MacBook Pros is nice, and Apple’s decision to put in nothing but Thunderbolt 3 ports has prompted a fresh wave of dongle talk, but the signature feature of the new MacBook Pros was always going to be the Touch Bar. This little touch-enabled strip represents a bunch of things. It’s a melding of Apple’s traditional Intel-driven software platform and the company’s own homegrown chips and its touch-driven iOS platform. It’s Apple’s answer to the touchscreen, a model that Apple steadfastly resists in its computers even as Microsoft and its partners embrace it. And it's the biggest thing about these Macs that’s truly new—Macs in the last half-decade have gotten thinner and lighter and have better battery life than before, but, Touch Bar aside, they all still run basically the same software in basically the same way. So, yes, these new laptops have new CPUs and GPUs, new designs, new ports, and new screens. We’ll spend plenty of time with all of those things. But the biggest question for buyers is whether the Touch Bar is worth it and what it adds to the experience that you can’t already get if you keep the latest version of macOS installed on your laptop. Differences between all three MacBook Pros Specs at a glance: 13-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro (Four Thunderbolt 3 ports) Screen 2560×1600 at 13.3" (227 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.9GHz Intel Core i5-6267U (Turbo up to 3.3GHz) RAM 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered, upgradeable to 16GB at purchase) GPU Intel Iris 550 (integrated, 64MB eDRAM) HDD 256GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 2x Thunderbolt 3, 2x Thunderbolt 3 with reduced bandwidth, headphones Size 11.97" × 8.36" × 0.59" (304.1 mm × 212.4 mm × 14.9 mm) Weight 3.02 lbs (1.37 kg) Battery 49.2Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $1,799.99 Price as reviewed $1,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics We've been over this a few times, but let's list the differences between the $1,499 MacBook Pro and the Touch Bar model. There are a couple of new details I can confirm now that I’ve actually been able to use both models. The low-end Pro uses a 15W Core i5-6360U CPU with an Intel Iris 540 GPU; the high-end model uses a 28W Core i5-6267U CPU with an Intel Iris 550 GPU. The difference, aside from small boosts to CPU and GPU clock speeds, is that the 28W model can run faster for longer and throttle less frequently. The 15W model can also consume less power. The low-end Pro uses a single “Alpine Ridge” Thunderbolt 3 controller from Intel, while the high-end Pro uses two Thunderbolt controllers. The two ports on the right side of the MacBook Pro have "reduced PCI Express bandwidth," which Apple says means they have two PCIe 3.0 lanes’ worth of bandwidth at their disposal instead of the four lanes dedicated to the ports on the left side (Intel’s mobile Skylake chipsets include a total of 10 PCIe lanes, four of which are already being used by the SSD). You can connect all the same things to both ports—displays, storage, power adapters—but especially high-performance storage arrays should be plugged in on the left side to maximize the available bandwidth. The low-end Pro uses 1866MHz LPDDR3 RAM while the high-end Pro uses 2133MHz LPDDR3. Apple has said it’s using LPDDR3 to save power, but it’s also the reason the systems max out at 16GB. The low-end Pro actually has a larger battery than the high-end one: 54.5Whr compared to 49.2Whr. Apple says both laptops have 10 hours of battery life, but the lower-power processor, the larger battery, and the lack of a little second screen above the keyboard all mean that the low-end model actually lasts a bit longer than the Touch Bar model. The low-end model includes two integrated mics, while the high-end model includes three. The low-end Pro’s 802.11ac Wi-Fi tops out at 867Mbps, while both the Touch Bar MacBook Pros can do a maximum of 1.3Gbps just like last year’s models. And here are a few further differences between both 13-inch models and the 15-inch models, all of which include Touch Bars. 15-inch Pros have enough thermal headroom to fit in quad-core Skylake processors. The base model includes a 2.6GHz (3.5GHz Turbo) Core i7-6700HQ, while our review unit uses a 2.7GHz (3.6GHz Turbo) Core i7-6820HQ. Either model can be configured with a 2.9GHz (3.8GHz Turbo) Core i7-6920HQ. All models use their processors’ Intel HD 530 integrated graphics when possible to save power, but they also include dedicated AMD Radeon GPUs. The Radeon Pro 450, 455, and 460 are all based on AMD’s latest Polaris architecture—we’ll go into more detail about each component later in the review. The trackpad in the 15-inch model is larger than in the 13-inch models. All four Thunderbolt 3 ports in the 15-inch Pros offer the same amount of PCIe bandwidth, since Intel’s quad-core CPUs add more PCIe 3.0 lanes to the amount that the chipset includes (in total, Apple is using four lanes for the SSD, eight lanes across all four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and another eight lanes for the dedicated GPUs). Using the 15-inch model Specs at a glance: 15-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro Screen 2880×1800 at 15.4" (220 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-6820HQ (Turbo up to 3.6GHz) RAM 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered) GPU AMD Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB RAM, Intel HD 530 HDD 512GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 4x Thunderbolt 3, headphones Size 13.75" × 9.48" × 0.61" (349.3 mm × 240.7 mm × 15.5 mm) Weight 4.02 lbs (1.83 kg) Battery 76.0Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $2,399.99 Price as reviewed $2,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics The reduced size and weight of the 15-inch Pro are both really nice when you’re carrying the machine around. At just four pounds, it actually weighs less than the 4.5 pound 13-inch MacBook Pros did before the jump to Retina, and it’s a pound-and-a-half lighter than the pre-Retina 15-inch models (there’s a less consequential but still nice half-pound reduction compared to the older Retina models). When you're using it, though, it’s still very much a 15-inch laptop. I use 13-inch laptops almost exclusively these days, and the more cumbersome size and larger palmrest make the 15-inch models just a little unwieldy compared to what I’m used to. In other words, even with the size and weight decreases, the 15-inch model isn't small enough to be a good replacement for a 13-inch notebook. I will say that my minor palm rejection problems with the 13-inch Pro’s larger trackpad aren’t really problems here. It may be because the trackpad is larger, so the corners of my hands are always firmly placed on the trackpad as I type rather than hitting it intermittently. Beyond this, the experience of typing and of using the trackpad is identical. The 2880×1800 screen has the same resolution as the older Retina models, albeit with the added brightness and contrast and the wide color support. But like the MacBook and the 13-inch Pros, the screen’s default resolution is 1680×1050 mode. As with the previous models, you can also select 1024×600, 1280×800, 1440×900, and 1900×1200 modes depending on what’s the most comfortable for you. Finally, the speakers here are much larger than the ones in the 13-inch model, and they sound pretty good for laptop speakers. They have respectable bass and dynamic range. While they aren’t as good as the speakers in a desktop like an iMac or some good dedicated speakers, they’re good enough for movies and TV, and they aren’t bad if you need to fill a room with music for a small party.

The name is very important. If the company sticks to its usual labeling convention, then the next flagship will be dubbed the iPhone 7S and feature a few improvements over the current variant. 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone; so expectations are running high. Apple’s sliding sales figures indicate that it needs to reclaim its reputation for innovation before rivals oust it from its comfortable position. Xiaomi has beaten the company to a minimum bezel handset with its limited edition Mi Mix. Android has been doing wireless charging for a few years and Samsung’s king of the curved screen handset market with its Galaxy Edge series. The iPhone 7 has been disappointing in terms of design. But considering that Apple hardly introduced any big improvements, there was no need to make massive changes to the appearance. For the company to shine forth as a leader in innovation once again, it’ll need to drastically overhaul its next iPhone. Based on what we’ve heard so far, here’s a pick of the best concept designs the iPhone 8 is likely to flaunt.

The Giants face the Bengals on Monday night at MetLife Stadium. Here are 10 things you need to know to get ready for the prime-time showdown: (Hit the share button above to send this to a fellow Giants fan) Brad Penner | USA TODAY Sports Apple has a big fan Rookie cornerback Eli Apple had the worst game of his young career last week, getting benched in the third quarter of the Giants' 28-23 win over the Eagles. But defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said Apple's role won't change for Monday night's game against the Bengals. "I am a big Eli Apple fan," Spagnuolo said. Groin and hamstring injuries have sidelined Apple for two games and forced him to leave two others early. Spagnuolo thinks those injuries have hurt Apple's development, but the defensive coordinator is confident the first-round pick is going to bounce back on Monday night. William Hauser | USA TODAY Sports Where's Darkwa? Running back Orleans Darkwa belongs on the side of a milk carton because he has been missing from the Giants' offense in the past three games. Darkwa hasn't played an offensive snap in the past three games after filling in well when Rashad Jennings was sidelined with a thumb injury. Darkwa's season stat line (3.7 ypc) is marred by a seven-carry, 11-yard performance in Week 5 against a Packers defense that entered that game allowing 1.8 yards per carry. Darkwa averaged 4.6 yards per carry with two touchdowns in the two previous games. With Jennings averaging 2.0 yards per carry in the three games since his return, it's hard to figure why Darkwa has been MIA. Coach Ben McAdoo only said "game plan decisions" when asked about Darkwa's absence. Michael Reaves | Getty Images Not so special teams Aside from a blocked field goal, the Giants' special teams were a disaster in last week's win over the Eagles. The Giants allowed a 66-yard punt return. Returner Dwayne Harris made the puzzling decision to take a late kickoff out of the end zone and only reached the 12-yard line. And even on the blocked field goal, Janoris Jenkins inexplicably tried a lateral in a crowd and was fortunate that teammate Mark Herzlich fell on the loose ball. Special teams coordinator Tom Quinn wasn't happy with what he said wasn't smart situational football.

The free agent signing is fourth on the team with 40 tackles and his massive presence is a big reason why the Giants' defense ranks sixth in the NFL in yards per carry after finishing 24th in that category last season. 2014 ✅ 2015 ✅ 2016, so far ✅ For the 3rd season in a row, Damon Harrison (@BigDame900) leads all interior D-lineman in run stop percentage. pic.twitter.com/9BtQtAMYtp — Pro Football Focus (@PFF) November 7, 2016 Snack attack Passing grades Rookie safety Andrew Adams received the highest grade of any safety in the league from Pro Football Focus last week. That was in line with the Giants' internal grades, as defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said Adams and fellow safety Landon Collins were measured as the unit's most productive players against the Eagles. Nat Berhe will see more time at safety as he returns from a concussion, but Adams appears to have a stranglehold on the starting job next to Collins. Andrew Adams has played so well in Berhe and Thompson's absence. pic.twitter.com/CSQi4bkGxi — 🗜ClampSZN Ethan🗜 (@EthanGSN) November 6, 2016 Passing grades Best in the biz Janoris Jenkins has quietly had a Pro Bowl-level first half of the season. Even Jenkins' teammates have to guard against taking his play for granted. "You talk about who’s the best corner in the league this, that and the other," receiver Odell Beckham Jr. said. "It’s tough to even put him in that category. You see him every day and go against him, when you’re asked who’s the best corner, you don’t think someone on your team. He’s playing at the highest of highest levels." Andrew Mills | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com Goodson sighting Rookie middle linebacker B.J. Goodson made his defensive debut last week, playing three snaps in the Giants' 28-23 win over the Eagles. Goodson should continue to see reps on defense as the season progresses. "We want to get B.J. oiled up, just as a football player," defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said. "I liked him as an aggressive guy, but he is a young guy. Putting him in the middle of the defense is a lot to ask, but if you don’t start to do it and then at some point you have to do it ... so we are going to kind of build on that. He has gotten reps here during the week. We are looking for certain situations to slip that particular package in." William Hauser | USA TODAY Sports I'm told expectation now is Victor Cruz (ankle) will NOT play Monday night against the Bengals, per source.#Giants will play it cautious. — Art Stapleton (@art_stapleton) November 13, 2016 Cruz docked Receiver Victor Cruz reportedly won't play against the Bengals on Monday night due to a sprained ankle. The news is a bit of a surprise because the ankle injury seemed very mild. But it's understandable that the Giants are being cautious with Cruz given his injury history. Rookie Roger Lewis is in line for a bigger role if Cruz is out. A knife in the back The Giants' defense has done a solid job limiting big plays this season. They rank third in fewest runs of 10-plus yards (18) and tied for 12th in fewest passes of 25-plus yards (16). But the Eagles were explosive last week with three runs of 10-plus yards and five passes of 25-plus yards. Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said big plays are "a knife in my back every day." Spagnuolo said the Giants' goal is to limit opponents to less than four big plays per game. William Hauser | USA TODAY Sports Jones' time Offensive coordinator Mike Sullivan confirmed the obvious on Friday: Brett Jones will start at left guard on Monday night against the Bengals. With starter Justin Pugh sidelined for multiple weeks with a knee injury, it was clear that the Giants were going to turn to Jones when they didn't sign a veteran fill-in last week. Jones fared well when he replaced Pugh early in the second quarter of last week's 28-23 win over the Eagles.

Google Microsoft Must Read News Operating Systems Smartphone Google Takes European Union Head-on, Says Android is not Anti-competitive By Shudeep Chandrasekhar - November 14, 2016 43 0 In a blog post late last week Google Senior Vice President and General Counsel Kent Walker made it very clear that Alphabet (Google’s parent company) isn’t going to take the European Unions allegations about Android lying down. In April 2015 the EU raised certain objections to Google trying to muscle in on the fact that it owns Android, and that it was forcing manufacturers to put Google Apps on their devices by default. But Walker says otherwise: “No manufacturer is obliged to preload any Google apps on an Android phone. But we do offer manufacturers a suite of apps so that when you buy a new phone you can access a familiar set of basic services.” And that’s essentially the case in a nutshell. Walker goes on to compare what Google does with what Apple and Microsoft currently do: “Android’s competitors, including Apple’s iPhone and Microsoft’s Windows phone, not only do the same, but they allow much less choice in the apps that come with their phones. On Android, Google’s apps typically account for less than one-third of the preloaded apps on the device (and only a small fraction of device memory). A consumer can swipe away any of our apps at any time. And, uniquely, hardware makers and carriers can pre-install rival apps right next to ours. In competition-speak, that means there’s no “foreclosure”.” But the EU also made a strange point, saying that Android doesn’t compete with Apple’s iOS. I say strange because the general public seems to agree with me. In a survey launched by the European Commission, 89% of the respondents said that Android and Apple’s iOS do, in fact, compete with each other. Google has also given other examples from the viewpoints of Apple itself, Samsung, developers and users. But those are just two points in the original Statement of Objections that the EC has issued to Alphabet, Inc. Another one states the following: “Google has abused its dominant position by systematically favouring its own comparison shopping service in its general search results.” Google’s response to that, as given by a spokesperson earlier this month was this: “We remain confident that these claims lack evidence and are wrong on the facts, the law, and the economics. The surest signs of dynamic competition in any market are low prices, abundant choices, and constant innovation — and that’s a great description of shopping on the internet today.” But that’s not the end of the allegations. The EC also brought to bear some allegations against AdSense for Search, which places contextual ads near the top of search results pages. Here’s Google’s response to that: “Our text ads help websites generate income and have always faced strong competition from other ad formats, so we disagree with the Commission’s assessment. Nevertheless, even before the Statement of Objections was filed, we changed practices the Commission takes issue with, so we hope to resolve this case quickly.” So on that front alone, despite being in disagreement with the EC, Google did tweak some of the their settings. And from what the spokesperson said, it seems they did it even before the EC brought it up. That’s possibly a pre-emptive move by Google, but it doesn’t seem to have helped the case much. On the Android case, Google was given a deadline of November 11 to respond, which they have done as of November 10. Now we’ll have to wait and see what the EC does in response to Google’s statement that was filed with them last week. So the big question now is whether or not Google is using unfair practices to push its product agenda into the Android ecosystem. But Apple is certainly doing it because iOS and macOS are proprietary platforms, and Windows continues to do it for Windows 10 Mobile devices. But the problem with Android seems to be that, although owned by Google, it was designed to be an open source platform that any device maker could take and then customized for their own purposes. In the final analysis, it seems like the EC is getting pressure from smaller groups with vested interests, such as local traders and Europe-based business and website owners. It’s unclear at this point where the accusations originated, but it’s clear that the EC is taking it upon itself to fight the cause. Unfortunately, Alphabet is on the receiving end of that fight. If things go the EC way, Google could be looking at billions of dollars in fines, as well as being forced to make several changes to the way they offer their apps on Google Play. Alphabet is the world’s second largest company by market capitalization, and very close to Apple, Inc. As of 2016 Google already crossed Apple’s market cap once, in February, and both their numbers are running close to each other. But in the case of Alphabet versus the European Commission, it would seem that the former is the David and the latter is the Goliath. Can Alphabet defeat the EC on this? Probably not without making several key concessions. Follow us for the latest news in this increasingly hot debate between Alphabet and the EC.

Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Many tech enthusiasts tuned in to last October's Apple hardware event to get the latest updates on the MacBook products. Specifically, the public was interested to see the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air refresh. The Apple fans were delighted to see the new and powerful MacBook Pro 2016, although many were also disappointed when the Cupertino-based tech giant made no mention of a refreshed MacBook Air laptop. Still, the Mac Air followers are still hopeful that Apple will still update the Air series. Although there are no clear signs from Apple, the rumors are rife that the all-new MacBook Air will arrive sometime next year. According to Game N Guide, the MacBook Air 2017 will be unveiled by Apple during the company's March hardware event. Apple recently picked up the habit of having a hardware event in March, starting with this year when they showcased the iPad Pro and iPhone SE. It is possible that Apple will also hold the first hardware event next year in March, this time to showcase the new MacBook Air. One of the possible major improvements of the MacBook Air 2017 is the replacement of USB-A ports. The MacBook Air has not been updated for a long time, so it is likely that the 2017 Mac Air will go straight to the latest USB-C ports, Mac Rumors reported. It is also expected to sport a Touch ID, as well as fingerprint sensor on its screen display for better security features. It will also sport an Apple Pencil-enabled Track Pad, although what's actually interesting is the arrival of Apple's famous virtual assistant Siri in MacBook. There are other rumors suggesting that the upcoming Mac Air will be powered by the present Intel Skylake chipset, although there is a possibility that it will be among the first devices to boast the next generation Intel Kaby Lake processor. There are still more details to confirm whether the 2017 MacBook Air will come into fruition or not. Some people are suggesting that the recently released thin air MacBook Pro is already a sign that Apple will no longer release a new Air laptop, permanently replacing the current MacBook Air model. However, the public is advised to take these early rumors with a grain of salt until Apple releases an official announcement.

Launched earlier today, the new MacBook Pro features the Touch Bar – a strip of glass built into the top of the keyboard. "We're introducing a new way to interact with your notebook," said Apple's chief design officer Jonathan Ive. "A multi-touch bar that provides a more intuitive, more immediate connection to your content." This bar replaces the function keys and changes automatically based on what the user needs. It can be used to adjust volume and brightness, write with predictive text and emojis, skip through audio and video, and access shortcuts. Icons on the bar will also be customisable in some apps. "Commands that were once hidden are now visible, accessible and also customisable," said Ive. "In each application, the most relevant controls are displayed dynamically, allowing you to work with greater efficiency." Additionally, the bar incorporates Touch ID fingerprint recognition technology, so users can unlock their machines almost instantly, as well as use Apple Pay on their laptops. Integrated speakers have also been redesigned to provide up to 58 per cent more volume, and bass that is two and a half times louder. Related story Apple's AirPod headphones connect wirelessly to iPhones and other devices Pressure-sensitive Force Touch trackpads are up to twice as large, providing more space for gestures during activities like digital drawing. The main screen features brighter LED backlighting and an increased contrast ratio. Apple also claims that the models are up to 17 per cent thinner than the current devices. "With our new design, the product's overall volume has been reduced dramatically," said Ive. "This results in an extremely purposeful and powerful creative tool." The announcement coincides with the 25th anniversary of the release of the company's first notebook, the PowerBook, and follows a series of launches last month. The iPhone 7 smartphone, AirPod wireless earphones and Apple Watch Series 2 were all revealed at the company's Keynote event in September 2016.

However, regardless of the controversy, it turns out that the number orders that have come in for the new Pro is greater than any other Macbook Pro in Apple’s history, according to Phil Schiller, Apple’s Senior VP of Worldwide Marketing. The product has outsold all of its Windows-based competitors already as well. Slice Intelligence created a graph to demonstrate where the sales stand as of Oct. 31, though the information was pulled from sales numbers – specifically by reviewing “hundreds of millions” of e-receipts – and not exact units sold, so there is a possibility that the numbers are more skewed towards Apple. The graph demonstrates that the sales of the Pro that came in the first five days surpassed sales for key competitor notebooks, including the Microsoft Surface Book and Lenovo Yoga 900. Just another step towards world domination, Apple. We see you.  SHARE TWEET EMAIL Torie Richardson EDMTunes Editor. San Francisco.

Details Here [VIDEO] If tech fans are on the lookout for a latest laptop, and is considering to get a new Mac, Apple’s latest MacBook Pro and MacBook Air are excellent choices, even so, here’s a guide on how to choose the laptops. (Photo : Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty Images) If tech fans are on the lookout for a latest laptop, and is considering to get a new Mac, Apple's latest MacBook Pro and MacBook Air are excellent choices. Here's a guide on how to choose the laptops. The MacBook Air was the Cupertino-based tech giant's slimmest and lightest laptop offering. Meanwhile, Apple's latest MacBook Pro lineage was bigger, which was made to match the laptop's bulky internals. However, the tech company's 2016 variants presents the new MacBook Pro era. The MacBook Pro 15-inch model, which automatically rolls out with the innovative Touch Bar, is able to smoothly edit 5K ProRes video on Final Cut Pro X. The new MacBook Pro unit runs faster compared to its Windows rivals, which comes along with superior specifications, Apple Insider reported. Anyway, in terms of weight of the latest MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, the smaller MacBook Pro weighs 20 grams heavier compared to the MacBook Air. Apple built both MacBook models using the tech company's signature aluminum body. The MacBook Pro comes in two colors, silver and space gray, while the MacBook Air will only be available in silver. The new MacBook Pro is packed with advanced display resolution with a 2560 x 1600 227, while the MacBook Air will have a 1440 x 900 128 pixels per inch (PPI) offering. That being the case, the first wave of the Touch Bar equipped MacBook Pros have started shipping to customers for delivery next week. While the tech company is quoting the Nov. 16 as the estimated delivery date, the United Parcel Service (UPS), the world's largest package delivery company, made it known that some customers can expect their new MacBooks on Nov. 14. The delivery estimates of the new MacBooks are a couple of days earlier than expected. Thus far, most of the MacBook Pros that have started shipping are the 15-inch models and custom orders, according to MacRumors.

Mariko Iwasaki Nov 14, 2016 8:05 AM EST As Apple AAPL debates its automotive strategy, Samsung Electronics (SSNLF)  moved quickly into the fast lane of in-car technologies with its $8 billion play for Harman International Industries (HAR) , a move that not only boosts to its top line but also provides greater access to the world's largest automakers including Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and Ford (F) . Samsung's $8 billion bid for Harman follows a string of embarrassments for the Suwon, South Korea-based firm, including the withdrawal of its flammable flagship Galaxy Note 7. But it also comes just less than a month after Apple announced it was significantly scaling back on its automotive project and will no longer try to build its own fully-fledged self-driving car. This means that rather than taking Tesla (TSLA) and other automakers head on, Apple will now focus on creating an autonomous driving system and partner with the existing car makers. Apple's car initiative, code-named Project Titan, was launched in 2014 under the instruction of CEO Tim Cook and led to the tech giant hiring over 1,000 engineers from the auto industry. Since then, however, its project leader and former Ford engineer Steve Zadesky has left and so have hundreds of other hardware and software engineers. Samsung's Monday announcement may ignite another sort of fire -- the fight for speed by Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL)  and other rivals participating in the automotive electronics market, which Samsung estimates will expand to $100 billion by 2025. The South Korean maker, which only established its automotive electronics team in December 2015, has certainly been nimble in this respect. In an analysis of the deal for our premium site Real Money, Jim Cramer wrote: "I wanted Apple to so much get away from being levered to the phone. I guess Samsung's electronics business wanted to do the same. And now it has." (To read Cramer's full take on the acquisition, click here.) But Samsung's purchase not only steals a march on its Apple rival, it should also lift its top and bottom lines.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) might have recently announced its latest and greatest iPhone models but that has not slowed down rumors regarding the upcoming iPhone 8. Interestingly, the $581.6 billion company is expected to introduce revolutionary changes in its yet-to-be-released smartphone to commemorate the 10th anniversary of its first-generation iPhone. If you don’t know already, the current-generation iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are selling like hot cakes, especially the newly-introduced jet Black version of the device. However, there are numerous users who are unsure between purchasing the new iPhone 7 or wait for next year’s model. In order to help you make the right choice, here is a quick review of the current-generation iPhone with its upgraded successor.   Design Here is where the next-generation iPhone will really stand out against its competition. If earlier reports are to believed, Apple is currently developing a bezel-less “all-glass” design for its upcoming iPhone 8. Interestingly, an all-glass display will mean that Apple is going to incorporate the home button of its upcoming iPhone model within the touch screen of the device. The ever-reliable Ming-Chi Kuo has also reaffirmed that the upcoming iPhone could sport a bezel-less design. It seems an exciting times lies ahead! Display Apple has made it a habit to incorporate an IPS LCD display in its leading devices, including the current iPhone models, but that could all change with the release of the upcoming iPhone 8. The Cupertino-based company has already implemented an OLED Touch Bar in its new MacBook Pro models, which suggests that Apple is finally ready to move on from its LCD display days. It’s no secret that OLED technology produces sharper and more vivid colors compared to LCD displays, so such a change would represent a huge step-up from Apple’s end. Camera The current-generation iPhone models sport some of the best-performing cameras in the market. The dual-camera lens in the larger iPhone 7 Plus is capable of rivaling budget DSLR cameras. Hence, it is quite improbable that the company would bother revamping the camera in its upcoming iPhone 8. However, Apple would want to bring slight improvement to the camera performance in its next-generation iPhone models. Unfortunately, Apple’s secrecy regarding its upcoming projects has made it a challenging task to speculate about the upcoming iPhone 8. However, users can be rest assured with the fact that the upcoming iPhone 8 will be more different (in a good way) from its predecessors. Stay tuned for more news and updates regarding the next-generation iPhones. Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

But has Sony done enough to fend off the competition? By André Schild. Added by Andre Schild on 14 November 2016. Saved under Reviews, Top Tags: Sony, Sony Xperia XZ, Sony Xperia XZ review, Xperia XZ Tweet The new 5,2-inch Sony Xperia XZ (R12 999) is the high-end successor to last year’s 5,2-inch Z5, while the 4,6-inch Xperia X Compact (R10 999) is the 2016 update to the similarly sized Z5 Compact. In contrast to the entry-level Xperia XA (R5 999), which proved to be a mixed bag, these latest Sony models are clearly targeted at anyone searching for a premium, high-end device and priced accordingly. So how does the pricey XZ do in practice, and how does it relate to its smaller (X Compact) and cheaper (XA) siblings? Design: some rough edges The Xperia XZ features a solid and generally comfortable exterior that clearly differentiates itself from rival flagships from Apple, Samsung, LG, HTC and Huawei because of the relatively sharp edges on the top and bottom. Its fingerprint reader is traditionally neatly integrated in the on/off button, located on the right side of the device — a distinctive design aspect since practically all competitive phones have this sensor located either on the front or rear. The only real downside to this side positioned fingerprint reader is that unlocking the phone while the Xperia XZ lies flat on a table or desk is a bit of a challenge. Compared to the 4,6-inch Xperia X Compact (135g) and the 5-inch entry-level Xperia XA (138g), the XZ is relatively heavy at 161g. This might seem marginal, but it adds up. With the XZ, Sony has finally made the leap towards official water and dust resistant (not proof!) certification. In theory, you shouldn’t have to worry about getting caught with it in the rain, or even washing off dirt under the tap. The catch is you must manually and firmly have to close the Sim card/memory card slot. Also, don’t expose it to liquids other than water, including seawater, salt water, chlorinated water or cool drinks. Abuse and improper use will undermine its IP65/68 rating and ultimately invalidate the warranty. The new Apple iPhone 7 (Plus), to put things into perspective, doesn’t have any ports that must be manually checked and closed. The Xperia XZ and X Compact are Sony’s first models to be equipped with modern, capless USB-C connectors for charging and data transfer purposes. Considering its limited resistance to water, this port should be completely dry before putting it into action. Sony’s official instructions to remove any moisture from the USB port is to shake the device several times with the USB port facing downwards and then use a micro-fibre cloth to wipe it dry. That all being sad, Sony’s new crown jewel generally feels and looks like a solid and premium device, but lacks elegance and refinement when stacked up to most other high-end phones. Screen: bright and colourful Sony’s latest smartphone features a 5,2-inch screen able to deliver a 1080p resolution using IPS-LCD technology, which is significantly, as well as visibly, higher than the 720p resolution employed on the X Compact and cheaper XA models. In the end, that all adds up to 424ppi of pixel density. In addition, maximum brightness levels of 612cd/m² on the XZ are on par with the Samsung Galaxy S7 (655cd/m²) and better than that of the iPhone 7 (590cd/m²). For an IPS-LCD screen, the contrast ratio, which greatly influences how vivid colours come across, is also very good (1 400:1), but unable to match that of the iPhone 7 (1 650:1) and the Galaxy S7’s Amoled technology. The Xperia X Compact offers a disappointing 1 060:1 contrast ratio. The Xperia XZ’s screen looks great, able to show content in bright sunlight comfortably with no visible pixels and with a top-notch colour palette. Camera: fully focused The rear/main camera of the Xperia XZ houses a 23-megapixel sensor that matches those of previous models, but which is now accompanied by a laser-autofocus system and special infrared sensor that should help find the right white balance. When directly compared to the captured image quality of last year’s Xperia Z5 device, the XZ indeed seems to be able to produce slightly better photo material. The combination of laser, contrast and phase-detection autofocus also makes the XZ a pretty fast device when correctly focusing on both persons or objects. Even in low-light settings, which are traditionally more challenging for smartphone cameras, the XZ stays on focus. During some short test runs, it flawlessly followed a moving object after highlighting it on the screen. The Xperia kept near-perfect focus on the moving object at all times. In the end, Sony implemented subtle but significant upgrades to the XZ’s camera, including better white balance and almost flawless focusing. Still, when push comes to shove, image quality can’t quite match that of the Apple iPhone 7, Samsung Galaxy S7 or even the new LG V20. Hardware and performance: smooth sailing Sony’s latest flagship device runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, 64-bit, quad-core processor, which on paper should be a big improvement over the Xperia XA’s beating heart and a minor one when compared to the Xperia X Compact. It also features 32GB of expandable storage space where the “budget” XA only came with 16GB. Connection-wise, the XZ offers all the bells and whistles you should expect from a new, high-end smartphone. It supports the latest 802.11ac Wi-Fi standard, 4G/LTE Cat 9, Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC. It also has a whole range of internal sensors to detect location, position, acceleration and movement. To find out how the raw hardware performance of the XZ related to other Sony models, as well as other high-end phones, I ran two separate benchmarks. Before commencing my test run, I updated all phones to their latest version, performed a factory reset and then left all options on their default settings. I first ran the cross-platform GeekBench 4 multi-core test to get a good indication of its processor and memory capabilities. The test clearly shows that both the XZ and X Compact have trouble keeping up with the high-end handsets from Apple, Samsung and Huawei. Still, in the grand scheme of things, both Sony devices can facilitate smooth operation. Only when stressed with demanding apps and heavy multitasking will they reveal their true hardware limits sooner than the faster phones. After GeekBench, I confronted the Xperia XZ with 3DMark Ice Storm, a benchmarking tool that focuses on determining the maximum graphical (GPU) performance, but also uses some main CPU and memory resources. This time, the Xperia XZ could easily rival the Galaxy S7’s horsepower. It is no match for the latest iPhone, though. The Xperia X Compact, on the other hand, fails to get along with the big boys. Battery life: all day long To power all its hardware, the Xperia XZ houses a 2 900mAh battery, which is slightly higher than the 2 700mAh on the Xperia X Compact and a considerable step up from the XA’s 2 300mAh capacity. In addition, the XZ has a few nifty tricks up its sleeve which aim to manage battery life to prolong future battery decline. It tries to learn your charging patterns and adapts to them, resulting in up to twice the battery lifespan — according to Sony, anyway. For instance, if you routinely connect the XZ with the charger at the end of every day, it will stop charging when it reaches 90% and add the last 10% right before you get out of bed the next day. The latter is most likely to be determined by the phone’s array of internal sensors, measured over a period of days. To find out how long the Xperia XZ lasts on a fully charged battery, I ran two benchmarks to emulate realistic user scenario’s while keeping screen brightness of all devices identical, simply to keep the comparison fair. The browser stress test, which follows a script that continuously keeps the devices browsing and scrolling through various websites until there is no more power left, showed that the XZ will get you through a full day. Taking some extra idle time into account, the Xperia XZ will last for about nine-and-a-half hours. The Xperia X Compact, with a smaller screen and lower resolution, but only marginally smaller battery, seems to have hit the sweet spot. It will last for more than 10-and-a-half hours, according this test. Still, both new Sony devices are clearly no match for the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7. The second test stressed both phones by displaying non-stop full-HD content. This time, the XZ and X Compact remained functional for a decent eight-and-a-half hours, but continued to pale in comparison to the Samsung. Conclusion With the Xperia XZ, Sony has managed to deliver a pretty good smartphone, but not a great one. It has a great screen, fast rear-camera autofocus, is water resistant (if you don’t forget to close the ports) and delivers smooth performance at an all-day-long battery life. What the XZ lacks, though, is elegance, refinement and innovation when stacked up to other premium, high-end smartphones. Compared to its predecessor, the Xperia Z5, the improvements are subtle and generally not that ground breaking, which is a missed opportunity given its steep price point. Nonetheless, it still gets a very decent 7,5/10.  — (c) 2016 NewsCentral Media Share this article Tweet Andrew Fraser “With the XZ, Sony has finally made the leap towards official water and dust resistant (not proof!) certification” Huh?

Yesterday AAPL: 105.71 -2.72 Samsung moves deeper into audio and in-car tech in Beats-like acquisition of Harman International Ben Lovejoy - 1 day ago @benlovejoy Samsung View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit With both smartphone and PC sales plateauing, tech giants like Apple and Samsung are always looking for new markets. Apple of course made a big bet on music with its $3B acquisition of Beats, and Samsung is now making an even bigger play by announcing plans to buy U.S. automotive component maker Harman International. The WSJ reports that the $8B deal will be the biggest one Samsung has ever struck, and it has more than a little in common with Apple’s purchase of Beats … Harman is best known for the audio brands it owns, covering both home and automotive markets. Harman brands include Harmon Kardon, Infinity, JBL, Lexicon and Mark Levinson. It also has a partnership with British audio specialists Bowers & Wilkins. Harman is also big in other forms of automotive tech, including embedded infotainment systems, connected safety and security systems, partnering with an impressive roster of car brands that include Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Chrysler, Jeep, Toyota, VW and more. The company is additionally involved in corporate technology and the Internet of Things. Automotive tech is arguably the market with the greatest potential for growth at present as the industry moves towards self-driving vehicles. This will not only drive demand for autonomous driving technology, but also means that in-car infotainment systems will become increasingly important as cars start doing the driving and their occupants need to find other ways to make use of the time spent travelling in them. It won’t be Samsung’s first move into the automotive market. While the company’s car business is not well-known outside Asia, it partners with Renault and Nissan to make three different models that date back to 1998 but still sell today: the Samsung SM 3, SM 5 and SM 7. It looks unlikely that Samsung will be looking to follow Apple into the streaming music business, however. Its previous attempt at a streaming music service, Samsung Milk, lasted just 18 months before it was discontinued.

Yesterday AAPL: 105.71 -2.72 Schiller: Apple tried touch screen MacBooks but doesn’t work for iMacs, landed on Touch Bar instead Zac Hall - 1 day ago @apollozac MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Despite what companies like Microsoft may be doing and what some customers continue asking for, Apple is really confident that you wouldn’t like a touch screen on your MacBook. Here’s Phil Schiller explaining Apple’s view on touch screen Macs to Backchannel‘s Steven Levy: Apple came to this conclusion by testing if touch screens made sense on the Mac. “Our instincts were that it didn’t, but, what the heck, we could be wrong—so our teams worked on that for a number of times over the years,” says Schiller. “We’ve absolutely come away with the belief that it isn’t the right thing to do. Our instincts were correct.” Of course, Apple is slowly introducing multi-touch to Macs with the release of new MacBook Pros that replace function keys with a dynamic touch panel… The reviews are starting to come in this morning and reception is mixed when it comes to the utility of the Touch Bar so far, and Schiller is confident that it’s the best approach for the notebook form factor. “Watch, iPhone, iPad, Macbook, iMac,” he said. “They really are all computers. Each one is offering customers something unique and each one is made with a simple form that perhaps is eternal. People in the industry may question them — we don’t, for some very simple reasons.” Translation: don’t expect an iPad/MacBook hybrid anytime soon like Microsoft’s convertible Surface products. Part of the reason may be that Apple wants a unified experience between notebooks and desktops. “We think of the whole platform,” he says. “If we were to do Multi-Touch on the screen of the notebook, that wouldn’t be enough — then the desktop wouldn’t work that way.” And touch on the desktop, he says, would be a disaster. Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd.” For Microsoft’s part, they’re launching what they call the Surface Studio — a giant iMac-like touch screen display that lowers into a giant iPad-like panel for artists. Apple’s take is that you can’t design the desktop operating system to be best for both touch and mouse input. He also explains that such a move would mean totally redesigning the menu bar for fingers, in a way that would ruin the experience for those using pointer devices like the touch or mouse. “You can’t optimize for both,” he says. “It’s the lowest common denominator thinking.” The messaging for now seems clear: don’t expect the Touch Bar to creep up to the display any time soon (if ever); instead, I’d expect iPads to get more powerful and dynamic in form factor (like Smart Keyboard for example) as Apple’s answer to this request from customers. For now, Touch Bar sounds more like Apple’s answer to a static row of function keys that may not get as much use as keys that could replace them. Multi-touch gestures on the trackpad may feel closer to touch — just not directly. Schiller’s reasoning here does suggest to me that iMacs will see the Touch Bar arrive in some form sooner or later. Can’t do touch screen MacBooks because it doesn’t work for iMacs, so Touch Bar can right? Schiller isn’t the only Apple exec to detail the company’s previous experimentation with touch screen MacBooks either. Craig Federighi hinted at the past experiments in recent interviews as well. Bottom line is don’t hold your breath on touch Macs in any form anytime soon if ever. Steve Jobs, of course, also spoke against the idea of touch screen Macs when selling the iPad: We’ve done tons of user testing on this, and it turns out it doesn’t work. Touch surfaces don’t want to be vertical. It gives great demo but after a short period of time, you start to fatigue and after an extended period of time, your arm wants to fall off. it doesn’t work, it’s ergonomically terrible. Touch surfaces want to be horizontal, hence pads.

Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei’s consumer business group, said yesterday the company expected to sell at least 10 million newly launched premium phones, known as Mate 9, a year in China, joining the fray against global giants Apple and Samsung to attract wealthy mainland smartphone users. “Huawei has landed in a high-priced segment which used to be an untapped territory for us,” Yu told reporters after a launch event. “We hope to eventually beat Apple in terms of customer experience, with better VR technologies, camera, and cloud computing services than theirs.” He added that as the company competed against global and domestic rivals in various battlegrounds, ranging from low-end products to high-priced ones, it would sooner or later regain the No 1 position on the mainland. Oppo and Vivo, subsidiaries of privately held BBK Electronics, leapfrogged Huawei to take the top two positions in the mainland’s smartphone market in this year’s third quarter, according to market research firm Counterpoint Technology. Huawei’s market share of 15 per cent on the mainland remains nearly unchanged from a year ago. Worldwide, it only trails Apple and Samsung. It’s a marathon rather than a sprint in the smartphone market, which is highly competitive and complicated Richard Yu, chief executive, Huawei’s consumer business group Shenzhen-based Huawei, renowned for building telecommunications networks, has become a major player in the consumer devices market in recent years. Yu said in Munich earlier this month that Huawei would rev up its growth in the smartphone market while seeking to move up a notch in two years. Huawei now has 9 per cent market share worldwide, compared to Samsung’s 20.1 per cent and Apple’s 12 per cent. “It’s a marathon rather than a sprint in the smartphone market, which is highly competitive and complicated,” Yu said. “I reckon that many of the current leading smartphone makers would be edged out in three to five years.” Huawei unveiled retail prices of its Mate 9 on Monday, with one of the models sporting a price tag of 5,299 yuan, the first time a home grown Chinese smartphone maker has launched a product selling at more than 5,000 yuan. It will directly take on Apple’s iPhone in the world’s most populated market, which is seen by millions of Chinese users as a premium phone with best customer experience. Yu said he was confident that Huawei could achieve sales of 10 million Mate 9 phones in a year, which has a new artificial intelligence feature – learning about the user’s habits and automatically putting the most frequently used apps within easy reach. On the mainland, Huawei also competes against Xiaomi, another popular smartphone brand led by Chinese information technology guru Lei Jun. “Runner-up position is by no means Huawei’s ultimate goal,” Yu told the South China Morning Post after the media briefing. “I can’t tell you when we can become the world No 1, but we definitely will.” This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Huawei out to capture world top spot   Most Popular Viewed 1 Modi’s key aide blames poor planning for India’s currency crisis 2 RIP: Hong Kong’s shopping industry, as e-retailers tighten their grip 3 China’s economy risks being washed aside by a Trump tsunami 4 How Chinese companies are taking virtual reality into whole new worlds 5 Buyers abandon Hong Kong property contracts as stamp duty bites Shared 1 RIP: Hong Kong’s shopping industry, as e-retailers tighten their grip 2 Modi’s key aide blames poor planning for India’s currency crisis 3 China’s economy risks being washed aside by a Trump tsunami 4 Chinese smartphone makers gain market share from Samsung’s exploding batteries 5 How Chinese companies are taking virtual reality into whole new worlds Commented 1 China’s economy risks being washed aside by a Trump tsunami 2 Duterte’s genial tone on the South China Sea is just one of many signs of warmer Sino-Asean ties 3 A performance we should all be ashamed of 4 Time for Hong Kong’s shrinking port sector to find new purpose 5 With its latest intervention in Hong Kong, Beijing wins the battle but is losing the war Promotions Register for a free copy of XXIV 2017 now Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like Politics One year on in Myanmar, is Suu Kyi’s halo slipping? 12 Nov 2016 - 12:00pm 3 China Pacific Rim nations urged to revise TPP without US before Trump cuts trade ties 12 Nov 2016 - 12:29am 15 Society Why China’s rise means Hong Kong stars like Jackie Chan will be the last of their kind 13 Nov 2016 - 7:23pm 14 Go Asia - Vietnam 11 Nov 2016 - 4:24pm Hong Kong Despite fears, new air traffic control system to be launched at Hong Kong airport on Monday 11 Nov 2016 - 11:26pm 3 Hong Kong Did CY Leung mess up his own oath?

Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 GO Hospital confirms injuries are caused by iPhone 7 Nov 14, 2016 14:05 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  The new iPhone 7 has caused a pregnant woman in Australia second-degree burns on her right arm after falling asleep with the phone in her bed. Melanie Tan Pelaez explains that she was using the iPhone 7 to watch movies in her bed while the device was plugged into a charger, but she fell asleep and didn’t get to disconnect the phone or put it on the nightstand. When she woke up in the morning, Pelaez noticed that her arm was red and felt pins and needles due to what seemed to be a superficial burn. She went to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a burn on the upper arm due to a foreign object, in her case the iPhone. “The hospital did a number of tests and told me the mark was a burn from a foreign object and told me to check around my bed to see what could be the cause of the injury,” she told news.com.au. The woman told the doctors that the only object in her bed was the iPhone 7, which she was using before falling asleep, and the markings on her arm matched the phone and the charger. Hospital documents confirm that the iPhone 7 was indeed at fault for the burns. “Patient representing for review of superficial thickness burn on right forearm. Burn sustained when patient slept on her mobile telephone - iPhone 7. Haemodynamically stable and afebrile,” the papers read. Apple only offered a new iPhone 7 Pelaez explains that after leaving the hospital, she went straight for the Apple Store to report the incident and have her iPhone checked. “Apple took my phone and details but said it couldn’t have been the phone because it didn’t have a distinct smell. I then got a call from a member of the executive team who told me they were now handing the matter and had sent the phone to a senior technician in California for testing,” she explains. The pregnant woman also took to Facebook to report the incident, adding that Apple only offered her a new iPhone 7 because they thought the device was not at fault. “Apple seems to think the phone isn’t to blame as it is designed to shut down, but my injury shows this isn’t the case. I’m just lucky because it could have been a lot worse,” she said. Pelaez refused to get a new iPhone from Apple, explaining that she doesn’t trust the device anymore, but it’s not yet known if she wants to pursue legal action or not. Apple has not issued a comment, and chances are it’ll never provide one given the fact that Cupertino handles these cases without disclosing a single detail of the investigation. Facebook post backfiring quickly The simple fact that the woman posted the incident on Facebook backfired quite quickly, with many users accusing her of trying to damage Apple’s image. There are also users who seem to believe that she is actually “working for Samsung,” while others blame her for sleeping with the phone in bed, especially when charging. “If you cover a device with your body heat and no air circulation to cool it, it will heat up. Press a hot device next to your skin... see what happens,” one Facebook user explains. If you do decide to check out her Facebook post (linked above), be warned that comments also include bad language. #Apple#iPhone 7#iPhone#iPhone explosion subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news iPhone 8 to Launch with Curved 5.0-Inch and 5.8-Inch Displays and No Bezels Father Says iPhone Nearly Caught Fire in His Daughter’s Pocket Trump Edition Gold-Plated iPhone 7 Up for Grabs for $3,000 iPhone 7 Plus Reportedly Explodes After Accidental Drop Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Hackers Steal FIFA Currency, Buy Houses and Expensive Cars with the Money WhatsApp Announces Video Calling Rolling Out to Android, iOS Users Microsoft Announces Black Friday 2016 Deals: Perfect Time to Go Windows 10 KDE Frameworks 5.28.0 Released with Numerous KWayland Improvements, More NVIDIA Makes Available GeForce Graphics Driver 375.86 - Get It Now Microsoft CEO Meets Chinese Official One Day After Warning on Trump Tax Plan Apple Downplays Microsoft Surface, Says Having Touch on a Desktop Is a Disaster    Second-degree burns caused by iPhone 7 new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments More Evidence Shows iPhone 8 Could Feature Revolutionary Wireless Charging more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Yesterday AAPL: 105.71 -2.72 MacBook Pro Review Roundup: mixed reviews on performance, potential for Touch Bar Jordan Kahn - 1 day ago @JordanKahn Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Today official reviews for Apple’s new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar have surfaced online as the first preorders for the device arrive to customers this week alongside a retail launch. Apple started shipping pre-orders over the weekend with the first deliveries expected to be in customers’ hands by early this week.  How does the new contextually sensitive Touch Bar panel embedded into the MacBook Pro’s keyboard perform in the real world? And are the rest of the machine’s hardware upgrades enough to warrant the price tag? The consensus seems to be that most enjoyed using the Touch Bar and noted its potential for the future. There are, however, mixed reviews when it comes to overall performance with many reviewers pointing out the price of the new MacBook Pros in relation to specs, performance, and the competition. Head below for the review rundown: WSJ: A Touch Bar, Touch ID and new design are tempting, but you’ll get the same performance and battery with the older model… So how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the “old” MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I’m doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out. The Verge (Walt Mossberg): The new 13” MacBooks — even the base model without the Touch Bar — are costly. And they may make pros unhappy. But, for everyday Mac lovers — users of the Air or maybe the older low-end Pro — they are now your only thin, modern, option with a full-fledged processor. The Touch Bar has potential, but it’s not magic. The battery isn’t likely to deliver on Apple’s claims. You can’t count on liking the keyboard. But, if you’re a Mac devotee ready to move past the Air — not back to a lower-powered MacBook — this is what Apple is offering. Take it or leave it. TechCrunch: The less celebrated spec bumps are what make the new Pro a worthy upgrade, particularly for those who, like me, have been suffering through their old system’s death rattles (or fan buzzing, at least), waiting for a significant update from the company. Better processors, more storage, a brighter display and better speakers are all wrapped up in a sleeker and lighter package than before… The Touch Bar feels like a nice bonus for the time being. It’s a compelling new input device that has the potential to alter the way we interact with applications on a laptop. CNET: But for the other 95 percent of the laptop market, the MacBook Pro remains a compelling choice. It’s far and away Apple’s most-advanced laptop. The touchpad has double the surface area of the previous model, it’s about as light as a MacBook Air but much thinner (14.9mm versus 18mm), and the flatter butterfly style keyboard has been subtly tweaked to work better here than it does in the 12-inch MacBook. Engadget: Touch ID and a thinner design are nice, but give me back my ports. (And my Function keys.)… I’m one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn’t quite what I wanted. For me, the ideal MacBook Pro is actually a mashup between this and last year’s model. Gizmodo: Third-party support for the Touch Bar is sparse but growing. Expect apps focused on design and coding to adopt first… Touch ID on the Mac is awesome… Performance is top notch across all of our benchmarks but if you’re getting the 13-inch, consider spending the extra $200 on 16GB of RAM now, since you cannot upgrade later. ArsTechnica: If you’ve got a MacBook Pro that you bought in 2012 or earlier and if you’re convinced of the potential utility and novelty of the Touch Bar, these 2016 MacBook Pros were just about worth the wait. Replace a four- or five-year-old laptop with one of these and you’ll get a great new design, a respectable performance boost, a nice screen, the single most versatile port you can get in any computer, and a new input device…The main problem at this point isn’t that the Touch Bar is a bad idea, but that these laptops cost a whole bunch of money. Macworld: These new MacBook Pros have a lot going for them. Their biggest weakness, across the whole Touch Bar line, is price…These prices could come down a little bit next generation, but if you need a MacBook Pro right now, the late 2016 models are solid performers. If I were buying one for myself, I’d go with the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and max out the storage, although the 15-inch model is even better. Mashable: Apple will never wins awards for affordability. This 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, Core i5 system starts at $1,799 — $300 more than the entry-level, traditional function-key sporting MacBook Pro. There are cheaper Windows 10 systems out there that offer better specs and full touchscreens. A 13-inch Core i7 HP Spectre x360, for instance, lists for $1,149.99 (the Mac offers slightly better graphics, an Intel HD Graphics 550 as opposed to the 520). If, however, you are a Mac fan, this is an excellent upgrade with a fascinating and highly extensible new Touch Bar. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Author: David Pierce. David Pierce Gear Date of Publication: 11.14.16. 11.14.16 Time of Publication: 8:00 am. 8:00 am Review: Apple MacBook Pro With Touch Bar The new MacBook Pro comes in three flavors: two 13-inch models and a 15-incher. They all have thinner bodies, better screens, and trackpads so big they blot out the sun. And you can buy it in space gray. But the important addition is the Touch Bar. This capacitive strip of OLED glass above the keyboard is supposed to change everything, again, about how you use your laptop. recommends 2016 Apple MacBook Pro With Touch Bar 8/10 Learn How We Rate Wired Thinner, lighter, prettier. There's no such thing as a too-big trackpad. The Touch Bar is remarkably well-executed. The ability to charge from any port is pretty great. Tired The world is not quite ready for USB-C, and you're not either. The Touch Bar needs more customization, and soon. Laptops aren't supposed to be this expensive, are they?

It’s been several years since the last big MacBook update, and mine is, like yours, long in the tooth. I’d been waiting for a reason to buy a new one, and jumped at the chance to try the new Pro. This is supposed to be it! The laptop of the future, and the future of the laptop. After using it, poking and prodding it, and plugging things into it, I have one word of advice. Wait. Can Touch This People love Apple computers because Apple gets the basics right. The keyboard, the trackpad, the screen, the speakers, all the table-stakes things too many companies get wrong. And in most cases, Apple made the best even better with the new MacBook Pro. Apple’s Touch Bar doesn’t quite count as a revolutionary overhaul, but it’s certainly the biggest change Apple’s made in years. The trackpad doesn’t physically click, but feels like it does, and it is so big and smooth you’d be crazy to use a mouse. The keyboard (a refined take on the 12-inch MacBook’s butterfly keys) doesn’t have much travel and takes getting used to, but it’s accurate and crisp and works beautifully. The speakers are louder and clearer than ever. I get eight or nine hours from the battery, as long as I’m not Photoshopping all day and keep the brightness below eye-bleeding levels. And the screen is, well, the screen is ridiculous. Apple’s ultra-wide color gamut, on top of the super-high resolution, makes it the best laptop display I’ve ever seen. The 13-inch Pro, which I’ve been using, is a bit over half an inch thick and weighs almost exactly three pounds. I carried a MacBook Air for years, and this feels like that. (The footprint is actually a bit smaller.) Everything about it, even the charger, is smaller than ever. Apple could have kept the body the same and added more battery, or more power, but opted for smaller and lighter. How you feel about that says a lot about whether you’ll like the new Pro. Apple’s Touch Bar doesn’t quite count as revolutionary, but it’s the biggest change in years. The thin OLED strip, where the function keys used to be, knows which app you’re in, tries to guess which features or settings you might need, and puts them within reach (barely) of your fingertips. In Safari, the Touch Bar offers small indicators for each tab and bookmark, plus quick access for search and opening a tab. In Messages, it becomes the Emoji Bar, which is objectively the best thing ever. You can scrub through your timeline in Final Cut, or swipe through photo albums in Photos. There’s no new functionality here, just easier and more obvious access to common stuff. Technically, the Touch Bar works brilliantly. It’s fast and smooth and responsive. The textured glass feels great, and looks fantastic. Using my fingerprint on the Touch ID reader to log in and to pay for stuff is the best. But the implementation feels unfinished. With no function keys, shortcuts for adjusting brightness and controlling music are hidden in a tiny menu to the right of the Touch Bar. Three are accessible at a tap: mute, volume, and screen brightness. (What madman needs brightness controls that much?) Pausing or playing music—something I do about 45,000 times daily—requires carefully tapping on the tiny left arrow, waiting a moment for the menu to expand, then finding and pressing the button. “It takes a heartbeat longer to pause my music” hardly qualifies as a burn-it-down kind of problem. But the Touch Bar exists precisely to make these small, repetitive tasks easier. And too often, it just doesn’t have the option or button I’m looking for. The screen changes constantly, moving things around to the point where I can’t find anything. I’d like to see Apple open the Touch Bar so users can customize it. Then it could be everything I want it to be, because I could make it so. Right now, I’m subject to Apple’s best guess about what I want. Apple often guesses wrong. Pros, and Cons The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar costs $1,799. It has a 2.9GHz Core i5 processor, 256 gigs of solid-state storage, eight gigs of RAM, and Intel Iris 550 graphics. Most benchmarks show that it’s faster than the previous Pro without being preposterously so. Now, if you don’t know or care what any of that means, it’s probably way more computer than you need. So is the 12-inch MacBook, honestly. That’s probably a better machine, if you don’t need more than a browser. More MacBook Brian Barrett Missing the MagSafe Charger in the New MacBook? Here’s Your Dongle Brian Barrett The MacBook Pro’s Most Important New Feature? Touch ID David Pierce Hands On: The New MacBook Pro Is a Whole New Kind of Laptop Brian Barrett Apple’s New MacBook Pro Has a ‘Touch Bar’ on the Keyboard If you’re a spec-hungry power-user, you might be underwhelmed. You might not like that Apple called this MacBook “Pro” and made it even more expensive while using an old version of Intel’s processors, something less than the fastest graphics cards, and limited it to 16 gigs of RAM, max, on the super-high-end, $4,200 15-inch model. You definitely won’t like that Apple ditched every one of its previous ports in favor of Thunderbolt 3 ports jacks that require spending between $20 and $2 billion on adapters. In my experience, there’s plenty of power here. My workflow isn’t everyone’s, but I can run Photoshop, Photos, 25 browser tabs, Slack (which is weirdly power-hungry at times), and a handful of other apps, no sweat. It’s not enough for high-end gaming, or really intensive video editing, but it’s more than enough for everyone else. But the ports. Apple. WTF? I can conclusively say The Dongle Life sucks. It’s great that my laptop is smaller and lighter, but hunting through my bag for the tiny adapter to plug in my hard drive, which is different from the one I need for my monitor, which won’t work to plug in my phone, is infuriating exercise. Lots of people don’t connect things to their laptops, but those people aren’t the people who need a MacBook Pro. Pro users need RAID arrays, and second displays, and Ethernet connections. Apple’s response, as with so many things, is: We know better than you do, so give it a minute. USB-C is here, or at least coming quickly, and you need to get on board. If you don’t buy a USB-C computer now because you don’t want adapters, you’ll be buying adapters in a couple years to connect your new stuff to your legacy computer. Everyone complains, but figures it out. There’s no better way to kickstart the ecosystem than to put the new world order in front of the pros who will build it. All of that is true. But it won’t help you connect your SD card. Begin Upgrade Do you desperately need a new laptop right this second? If not, wait. Run your current (and probably still excellent) machine into the ground, then buy a new one. In a year or two USB-C accessories will be everywhere, developers will have figured out what the Touch Bar is good for, and Apple may even give the Pro spec bump. If you are in the market, though, consider your next purchase an investment and buy something this powerful, this nice, and this future-proof. Most people won’t need more oomph until we’re all living in VR, Ready Player One-style. Your best bet may be a MacBook Pro. Or, you could spend a lot less on a Dell XPS 13, HP Spectre 13, or Microsoft Surface Book, all of which are similarly great. The new MacBook Pro is a terrific laptop and, like the super-skinny MacBook, a clear indication of where most of the computing world is going. But comes with growing pains while your workflow and other devices adjust to a new way of doing things. I can eke another nine months or so out of my old Pro before springing for the upgrade. You probably can too. But we all need to start getting ready for the one-port, no-wires, un-repairable future now, because it’s coming. Go Back to Top.

On visiting the doctor, she was advised a visit to the hospital. Apple has sent the phone for testing by a senior technician in California. Apple has confirmed to News.com.au that it is investigating the matter with Pelaez. Apple also offered Ms Tan Pelaez a replacement iPhone, but she did not want it as she had lost faith in the company. Pelaez has been a long time Apple user and has not previously faced any problems with products by the company. On returning the phone, Apple executives had said that the source of the burn injuries could not have been the phone as the phone was designed to cut off power on overcharging. Pelaez has visited the emergency room in the hospital twice because of the burns, and is exploring the option of plastic surgery to fix the scarring. This is the second such incident from Sydney, Australia in recent memory. A biker had to punch the phone off his leg after the device burst into flames following a fall. An Apple iPhone 7 had reportedly exploded in China three days ago, after a 50 centimetre fall. For those fearing a repeat of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Fiasco, there were reports of over 30 Note 7 devices exploding over a course of a week.

Benchmark Awards Reports Blogs Topics CXO Challenge Whitepapers What's On Banks rubbish Apple's security claims over NFC access By Allie Coyne on Nov 14, 2016 11:09AM Claim tech giant has failed to provide proof. Apple's claims that opening up access to the NFC chips in its iPhones would compromise the device's security are unfounded, three of Australia's biggest banks say. Westpac, NAB, and the Commonwealth Bank, alongside Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, are currently lobbying the ACCC to let them join forces to pressure Apple into providing access to its NFC chips so they can offer their own mobile wallets on the iPhone. The banks started their campaign in July when they asked the ACCC to let them form a cartel. Their request for interim approval was denied in August, and the ACCC is expected to make a longer term decision imminently.  The banks argued Apple is limiting competition and customer choice by restricting them from offering services on iOS as they do on Android. Apple uses the NFC chip to run its Apple Pay mobile payments platform. Apple has claimed, among other things, that opening up NFC access would compromise the security of its devices. However, in their latest submission to the debate, the banks on Friday rebuffed Apple's claims and said the tech giant had failed to provide any evidence that opening up the NFC function would affect the security of the iPhone and any mobile payments platform running on it. Apple had cited cases where Android devices were susceptible to third-party attacks via malicious apps that use the device as an NFC reader, where attackers could obtain Samsung Pay tokens used by its MST [magnetic secure transmission] hardware, and where access to the NFC radio on Android could be exploited via published APIs. "It is important to distinguish between potential security issues that happen to involve Android devices, and the suggestion that the potential security issues actually arise because of the provision of access to the Android NFC function," the banks said in their submission. "None of the claims about potential security issues are directly linked to the provision of access to NFC functionality." The banks said each of Apple's examples involved older and less secure payments methods, or card details store in cleartext on merchant servers. "The applicants are not aware of any report that the payment methods used by NFC mobile wallets have been compromised on any platform," they wrote. "That is, if an authentic card is added to an NFC mobile wallet with security features that may include a hardware secure element, tokenised credentials and strong encryption, a secure customer verification method such as a long PIN or fingerprint verification, and a dynamic cryptogram generated for each transaction, it does not appear to have been demonstrated even in a controlled environment that these credentials can be stolen and used for fraudulent transactions." The banks argued NFC payments - which they said are typically low-value - presented a lower security concern than the sometimes large-value payments initiated through web browsers, QR codes, mobile banking apps and Bluetooth connections, which aren't always recoverable in cases of fraud, like NFC payments are. "Apple has not provided any credible argument to the applicants that granting access to the iPhone’s NFC function would present a particular threat to the security of iPhone payments or any plausible harm to iPhone users," they told the ACCC. "If it has provided any such argument to the ACCC on a confidential basis, the applicants urge the ACCC to test this argument with an independent technical and security expert. "Otherwise, the only conclusion to be drawn is that Apple is refusing to provide access to the NFC function in order to prevent competition with Apple Pay and avoid any downward pressure on the supra-competitive fees it can charge for Apple Pay." Last week Apple signed a deal with payment solutions provider Cuscal to bring Apple Pay to 31 of Australia's smaller banks and financial institutions. Cuscal said it will "soon" enable Apple Pay for the likes of Teachers Mutual Bank, My State, Credit Union Australia, Defence Bank, and Australian Unity, among others. Copyright © iTnews.com.au .

Everything about it feels more refined, sharper, and faster than your old laptop. But it’s probably out of your budget, and even though everything about it is better than what you’re used to, you can’t name one particular thing you miss when it’s gone. I’ve been using Apple’s MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, for the past week. It begins shipping this month starting at $1,799 for the entry level 13-inch version. Apple also offers a 15-inch model starting at $2,399 that includes a faster processor, boosted graphics, more memory, and a larger trackpad. As the laptop’s name implies, the most significant upgrade is the addition of a thin horizontal touchscreen called the Touch Bar, which sits just above the keyboard, where the function keys once resided. The Touch Bar’s big trick is its ability to change functionality based on the software you’re using — it will show media controls in iTunes and editing buttons in Photoshop, for instance. It’s a welcome upgrade along with the new Pro’s upgraded keyboard, snappier performance and other enhancements. But it’s not as radical a change as including a full-blown touchscreen, which Apple has yet to do despite the prevalence of touchscreen laptops on the market. The new MacBook Pros’ high price make them tough to recommend unless you’re a professional who might view a new computer as an investment. There are well-built Windows laptops out there with just as much power — and full-blown touchscreens — that cost considerably less. The Touch Bar is a nice addition, but it’s not enough to warrant upgrading if your current laptop is only a couple of years old or newer. Here’s a closer look at what it’s been like to use Apple’s new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Touch Bar The Touch Bar, the standout feature on the new MacBook Pro, is a classic Apple flourish: It’s not, strickly speaking, a must-have, but it’s pleasant to use nontheless. Put simply, it’s a tiny touchscreen whose buttons change as you hop around different apps. When browsing in Safari, for example, the center portion of the strip will display your currently open tabs, making it easy to jump between them. In Apple’s mail app, a trash can icon helps speedily delete unwated emails, while the “Move to” key helps you quickly sort messages into various folders. Most of Apple’s default apps already make good use of the Touch Bar, including Messages, Calendar, iTunes and more. Outside developers can incorporate the Touch Bar into their apps as well; you’ll find it used by Photoshop, Microsoft Office, 1Password and Pixelmator to start. I found the strip most helpful when it came to editing photos and videos, as it makes it easier to compare edited and unedited versions of photos as well as scrub through footage. Should you find yourself unhappy with the commands the Touch Bar offers by default, you can customize them to your liking. The Touch Bar also includes Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint reader, enabling faster switching between accounts as well as digital payments via Apple Pay.   AppleMacBook Pro Touch Bar While I like the Touch Bar, there are plenty of ways Apple could improve it. Not every shortcut implementation is perfect just yet — it’s nice to be able to switch tabs more quickly in Safari, for instance, but it’s tough to distinguish between different sites on the tiny screen. Nor does the Touch Bar accelerate the process of switching between apps. (Accessing the standard function keys, including the button to open Apple’s app-switching Mission Control interface, requires an extra tap when within an app.) That said, the Touch Bar is a welcome step forward in creating a computer that’s better able to adapt to users’ needs at a given time. But it’s not a necessity. Computer buyers who only need a laptop for light document editing and web surfing can steer clear of paying the extra $300 for the Touch Bar. (A non-Touch Bar version of the new MacBook Pro can be had starting at $1,499, while the company’s cheaper laptops and iPad Pros are also good options if you need an Apple machine.) Creative professionals, however, should give it serious consideration. Using It Apple’s new MacBook Pro offers other improvements, too. While it’s slightly heavier than the MacBook Air (2.96 pounds versus 3.02 pounds), its overall size remains impressively compact. The new Pro is both shorter and narrower than the Air. The refreshed MacBook Pro also features an updated version of Apple’s butterfly-style keyboard, which the company introduced with the 12-inch MacBook. Although I was reluctant to embrace that keyboard when it first appeared — it always felt too shallow to me — I enjoy typing on Apple’s latest effort. The keys feel deeper and less stiff, making it easier to type quickly when compared to previous Apple laptops. The new laptop’s trackpad is significantly larger than that of Apple’s previous efforts, which provides more room for gestures like pinch-to-zoom. Still, I found the bigger trackpad to be more of a hinderance than a benefit. I keep right-click enabled on my Mac as my secondary click mechanism, so I often found myself accidentally right-clicking when I meant to single-click. The Retina display on the new Pro is exceptionally beautiful, and will be one of the most noticible upgrades for anybody upgrading from a MacBook Air. The 2,560×1,600 display makes colors and text pop in a way that the MacBook Air’s 1440×900 screen simply can’t match. Performance, Battery Life, and Connectivity The MacBook Pro’s battery life seemed to fall in line with Apple’s claims of a 10-hour lifespan. I was able to get through a workday with a little power to spare before the laptop shut down, which is satisfactory but outpaced by the 13-inch MacBook Air. The MacBook Pro, as its name might imply, is capable of handling far more than just casual computing. Whether I was running video games on their highest graphics settings, opening and editing high resolution photos, or browsing Safari with 10 or more tabs open, I never saw any performance hiccups. Before buying the MacBook Pro, you ought to consider the port situation. The new laptop includes four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports, with nary a standard USB or SD card slot to be found. USB-C offers plenty of benefits over older ports (like faster file transfer speeds), but we’re still in the middle of a transition period, meaning you’ll probably need to buy some adapters for connecting your MacBook Pro to external displays, a camera memory card, or even, yes, an iPhone. That’s going to be a headache for many potential buyers, especially professional users who rely on lots of peripherals to get their job done. Apple has long been known to make controversial connectivity decisions. The MacBook Air was initially derided for its lack of an optical drive, while the more recent omission of a headphone jack on the iPhone 7 invited similar complaints. For its part, Apple says wireless connectivity and USB-C are the future. That’s likely true, but it’s not particularly helpful to those who’ll need to spend extra money on dongles. (Apple responded to an outcry over the MacBook Pro’s port situation by reducing the price of adapters through the end of the year.) Conclusion Windows PCs have undergone huge transformations over the past several years: they’ve gained touchscreens, the ability to bend and twist, and many can pull double duty as tablets. Apple’s MacBooks haven’t changed nearly as dramatically — using an Apple laptop built in 2015 is largely the same as using one from 2010. Apple’s new MacBook Pro changes all that, finally revealing what Apple believes is the next step for its laptops. Unlike many Windows manufacturers, Apple isn’t trying to compeletely reinvent the laptop. Rather, it’s thinking about how laptops can get smarter, with features like the Touch Bar that adapt to meet users’ needs at a given time. Early reports indicate Apple may double down on this concept with an entire keyboard of context-aware buttons, rather than just a single row. Still, the new Macbook Pro isn’t for everybody. As helpful as it may be for digging through your inbox or inserting emojis into your chats, its steep price means it’s a better buy for media professionals rather than everyday users. (And even they will have to deal with the port situation.) For the rest of us, there are plenty of cheaper options, including Apple’s lower-end laptops, its iPad lineup, and excellent-yet-affordable Windows laptops like Dell’s XPS 13. 4 out of 5 stars Pre-order now: 15-inch model starting at $2,399 here, 13-inch starting at $1,799 here Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Microsoft, Apple and Google Aim to Extend Touch Technologies to a World of new Devices and Applications | Main | Samsung Aggressively Gets into Apple's Face with Moves into AI and Telematics with Harman Acquisition » November 14, 2016 Chinese State Publication Warns President Elect Trump that any Tariffs on Chinese Goods Would be bad News for Apple   Last week Patently Apple posted a report titled "Chinese Cyber Security Law goes into Effect in June 2017 that may Require Apple to surrender iOS Source Code." The report noted that "China has green-lit a sweeping and controversial law that may grant Beijing unprecedented access to foreign companies' technology and hamstring their operations in the world's second-largest economy." So unilaterally China appears to be threatening U.S. tech companies by such new legislation. With President Elect Trump wanting to push back against China's monetary manipulation and unfair trade practices, a Chinese state publication sent a message out to President-Elect Trump that they have the cards to hurt the U.S. in any trade war.   The fear mongering rhetoric has already kicked into high gear this morning in China as a State-backed newspaper decided to do a little saber rattling of their own towards President Elect-Trump. CNBC reports that the publication has clearly stated that "Apple iPhones and other U.S. goods could suffer sales hits in China if president-elect Donald Trump goes through with his 'naïve' plan of slapping a large import tariff on Chinese products." So it appears that China will use Apple as a bargaining chip in any negotiations with Trump.   During his election campaign this year, Trump spoke of a 45 percent import tariff on all Chinese goods while failing to outline how it would work. Should any such policy come into effect, China will take a "tit-for-tat approach", according to an opinion piece in the Global Times, a newspaper backed by the Communist party.   "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.," the Global Times article read.   But the Chinese newspaper was not convinced Trump would go through with his suggestion, calling it "merely campaign rhetoric" and questioning its legal validity. U.S. law dictates that presidents can only impose tariffs of no more than 15 percent for a maximum of 150 days on all imports,   The report further noted that "If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-U.S. trade will be paralyzed," the Global Times said.   Lastly the CNBC report stated that "The opinion piece said Trump was a 'shrewd businessman' and would not be naïve, but, if he was serious with the policy, it would affect a number of U.S. industries."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

It's got a blisteringly fast processor, 3D Touch gestures, Touch ID, motion tracking, and a camera that shoots eye-popping 4K video. Still, there are plenty of ways you can get more out of the device, thanks to a range of quality accessories made especially with the smartphone in mind.  We've picked out a selection of the best gadgets available, that could have you enjoying your iPhone in ways that might never have crossed your mind, and help you resist upgrading to the iPhone 7. To create this list, we've scoured the web for the things we're most impressed by, offering some cool features to enhance the power of your smart timepiece. We've ranked these from cheapest to most expensive according to prices at time of writing  - however, some variation may occur over time.  1. Coolead Selfie Stick with Monopod A feature-packed stick for all your selfie needs Colors: Black, Blue, Gold | Material: Carbon fiber Compact Cheap Doesn't match all iPhone 6S colors It's a selfie stick There's a selfie stick, and there's a selfie stick from Coolead. On top of the standard handle and extended mode, this has a monopod and a detachable Bluetooth remote for completely hands-free use. All the functions are operated using four buttons on the handle, and the whole thing retracts into a compact little device perfect for chucking in a handbag. 2. Apple 12W USB Power Adapter Gets your iPhone charged up in record time Colors: White | Material: Plastic Speeds up charging Affordable Only comes in white Still not true fast charging As the iPhone 6S only has a fairly small battery unit compared with the big bad Androids on the scene, it only takes a couple of hours to charge up even though it still uses a very basic charger. However, you can actually get faster charging if you get hold of the more powerful 12W charger Apple reserves for iPads. Both chargers have the same voltage, but the 12W iPad one is juiced-up with extra current to stop the giant battery units of the iPads from taking a small eternity to fill up. Until the iPhone 6 generation, using this charger for iPhones wouldn't result in quicker charging, but now it does. We're not talking the sort of fast charging speed you get with Qualcomm Quick Charge, used in a bunch of Android phones. But until Apple gets up to speed and decides to nick this idea, we'll take any improvement. 3. iOttie Easy One Touch 2 Car Mount An affordable car mount fit for most smartphones Colors: Black | Material: Plastic Good value Fits most phones Only one color option Plain design This is a great solution if you want easy access to your iPhone when you're in your car. A 360-degree rotatable mount sits on a strong suction cup for a secure fit on your window or dash, plus the holding frame has an opening to connect a Lightning cable for in-car charging (and CarPlay, if you're lucky enough to have that). If your other half uses the same car and owns a different phone, no problem - the iOttie mount can be adjusted to compensate for bigger devices and can hold anything between 2.3 and 3.2 inches wide. 4. Mad Catz C.T.R.L.i Takes your gaming to the next level Colors: Black | Material: Plastic Comfortable to hold Built-in stand Looks cheap Only comes in black Here's one for the big iPhone gamers. The Mad Catz C.R.T.L.i is one of the best smartphone game pads around right now. The SteelSeries Nimbus looks a bit classier, but what the Mad Catz gets you is an inbuilt stand that keeps your iPhone in the right spot. It's not like you're going to want to play Modern Combat 5 with one hand on the pad, the other holding the phone, is it? While the Nimbus is the first pad to be advertised as 'made for Apple TV', the Mad Catz C.T.R.L.i will work with Apple TV games too if you're thinking of getting an extra Apple box for your lounge, and the controller's design is roughly based on an Xbox pad, making it a joy to use. Read the full review: Mad Catz C.T.R.L.i 5. Monoprice 5200mAh Battery Backup with LED Flashlight Keeps your iPhone going all weekend Colors: Silver, Metallic Blue, Black | Material: TBC High capacity Charges other devices Not super cheap One more thing to carry around Sick of finding your iPhone battery almost dead when you're out on the road? Then never again leave the house without this power pack from Monoprice. Its 5200mAh capacity is enough to recharge your iPhone 6S at least twice - more than enough for a weekend away, we reckon. The pack also charges other devices with USB connectivity. All you do is plug your phone's Lightning cable into the battery's port for charging to commence, while the battery itself is charged via a micro USB to USB cable. It even packs a powerful LED flashlight on the other end. What's not to like? 6. Aircharge Wireless Charging Case Gives you a new way to charge your iPhone Colors: Black/White | Material: Plastic Adds wireless charging support Provides some protection Chunky Covers up your phone It can take Apple a long, long time to adopt new technologies. Its iPhones have only fairly recently received NFC, and there's no sign of wireless charging yet. However, you can crowbar this feature in with a remarkably affordable case - the Aircharge Wireless Charging Case. It only costs as much as a slightly higher-end phone case, but packs in a Qi (pronounced "chee") sensor that lets you use any Qi charging base to power your iPhone. You'll find scores of these online, and even IKEA has got in on the action. 7. Olloclip 4-in-1 Adds four powerful new features to your phone's camera Colors: Silver/Black, Space Gray/Black, Silver/White, Red/Black, Gold/White, Rose/White | Material: Glass and plastic Makes the camera more powerful Lots of color options Easy to lose Not cheap The iPhone 6S camera is powerful, but it's not the most feature-packed of snappers out there, which is where the Olloclip 4-in-1 comes in. This lens bundle goes way beyond just adding an app mode or two, it's a module you plonk on top of the phone, covering the lens and adding another lens element in front. While an Olloclip 4-in-1 will disappear in your pocket - it's pretty tiny - it actually gets you four new lens modes, all with new optical effects. There's no software nonsense going on here. It's a two-sided little gadget, and there are little screw-on extras that modify the lenses. As well as dramatic fisheye and wide-angle views, there are two macro zoom lenses too, offering 10x and 15x magnification. If you're willing to spend a bit more you can get better optics from the Moment lens kit, but it's also much harder to get hold of. And you can create some real Instagram-baiting shots with an Olloclip already. 8. ThinCharge Battery Case Adds battery without adding too much bulk Colors: Black, Gold, White | Material: Plastic Protective Slim Plain design 2600mAh capacity is lower than some cases Most battery cases add significant bulk to the iPhone Apple worked so hard to slim down, but not the ThinCharge. The makers claim it's the thinnest battery case on the planet, and they could be right. At just 11mm deep and 70g, the fact this can charge up a dying iPhone is nothing to sniff at. The two-part design also offers some decent protection from falls, and uses a Lightning connector to charge (not supplied). 9. Griffin Survivor Powerbank A hefty power pack full of juice Colors: Black | Material: TBC High capacity Durable Sizeable Pricey Griffin brings its Survivor smarts to a charging accessory with the all-terrain Powerbank, which packs up to three full recharges for an iPhone 6S Plus - and can even bring a drained iPad Pro back to life. Energy levels are indicated by the LED fuel gauge, while military spec drop protection, port covers and impact resistance ensure the Powerbank stands up to even the most unforgiving environments, making it perfect for camping or off-piste business travel. It even includes an emergency torch! 10. Quad Lock Bike Mount Kit A simple and secure bike mount Colors: Black | Material: Polycarbonate and TPU Protective Simple to use Only one shade Not cheap If you want a stable and secure mount to affix your iPhone 6S to your handlebars, Quad Lock is the brand to opt for. The mount's locking system is a simple twist-to-lock single step solution for holding your phone in portrait mode while you ride, and the tough dual-layer polycarbonate and TPU holder case (supplied) keeps your device protected while you're on the trail. 11. Plantronics BackBeat Fit Headphones built for runners Colors: Blue, Green, Power Blue, Sport Gray, Stealth Green, Fit Fuchsia, Black Core | Material: Plastic and rubber Secure fit Lots of color options Lack extra features Seem basic for the money Like running? A good pair of wireless earphones should be right near the top of your Christmas list. Our favorites of the moment are the Plantronics BackBeat Fit, a pair our marathon-running mobile editor Gareth swears by. The difficulty when designing a pair of wireless earphones is how to get the things to stay in your ears after potentially hours of being jogged about like a pair of socks in a washing machine. Thanks to their malleable rubbery ear hooks, the Plantronics BackBeat Fit nail it. Their sound is strong too, rounding-off a truly great pair of sport-ready earphones. They don't have things like integrated pedometers or heart rate monitors, but they do ace the basics, and that's what really matters. 12. Moov Now A clever tracker at a good price Colors: Fusion Red, Aqua Blue, Blizzard White, Stealth Black | Material: Plastic and rubber Unique look Good value No screen Divisive design This tiny little activity tracker doesn't try to do everything, or dazzle you with a bright screen, it's much more interesting than that. This screen-less wonder is a pure activity tracker, but it's far more than just another Fitbit step counter. As well as counting your steps, it has preset activities for all kinds of stuff in its app. Guitar Hero-style cardio boxing, running efficiency training, cycling, swimming. And what Moov Now offers over the competition are audio prompts to egg you on. If you want to blossom from couch potato caterpillar to triathlon butterfly, this is the budget fitness tracker you need. Trust us. 13. Grovemade iPhone Dock A premium wooden dock that looks as good as your phone Colors: Walnut, Maple | Material: Wood and steel Stylish Premium Expensive Only two wood choices Luxury, precision-made iPhone docks start here, with this slab of hand-sanded and oiled walnut or maple from Grovemade. The dock has a base of solid steel weighing three pounds, ensuring it stays in place whenever you remove your phone. The dock also has an ingeniously designed interior for routing through a Lightning cable (not supplied), allowing you to position the connector at just the right height so that your iPhone's case or bumper doesn't inhibit contact. 14. Philips BT6000 A compact speaker with strong sound Colors: White, Black, Blue, Red | Material: Plastic Compact and lightweight Weatherproof Lack of bass at lower volumes Auxiliary port exposed when used You don't have to spend loads of cash to get a good wireless speaker. If you want something to fling in your bag to bring out occasionally, you can do a lot worse than the Philips BT6000. It has two drivers and two bass radiators to get you much bigger sound than its dinky-ish size might suggest. The BT6000 can take some abuse too, and it's splash proof. We like to think of it as primed for parties. If you're willing to spend more the Bose SoundLink Mini II gets you much beefier sound from a box roughly the same size. But, hey, it's around twice the price. Read the full review: Philips BT6000 15. UE Boom 2 A stylish speaker for every occasion Colors: BrainFreeze, Cherrybomb, Green Machine, Phantom, Tropical, Yeti | Material: TBC Brilliant design Waterproof Not much of an upgrade from the original Boom Pricey If you're looking for a more affordable portable Bluetooth speaker than the Beoplay A1, found elsewhere in this list, then you can't go wrong with the rugged UE Boom 2, which boasts gesture controls and an on/off feature controlled from the app. The hand-washable, fully waterproof unit can maintain a connection with an iPhone up to 100 feet away and offers around 15 hours of audio output on a single charge. It's also drop resistant to five feet and stays lightweight at 548g, and can pump out bassy tunes through 360 degrees at a decent volume. Read the full review: UE Boom 2 16. Buffalo MiniStation Air 2 1TB A feature-filled drive that works wirelessly Colors: Gray | Material: Plastic Can charge your phone Wireless Plain Expensive This wireless portable hard drive from Buffalo is a great way of serving video, music and photos to your iPhone, thanks to its intuitive iOS app, which lets you stream media directly. Wireless N range is an impressive 20 feet, and the drive boasts encryption to keep your transfers secure. Apart from its USB 3.0 connectivity for wired transfers, the mobile NAS also has a second USB port for topping up your phone when you're away from home, while its 3020mAh battery should keep things ticking over until you return. 17. B&O Beoplay A1 Portable Bluetooth Speaker One of the best Bluetooth speakers available Colors: Black, Deep Red, Moss Green, Natural | Material: Aluminum Great sound Long battery life High price Not waterproof B&O marries looks with impressive sound in this compact, rugged speaker. The style and craftsmanship alone put it in a completely different bracket to the cheaper UE Boom 2, and its audio performance stands up to the premium category it carves out. It also sounds better than Bose's SoundLink Mini II, and that's saying something. The clarity and sonic detail defies the small profile, and coupled with its balanced dispersion and 24-hour battery life, the Beoplay A1 is sure to impress your friends. 18. AKG N60 NC Completely block out the world with these noise-cancelling headphones Colors: Black | Material: Leather and aluminum Noise cancelling Great sound Very expensive Only come in black For years, Bose has made recommending noise-cancelling headphones to people very easy. Until recently it offered the best combo of comfort and noise-nixing abilities, but the AKG N60 NC has really shaken things up. This ultra-portable set gets you great sound quality, and can neuter the noise of car engines at fifty paces. Not used a noise-cancelling set before? Rather than just blocking out the sound by creating a barrier between your ears and the outside world, the AKG N60 NC use microphones to monitor ambient noise, then pipe an inverse wave through that cancels that noise out. That's why it feels a bit weird when you first put a good pair of noise-cancellers on. Still, that means you can wear them on the train among a bunch of loud drunk people and not have to ramp the volume up. It's a gadget that's good for your blood pressure. 19. Zhiyun Z1-Smooth2 gimbal Lets you shoot smooth, judder-free footage Colors: Black | Material: Aluminum alloy Useful app Long battery life Expensive Can take some getting used to Recording 4K video on your iPhone 6S offers pretty mind-blowing results, and yet most amateur smartphone footage is marred by camera judder and shake. What if you could smooth out your videos in one fell swoop and make them look ten times more professional? The Z1-Smooth2 gimbal does exactly that. It's the perfect accessory for casual filmmakers who want to use their smartphone to capture eye-popping video. It's easy to operate thanks to the accompanying app and the Bluetooth buttons on the handle, it offers 360-degrees of steady rotation, the battery life is excellent and it works in both landscape and portrait mode. 20. Sennheiser PXC 550 Bluetooth headphones Premium headphones fit for a premium smartphone Colors: Black | Material: Synthetic leather Strong sound Noise-cancelling Very pricey Only available in black Sennheiser's answer to Bose's wireless flagship QC35 headphones offer a first-class package with enough features to keep even the most dedicated audiophile happy. The cans' adaptive noise-cancelling tech keeps things quiet on the outside while you enjoy the driver's superior sound for up to 22 hours on one charge (30 hours when wired). The touch controls on the ear cup and the lightweight, comfy design makes wearing them a treat the whole time, so much so you won't ever want to fold them away in the travel case.

Apple believes in doing things to increase its profit margins at the cost of its market share, and this has always been its principal marketing strategy. No 2017 Update According to Ming Chi Kuo, one of the best analysts at KGI Securities, Apple will be cancelling its annual upgrade for the new iPhones. Kuo reports in MacRumors that the company will not be releasing the 2017 update of iPhone SE. The 4 inches iPhone is a big it commercially and is in fact considered to be even better than the iPhone 7. The Reasoning  Why is Apple inflicting such a wound on itself is a question many are asking. Kuo states that there are two reasons behind the cancellation of the upgrade. One is in order to get an increase in the margins of the iPhone SE of 2016, as the older parts come down in price. Another reason is to eliminate or rather bring down the risks of cannibalization by the iPhone SE of 2017 on the sales of the iPhone 7, which is more profitable. Business Reasons The two reasons given above seem to make a lot of business sense, as Apple is well known to be more interested in getting a profit share rather than a market share. The company seems to be concerned over the sales of the iPhone 7. In addition, it is not acceptable for the company to admit that the iPhone 7 sales were impacted due to the customers preferring the budget model to the new iPhone 7 model. Negative Impact However, there is a flip side to the cancellation of the upgrade, as Kuo notes that if a new iPhone SE is ditched by the company, it will affect the sales figures. According to him, the shipments of the phone will come down by around 10% at the least during the second quarter of next year. The sales will be around 35 million compared with the sales of 40.4 million during the second quarter of this year. In fact, the saving grace of the second quarter this year was the demand for the budget model. Preference for Budget phones If users are given the choice of selecting an Apple phone and offered the iPhone SE or the iPhone 7 as options, most will go for the latest iPhone 7 to be sure. However, if you want to have an iPhone within a certain budget, undoubtedly most would go for the budget friendly iPhone SE. This is what Apple seems to be concerned about. If most users are concerned about the budget, they will move towards the SE model and this will hurt the new iPhone 7 market. Apple seems more focused on the iPhone 7 at the moment, so it will not allow its own product to compete with the new iPhone 7 models.

Anyway, these days sure prove that some secrets do get out before it is supposed to be out. Advertisement Just last week or so, we were able to see leaks of upcoming smartphone devices and TV services. This time we have encountered the iPhone 8 leak circling its way around the web as of this moment. The latest buzz suggests that the next flagship phone from the Cupertino company will be making major changes on their beloved phone. Although the public has just seen it released its iPhone 7, the next successor is already highly-anticipated. It will make the awaiting users anticipate more if the iPhone 8 leak rumours are to be believed. As the report says, the upcoming Apple phone is making a major update, one involving its all too familiar physical appearance. MacRumors reported that Barclays Research analysts with sources within Apple's supply chain claimed the tech company is set to release 5-inch and 5.8-inch iPhones that have curved and bezel-free designs in 2017. This means that the actual size of the iPhone will not change much but they believed it will feature curved displays. If it is to be believed, the 5.7-inch iPhone will be using OLED display technology. OLED technology for those who don't know yet, will be sharper and brighter. It is more energy efficient than the usual LCD technology currently on all iPhones. The OLED suppliers are reportedly Samsung and LG plus Sharp, who is now owned by Foxconn. Meanwhile, one of the widely-spread reports is about the iPhone finally losing its iconic home button. This is because the new iPhone is set to become thinner. The Barclays researchers don't believe it will move as an in-screen solution but they do expect that the screen might be extended on both sides to solve this problem. How that will play out still is unconceivable for now. Additionally, Game & Guide claimed that the device will have dual cameras. The lens is reportedly almost the same as the DSLR cameras. It was noted that the dual-camera of the iPhone 7 Plus was highly welcomed, so that might be one of the reasons why its camera will be like this. Advertisement The upcoming iPhone could also have a more powerful chipset and a higher RAM. Since the iPhone 7 has an A10 processor and a 2GB RAM, iPhone 8 might get the A11 processor. The Cupertino company is yet to make a statement regarding the following leaked details. In the first place no confirmation yet about an iPhone 8 has been made. If there is one, we know that Apple will surely promise to make a more efficient and faster device.

News Reviews Tech Tips Galleries Buying Guides Videos Talking Points SEARCH HOT GADGETS Samsung Galaxy Note 7 iPhone 7 Google Pixel Moto Z Play Xiaomi Mi Mix OnePlus 3T ZenFone 3 Max Nokia D1C is a phone not a tablet, images leak online Samsung to launch AI digital assistant service for Galaxy S8 Microsoft stops selling Windows 7, Windows 8 BlackBerry launches DTEK50, DTEK60 Android phones in India Home > Technology > iPhone 8 may come with truly wireless charging and bezel-less curved display Manish Sain   |   @fat_grizzly Last Updated: NOV 14, 2016 New Delhi Email Author Apple is expected to celebrate 10th anniversary of iPhone next year by launching a phone with remarkable features. So far these features are rumoured to an OLED curved display and wireless charging. While there doesn't seem to be anything remarkable, or first of its kind, in either of the features, a new report suggests that the wireless technology may actually be something to look forward to. According to BGR, Apple is working with a company named Energous to add a 'truly wireless technology' in the upcoming iPhone. The wireless charging technology so far requires the compatible phone to be placed on a charging pad, although it doesn't use any wires, it limits the phone's usability for the time it is being charged. The new technology will be different in this aspect. According to the report, Apple will implement some sort of module into the iPhone 8. The module will connect to a transmitter plugged into a wall socket. If the report is true, the setup will allow the iPhone 8 to charge wirelessly to a distance up to 15-feet from the transmitter. Energous has earlier said that it is working with a "tier 1" company. While this tier 1 company could be Samsung as well, however, Energous' recent deal with Dialog Semiconductor, a company that makes power management solutions for consumer electronics, suggests it to be Apple. Energous had announced a $10 million strategic investment from Dialog Semiconductor. It is to be noted here that Dialog Semiconductor's top customer is Apple. So all these dots connect and form a straight line pointing towards Apple and Energous working together. Earlier this month, Nikkei had also said that Foxconn is making wireless charging modules for the Apple. However, it didn't specify whether the modules will be used in next year's iPhone. Also read: iPhone 8 will have curved display and wireless charging. Here is everything we know so far We will have more certainty about a truly wireless charging in the coming months, in the meantime another report has come out that says the iPhone 8 will have a bezel-less curved display. Sharp corp's president, Tai Jeng-wu had told Nikkei that Apple will soon switch to OLED displays from LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) displays. The Nikkei report had suggested that there will be three iPhones next year. Two of these phones will come with the usual LTPS display while the premium variant will sport a 5.5-inch curved OLED display. Now Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn also suggest that the iPhone 8 will have a bezel-less display with curved edges on all sides. "iPhone 8 design didn't sound 100% locked down but we believe the move is to a bezel-less design with screen sizes getting larger and curved edges in the original envelope. The IP8 moves to 5" (from 4.7") and the Plus moves to 5.8" (from 5.5")," the analysts write. The report of iPhone 8 having a truly wireless charging technology and bezel-less curved display is definitely exciting, however, we suggest you to take these reports with a grain of salt. There are still many months before Apple launches a new phone, possibly named iPhone 8, and we will have more concrete reports by then.

Login Search Samsung to Buy Auto-Parts Supplier Harman for $8 Billion -- Update November 14, 2016, 04:07:00 PM EDT By Dow Jones Business News Shutterstock photo By Jonathan Cheng Samsung Electronics Co. agreed to pay $8 billion for U.S. auto-parts supplier Harman International Industries Inc., using its biggest acquisition ever to boost its position in the race among technology companies to shape the future of the car. The South Korean electronics giant said Monday it would pay all cash for Stamford, Conn.-based Harman, an audio pioneer that dates back to 1953 but in recent years has pushed aggressively into the automotive world. Alphabet has been testing software that enables cars to drive themselves, using modified Lexus SUVs and its own prototype vehicles built with help from auto suppliers including German mega-supplier Robert Bosch GmbH. The Google cars have driven a total of more than 2 million miles, gathering data to refine performance and safety. Apple has been working on building its own electric, self-driving car, in a secret initiative code-named Project Titan. This summer, after a number of stumbles, the company assigned Bob Mansfield, a veteran Apple executive, to take over and he subsequently shut some elements of Titan, The Wall Street Journal reported in September, leaving Apple's exact strategy a mystery. Samsung, which has taken a $5 billion hit this year for recall expenses and lost sales on its now-scrapped fire- prone smartphone, is positioning itself as a major supplier of components for the future car. It doesn't plan to make cars itself, but sees automotive technology, and the broader shift toward connected, driverless vehicles, as a promising growth area to sell more of its semiconductors, display panels and mobile services. "We think technology is more critical than being in the metal-bending business," Young Sohn, Samsung's strategy chief, said in a September interview. "If Apple wants to build cars, we want to be their supplier; Detroit, too. Anybody." Harman, perhaps best known for its Harman Kardon speakers and other audio gear, also has diversified under Chief Executive Dinesh Paliwal into software development and components for connected cars. Much of that has been done on the shoulders of major acquisitions, such as a $780 million deal last year for Mountain View, Calif.-based software services company Symphony Teleca. Harman, which had revenue of $6.9 billion in its last fiscal year, has secured big new contracts with General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. It has projected an order backlog of $24 billion. About two-thirds of its current sales come from auto makers. Mr. Paliwal said linking up with Samsung would give the two companies an edge in a competitive field. "Partnerships and scale are essential to winning over the long term in [the] automotive" industry, he said in a statement. "Strategically, this is a very big play for Samsung," said Mark Boyadjis, an analyst for research firm IHS Markit. "Samsung will get an instant and significant head-start into monetizing the automotive industry with Harman as a subsidiary." IHS Markit estimates the market for automotive hardware for infotainment, telematics, acoustics and display systems will soar to $61 billion in 2022 from $42 billion this year. The technological revolution in cars has also driven changes in the chip sector, with Qualcomm Inc. last month agreeing to pay $39 billion for NXP Semiconductors NV, the world's largest developer of chips for automobiles. Auto makers rely on suppliers for an increasing amount of technology in their cars. Samsung knows this well, as it serves as a provider of costly and complex lithium-ion batteries to Nissan Motor Co. and several others. It is also the world's biggest producer of memory chips that go into virtually every consumer electronics product. The acquisition of Harman is a rare big deal for a sprawling company that has long preferred to develop its own technologies in-house. Samsung's third-generation heir Lee Jae-yong has sat on the board of directors of Exor SpA, the controlling shareholder of Fiat Chrysler, for the past four years, and Samsung last year assembled a task force to look into different ways to jump into the automotive world. But after looking at how long it would take Samsung to build up those capabilities internally, executives decided it would be much faster to make an acquisition, according to people familiar with the matter, who added that talks with Harman began during the summer. Under the deal, which is subject to approval by Harman shareholders, Samsung will pay $112 a share in cash for Harman, which will be an independent subsidiary of Samsung. That is a 28% premium over Harman's Friday closing price of $87.65 a share, though it is below Harman's all-time high of about $145 in April last year. Harman's shares traded up 25% Monday afternoon at $109.71. Samsung's previous largest acquisition was a two-part, $840 million purchase of AST Research in the mid-1990s. Samsung sustained heavy losses before ultimately giving up on Irvine, Calif.-based AST, once the world's fifth-largest computer maker. As a result, for nearly two decades, Samsung's top management remained wary of big deals, preferring to build technology by pouring investment into research and development. In recent months, however, Samsung has turned to deal- making as a way to instantly build up its capabilities in emerging technologies such as mobile payments, cloud-based services and artificial intelligence. Samsung, which had a war chest of $71 billion at the end of September this year, has proven its willingness to spend freely to quickly gain a dominant position in a new industry. In just five years, it plowed roughly $3 billion into complex biologic drugs, where it is already one of the world's biggest players. This isn't Samsung's first try at the automotive industry. In 1994, Chairman Lee Kun-hee launched Samsung Motors, with assistance from Nissan, before being forced to sell control of the company to Renault SA after the Asian financial crisis in 1998. Evercore Partners Inc. advised Samsung, while J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Lazard Ltd. advised Harman. --John D. Stoll in Detroit and Tim Higgins in San Francisco contributed to this article.

It's ready for the brave new world of USB-C connectivity. And the Touch Bar is cool right now, with potential to spare. [Photo: courtesy of Apple] Harry McCracken 11.14.16 8:00 AM There’s a famous story about an Apple meeting that occurred soon after Steve Jobs returned in 1997. As the company's cofounder rationalized its product line—which at the time included a dizzying array of Mac versions—he sketched a grid on a whiteboard. Then he filled its quadrants with four computers—one desktop and one portable model apiece for consumers and for professionals. Though the grid showed that Apple would pare its offerings way down, it also acknowledged a basic reality: You can’t please everybody with one machine. Consumers have their preferences; professional users have theirs. Fast-forward to late 2016. At Apple’s October media event at its Cupertino campus, the company announced its newest MacBook Pro notebooks. The great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren of the computer that Jobs put in the professional/portable square of his grid, they're aimed at people who need serious computing muscle and advanced technologies and are willing to pay for them. The new MacBook in three versions: 13" without Touch Bar, 13" with Touch Bar, and the 15 incherPhoto: courtesy of Apple Making every potential customer happy in 2016 is no more of a cakewalk than it was a couple of decades ago. Some pro users—the sort whose work involves industrial-strength tasks such as advanced video editing—are disappointed with the direction of these new MacBook Pros. They say they’d prefer newer Intel processors than the ones Apple chose and higher maximum RAM capacity, and are wary of the Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports that the company has used to replace older, more familiar connectors. And as long as their laptop is powerful, they don’t particularly care if it’s thin and light or thick and heavy. Apple, however, does care about computers being thin and light. It's long achieved that goal in part by wringing out aging technologies before every last potential customer is willing to say goodbye to them, and doesn't obsess over most standard tech specs. It loves to fuss over basic aspects of the experience such as screen quality. And it wants to introduce features that help Macs stand out from the the Windows-PC competition, such as its unique new Touch Bar. Judged on those priorities, the new MacBook Pros are, in most respects, winners—assuming you can deal with their price tags. The line starts at $1,499 for the most basic 13" model, which lacks two major new features, the Touch Bar and Touch ID. For $1,799, you get a 13" version with Touch Bar, Touch ID, and slightly better processor, graphics, and Wi-Fi specs. The 15" model starts at $1,999. Prices max out at $3,499 for a fully tricked-out 15" unit. (I've been trying out both 13" variants and the 15" one, via review units supplied by Apple.) Thin Is (Always) In This being Apple, it’s no shocker that when you unbox a new MacBook Pro, the most instantly obvious thing is that there’s less of it. At 3.02 lbs and .59" thick, the 13" models are .46 of a pound lighter and .12" thinner than their immediate predecessors. They’re also only a smidge heavier than the 13" MacBook Air, and thinner than the chunky end of that wedge-shaped notebook—a striking improvement from the era when the Air earned its name by being far more pleasant to tote than the Pro. Meanwhile, the 15" model, at 4.02 pounds and .61" thick is .47 of a pound lighter and a tenth of an inch thinner than the previous version. It's among the most portable full-power 15" notebooks out there, and maybe the first big-screen MacBook that truly makes sense for folks who like their laptops light. The MacBook Pro's backside Apple remains iconic but no longer glows.Photo: Harry McCracken If you own a MacBook Air, you should know that Apple ups its build-quality game with the Pro line. Their top halves are a single sweeping surface rather than a screen indented in a frame; there's no plasticky hump at the hinge; they're available in both silver and gray; in general, they just feel more solid and deluxe. (As they should at these prices.) As it did with last year's 12" MacBook, Apple made these new Macs thinner in part by equipping them with a keyboard designed not to eat up much vertical space. Slightly improved in this new iteration, it sports keys that are roomy, stable, nicely sculpted, and illuminated with perfectly even backlighting. What they don’t have is the clacky full-travel feel that some people covet. My fingers (which are used to Apple’s Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro) adjusted quickly and found the results comfy. But if you’re a keyboard conservative, I recommend visiting an Apple Store and trying this one out before you commit. The 15" MacBook Pro's trackpad is bigger than a giant iPhone.Photo: Harry McCracken No such test drive is necessary for Apple's new trackpads: I can’t imagine anyone disliking them. As on the 12" MacBook and the the most recent previous round of MacBook Pros, they use Apple’s Force Touch technology, which means they're solid-state devices that uncannily mimic the feel of a click by vibrating. The fact that the trackpad doesn’t actually move up and down allowed Apple to make it larger; you can plop an iPhone 7 Plus down on the 15" model’s pad with space to spare. The extra real estate is a particular boon for maneuvers that call for precision, such as painting in Photoshop, as well as MacOS gestures that require you to splay your fingers out on the trackpad surface. Apple has done a sweeping, imaginative job of building Touch Bar functionality into MacOS. The trackpad may be bigger and better, but what sits above the keyboard on the $1,799 13" MacBook Pro and the 15" model is all-new. On the top-most, right-hand corner, where the power button has traditionally resided, there’s now a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, adopted from the iPhone and iPad. As on Apple’s mobile devices, it lets you unlock your Mac in a jiffy without a password and safely and swiftly pay at online stores that support Apple Pay. Coming soon: third-party apps with Touch ID support, such as a version of login manager 1Password. To the left of the Touch ID sensor, instead of the top row of function keys that have been part of computer keyboards since mainframe days, is the long, skinny, touch-enabled OLED display known as the Touch Bar. This is the first time Apple has made Macs you can control by tapping on a screen, and you might instinctively use the touchscreen PCs that are common in the Windows world as a reference point. In fact, I did that myself. But if you’re clamoring for Apple to put conventional touchscreens on Macs a la Microsoft's Surface—a move it's long said it has no interest in making—the Touch Bar will not mollify you even a tiny bit. Rather than being a halfway step to giving Macs a full touch interface, it’s an extension of the keyboard, designed to keep you productive without forcing you to lift your arm and jab at the main display. Apple underlined that point by giving the Touch Bar a predominantly black-and-white color scheme that matches that of the adjacent physical keys; even its surface feels much like the nearby keycaps. (As I used it, I tended to forget it was a screen at all.) The $1799 13" MacBook Pro (left) has Touch Bar and Touch ID; the $1499 model does not.Photo: Harry McCracken Conceptually, the Touch Bar offers two related benefits. With just a tap or two, it lets you access features that would ordinarily require you to swipe a mouse pointer around using the trackpad or a mouse. And because it can show features that are specific to the app and task you’re performing, it's able to expose functionality that would otherwise be buried deep in on-screen menus or toolbars. The Touch Bar's most straightforward substitute for the classic top row of keys is called Control Strip. It gives you virtual keys for tweaking the brightness and volume, managing windows, and performing other jobs that the old keys did. But the Control Strip, unlike the plastic keys it replaces, is customizable. Want a button to lock the screen or call up MacOS’s dictation feature? Fine—you can drag it onto the Touch Bar as a substitute for one of the default buttons. Control Strip lets you reconfigure the Touch Bar by dragging buttons right off the display.Photo: Harry McCracken Where the Touch Bar really gets interesting is when you’re using an app that’s been designed with it in mind. In that instance, the Control Strip collapses down on the right side of the Touch Bar, and the rest of the space is devoted to functions specific to the task at hand. If you’re entering text in an app such as Messages, for instance, you get an emoji picker as well as smartphone-style autocomplete suggestions for the word you’re typing. Touch Bar word and emoji suggestions Apple has done a sweeping, imaginative job of building Touch Bar functionality into MacOS and the apps that ship with it. In Photos, for instance, you can dig deeply into the features for fiddling with an image without removing your finger from the Touch Bar. In Safari, you can skim through teensy half-a-pinky-size thumbnails of your open tabs. In the Numbers spreadsheet, you can construct formulas and format cells. In Reminders, you can check off completed to-dos or give yourself more time to tackle them. And on and on. Some apps—but not all of them—let you customize their Touch Bar capabilities in the the same way you can rearrange the Control Strip. Editing a photo in Apple's Photos app via the Touch Bar This context sensitivity will not be limited to Apple’s own wares. At the MacBook Pro launch event, Adobe previewed an upcoming Touch Bar-aware version of Photoshop that could make it a lot simpler to make the most of that notoriously opaque program. By the end of the year, Apple says, a bunch of other popular MacOS apps will support the Touch Bar, including Microsoft Office, Skype, OmniFocus, Pixelmator, Coda, Sketch, and more. (If Chrome doesn’t join that list, it might force me to switch to Safari.) Hardcore touch typists will have to adjust their work habits. Assuming that third-party developers take the Touch Bar seriously—and Apple puts it on other machines, such as the iMac—it could become an indispensable part of the Mac interface. But it isn’t the sort of feature you encounter for the first time and immediately begin using as if you’d known it for eons. For me, it took a few days of use before I’d figured out all the major icons and was able to maneuver around on autopilot. (Apple provides some tips and tricks, but something closer to a full-blown interactive tutorial might have been in order.) Hardcore touch typists will also have to adjust their work habits: The Touch Bar requires you to at least peek at your keyboard as you work. This fact bothered me more in theory than in practice, perhaps because it's located close enough to the main display that I was able to glance downward when I needed it. The more useful you find the Touch Bar, the more likely it is that you’ll come up with ways it could be even better. At first, my right hand's ring finger had a tendency to brush against the Siri button and accidentally trigger it, so I removed Siri and replaced it with a section of blank space. But it turned out I could only do that in the full-width Control Strip, not the reduced-size one. I also found that the media-player feature sometimes didn't work or played back sound effects such as Slack's alert ping rather than anything I'd want to control. On the Touch Bar, your Safari tabs are really tiny Ultimately, not every Mac user is going to take to the Touch Bar. But I think that some skeptics will have second thoughts after they’ve gotten their fingers on it for a while. And I’m looking forward to seeing where Apple takes this concept with Touch Bar 2.0, 3.0, and beyond. Port Overhaul When Apple takes bulk out of a laptop, it often does so in part by retiring components that it thinks are headed for the parts graveyard anyway, such as DVD burners and Ethernet jacks. In the case of the new MacBook Pros, this streamlining comes mostly in the form of providing Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports to replace a disparate collection of connectors. The previous MacBook Pros had a MagSafe power connector, two USB ports, two Thunderbolt 2 ones, an HDMI jack for TV hookups, a headphone jack, and an SD memory-card slot. The new $1,799 13" model and the 15" one boil this down to the headphone jack—insert your own iPhone 7 reference here—and four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ones. Two Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports and a good old headphone jack.Photo: Harry McCracken I say "Thunderbolt 3/USB-C" because while the two technologies use the same slim, reversible connector, they aren’t actually the same thing. Between them, the vision is to let you plug into AC adapters, displays, storage devices, and more, all using one do-everything port. Fast Company contributor Glenn Fleishman does a good job of sorting out the details, which are manifold, in this article. When Apple introduced USB-C last year on the 12" MacBook, it went overboard with minimalistic zeal and equipped the machine with one port, which meant you couldn’t even plug in your laptop and charge your phone at the same time without the use of an external adapter. The four ports you get on the higher-end 13" MacBook Pro and the 15" model should be enough for almost anybody. The $1,499 MacBook Pro has only two ports, located on the left side, which is (barely) adequate—but I wish Apple had put one on each side of the case, which would let you more conveniently charge your Mac regardless of whether you're sitting to the left or right of a power plug. Apple didn’t go whole-hog for Thunderbolt 3/USB-C without reason. Even with a MacBook Pro with plentiful ports, the issue remains that Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C are not yet anything like commonplace. Devices such as desktop monitors, hard disks, and thumb drives that are built for them are still greatly outnumbered by ones designed for earlier standards. For now, if you buy one of these MacBook Pros and bide your time until the new standards are widely supported, you'll have to invest in the necessary cables and adapters—available from Apple at temporarily discounted prices as well as from other makers—to make your new Mac work with old stuff. Or in some cases you might just go wireless: For instance, Apple says that it ditched the SD slot in part because so many new cameras ship with built-in Wi-Fi. Now, Apple didn’t go whole-hog for Thunderbolt 3/USB-C without reason. The company has always been willing to usher customers into a period of disruptive transition in order to help propagate new standards. (Exhibit A: The iPhone’s Lightning plug, which replaced the once-pervasive Dock connector and had some folks squawking for a spell.) This is a strikingly different philosophy than that practiced by many makers of Windows PCs—companies such as Dell will still sell you a laptop with an elephantine, 1980s-era VGA port if that is what you want. As in previous instances, the fact that Apple has embraced these new technologies with such gusto should help nudge the rest of the industry to do the same that much quicker. But that doesn’t mean that you, Mac user, must feel obligated to make the move before you're ready. If the prospect sounds daunting, there's no shame in holding off on getting a new MacBook Pro—and the longer you wait, the more appealing the Thunderbolt 3/USB-C proposition will get. New power adapter: no MagSafe, no cord-wrapping wings.Photo: Harry McCracken Oh, one other thing: As became obvious last year when Apple released the 12" MacBook, the arrival of USB-C as the new means of charging Macs means the end of MagSafe, the beloved, ingenious technology that prevented a power cord that got accidentally jostled from dragging the entire computer with it onto the floor. It's sad to see it go. But personally, I miss the fold-out wings on the old-style MacBook’s power brick—which let you neatly wrap up the cord for travel—more than MagSafe. The new brick, which looks like a giant iPhone charger, lacks them. Apple Polishing Beyond the svelter design, Touch Bar, and new ports, the new MacBook Pros shows multiple refinements that, on their own, wouldn't prompt anyone to splurge on a new computer. They just make that new computer better once you have it, and are the sort of improvements that Apple never gets enough credit for making. The MacBook Pro's high-resolution Retina display would have been one of the biggest reasons to upgrade from a MacBook Air no matter what. But it's also brighter than previous screens—at full blast, it makes my eyeballs tingle—offers better contrast, and has a wider color gamut for more accurate reproduction of photos. Apple also lavished attention on the speakers, which you can crank way, way up without turning music or movie soundtracks into a distorted mess. The ones on the 15" model, amazingly, sound better to my ears than the audio system built into my aging 42" HDTV. Given that some of Apple's most demanding professional users are fretting about these machines' processors and RAM capacities, should those of us who don't need tippy-top-of-the-line performance be concerned? I'll leave benchmarking to experts such as the folks at AnandTech, but these Macs have more than enough horsepower for non-superhuman computing tasks; even though Apple didn't use Intel's latest processors, it called on technologies such as high-speed solid-state storage to keep things fast. The three units I tried were the base-model versions at each price point—$1,499, $1,799, and $1,999—and none of them ever felt slow. Photo: courtesy of Apple I also didn't try to formally measure battery life, which Apple rates at up to 10 hours. The company has clearly decided that this figure—basically, one especially busy workday—is ideal for most computing devices, which is why it's what it strives to attain on all versions of the iPad as well as these new laptops. Ultimately, the design decisions that Apple made with these new-generation MacBook Pros result in machines that I think will please many people. What they don't do is clarify the future of the Mac for every type of buyer. Besides those power users who were hoping for even more potent MacBook Pros—and may get them in updates to these models—there's the far larger audience of people who don't need boundless computing muscle and are at least somewhat price-conscious. At the same time that Apple announced the new Pros, it discontinued sales of the $899 11" MacBook Air—a candidate for my own personal pantheon of the greatest computers ever—except to educational institutions. The 13" Air remains in the lineup for now as a $999 budget model, but with its non-Retina screen, it's a bit of a throwback. The 12" MacBook is $1,299, and aimed at people who crave portability above all else. That makes the non-Touch Bar version of the 13" MacBook Pro the cheapest up-to-date, general-purpose Mac notebook. Its starting price of $1,499 is $200 more than the previous-generation 13" Pro. You don't need to be an incurable cheapskate to hope that Apple fills in the hole that creates in its lineup, either by cutting the entry-level cost for a MacBook Pro or releasing something new and versatile that isn't a Pro and costs at least a couple of hundred dollars less. Such a MacBook would be the modern-day descendant of the one that Steve Jobs put in the consumer/portable quadrant of his 1997 grid.

Andrew Cunningham Buttons have, by and large, been replaced by sliders. Andrew Cunningham Customizing the Touch Bar buttons in software. The new design of the MacBook Pros is nice, and Apple’s decision to put in nothing but Thunderbolt 3 ports has prompted a fresh wave of dongle talk, but the signature feature of the new MacBook Pros was always going to be the Touch Bar. This little touch-enabled strip represents a bunch of things. It’s a melding of Apple’s traditional Intel-driven software platform and the company’s own homegrown chips and its touch-driven iOS platform. It’s Apple’s answer to the touchscreen, a model that Apple steadfastly resists in its computers even as Microsoft and its partners embrace it. And it's the biggest thing about these Macs that’s truly new—Macs in the last half-decade have gotten thinner and lighter and have better battery life than before, but, Touch Bar aside, they all still run basically the same software in basically the same way. So, yes, these new laptops have new CPUs and GPUs, new designs, new ports, and new screens. We’ll spend plenty of time with all of those things. But the biggest question for buyers is whether the Touch Bar is worth it and what it adds to the experience that you can’t already get if you keep the latest version of macOS installed on your laptop. Differences between all three MacBook Pros Specs at a glance: 13-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro (Four Thunderbolt 3 ports) Screen 2560×1600 at 13.3" (227 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.9GHz Intel Core i5-6267U (Turbo up to 3.3GHz) RAM 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered, upgradeable to 16GB at purchase) GPU Intel Iris 550 (integrated, 64MB eDRAM) HDD 256GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 2x Thunderbolt 3, 2x Thunderbolt 3 with reduced bandwidth, headphones Size 11.97" × 8.36" × 0.59" (304.1 mm × 212.4 mm × 14.9 mm) Weight 3.02 lbs (1.37 kg) Battery 49.2Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $1,799.99 Price as reviewed $1,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics We've been over this a few times, but let's list the differences between the $1,499 MacBook Pro and the Touch Bar model. There are a couple of new details I can confirm now that I’ve actually been able to use both models. The low-end Pro uses a 15W Core i5-6360U CPU with an Intel Iris 540 GPU; the high-end model uses a 28W Core i5-6267U CPU with an Intel Iris 550 GPU. The difference, aside from small boosts to CPU and GPU clock speeds, is that the 28W model can run faster for longer and throttle less frequently. The 15W model can also consume less power. The low-end Pro uses a single “Alpine Ridge” Thunderbolt 3 controller from Intel, while the high-end Pro uses two Thunderbolt controllers. The two ports on the right side of the MacBook Pro have "reduced PCI Express bandwidth," which Apple says means they have two PCIe 3.0 lanes’ worth of bandwidth at their disposal instead of the four lanes dedicated to the ports on the left side (Intel’s mobile Skylake chipsets include a total of 10 PCIe lanes, four of which are already being used by the SSD). You can connect all the same things to both ports—displays, storage, power adapters—but especially high-performance storage arrays should be plugged in on the left side to maximize the available bandwidth. The low-end Pro uses 1866MHz LPDDR3 RAM while the high-end Pro uses 2133MHz LPDDR3. Apple has said it’s using LPDDR3 to save power, but it’s also the reason the systems max out at 16GB. The low-end Pro actually has a larger battery than the high-end one: 54.5Whr compared to 49.2Whr. Apple says both laptops have 10 hours of battery life, but the lower-power processor, the larger battery, and the lack of a little second screen above the keyboard all mean that the low-end model actually lasts a bit longer than the Touch Bar model. The low-end model includes two integrated mics, while the high-end model includes three. The low-end Pro’s 802.11ac Wi-Fi tops out at 867Mbps, while both the Touch Bar MacBook Pros can do a maximum of 1.3Gbps just like last year’s models. And here are a few further differences between both 13-inch models and the 15-inch models, all of which include Touch Bars. 15-inch Pros have enough thermal headroom to fit in quad-core Skylake processors. The base model includes a 2.6GHz (3.5GHz Turbo) Core i7-6700HQ, while our review unit uses a 2.7GHz (3.6GHz Turbo) Core i7-6820HQ. Either model can be configured with a 2.9GHz (3.8GHz Turbo) Core i7-6920HQ. All models use their processors’ Intel HD 530 integrated graphics when possible to save power, but they also include dedicated AMD Radeon GPUs. The Radeon Pro 450, 455, and 460 are all based on AMD’s latest Polaris architecture—we’ll go into more detail about each component later in the review. The trackpad in the 15-inch model is larger than in the 13-inch models. All four Thunderbolt 3 ports in the 15-inch Pros offer the same amount of PCIe bandwidth, since Intel’s quad-core CPUs add more PCIe 3.0 lanes to the amount that the chipset includes (in total, Apple is using four lanes for the SSD, eight lanes across all four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and another eight lanes for the dedicated GPUs). Using the 15-inch model Specs at a glance: 15-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro Screen 2880×1800 at 15.4" (220 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-6820HQ (Turbo up to 3.6GHz) RAM 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered) GPU AMD Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB RAM, Intel HD 530 HDD 512GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 4x Thunderbolt 3, headphones Size 13.75" × 9.48" × 0.61" (349.3 mm × 240.7 mm × 15.5 mm) Weight 4.02 lbs (1.83 kg) Battery 76.0Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $2,399.99 Price as reviewed $2,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics The reduced size and weight of the 15-inch Pro are both really nice when you’re carrying the machine around. At just four pounds, it actually weighs less than the 4.5 pound 13-inch MacBook Pros did before the jump to Retina, and it’s a pound-and-a-half lighter than the pre-Retina 15-inch models (there’s a less consequential but still nice half-pound reduction compared to the older Retina models). When you're using it, though, it’s still very much a 15-inch laptop. I use 13-inch laptops almost exclusively these days, and the more cumbersome size and larger palmrest make the 15-inch models just a little unwieldy compared to what I’m used to. In other words, even with the size and weight decreases, the 15-inch model isn't small enough to be a good replacement for a 13-inch notebook. I will say that my minor palm rejection problems with the 13-inch Pro’s larger trackpad aren’t really problems here. It may be because the trackpad is larger, so the corners of my hands are always firmly placed on the trackpad as I type rather than hitting it intermittently. Beyond this, the experience of typing and of using the trackpad is identical. The 2880×1800 screen has the same resolution as the older Retina models, albeit with the added brightness and contrast and the wide color support. But like the MacBook and the 13-inch Pros, the screen’s default resolution is 1680×1050 mode. As with the previous models, you can also select 1024×600, 1280×800, 1440×900, and 1900×1200 modes depending on what’s the most comfortable for you. Finally, the speakers here are much larger than the ones in the 13-inch model, and they sound pretty good for laptop speakers. They have respectable bass and dynamic range. While they aren’t as good as the speakers in a desktop like an iMac or some good dedicated speakers, they’re good enough for movies and TV, and they aren’t bad if you need to fill a room with music for a small party.

Beloved workhorse of graphic designers, video editors, coders, and others wedded to the macOS ecosystem, any change to the MacBook Pro was going to be contentious. All the same, even stoic, self-confident Apple was seemingly rocked by the fierce reaction to features like Thunderbolt 3 and the brand new Touch Bar. Why not a full touchscreen? Why have you abandoned the legacy ports? Why make it thinner when pro-users care about power? Why aren’t the processor and graphics the very fastest, most cutting-edge? Why is memory limited to 16GB at most? Why are you forcing the MacBook’s keyboard on us? Amid it all, a common theme: Apple has forgotten the “Professional” in recreating the MacBook Pro. In a keynote filled with DJs, and family galleries in Photos, and Touch Bar access to emojis, was this new notebook no longer the machine of choice for the work-horse pro? Hardware and Design Familiar and yet different. At first glance you can’t confuse the MacBook Pro with anything else, but look closer and the differences this time around start to make themselves noticed. Biggest change for this new version is the addition of a second color, the same Space Gray as the 12-inch MacBook is offered in, alongside the original Silver. No sign of Rose Gold, however, and though Jet Black would be eye-catching, it’d also be a sea of scratches after one trip in your bag. Thickness and weight are down. The old 13-inch MacBook Pro was 3.48 pounds and 0.71-inches thick; its replacement is 3.02 pounds and 0.59-inches thick. Meanwhile the old 15-inch MacBook Pro was 4.49 pounds and 0.71-inches thick, which drops to 4.02 pounds and 0.61-inches with the new model. As has been Apple’s way for the past few generations, user-upgrades aren’t encouraged. If you get the base panel off, you’ll find processor and memory are of course soldered in. Unexpectedly, the PCIe storage is removable, but since it uses a custom SSD controller we’ll have to wait and see whether third-party suppliers will be allowed to offer replacements. Specifications and Performance In what’s become a fairly full desktop, I’ve had all three main versions of the new MacBook Pro on hand for testing. The $1,499 entry-level model, which lacks the Touch Bar, has a 2.0 GHz dual-core Core i5 and Intel Iris Graphics 540. It’s paired with 8GB of 1866 MHz LPDDR3 memory (16GB is an option) and a 256GB PCIe SSD (512GB/1TB are options). The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has a 2.9 GHz dual-core Core i5 and Intel Iris Graphics 550, for $1,799. It’s paired with 8GB of faster, 2133 MHz LPDDR3 memory (again, 16GB is an option) and a 256GB PCIe SSD (with the same 512GB/1TB options). Both versions can be configured with Core i7 processors, up to 3.3 GHz. Finally, there’s a 15-inch MacBook Pro, with a 2.6 GHz quad-core Core i7 processor and both Intel HD Graphics 530 and AMD Radeon Pro 450 2GB graphics, priced at $2,399. It has 16GB of 2133 MHz LPDDR3 memory as standard, along with a 256GB PCIe SSD (with up to 2TB options). The fastest processor in the largest MacBook Pro is a 2.9 GHz Core i7 quad-core. Faster hardware has been top of the wishlist for MacBook Pro fans for some time, though Apple’s decisions haven’t been met with universal acclaim. Since Intel’s very latest 7th-generation “Kaby Lake” processors aren’t available in anything other than the ultra-low-voltage form Apple used in the 2016 12-inch MacBook update, and so it stuck with “Skylake”. Dual-core and quad-core “Kaby Lake” chips will arrive in 2017, Intel says, though when they might show up inside a MacBook Pro remains to be seen. The second controversy is memory. Even a fully maxed-out 15-inch MacBook Pro – which will set you back a cool $4,299 – can’t be had with more than 16GB of RAM. Whether you have 8GB or 16GB, it’s LPDDR3 not the newer, faster LPDDR4: Apple says that’s a power usage decision made in combination with using the “Skylake” chips. Benchmarks, of course, only tell part of the story, but they’re useful in contrasting between the three variations of notebook I have here. Geekbench 3’s results aren’t too surprising, though there’s clearly not a huge processing jump from going from the 2.0 GHz Core i5 dual-core to its 2.9 GHz sibling. The 15-inch’s extra cores play their hand, meanwhile, though performance on paper is still comparable to the old version. Apple has been pushing faster and faster solid-state storage in its notebooks for some generations now, and the new MacBook Pro line-up is no exception. Benchmark speeds were pretty consistent across all three models in QuickBench 4.0, hitting a hefty 2,909.2 MB/sec read and 1,571.2 MB/sec write at their fastest. Yes, Apple charges a fair amount to climb up through its SSD storage, but you can’t argue with the performance. Finally, there’s graphics. Again, Apple has come in for some criticism with its choices of GPU, specifically the discrete Radeon chips in the 15-inch MacBook Pro, which aren’t the very fastest in AMD’s line-up. All get Intel Iris graphics too, and they hold up well in the 13-inch notebooks in comparison to the outgoing model. Gains from the Radeon Pro 450 with its dedicated 2GB of memory aren’t vast; it’s worth remembering that this is the entry-level discrete GPU in Apple’s lineup. Even so, it’s a noticeable step up from the old machines. None of the new MacBook Pro models should be your first choice for graphics-intensive gaming – nothing new there – and those looking for the very fastest mobile GPU performance will still need to look to Windows notebooks, but all three are capable when it comes to video rendering, CAD and graphic design, and other such tasks. Display and Speakers Apple has stuck with its Retina-class resolution on both the 13-inch and 15-inch notebooks, the smaller using a 2560 x 1600 panel and the larger a 2880 x 1800 panel. Because of the way those screens work – by default, at least – you get a smoother 1440 x 900 on the 13-inch and 1680 x 1050 on the 15-inch. What’s new this time around is brightness, contrast, and color quality. For a start, brightness has climbed from 300 nits of the old model to 500 nits on the new. That means outdoor visibility is significantly improved, as well as screen legibility when dealing with reflections. The contrast ratio improvement helps too, now at 1,500:1 versus the 900:1 of the old LCD. Finally, there’s support for the DCI-P3 color space, which Apple has made such a big deal of in the recent iMac 5K and iPhone 7. In short, it means 25-percent more visible colors than with the old model, though reds and greens benefit particularly. Of course, you’ll also need DCI-P3 compliant images to actually tell the difference: luckily, the iPhone 7 shoots them, while if your standalone digital camera doesn’t produce them with its in-camera JPEG rendering, you can always edit them from RAW. Of course, many people prefer to use an external display, and that’s covered too. Courtesy of Thunderbolt 3 – more on which in the next section – you can drive as many as two 5K screens from the 15-inch MacBook Pro. The 13-inch isn’t quite as powerful, but can still handle a single 5K display or two 4K displays. Right now, native Thunderbolt 3 displays aren’t especially common, and Apple hasn’t replaced the discontinued Thunderbolt Display with a new version. Instead, it’s pushing LG’s UltraFine 5K and 4K screens, at 27- and 21.5-inches, which are $974 and $524 respectively until the end of the year. Unfortunately I’ve not been able to test them out yet. Apple is particularly proud of the speakers on the new MacBook Pros, boasting of twice the dynamic range. They definitely sound better than the system on the old notebook, particularly in the case of the 15-inch which has a surprising amount of power to fill a room. Part of the difference, I’m told, is that the speaker system is wired directly into the system power now, for triple the peak power of the old approach which used an intermediary converter. Physics only lets you get away with so much, of course, and while things sound balanced across the frequency range at low to medium volume, the bass starts to get overshadowed by treble and upper-mids at the upper end of the range. Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C If the processor, memory, and graphics decisions Apple made are the internal cause of the new MacBook Pro furore, the choice to ditch almost all of the legacy ports is the external trigger. Gone is MagSafe 2, and USB 3.1, and Thunderbolt 2, and HDMI, and the SD card slot. In there place, you have Thunderbolt 3 using the USB Type-C connector. The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro – the one without the Touch Bar – gets two such ports. Any Touch Bar-equipped model doubles that to four. The 3.5mm headphone jack lingers on the right edge, quietly taunting iPhone 7 owners. Few disagree that Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C is the port of the future. Its advantage is its speed and flexibility: one single cable can deliver power, data, and display signals all at the same time. It’s fast, with up to 40 Gbit/sec data rates on paper at least, and backward compatible with USB 3.1 gen 2 (which maxes out at 10 Gbit/sec). Like Lightning, there’s no “right side up” and you can plug it in either way. Unusually, it’s bidirectional: the same port that one moment was drawing power from a hub, can the next minute be supplying power to an external hard-drive or other peripheral. In short, Apple fans would’ve been livid had Apple not included it on the new MacBook Pro. Instead, they’re just furious that Apple has embraced Thunderbolt 3 so enthusiastically. While it may be compatible with many of the ports we’ve grown used to over the past years, that requires adapters and dongles. Need to plug in a USB Type-A device? You’ll need a dongle. Want to connect your HDMI TV, or your VGA projector? You’ll need a dongle. Need a port for wired ethernet? You guessed it, you need a dongle. I’m a 12-inch MacBook user and have been since the first-gen model in early 2015. I mention that to make it clear that I’ve been living the USB-C-only lifestyle for some time now, and with just a single port. Along the way I’ve found some of the frustrations I expected to be less significant than I thought they’d be, and vice-versa. Adapters have become a part of my daily life. Most commonly, that’s because I need to import photos and videos from the SD card in my camera; I have a small card reader and Apple’s USB Type-A to Type-C dongle in my bag. Unplugged, the latter can be used to read USB drives, or connect to scanners or non-wireless printers. Would it be great to be able to plug everything in natively? Sure, though I think I thought something along the same lines back when floppy drives and CD drives and DVD drives rose and fell in popularity. Even the previous MacBook Pro with Retina display, which many are looking at with renewed fondness now, demanded I carry a Thunderbolt 2 ethernet adapter just-in-case. Personally, when it comes to adopting Thunderbolt 3 wholeheartedly I suspect Apple would’ve been damned if they did and damned if they didn’t. This commitment to the USB Type-C connector is exactly what the port needs for peripheral and accessory makers to take the transition seriously: I think we’ll see more USB-C devices, at a faster rate, as a result. Had Apple just switched the Thunderbolt 2 ports on the old MacBook Pro to Thunderbolt 3, and left the legacy connectors in place, we’d be complaining that the new standard was slow to gain traction. All the same, Apple could’ve handled this transition better. The fact that you’re paying upwards of $1.5k for a notebook and don’t get a USB Type-A to Type-C adapter in the box seems miserly: sure, Apple sells them now for nine bucks apiece, but it’s galling nonetheless. We’re yet to see a compelling USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 hub from the Cupertino firm either; I’ve been carrying Huawei’s, but reports from the Wild West of third-party options, many of which prove to be compromised in any number of ways, show the confusion Apple has dumped its users into. I suspect Apple has held off from addressing that situation because it expects it to go away in time. That’s probably true. All the same, right now for every moment of pleasure at plugging in a single 5K Thunderbolt 3 display and also having your MacBook Pro powered and hooked up to a row of extra ports for data, there’s the sting of “hang on, where’s my Type-A connector gone?” frustration. Touch Bar As someone who has used macOS for a reasonable number of years now, my fingers have picked up a fair few shortcuts along the way. Some, like command+S for save, or command+T for a new tab, or command+F for find have become second nature: my fingers punch them out before my brain consciously thinks about them. Ironically, it’s that which makes touchscreen notebooks less functional for me, since it’s quicker to hit a key combination than it is to reach up, tap the display, and then bring my hand back down again. My first inclination was to force myself to stop using shortcuts and rely on the Touch Bar instead. That’s harder than it first sounds, I discovered, not to mention fairly unproductive. Just like setting up your iOS home screen, or choosing what apps to have in your macOS dock, it pays to spend a few minutes customizing the Touch Bar before you wade in. That’s usually done in each individual app, where you get a selection of buttons you can drag down into the bar, or conversely drag those icons already present out. There’s also a global setting for the default shortcuts which is accessed in the System Preferences. It’d be more convenient if you could see every Touch Bar layout from there, for each different app, but right now you have to switch between apps individually. What surprised me was how quickly I got into the habit of using the Touch Bar, at least for certain tasks. Having switched back to Apple’s Mail app – I’d usually rely on Gmail’s browser interface, which also supports keyboard shortcuts – I found myself reaching up to stab the “Send” button on the Touch Bar alongside the escape key more often than not. In the Calendar app, being able to sweep through the weeks via the Touch Bar proved quicker than clicking through. Some of Apple’s more eye-catching demos are those that, ironically, don’t work so well on the Touch Bar. Picking out emojis is fine if you’re looking for one you frequently use – as on iOS, they’re clustered at the start of the list – but actually going hunting for something different requires a whole lot of swiping. It’s much easier to hit control+command+space and choose (or search) from there. Similarly, autocomplete when generally typing makes a lot less sense on a notebook than it does on an iPhone or iPad. At times, it can actually be less convenient than the regular buttons were. In Spotify, for instance, shortcuts for media control are now two taps away – first you touch to expand the Control Strip of core commands, and then you can hit play/pause or skip tracks – though that’s likely to become less of an issue as more developers add support. I’ve used the Touch Bar more than I thought I did, though there are clearly some areas where improvement could be made. Some will presumably be addressed in time, like third-party apps which don’t interact with the OLED strip at all. Others, though, depend on Apple choosing to embrace flexibility. Right now, for instance, there’s no way to assign macros to a Touch Bar button. You can’t have a single button that automatically starts a new email and populates the To: box with preset recipients, or that creates a Pages document with certain styles and sections. I have Automator workflows set up to convert different image or document formats to JPEGs, but I can’t assign them to the Touch Bar: all I have is Apple’s selection of pre-approved buttons to choose between. The company tells me that it can’t comment on what future integration might be added down the line. A small handful of third-party apps will have Touch Bar support at launch – Apple says that includes Day One, Coda, and Pixelmator – while others, like Sketch, Photoshop, djay Pro, and OmniGraffle will be updated by the end of the year. Microsoft has committed to Touch Bar support in Office, Outlook, and Skype, while utilities like 1Password will also embrace the finger-strip. That’s fine if you live in standalone software, but plenty of our time is now spent in web apps. Unfortunately, while Apple has APIs for standalone software, apps that live in the browser don’t get to play. Similarly, there was a conscious decision made not to allow notifications to break into the Touch Bar in any way: you can’t have pop-up alerts on there, like a ticker tape machine, and nor can you interact with shortcuts in macOS notifications like delete or reply. Overall, though, I’m curious to see how the Touch Bar fares once more people get their fingers on it. After you let go of the idea that it’s a baby-step toward a full touch display, and instead a third type of interface alongside keyboard and trackpad, it becomes a case of finding the moment it suddenly chimes with how you use macOS. If you really decide you don’t like it, meanwhile, you can set the Touch Bar to only show the function keys by default. Holding down the “Fn” button brings those old-school keys up temporarily, too. Touch ID Apple’s fingerprint sensor technology has at last made the jump from iOS to macOS, and it does much the same as the home button on the iPhone and iPad does today. Register your fingertip – up to five can be stored, though only at most three per user account – and tapping the square to the right of the Touch Bar will unlock your Mac and log you in. If you have more than one account set up, fingerprints can be used to switch between them. Again, as on the iPhone, you can optionally use Touch ID to authenticate payments using Apple Pay, and purchases through iTunes and the App Store. If you set up locked notes, Touch ID can be used to unlock them again. APIs for third-party developers will mean other software should be able to do similar things down the line, though right now I couldn’t find anything else which allowed me to log in via fingerprint. It’s one of those things that, after you’ve lived with it for a brief time, it’s jarring to go back to passwords. I’m in the habit of locking my Mac whenever I leave it: with Touch ID it’s less than a second and I’m back into the system – you don’t even have to wake the screen separately first; just tapping the scanner takes you straight to whatever you were working on last – in contrast to having to punch in a password multiple times a day. Apple has a new chip – the Apple T1 – which it uses to store fingerprint data and payment information securely. It’s actually a surprisingly clever little chunk of silicon, in some ways more akin to a smartwatch than anything else, but the key element is the Secure Enclave. That’s what encrypts your fingerprints and card information, tokenizing it rather than sharing it with apps and web-based stores. The Touch ID square is actually a button, though you don’t have to actually press it for your fingerprint to register, just rest it on top. Hold it down and it acts as a physical power button – it’s also how you can restart in the case of a system crash – though you rarely have to use it. Just opening the lid of the notebook boots/resumes it. In the process, Apple also removed the startup tone. I’m not entirely sure why that has prompted such an outpouring of sentiment, perhaps it’s port requiem overspill. Keyboard and Force Touch trackpad It’s not just down to the Thunderbolt 3 switch that helped Apple make the new MacBook Pro thinner: the “butterfly mechanism” keyboard played a part, too. It also triggered a few groans from those familiar with – but not a fan of – the keyboard on the 12-inch MacBook, which was Apple’s first play with the new mechanism. Happily for those skeptics, things are a little different second time around. Though I’m personally a fan of the MacBook keyboard, I can understand why some people struggle with it. Though the company points out that each individual key is more stable, travel is much reduced in comparison to Apple’s old ‘board. That takes some getting used to. On the MacBook Pro, travel is the same half-millimeter but the underlying dome switch is different. That may not sound like much, but it gives the keys far more “pop” as you strike them: it actually feels like they’re moving more than they really are. Side by side with the 12-inch MacBook, it’s a noticeable improvement. Just as the keycaps are larger on the new MacBook Pro, so the Force Touch trackpads have grown. On the 13-inch models it’s now around 6.25-inches diagonal; the 15-inch is even bigger, at a vast 7.25-inches. As we’ve seen before, they provide the sensation of a click even though it’s actually simulated – you can choose between light, medium, and firm sensations in the settings – which takes a little getting used to at first, but quickly becomes second nature. All that extra room makes macOS gestures easier, and there’s less swipe-and-lift involved in general navigation. I was a little worried about palm-rejection, given the size of the trackpad means there’s a reasonable chance some part of your hand or wrist might be resting on it at times, but Apple’s improved algorithms there have seemingly done the trick, and I’ve not noticed any issues. Its sheer size does make me wish that Apple had added Pencil compatibility for repurposing the trackpad as a graphics tablet. Battery After all the changes, Apple’s commitment to a promised 10 hours of battery life is one of the few carry-overs from the old MacBook Pro. That’s 10 hours of wireless web browsing, mind, or iTunes movie playback, both at 75-percent brightness. Actual battery size varies of course, though it’s interesting to note that, because it doesn’t have the Touch Bar to accommodate, the entry-level 13-inch has a slightly larger battery than its more expensive but identically-sized sibling. My own testing suggests that 10 hour figure is pretty accurate, and even too conservative by an hour or so. It’s very dependent on not only how much you’re stressing the system but what apps you’re using, however. If you’re a Safari user then you’re going to see much better results than if you prefer Chrome, for instance. Even if you’re just browsing, it can mean the difference of a couple of hours. Push things harder, such as doing 4K video processing, and you’ll spend far less time away from the outlet. It took 11 minutes for iMovie to export a 10 minute 4K video on the 15-inch MacBook Pro, for instance. During that time, the battery dropped by 10-percent. As for recharging, Apple supplies a 65W adapter with the 13-inch MacBook Pro, while the larger model gets an 87W adapter. There’s no extension cable – it plugs directly into your outlet – though you can buy one separately, and there aren’t the flip-out arms to wrap the cable around, either. Other USB Type-C devices, like Google’s Pixel phones, are happy to recharge from them too. Wrap-Up Has Apple forgotten the professionals which are arguably its most vocal advocates? I don’t think that’s true, though I do suspect that group now finds itself at the fringe of MacBook Pro users. Such is the side-effect of a user group in general expanding. Ergonomically, I’m among those still content with a non-touch primary display. My experience with the Touch Bar, meanwhile, has left me mighty curious to see what comes next as third-party developers get to grips with the potential of the added interface. Right now, a large part of its usefulness is in replicating keyboard shortcuts: that’s handy if you’re unfamiliar with them, but it’s no great surprise that longtime Mac users have been less wowed. That doesn’t mean there’s not plenty of potential for a small, full-color display that leaves your primary screen uncluttered and allows you to manipulate tools with one hand while you use the trackpad with the other. Just as Thunderbolt 3 needs time to gain traction, so the Touch Bar is dependent on third-party support and imagination to really come into its own. Life on the cutting edge is, inevitably, something of a gamble as you wait for everyone else to catch up. I can’t help but imagine a 2017 MacBook Pro with Kaby Lake processors and several months of developers getting to grips with the potential of Touch ID and the Touch Bar. As it stands today, though, the dongle frustration and the fact that you really need to pay $1799 or more – the entry-level 13-inch misses out too much, in my opinion, to be worth considering – are outweighed by the improvements in graphics, the excellent build quality, and the promise its unique hardware coupled with macOS represents.
