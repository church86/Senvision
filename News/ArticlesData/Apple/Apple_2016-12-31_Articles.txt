The ASUS Flip C100P Chromebook is an expertly designed, first-of-its-kind convertible that takes everything we love about tablets and laptops, and crams them together into a single flexible device. Convertibles have been a part of the Windows family of PCs for years now, but have only recently started making their way into the legion of Chromebooks that were introduced over the past year or so. Will the C100P prove that Chrome OS is just as good on a touchscreen as it is with a classical trackpad, or will the Flip flop on its face before it even gets off the ground? Find out my ASUS Flip C100P Chromebook review! Overview Summary: The ASUS Flip C100P sports a beautiful display and a staggeringly long battery life into a nimble, portable, and convertible sub-2lb frame. WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The ASUS Flip C100P is the perfect cheap convertible for students. Price: $265.99 on Amazon  Available: Now Model: C100PA-DB02 What We Liked Chrome OS is made for touchscreens Surprisingly vibrant screen Long-lasting battery What We Didn’t Speakers were only good half the time Underpowered for heavy browsing tasks ASUS C100P Flip Specs ASUS Flip C100P Processor Rockchip 1.8GHz Processor RAM 4GB SDRAM Display Type IPS Display Resolution 1200 x 1800 Storage 16GB eMMC WiFi 802.11ac Bluetooth 4.0 Keyboard Standard Battery 8 hours 46 minutes (at load) Price $265.99 Buy Now Design No, Apple isn’t making Chromebooks yet, but you wouldn’t know it looking at the ASUS Flip It’s not a secret that over the past 15 years or so, Apple has revolutionized what every design department from here to Taiwan thought about not only about what a piece of technology could do, but also how good it could look while it got the job done. They took clunky, IBM-inspired black-on-gray-on-beige laptops and made them sleek, sexy, and tactile like no other company of the past decade ever could. So it’s not surprising that the design of other products has followed suit. Chromebooks in particular are known for taking the core tenants of the Macbook design (simplicity on smooth surfaces),and incorporating them into their own umbrella of products, but the ASUS Flip C100P takes it to a whole other level. I’m surprised Apple hasn’t already sued ASUS for design infringement, looking at this laptop. In a blind logo test, I’d have a hard time telling the Flip apart from many of the devices that Apple has already released, including the anodized aluminum casing, the flat key black-on-silver keyboard, and the lone headphone jack controlled by two volume buttons on the side that look eerily similar to what you’d find on the side of an iPhone 6. Of course, Apple’s design department is one of the best in the business, and it’s no wonder why ASUS would do everything it could to emulate them. From the chassis to the trackpad to the matte black bezels the Flip barely passes as a laptop made by ASUS, and looks a heck of a lot more like what Apple would do if they ever collaborated with Google on their very first Chromebook. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing, either. Software Chrome OS transitions seamlessly into the touchscreen arena without a hitch At this point, if you don’t know what you’re getting on the software side of things when you buy a Chromebook, you haven’t been paying close enough attention. Read More: Best Chromebook Apps Chromebooks are the preferred choice for a lot of consumers because they don’t come with any extra surprises, no annoying bloatware or extra pieces of useless software that the laptop maker uses to promote some dysfunctional internal software they made off the cuff. Nope, Chromebooks are simple, easy, and consistent, and the Flip is no different. An offline version of the Drive suite of apps is the only real “software” the Flip lays claim to. Other than that, anything else you “install” won’t be more than a Chrome extension or a glorified web shortcut that’s attached to your Start menu…just the way we like it. Hardware In true Apple design spirit, the Flip has as little open holes as possible (including available port options) With such a minuscule 1.96lb frame, the Flip C100P isn’t in the running to win an award for top of the line specs anytime soon. The Flip runs on an Integrated 1.8GHz Rockchip Mali T764 CPU, and 4GB of SDRAM. Along with its minimal power, there also aren’t a ton of ports to choose from, with only a mini-HDMI, two USB 2.0 ports, an audio jack and one micro-SD card slot lining the edges of the case. The onboard 720p webcam took “okay” pictures, but nothing all that mind-blowing, although the 16GB of onboard storage was a welcome addition to an otherwise lackluster set of stats. Performance Somewhat expectedly, the performance of the Flip was only subpar thanks to its lowered specs. As per usual, we ran the ASUS Flip in a number of different general usage scenarios, as well as running a standard set of WebGL tests to determine how it held up under everyday circumstances. Read More: Samsung Chromebook 2 Review We were able to open around six tabs of various text-based sites along with four 1080p YouTube videos playing in the background before the Flip started to chug, which is one of the earliest breaking points we’ve seen in a Chromebook yet. Those videos loaded crazy quick thanks to the included 802.11ac Wi-Fi chip however, which screamed through our bandwidth tests at a steady clip of around 160 – 180Mbps depending on where we were in the house. The onboard speakers on the other hand were a bit of a mixed bag. With the Flip in normal laptop mode, they were pinned almost directly to the surface we were typing on, making our test music sound distant and unpleasant. In tablet mode, however, the speakers faced directly outward and sounded quite a bit better, and fuller than what you’d see on other Chromebooks in the same category. Display Whether it’s competing with tablets, laptops, or both the Flip’s display is a winner wherever it competes For such a small laptop, the Flip packs some shockingly punchy pixels on its smaller 10.1″ 1200 x 800 IPS display screen. Colors in games and movies popped off the screen, and the touchscreen itself was extremely responsive when the C100P wasn’t under heavy load from multiple apps or tabs running at the same time. In tablet mode the quality of the screen is even more apparent, especially when you’re watching Netflix or YouTube videos with convertible set in the “angled” mode (the hinge between the laptop and tablet configured at 45°) for the full cinematic experience. Battery The battery on the Flip was equally as impressive as its screen, lasting a solid 8hrs and 46min during our various testing procedures. With a chassis this small it’s rare that you get a laptop that can last through a full workday of tasks without needing a plug-in somewhere along the line, but the ASUS still managed to hang in there with the best of laptops and tablets alike. Wrap Up If you can’t decide whether to spend your hard-earned technology budget on a laptop or a tablet, a convertible like the ASUS Flip C100P might be the perfect middle-ground for anyone who still can’t make up their mind by the time they’ve already gotten to the electronics store. The ASUS Flip C100P proves that even though convertible laptops (and Chromebooks particularly) may not be right for everyone, Chrome OS is still able to perform handily in either arena, and has no problem replacing your next iPad Air for half the cost.

You can watch streaming video on it, download apps, take photos with its camera and give voice commands to Siri, its digital assistant. You can even make old-fashioned voice calls on it. Nokia, the Finnish company that was the world’s largest cellphone maker until its business was decimated by Apple and makers of Android-based phones, claims none of those features would exist without its inventions, which were made over many years and after billions of dollars were invested in research. For the past five years, Apple has paid Nokia a modest royalty for the use of its patents. But with that pact expiring on December 31, Nokia wants Apple to keep paying for that portfolio, and is demanding that Apple licence additional patents. Apple is refusing to pay Nokia’s price and has accused it of extortion. The impasse, after two years of tense negotiations, broke into open warfare last month in a volley of lawsuits in 11 countries, including the United States and Germany. “Apple is saying, ‘we want to pay one low price and not have to deal with any of your patents again’,” Clem Roberts, an intellectual property lawyer at Durie Tangri in San Francisco, said. “Nokia is saying, ‘I don’t want that low price because my patents are worth more than that.’” The fight underscores just how much today’s smartphones rely on an earlier generation of technology. It also shows how cellphone pioneers like Nokia, Ericsson of Sweden and Motorola, whose patents are now owned by Google, are still trying to profit from the industry in which they are now bit players, at best. “Obviously, the iPhone was not created on a green field but was built on what others created before Apple,” said Florian Mueller, a German iPhone app developer and former consultant to technology companies who has followed the cellphone patent wars. “On the other hand, the iPhone was a paradigm shift. It was more of a mobile computer than a mobile phone.” Patent disputes are common in the technology industry. This month, for instance, Samsung won a partial victory over Apple when the US Supreme Court ruled that it should not have to give up all of its phone profits for copying the look of Apple’s iPhone. Google, part of Alphabet, won a similar case against Oracle in May after it was accused of copying software code used for Android, the search giant’s smartphone operating system. But the tactics are evolving as the law and technology change. When the Supreme Court a decade ago limited the leverage that patent owners had to stop sales of a product that violated their patents, it empowered patent users to play hardball in negotiations, Roberts, the intellectual property lawyer, said. Companies like Nokia and Ericsson, which once had an interest in exchanging mutual licences with other companies for their own cellphone businesses, left the handset market and concentrated on other tech gear and licensing their old patents. Nokia and Ericsson each make more than $1 billion a year from licensing their patents and brands globally, their annual reports say. Nokia has split its patent portfolio and transferred slices to patent trolls — a derisive term for companies that buy others’ intellectual property and often file lawsuits to extract royalties from patent users — with Nokia sharing in any profits. In its legal filing on Tuesday, Apple claimed that this strategy was a conspiracy between Nokia and its patent partners, which include Acacia Research and Conversant Intellectual Property Management, to raise patent prices in violation of federal antitrust law. Apple said Acacia and Conversant had filed 52 cases against the company around the world, many asserting violations of Nokia patents. In September, Acacia won a $22.1 million jury verdict against Apple, and last week, Conversant won $7.3 million. “Unfortunately, Nokia has refused to licence their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple’s own inventions they had nothing to do with,” Apple said in a statement about the case. In response, Nokia filed legal cases against Apple in 14 venues, from Texas to Japan accusing it of violating 40 patents. Nokia said it had reached patent deals with more than 100 other companies, including many smartphone makers, which demonstrated that it had offered its intellectual property at a fair price. “After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple’s use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights,” Ilkka Rahnasto, the head of Nokia’s patent business, said in a statement. Important patents Analysts say there is no doubt that Nokia owns important patents, which include those related to how phones transmit data and how their batteries consume energy. Ericsson, which also had a long-standing legal dispute with Apple before they agreed to a new licensing deal last year, similarly has a large portfolio of patents — including technology for how smartphones make calls and how video is beamed onto a handset. “Unless there’s a fair return on this technology, the whole model for the telecom world is at risk,” Gustav Brismark, Ericsson’s chief intellectual property officer, said. He added that the company had invested billions of dollars over decades in its patents. In the past, Brismark said, companies quickly reached agreements over how to use Ericsson’s patents. But in the past five years, companies like Apple have more often turned to courts to reach settlements. Central to the latest dispute between Apple and Nokia is what is a fair and reasonable fee to use Nokia technology that is now part of every smartphone. Patent lawyers say there has been a tradition of charging a modest royalty for patents on standard technologies. Previously, Nokia fought bitter legal battles with other smartphone makers, including Samsung and LG, over how they used its patents. As Nokia seeks to require Apple to pay to licence more of its patents, some of its recent claims may be hard to justify. In one of its lawsuits filed last month, it says Apple is violating a patent Nokia received two months ago for an electronic device case that includes a hole for a camera lens in the back and room for a battery beneath the display, features that have been common to smartphones for many years. Still, Roberts said US courts have been sceptical of patent-related antitrust claims like those by Apple. “The whole point of the government granting these patents is that it was giving the inventor a monopoly over that invention,” he said. But Apple and Nokia are fighters, and too much is at stake for either to give up easily. “What is a fair return on technology that has been shared with everyone?” Brismark of Ericsson said. “You have to create the right incentives for tech pioneers.”   Tweet Go to Top Videos Mulayam Singh avoids question on rift in...

KOLKATA: Apple's plan to assemble iPhones in India will be drastically different from those of rivals with plants in the country. The iPhones proposed to be assembled in Bengaluru will be primarily for sale only locally and not meant for overseas markets. Additionally, none of the components will be sourced from local companies, two senior industry executives aware of the plans said. Apple also won't customise the handsets for India even though the local team has been pushing the Cupertino-based company to roll out a dual-SIM iPhone, considering that about 80 per cent of the domestic market consists of such devices, the executives said. Apple's position on assembling iPhones in India is in contrast to its biggest rival Samsung Electronics, which exports products made at plants set up in Noida and Sriperumbudur, and other companies that have started basic sourcing of parts from the country. Still, the assembling operations are crucial for Apple's plans for India, the world's fastest-growing smartphone market. The company management has been pushing India to double revenue to $3 billion by 2017-18. Local assembly will help Apple to comply with norms to start operating company-owned outlets in India and get a 10 per cent tax benefit, which will allow it to reduce iPhones prices, the executives said. "The Indian assembling unit is not being set up to add capacity to global operations, considering the company just announced a decision to cut global production by 10 per cent. It's to boost its other business plans in India and also build a strong relationship with the government," one of the executives said. Apple declined to comment on the matter. Apple currently assembles iPhones in China through Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron for its global operations. It also has an iPhone assembling unit in Brazil run by Foxconn. The executives said Wistron became a partner of choice for its India assembly plan since it had already set up a repair unit for the company in Bengaluru last year. The facility, which is running at sub-optimal capacity, has the capability to undertake hardware repair work such as screen replacement, which was earlier done in China and Singapore. Apple plans to start assembling iPhones in India this year. The decision was taken barely seven months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed the idea to Apple CEO Tim Cook, who visited India in May last year. The company took almost three years to decide on setting up its distribution and repair centres in India, both of which came up last year, the executives said. In 2015-16, Apple overtook domestic handset maker Micromax Informatics by revenue to become India's second-largest smartphone maker after sales increased 54 per cent to `9,997.1crore ($1.5 billion). "The bulk of Apple's revenue is driven by older handsets, which are priced at about `20,000. The company wants to push sales of the new iPhone models in India, which is possible by availing tax benefits from local manufacturing," one executive said. Apple's market share in the Indian smartphone market was 1.1 per cent in the July-September quarter, with Samsung leading with a 22.6 per cent share and Micromax in second spot with 9.9 per cent, according to Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Technology Market Research.

This year will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and the grand opening of Apple’s ‘Spaceship’ Campus 2 headquarters in Cupertino where it will host events at a new 1000 seat auditorium, and that’s before we even get to actual products. Head below for our look at what’s next for Apple as we ring in the New Year. iPhone 8 | iOS 11 There are a few things to keep in mind for the iPhone launch next year that weren’t factors in 2016 with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus lineup. First off, if reports that Apple isn’t planning to update the iPhone SE, the last of the 4-inch iPhone models that it introduced last March, are accurate, that could be a reason to upgrade or a deciding factor for some looking to switch to a different device this year. At the same time Apple appears to be prototyping larger screen sizes for the iPhones with the latest intel pointing towards a pro model that includes a larger up-to-5.8-inch OLED display with curved edges. Add in clues that Apple is considering wireless charging, a new all-glass design, an embedded home button, and more, and this year’s iPhone update looks like it will be a significant one for what will be the device’s 10 year anniversary. We’d also expect a preview of iOS 11 at Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June if the company follows its usual timeline. Our full rundown on the latest iPhone 8 intel is here.  iPad Back in August, typically reliable supply chain analyst KGI pointed to three new iPad models that Apple has planned for 2017. If that report is accurate, we could see a new second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro, a low-cost 9.7 inch iPad, and a new iPad Pro with a 10.5 inch display, which would be an entirely new screen size for Apple’s tablet range and could presumably replace the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro that Apple introduced back in March. In November, one report from Digitimes backed up reports of an incoming 10.5-inch model, while a separate report from Japanese site Macotakara said that a new 10.9-inch iPad rumored for release early next year will have the same footprint as the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro. In that case, perhaps that’s the same low-cost 9.7-inch model referred in KGI’s report.  When will we see the new iPads? March would make a lot of sense for a launch given past iPad launches. But a report earlier month claimed low yield rates for the A10X chip could delay production of the tablets beyond the planned March timeframe. That chip is expected to be used in at least the new higher-end Pro iPads. While the iPhone 8 is expected to see a switch to an OLED display for at least some models, the KGI report earlier this year claimed Apple was targeting 2018 for the launch of an iPad with a similar flexible or curved OLED panel. Mac | macOS 10.13 With Apple’s recent launch of the new 2016 MacBook Pros and a collaboration with LG on new 4K and 5K displays, in 2017 we’re looking forward to updates to other Macs, namely an iMac update reportedly in the works. That doesn’t mean that MacBooks won’t see a refresh this year, though. While the 12-inch MacBook and especially the new MacBook Pro are still relatively new machines, Bloomberg reported earlier this month that Apple is at least currently targeting spec bump upgrades for both devices sometime over 2017. It also added to the earlier supply chain reports that iMac would receive an update with updated graphics chips and USB-C ports, which we are assuming will be Thunderbolt 3 like the new MacBook Pro. Despite any intel as of yet, the Mac Pro is the Mac most in need of an update at this point, so that’s another possibility for the year ahead. Like iOS 11, we’d expect Apple to continue tradition of previewing macOS 10.13 at its annual WWDC developer conference in June ahead of a release in the fall. Touch Bar and Touch ID on standalone keyboard? As a side note to Mac updates, we reported earlier this year that Apple held talks with Foxconn startup Sonder, a company building dynamic E Ink keyboard tech in the form a standalone keyboard product and laptop modules it plans to offer OEMs. That was right before Apple introduced its new Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro later that month and The Wall Street Journal interestingly followed up with a report that Apple is planning to launch new Mac laptops with E-Ink dynamic keyboards in 2018 that include contextually-sensitive display emojis and special characters. That sounds a lot like Sonder’s tech and an expansion of the Touch Bar to a full keyboard, and that would also make it possible for Apple to release a standalone keyboard with similar functionality for desktop Macs– something that was a big topic of conversation following the introduction of the Touch Bar on MacBook Pro. Apple Watch With the recent introduction of the Series 2 Apple Watch and Nike+ Edition model, we got a taste of how Apple will play the Watch upgrade cycle. It ditched the gold this time around and introduced a more mid-range but premium ceramic model, introduced a new and improved but lower-end Series 1, and in the process updated the entire line with new specs for Series 2 including an increased focus on health and activity features. I’d expect a similar update for Series 3 in the fall this year, although not much is known about what Apple has in the works. Cellular connectivity and integrated cameras, perhaps for FaceTime, have been features many have speculated could be next. At the very least I’d expect to see new materials used– black ceramic is an option, as is titanium, both materials popular among high-end watchmakers without gold price points. As always, we could get a preview of new software features at WWDC in June. Apple TV / Siri Speaker Not much is known about Apple TV upgrades that might be in the works for 2017, but all the reports of Apple’s negotiations with cable companies and content providers for a TV service could hopefully result in something this year. Apple is also stepping up efforts with original content including its first documentary as a tie-in with Apple Music. The company notably released a new TV app for Apple TV late in 2016, which we noted could really be seen as a first step to a full-fledged streaming service. And it’s currently US only, as is the new single-sign on feature that makes it easy to authenticate your cable provider and access available content while we wait for that real streaming service. So there’s lots of room for expansion there. Like the other OS updates, we’d expect tvOS 11 to be previewed at WWDC in June. At WWDC last year Apple released its Siri SDK, a move that was reportedly made ahead of a planned Amazon Echo/Google Home hardware competitor. Reports of that device’s development have been plenty, including a recent report from Bloomberg that product is now in prototype testing ahead of an expected 2017 release. That report also noted that Apple once considered offering the functionality in the form of an updated Apple TV, but we’d expect the standalone Siri speaker to still be highly integrated with upcoming tvOS and HomeKit updates. BeatsX AirPods are out, but Apple’s other W1-chip enabled Bluetooth earbuds called BeatsX won’t arrive until February according to recent reports. These aren’t cord-free, and they are priced similarly to AirPods at $149, but they pack in longer 8 hour battery life, Lightning charging, and a more customizable fit than AirPods with all the pairing and connectivity benefits of the W1 chip.  Campus 2 Apple is expected to be moving over 13,000 employees into its new 176-acre “Campus 2” this year, making the site not only the company’s new Cupertino HQ but also the venue of future product unveilings and Apple events. That could give a new face to Apple events being planned for 2017, and the company could perhaps even have something special planned for early this year when it’s expected to officially begin moving in. It’s unclear if Apple could possibly host all of its future events at the campus and the location’s 1000 seat auditorium, or if it will continue to host larger events like WWDC at outside venues.  The company is currently thought to be planning a move to the location by the end of January 2017, that is at least according to Tim Cook’s latest memo to employees last year. Apple started hiring full-time staff for the new campus back in November, and it estimates landscaping work to continue into the first quarter of 2017.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: AI 5 deep learning startups to follow in 2017 Jordan Novet@jordannovet January 1, 2017 12:10 PM Tags: artificial intelligence, Bay Labs, Cerebras Systems, deep learning, Deep Vision, Graphcore, top-stories, Visenze Above: ViSenze cofounder and chief technology officer Guangda Li. Image Credit: ViSenze If artificial intelligence (AI) hadn’t hit the mainstream before, it did this year. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai came through with the best sound bite, saying that the world is going from being “mobile-first” to “AI-first.” Apple squished AI into the iPhone, and Google stuck it in the Pixel. Facebook brought it to the News Feed, and Microsoft put it in Word. Samsung bought AI startup Viv to catch up with Apple’s Siri virtual assistant. And messaging apps like Skype and Messenger now feature chatbots. Much of the AI attention has been focused on deep learning, which entails training artificial neural networks on lots of data and then getting them to make inferences about new data. And in the past five years, more and more deep learning startups have cropped up. This year, chipmaker Intel bought Nervana, which was making hardware and software for deep learning, and enterprise software company Salesforce bought MetaMind, which made deep learning software that could quickly process lots of images and text. Both Nervana and MetaMind appeared on my list of five deep learning startups to follow in 2015. Meanwhile, the startups on my 2016 list are all chugging along. Now I have a new batch of companies to watch for in the year ahead: Bay Labs Bay Labs is among the startups applying deep learning to medical imaging. Its engineering-heavy team includes Johan Mathe, who previously worked on Google’s Project Loon. Yann LeCun, director of Facebook’s artificial intelligence research group, has invested in the startup, along with Khosla Ventures. Cerebras Systems Cerebras is a secretive startup headed up by Andrew Feldman, who sold microserver company SeaMicro to AMD for $334 million. Feldman’s new startup is building AI hardware, and esteemed venture capital firm Benchmark led a funding round totaling more than $20 million, according to a source familiar with the matter. (Feldman wouldn’t comment for this article.) Deep Vision Based in Palo Alto, Deep Vision is building low-power chips for deep learning. While at Stanford, two of the startup’s cofounders, Rehan Hameed and Wajahat Qadeer, cowrote an interesting paper laying out a “Convolution Engine chip multiprocessor.” Graphcore Graphcore has developed an intelligent processing unit (IPU) PCIe accelerator that neural networks can use for training and making inferences. The startup has also built software for working with its infrastructure using the existing MXNet and TensorFlow deep learning frameworks. Investors include Bosch Venture Capital, Foundation Capital, and Samsung Catalyst Fund. ViSenze Founded in 2012, ViSenze performed better than several groups in certain parts of the 2016 ImageNet image recognition competition. Funded by Rakuten Ventures, ViSenze is a spinoff of NExT, a research center established by National University of Singapore and Tsinghua University of China. Its software can perform object recognition and tagging for images and videos and provide visually similar content. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Jan 1, 2017 at 1:33PM Oftentimes, portfolio performance can benefit from lack of action. In other words, investors may be better off simply leaving their stocks alone, and not worrying about timing the market to buy and sell at the right times. "We continue to make more money when snoring than when active," famed investor Warren Buffett has said. On a similar note, he has said, "Our favorite holding period is forever." With this important investment principle in mind, here are three stocks in my portfolio I almost certainly won't be selling in 2017: Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Image source: Getty Images. Tesla Motors: Tesla is likely the riskiest stock of these three. But selling before the automaker launches its lower-cost Model 3, which ultimately represents the realization of the company's "master plan" laid out over 10 years ago, could be a mistake. While the stock's valuation has undoubtedly already priced in expectations for extraordinary growth, 400,000 deposit-backed reservations for the highly anticipated vehicle preview a potential major tipping point toward electric vehicles -- and Tesla would be at the center of this critical shift. Facebook: Facebook stock has run into some road bumps recently. The stock has slid about 11% since the company reported its third-quarter results on Nov. 2. The quarter's results were great, but investors were spooked by management's references to expectations for big investments in 2017. Investors, however, have seen this before. In 2014, Facebook similarly warned investors of plans for big investments -- and the stock has since soared 56%. Obviously, big spending doesn't automatically mean Facebook's stock will rise again. But the world's largest social network has earned my trust with its long-term plans as it charged forward with big investments in mobile, predicted Instagram's huge potential when it purchased it for $1 billion, and improved its native Facebook platform at a blistering speed that competition can't match. And it's not like Facebook can't afford to get more aggressive with its spending. The company generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow in its most recent quarter alone -- up from $1.4 billion in the year-ago quarter. Apple: Apple's revenue and EPS have faced headwinds recently, down 9% and 15%, respectively, in the tech giant's fiscal fourth quarter compared to the year-ago period. So why would I hold onto a business with financial results so dismal? Two reasons: The stock is cheap. With its price-to-earnings ratio of just 14, Apple stock already prices in expectations for sustained challenges. The scale and reach of Apple's robust ecosystem of user-friendly products has proved to be a sustainable foundation for customer loyalty, pricing power, and repeat purchases. Sometimes, it's best just to sit back and give your stocks time to perform. Image source: Getty Images. But beyond these reasons for holding these three stocks throughout 2017, my main motive for holding them is simply to avoid the pitfalls of market timing and to maximize my time invested in stocks. The best way I know to invest is to simply buy solid companies with long-term prospects and hold them for the long haul. Sure, if Tesla, Facebook, or Apple begin to consistently make poor decisions, I may consider selling. But barring any major unexpected issues, I plan to give them the chance to meet -- or possibly even exceed -- my expectations in 2017 and beyond.

The smartphone industry has been one of the, if not the, most fast-paced industries in the realm of technology. This has been especially true for the leaders of the smartphone industry, Samsung and Apple, as they release brand new flagships year in and year out, with the next one showcasing even more cutting-edge tech than the last. But did you know that Apple’s latest premium smartphone line, the iPhone 7, is equipped with tech that has been abandoned by most smartphones as early as the Samsung S II? Yup, the iPhone 7 is still equipped with an LCD screen, a technology that has been gaining declining support from smartphone creators as early as 2008, when Nokia came out with the first AMOLED display smartphone: the Nokia N85. The iPhone 7 refused to jump on the AMOLED bandwagon [Image by Chesnot/Getty Images] For the not-so-technologically-savvy, AMOLED and LCD displays both have merits to themselves, as expertly nitpicked by Android Authority. LCD displays have had a good run, donning a more consistent screen life than AMOLED, but as people tend to upgrade more frequently nowadays, beautiful displays start to supersede display life. AMOLED displays, in particular, has been gaining momentum in the smartphone industry in the recent years as it is able to display unmatched color saturation, good battery life preservation, and opens new doors of possibilities when it comes to creating thin and flexible displays. Bendable OLED prototype [Image by Jae C. Hong/AP Photo] While the iPhone 7 has pulled through with LCD by incorporating technology called DCI-P3 wide color gamut into its LCD, as Wiredexplains, it looks like the time has come for the smartphone giant to finally yield to the AMOLED trend as news from DigiTimes reports that Samsung will be supplying AMOLED panels for Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8. According to the report, Samsung Display will become the exclusive supplier of AMOLED panels, which will be used by the 2017 iPhone 8. According to their unidentified sources, Apple will launch 4.7-, 5.5-, and 5.8-inch new iPhone models in the second half of 2017. Interestingly, the 4.7- and 5.5-inch variants will still come in the traditional iPhone LCD. The huge 5.8 version, the version believed to be the iPhone 8 flagship, will be the only variant to come with the AMOLED panel. Leaks and rumors of the iPhone 8 coming with AMOLED and bezel-less displays have been circulating before 2016 came to a close, and it looks like multiple sources are corroborating the information that, indeed, the iPhone 8 will set another bar for the smartphone industry. Surely, Apple is preparing some explosive stuff for their upcoming iPhone 8, since it will mark the line’s 10th year anniversary. iPhones have stuck with mid-sized smartphones before they broke the trend with the iPhone 6, so it’s not such a big surprise that they are releasing an ever bigger iPhone 8 as the market continues to shift to preferring huge displays, like Samsung’s Galaxy Note series. Forbes, along with other reports, expects that the 5.8 inches that the iPhone 8 will come in will not only be its phone size, but its display size as well, as rumors point to a bezel-less iPhone 8, much like the Galaxy S7 Edge and the short-lived Galaxy Note 7. iPhone 8: Everything we currently know about Apple’s 10th anniversary flagship https://t.co/rgUYP9hM7n #iPhone — iPhone News (@iPhone_News) December 30, 2016 The report also suggests that Apple is expecting 60-70 million units of iPhone 8 to ship globally in 2017, which s a pretty bold estimate for Apple since the company has witnessed a consistent decline in iPhone sales in the recent years. But as Apple celebrates its 10th year anniversary, it looks like the iPhone 8 only aims to go big, lest it goes home. The new iPhone 8 is expected to start production as early as March, with an estimated release date of September 2017. What game-changing design do you think will the iPhone 8 introduce this time around?

The iPhone 7 turned out to be a great phone, but Apple upset a lot of people by removing the headphone jack. The AirPods were delayed two months, meaning most people couldn't get them in time for the holidays. (You'll have to wait until February 2017 for them to arrive if you order them now.) And Consumer Reports torched the new MacBook Pro for its inconsistent battery life. So what does 2017 look like for Apple? Here's what I predict will dominate the conversation around Apple's products next year. It's not an all-inclusive list, but it's the stuff you'll likely care the most about. New iPads © Provided by Business Insider Inc AP It feels like an eternity since Apple had anything to say about the iPad. We got the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro this past spring, but every other iPad model is one to three years old at this point.  The lineup is well overdue for a refresh, and it sounds like that may be coming soon. Rumors are all over the place, but it sounds like Apple is planning to release some new iPad models in the spring of 2017. Some reports say the new iPads will have slightly larger screens (10 inches, up from 9.7 inches), and that the non-Pro models will work with the Apple Pencil. Unfortunately, the early reports about the new crop of iPads are so consistent that it's tough to lock down exactly what Apple will end up launching. But it is pretty clear Apple's 2017 will start with the iPad. A greater emphasis on Siri © Provided by Business Insider Inc AP Two of Apple's biggest rivals doubled down on voice assistants this year, leaving Siri in the dust. Google launched its excellent new Assistant on the Pixel phone and Google Home speaker. Assistant can tap into Google's vast library of internet knowledge to bring you the answers you want. Amazon continued to define the voice assistant category by expanding Alexa to new Echo devices like the Dot and Amazon Tap. Plus, third parties started integrating Alexa into their gadgets. (Expect to see so much more of that in 2017, by the way.) Despite its five-year head start on the competition, Siri still feels woefully behind. Apple added limited third-party support for Siri, but there are few signs it's really taking off.  What could we see from Siri in 2017? The good news for Apple is it's sitting on a lot of excellent AI and voice control technology, especially thanks to its purchase of a UK-based startup called VocalIQ. I wrote about VocalIQ way back in May. The technology would allow users to control all their Apple gadgets with just their voice, which will be useful in the home, car, and while using the AirPods. Here's what I reported at the time: Because VocalIQ understands context so well, it essentially eliminates the need to look at a screen for confirmation that it’s doing what you want it to do. That’s useful on the phone, but could be even better for other ambitious projects like the car or smart-speaker system Apple is reportedly building. (VocalIQ was being pitched as a voice-controlled AI platform for cars before Apple bought the company.) In fact, VocalIQ only considers itself a success when the user is able to complete a task without looking at a screen. Siri, Google Now, and Cortana often ask you to confirm tasks by tapping on the screen. 2017 would be a great time for Apple to start incorporating VocalIQ's technology into Siri, considering how far ahead the competition is today.  Another dull year for the Mac © Provided by Business Insider Inc AP The only thing of note to happen with the Mac this year was the launch of the new MacBook Pro. And even that was met with a lot of anger. Many were upset that they had to purchase a lot of adapters to get their accessories to work with the new Thunderbolt 3 port. And then everyone learned the MacBook Pro's battery life was nowhere near as good as Apple claimed. Bummer. It doesn't look like much more is in store for the Mac in 2017. The iMac could get a spec bump and the battery life on the MacBook Pro could (and should!) get fixed, but don't expect much else. Modest improvements to the Apple Watch © Provided by Business Insider Inc AP Apple learned a major lesson with the Apple Watch, and has since scaled back expectations for the device and focused on health and fitness instead with the new Apple Watch Series 2. It's unlikely the Apple Watch will get a significant update in 2017, but I wouldn't be surprised if a new model showed up with 4G connectivity so you could use it without your iPhone. A major iPhone refresh © Provided by Business Insider Inc AP 2017 will mark the iPhone's tenth anniversary, and it sounds like Apple is gearing up for a blowout. The next iPhone is said to be a major refresh with an all-glass design, no bezels around the screen, and possibly a version with a curved display. Not to mention wireless charging, the death of the home button, and a new screen technology called OLED, which provides deeper, richer colors. By now there are so many reputable reports backing up these claims that it's silly not to believe them. The iPhone is Apple's most important and profitable product. If it feels like the company has shifted focus from other categories to focus on the iPhone, it's easy to see why. It's the product you're going to care the most about and spend the most money on. Expect to start seeing the first design leaks early in 2017. Rebound? After a year full of various stumbles, Apple is exiting 2016 on shakier ground than it started. Besides the next iPhone, there doesn't seem to be too much coming in the pipeline to get super excited about. The big challenge for Apple in 2017 will be to unlock more potential from its products by continuing to improve where it's always been the weakest: AI, software, and other digital services.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Apps & Software AirPods might not be impossible to find for much longer Chris Smith @chris_writes January 1st, 2017 at 10:10 AM Share Tweet The AirPods are Apple’s hottest product right now, but the company is having trouble meeting the unexpectedly high demand that followed the delayed launch. Apple may have missed out on the crucial Christmas shopping season, but that might not be bad news considering that people are still looking to get their hands on a pair (if you’re still looking to score a pair of AirPods, this post will show you how). To that end, Apple’s AirPods manufacturer is reportedly in the process of expanding AirPods production capacity. Don't Miss: Here’s what a Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus looks like after 3 months without a case According to Chinese-language Economic Daily News, quoted by Digitimes, Apple’s AirPods supplier Inventec has recently started expanding capacity at its Shanghai plants to increase output. The plants are also working overtime to deliver orders, the report goes to note. That said, we have no idea how many AirPods Apple has made so far, how many it’s mass-producing every day, or how many it has sold so far. Apple CEO Tim Cook said a few days ago that the AirPods are a “runaway success” for the company. That may very well be an accurate way to describe Apple’s performance, but Cook did not translate the company’s runaway success into actual numbers. What’s clear is that the $159 iPhone accessory is a big success with Apple fans. If you still haven’t had a chance to buy yours, at least now you know Apple is doing everything it can to increase supply. If you’re looking to find out when the AirPods will be in stock near you, check out this handy resource.

Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat The 2016 MacBook Pro is scandalous. Relative to its predecessor, it’s missing ports, short on battery life, skimpy in the keyboard department, and more expensive. Following reports of battery issues, Apple ultimately chose to remove its estimate of how long the battery would last. Consumer Reports declined to recommend the device. Me, personally? I really like this laptop, even with its imperfections. It is thinner and lighter. More of the case is made out of aluminum. The speakers are louder. The trackpad is larger. And if you pay extra, there’s a Touch Bar display above the keyboard that gives you a new way to control things. And it comes in space gray! Above: The 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro is 0.59 inches thick. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat I will admit that, feature by feature, a 2015 MacBook Pro may be a better choice for some. (HDMI port? SD card slot? USB-A? MagSafe? Yeah.) But the new version is well polished. Do I wish I could upgrade it myself? Of course. Could the battery last longer? Oh, yes. The thing is, it’s the finest laptop I’ve ever used. Touch ID Apple has come up with an excellent answer to Microsoft’s Windows Hello feature in Windows 10, which lets people sign in by doing nothing more than looking at a PC’s display — specifically infrared cameras. Apple didn’t have to invent anything new; it simply added the Touch ID fingerprint scanner that’s been available on iOS devices for three years. But instead of doubling as a home button, it serves as a power button on the MacBook Pro models that come with the Touch Bar. It’s not as fast as fingerprint scanners on other devices, like Huawei’s Mate 9 phone. And you can’t always use Touch ID to authenticate — like when you restart, for example. But when it is available as an option, it speeds up the process of signing in and buying things on desktop. The Touch Bar Right up with Touch ID, the Touch Bar is the main attraction of the 2016 MacBook Pro. The biggest question I’ve asked myself about the Touch Bar since Apple first revealed it is whether it’s something you must have. After using the base-model 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar as my main computer for a month and a half, I’ve concluded that you can live without it. In fact, Apple advises developers against exposing features exclusively in the Touch Bar. That said, the Touch Bar can provide an easier way to access features that are ordinarily hard to find. That’s true with the Ulysses writing app, for example. Above: MacBook Pro Touch Bar. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat A small experimental development community has formed around it — see games like Pac-Bar and TouchBarPong — suggesting that developers are intrigued by the component’s possibilities. And I don’t miss the F row of keys that the Touch Bar replaces as much as I thought I would. The software escape button at the left end of the Touch Bar usually does the trick. And I like that Siri now has its own dedicated button. Could Apple make the Touch Bar brighter? Yes. Could more app developers optimize for it? Absolutely. I still like it. I look forward to seeing it on Apple’s standalone keyboards and less expensive MacBooks. Display The 13.3-inch, 2,560-by-1,600px Retina display is damn clear. It’s more precise than any laptop I’ve tested. It makes additional connected monitors less interesting. It gets quite bright, too, at 500 nits. Watching high-definition video and zooming in on quality photos is a treat. Keyboard and trackpad The keyboard does indeed resemble the extremely shallow one on the 12-inch MacBook Pro. The Pro is thankfully more comfortable to type on, though; you don’t need to push the keys so hard to make your keystrokes known. I’ve grown to love writing on it for long stretches of time — even at night it’s fine because the keyboard backlight lights up every key evenly, unlike HP’s Spectre x360. But during quiet hours I try to tap more gently, because the keys can make a good amount of noise. The trackpad is definitely giant. And I like it that way; I haven’t encountered problems with palm rejection when I’m typing. Build quality The overall look and feel of the laptop is top-choice as well. The edges of the aluminum case are satisfyingly sharp. It still feels sturdy even though it is a tenth of an inch thinner and half a pound lighter than the previous generation. Nothing here feels flimsy. Above: The back of the 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro in space gray. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat Performance Generally speaking, this computer can handle heavy computational loads. It’s certainly more powerful than the 12-inch MacBook. But it does occasionally stumble. Under the weight of a few dozen browser tabs, for example, it can slow down. The laptop I’ve been testing has a 2.9GHz sixth-generation Intel Skylake Core i5 chip, an Intel Iris Graphics 550 integrated graphics processing unit (GPU), 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM, and a 256GB solid-state drive (SSD). Given the $1,800 price, one might hope for more. Battery life The same goes for the battery. Apple advertises up to 10 hours of wireless web usage on all variations of the new MacBook Pro, but I’ve never gotten more than around eight hours on the 13-inch Touch Bar model, with its 49.2 watt-hour battery. My average was below five hours. Put another way, I get less out of one charge than I did on the 2016 12-inch MacBook Pro — and my early 2014 13-inch MacBook Air. Yes, you can live with low battery life if you bring an external battery everywhere you go. I’ve come to think of this as a necessity for the current MacBook Pro. It’s not convenient — it does cancel out the weight savings! — but it’s workable. Ports Leave your charger at the office? No problem — if you have a USB-C charger handy. I’ve got one here from HP at the moment — you’ll be fine. It just works. This is one upside of the arrival of USB-C on the Mac. Having four USB-C ports, up from one on the 12-inch MacBook, is freeing. It’s proven to be enough for me. But the important thing here is what’s not present. I’ve gotten by with just a couple of USB-A to USB-C adapters and a VGA Multiport adapter. People with more complex needs may have to rely on more dongles, which can be tiresome. Altogether All in all, I feel very productive on the new MacBook Pro. Its usual responsiveness is engaging, and typing on it feels natural. But it could be more powerful given its price tag. So people will need to decide for themselves if they should pay more to get improved specs on the Touch Bar models. (The non-Touch Bar version may be out of the question for some because it has just two USB-C ports.) Either way, in the coming years Apple will inevitably enhance this laptop just like it does all of its products. When that happens — when it gets new chips and longer battery life, and when there are thousands of apps that integrate with the Touch Bar — the MacBook Pro will be a better choice.

According to a new leak, the upcoming beta update will bring a "Theater" mode to the table, but what could it entail?  ( Deborah Breen Whiting | Pixabay ) Advertisement Apple is reportedly gearing up to release iOS 10.3.1 beta in January and it could include an intriguing "Theater" mode, according to a new leak. The beta update could be focused on improving the iPad experience, but it remains unclear just what that Theater mode would entail. Before we dive any deeper, keep in mind that this information is not official and it may well turn out to be fake. In fact, Apple-centric publication AppleInsider says this rumor is "highly questionable" and it's best to take it with a hefty grain of salt. With that out of the way, here's the deal. Tipster Sonny Dickson, who has leaked Apple-related info on several occasions in the past, has now taken to Twitter to reveal that Apple will start seeding iOS 10.3 beta 1 on Jan. 10 and the update will include this so-called Theater mode. iOS 10.3 to feature a new Theatre mode - will include a new popcorn-shaped Control Center icon. — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 30, 2016 iOS 10.3 Theater: What Could It Be? The tipster doesn't offer any additional details as to what this Theater mode will bring to the table, so it remains unclear for now just how it will work. The purported name, however, suggests some special controls or settings for when users want to enjoy a movie without distractions. For instance, Theater mode could be a quick-access mode to disable system sounds, enable haptic feedback, reduce screen brightness and block incoming calls and messages when watching a movie. This mode would be suitable for going to a movie theater. At the same time, it could also refer to a set of settings for watching a movie on an iOS device, such as lowering the volume of system sounds or muting them without affecting the audio of the movie. iOS 10.3 Beta Release The purported Jan. 10 release date for the first iOS 10.3 beta would fall in line with AppleInsider's site analytics, which registered an increase in visits from Apple devices running iOS 10.3. The publication notes that it started seeing hits a few months ago, but there has been a significant spike in the past week. This could suggest that the beta is getting closer to release and a Jan. 10 rollout date doesn't seem too far-fetched. Aside from adding this rumored Theater mode, iOS 10.3 should also include some fixes to patch up the issues marring the iOS experience, which only got worse with the iOS 10.2 update. Battery drain is among the most persistent issues that Apple has yet to fix, but iOS 10.2.1 beta testers might have found a potential solution. It remains to be seen if the latest leak is accurate and, if so, just what iOS 10.3 will entail exactly. Until formal confirmation, however, retain a healthy dose of skepticism.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Partnered with Photographers to Capture New Year's Celebrations from around the World on iPhone 7 | Main | Note7 Probe Results due this Month While Samsung Admits that Growth will lag in 2017 Due to Tough Competition » January 01, 2017 Apple's Chief Israeli Officer Appointed to Run the Israeli Government's 'Innovation Authority'   Apple acquired Anobit in 2011 and hired Aharon Aharon, a high profile figure in the Israeli tech scene. He founded Camero, an RF-based imaging system company in 2004, and worked for Zoran, Discretix and IBM. It was reported that Apple hired Aharon to assist them in opening a semiconductor development center in Israel. This week an Israeli publication reported that Aharon Aharon will be leaving Apple in the coming months to run Israel's 'Innovation Authority' which used to be called the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Economy Ministry. The Authority is in charge of the nation's innovation policies and aims to help foster resources and conditions to promote the nation's technological ecosystem.   The Times of Israel oddly referred to Aharon Aharon as the CEO of Apple Israel. The report specifically stated that "Aharon has served since 2011 as CEO of Apple Israel, and previously served in the IDF's elite Intelligence Unit 8200. He holds two degrees from the Technion, in computer and electrical engineering."   I don't know if that title is official or if it's just an awkward Israeli interpretation of the post he held, but it was used three times. Israel's Haaretz reporting on this same story simply referred to Aharon as 'Apple Israel Chief.'   Among the key challenges Aharon will have to face are an acute shortage of skilled manpower the high-tech industry is facing, to help continue to fuel the tech sector. The high-tech industry contributes to 50 percent of Israeli exports but employs less than 10% of the workers in the economy.   Whether Aharon's new appointment will give Apple any better governmental connections is unknown at this time, but it certainly won't hurt.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The story of how Steve Jobs saved Apple from disaster and led it to rule the world, in 39 photos Matt Weinberger Jan. 1, 2017, 9:30 AM 424,964 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple co-founder Steve JobsAlessia Pierdomenico / Reuters Nowadays, Apple is the most valuable company in the world, thanks in huge part to the vision of the company's late cofounder and CEO Steve Jobs. But if you only saw the movie, you got less than half of the story. Once upon a time, Apple was a disaster, chewing through CEOs and delivering one bad quarter of financial results after another. In 1996, knowing he had to do something dramatic, Apple's CEO at the time Gil Amelio negotiated a deal to buy NeXT, the computer company owned by an exiled Jobs, in hopes that he would bring some much-needed direction to the company. Instead, Jobs manipulated the board into getting Amelio fired and decided that if Apple were to be saved, he would be the one to do it — even if it meant getting help from the company's rivals at Microsoft. Here's what happened next. View As: One Page Slides In late 1996, Apple announced plans to bring cofounder Steve Jobs back into the fold 11 years after he left the company by acquiring his startup NeXT for $429 million — just in time for Jobs to join then-Apple CEO Gil Amelio on stage at January 1997's Macworld Expo, a convention for Mac enthusiasts, as a keynote speaker. Lou Dematteis/Reuters Steve Jobs' NeXT found its niche selling graphically intensive PCs with cutting-edge screens to universities and banks. Apple hoped that Jobs would revitalize the Mac maker, whose stock had hit a 12-year low under Amelio's leadership and experienced crippling losses. AP Images On July 4, 1997, Jobs persuaded Apple's board to oust Amelio and make Jobs the interim, and then permanent, CEO. In August 1997, Jobs took the stage at another Macworld Expo to announce that Apple had taken a $150 million investment from its long-time rivals at Microsoft. "We need all the help we can get," Jobs said, to boos from the audience. Jim Bourg/Reuters In fact, by 1997, Apple's financial situation was so dire that Dell CEO and founder Michael Dell, one of Microsoft's biggest partners, once said that if he were in Jobs' shoes, he'd "shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders." Mario Tama/Getty Images But in early 1998, at yet another Macworld Expo in San Francisco, Jobs ended his keynote with the first of his soon-to-be ubiquitous "One More Thing" announcements: Thanks to Jobs' product direction and Microsoft's help, Apple was finally profitable again. Reuters Also in 1998, Jobs hired an executive named Tim Cook to head up Apple's worldwide operations. Cook would stay with the company, eventually becoming chief operating officer. Flickr/Thetaxhaven Jobs needed the help. At this point, Jobs was CEO of both Apple and Pixar Studios, of which he had become chief investor in 1986 after funding it with $10 million. Jobs is actually credited as an executive producer on 1995's "Toy Story." Getty / Gabe Palacio Behind the scenes, Jobs was making some big changes for Apple employees, too: Under Jobs, the Apple cafeteria got much better food, and employees were barred from bringing their pets to the campus. He wanted everybody focused on Apple. Instagram, @paulomshah Almost exactly a year after that Microsoft cash came in, in August 1998, Apple would release the iMac, an all-in-one, high-performance computer codesigned by Jobs and new talent Jonathan Ive. Mousse Mousse/Reuters The iMac came in multiple colors, the first time the world would get a taste of Ive's computer design sensibilities. This first iMac was a much-needed hit, selling 800,000 units in its first five months. AP Jobs had originally pitched the name "MacMan" for this new Mac. It was Ken Segall, an executive with Apple's ad agency at the time, who suggested "iMac." The "i" is for "internet," since it took only two steps to connect to the web, in case you were wondering. But Apple has also said it stands for "individuality" and "innovation." Ken Segall The naming scheme would stick around. In 1999, Apple introduced the "iBook," a funky machine that tried to replicate the iMac's success as an entry-level laptop. Photos courtesy of Portfolio/Penguin, publisher of JONY IVE, The Genius Behind Apple's Greatest Products But Apple's next really dramatic move would come in 2001, when Mac OS X was released. Where Apple had been treading water with Mac OS 8 and 9, OS X was a drastic redesign, based largely on the Unix and BSD technology at the core of Jobs' NeXT Computers. Lou Dematteis/Reuters From here, things started moving fast and furious for Apple. Later in 2001 Apple would open its first retail stores, in Virginia and California. Mario Tama/Getty Images In October, Jobs' Apple would take its first steps beyond the Mac with the iPod, a digital music player that promised "1,000 songs in your pocket." The iPod actually got off to a slow start, largely because it started at a pricey $399 and worked only on Macs. STR New/Reuters In 2003, Apple opened up the iTunes Music Store, with its novel pricing model of $0.99 per song, to turn the iPod into the center of a digital media universe. Around the same time, both iTunes and the iPod hit Windows, jump-starting Apple's music play. Getty Images But in 2003 Jobs received some news that would cast a shadow over the good times at Apple: He had pancreatic cancer. He kept it a secret until sharing the news with employees in 2004. Sean Gallup/Getty Images In just six years, Apple had gone from a laughing stock in tech to a serious player. And from 2003 to 2006, it went from around $6 per share to about $80 per share. Apple was still lagging behind Microsoft in marketshare, but it was making serious money. Celebrities like U2 and John Mayer were tapped to help out at company events. Tim Mosenfelder / Getty Over the years, Jobs' Apple had been asked to extend its design expertise to creating a new touch-screen device. In 2004, Jobs convened Project Purple, under his supervision with Ive in charge, to develop a touch-screen device. Originally, Jobs was envisioning a tablet, but it eventually turned into a concept for a cell phone. BI The iPod lineup slowly grew, too. By 2005, there was the iPod, the iPod Mini, the iPad Nano, and the iPod Shuffle, in descending size order. That same year also saw the introduction of the first iPod with video, alongside the ability to buy movies and videos on iTunes. Don Synstelien In 2005, Motorola introduced the ROKR, a phone that it made in partnership with Apple. It was the first phone that could play music from the iTunes Music Store. But it was limited to being able to store only 100 songs because of a limit in its software. Flickr/nicolelee In 2006, Jobs made a big move that probably saved the Mac. Former CEO John Sculley had banked Apple's future on the pricey PowerPC processor, while the major Windows PC manufacturers stuck with Intel. It meant Macs were both more expensive to buy and harder to develop software for. But in 2006, Apple introduced the first MacBook Pro alongside a new iMac, both of which came with Intel processors. Lou Dematteis/Reuters It also meant that for the first time you could install Windows on a Mac. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Apple was on the upswing. In 2006, the flagship Apple Store opened in Midtown Manhattan. Its unique glass-cube structure makes it a modern New York City landmark. Seth Wenig/Reuters But at this point, Jobs' health was starting to fade, and observers started to take notice. Note how thin Jobs looks here, shaking hands with Disney CEO Bob Iger at a 2006 Apple event. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Still, 2006 also marked a personal victory for Jobs. He got to send this email to every Apple employee: "Team, it turned out that Michael Dell wasn't perfect at predicting the future. Based on today's stock market close, Apple is worth more than Dell. Stocks go up and down, and things may be different tomorrow, but I thought it was worth a moment of reflection today. Steve." Seth Wenig / Reuters After years of speculation, Jobs would officially unveil the iPhone at January 2007's Macworld Expo. It combined the music features of the iPod with a slick, responsive touch screen that didn't need a stylus, unlike most mobile devices at the time. And the iPhone's Safari was the first full-featured web browser on a phone. AP An excited media dubbed it the "Jesus Phone." Excited fans camped out in front of Apple Stores nationwide. Getty Images/Mario Tama The iPhone was a massive hit, taking only 74 days from its August 2007 launch to sell a million units. Sean Gallup/Getty Images In 2008, Apple released the first big iPhone update: the iPhone 3GS. It had faster network speeds, sure, but the biggest change was that it came with this thing called an App Store to let you install software from non-Apple developers. At launch, the App Store had 500 applications. Kimberly White/Reuters Famed venture investor John Doerr of Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers took the stage to announce a $100 million iFund for app developers. It was the start of the app economy, and Apple was leaving Microsoft in the dust. David Paul Morris/Getty Images Still, Jobs' health continued to loom over Apple. In August 2008, Bloomberg accidentally published a 2,500 word obituary of Jobs. At a September 2008 keynote, Jobs poked fun at the idea. Robert Galbraith/Reuters In 2009, Tim Cook was tapped as interim CEO while Jobs took the first of three extended medical leaves. Even on Jobs' return, Cook became a regular at Apple keynotes. When Jobs returned, his prognosis was listed as "excellent." REUTERS/Kimberly White In 2010, Jobs finally introduced the Apple iPad, the tablet he had been wanting since the early 2000s. Getty Images News The iPhone and the iPad accidentally started an internet standards war. Jobs thought Adobe's Flash, then the de facto standard for interactive web content, was slow and insecure. And so Apple's mobile devices didn't support it. A jilted Adobe, recognizing the threat this posed to its business, took out magazine ads begging Apple to reconsider, to no avail. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images In early 2011, during the last of his medical leaves, Jobs would give his final two product-announcement presentations: one in March for the iPad 2, and one in June for the iCloud service. Beck Diefenbach/Reuters Jobs made his last public appearance in June 2011. He proposed a new Apple Campus to the Cupertino City Council. After years of construction, Apple is planning to move into the "spaceship campus" in early 2017. Apple Jobs stepped down as Apple CEO on August 24, 2011, accepting a role as chairman, after his pancreatic cancer relapsed. Not long after, Jobs died on October 5, 2011, working for Apple until the day before his death. That night, the flags at Apple flew at half-mast. Wikimedia Commons Tim Cook got the nod as full-time CEO after Jobs' resignation. Apple has continued to grow under Cook, becoming the most valuable company in the world.

I broke my New Year’s resolution by January 4, but I started again on April 1 and ultimately lost over 50 pounds in 2016. Apple Watch didn’t lose the weight for me — it took a lot of dedication and really changing my lifestyle — but the fitness tracking features and Apple’s Activity app helped quantify my effort without me doing too little or going overboard. Apple Watch has absolutely been an effective motivational coach that has pushed me toward my goal of being more active. Below I’ll detail my experience and share some of what I’ve learned along my journey. Apple Watch Activity Rings show you Move, Exercise, and Stand. Move is how many active calories you’ve burned based on heart rate data, Exercise is how many minutes your heart rate has been elevated from an activity as simple as a brisk walk, and Stand is how many times you’ve stood up and moved around for at least one minute of any hour. Move, Exercise, and Stand are represented by three rings that close when you complete a goal. Move is a customizable goal that you can change at any time, Exercise is a fixed 30-minute goal but you don’t have to workout all at once, and Stand takes 12 different hours to complete. Activity Rings as visual indicators of my progress throughout each day have been super effective for me. I’ve tried other fitness trackers before but nothing has proved as friendly and motivational as Apple Watch. Part of what makes Apple Watch work for me is that it has appeal outside of activity tracking features: it’s a nice watch, it has Siri and Apple Pay, and it’s closely integrated with the iPhone. I wore mine for about a year before actually taking its fitness tracking features seriously. Achieving my weight loss goal still didn’t happen overnight. Losing the first ten pounds was the easiest then it got tougher, but creating a workout routine with Apple Watch dramatically helped. My advice for setting your personal Move goal is this: complete 30 minutes of exercise that you can consistently repeat daily then look at your Move number near the end of the day and make that your daily goal. For example, I started with 30 minutes of elliptical (15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the afternoon before I could complete a full 30-minute session) as my base workout. The workout burned around 300 active calories and I burned another 200 active calories a day without exercising so I set my Move goal at 500. Your Move goal could be lower or higher based on what workout you consistently complete, but the key is finding something that pushes you to move more without being too difficult to make part of your routine. Starting small is okay too. I gradually increased my Move goal up to 800 each day before hitting my goal of losing 50 pounds and reducing it back to 500, and there’s no way I could have started at 800 without being discouraged. Losing the weight took a combination of both diet and exercise, of course, and food tracking with Apple’s HealthKit feature really helped. I use MyFitnessPal to log my meals. It helps you set a daily calorie goal and automatically subtracts calories burned from exercise measured from Apple Watch. If your calorie goal is 2000 and you eat 2300 calories in a day and burn 350 calories from exercise, then you’re still in your goal. HealthKit support means data that you input in MyFitnessPal can be shared with Apple’s Health app, too, which can become a wealth of information as you collect more data. Dieting has been much tougher than exercise for me, but I don’t think I would be motivated to do one without doing the other. Because I was logging workouts with Apple Watch and completing my Activity Rings, I felt motivated to improve my diet as well. I’ve been a junk food eater for 25 years (and growing up on Southern cuisine hasn’t helped), but in April I gave up soda and sweet tea for water and unsweet tea and started drinking my morning coffee black. I also traded snacking throughout the day and oversized fast food meals at the end of the day for consistent and more considered breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. The trick to dieting for me has been to go easy on myself. I used to eat junk food all the time and occasionally have a healthy meal but that didn’t make me healthy. Now I try to eat better every day and enjoying junk food in moderation doesn’t define my diet. My family photo in December 2014 and December 2016 Meal logging sounds like a lot of work, but you probably eat the same foods routinely plus MyFitnessPal and similar apps have nice databases of nutritional information for lots of foods. This has also helped me be more thoughtful about my eating habits. If I couldn’t put a number on my eating habits, I might severely overestimate how much I’m eating and diet all wrong. Instead, I can see when I have room for a Pokémon Go frappe without missing my goal. It’s the same story for Apple Watch fitness tracking. It’s key for me to be able to gauge how much effort is enough without going overboard and thinking I have to do something unsustainable to be healthier. I weighed 211 on April 1 and 157 on December 31; my target goal is around 150 I’ve also found that weighing regularly has been very motivating. For me weighing daily has been most helpful, but weekly is usually recommended. I like the most amount of data I can capture and seeing patterns (up and down but overtime way down) has motivated me. I wake up every morning, put on my Apple Watch, weigh, then use that number to either feel good about my progress or push myself a little more while keeping the big picture progress in mind. I log my weight in Apple’s Health app, and seeing the number charted over time has been super informative for knowing how well I’m doing or if I’m off track. I started this with a basic scale and entering the data point in manually each day, then I upgraded a few months ago to a smart scale that adds the data automatically using HealthKit. I honestly never thought I could lose 50 pounds when I started in April — especially by the end of the year — but using Apple Watch to build a routine and quantify my effort helped make it possible. My initial goal was to lose ten pounds and I’ve taken it ten pounds at a time since I started without dramatically changing my routine. Starting a streak in the Activity app especially helped, which also made traveling during my summer vacation a bit challenging. When my wife and I drove 15 hours to Washington D.C. in August, I decided ahead of time that breaking my streak for a vacation would be fine. We ended up driving overnight both ways and shared driving duties so I was able to complete my Activity Rings during the day without breaking my streak. While I wouldn’t recommend everyone try so hard to keep a streak going, I have to admit that the effort on those two days pushed me to keep going on days when I didn’t actually have an excuse to slow down. This is where Apple Watch has seriously changed something about my life aside from helping me lose weight. I find time to squeeze in time for myself to exercise every single day, and this usually improves something about the rest of my day. For example, on both Thanksgiving and Christmas, I ran a 5K at sunrise which gave me time to think about the day and appreciate the hours ahead. I felt accomplished before the day really even started which helped me feel present in the moment for the rest of the day. (I also wake up earlier on most days to sort of game by Stand goal by getting an early start on it.) Exploring new workouts and routines with Apple Watch has also been a blast. I started out running but I really wasn’t good at it so decided it wasn’t for me. Apple’s Workout app can track elliptical workouts so I bought a used machine for my home office and made using it my daily exercise. I purchased a bike to add outdoor cycling to my routine just because the Apple Watch supported the workout and I wanted some variety in my routine. Then I revisited running a little at a time before it became routine. I started running 0.5 miles at a time (with a rest or two along the way) then graduated to a mile at a time before adding a 5K run every Sunday to my schedule which is one of the highlights of my week. My journey with Apple Watch has even expanded my family. I adopted a Dalmatian puppy named Hayley a few weeks ago. I’ve always admired Dalmatians, but they’re very active dogs and I was not an active person before. I was admittedly too lazy and inactive to be a good dog owner before. Now that I’ve transformed my lifestyle, I have a new running partner and my daughter has her first puppy. I’m seeing positive effects in different areas of my life all the time after taking a few steps back in April to do something different. When the weather warms up, I look forward to regularly swimming as part of my exercise routine. I tested swim tracking when Apple Watch Series 2 first launched in September, but for now, the water where I live is a little too cold for swimming so I’ll wait for warmer weather. Weight loss aside, I absolutely love how transformative Apple Watch has been in my everyday life. For anyone on a similar journey, I recommend starting slow and going easy on yourself. Stick to your routine even if you break it here or there. Apple’s Ring in the New Year Activity Challenge is a great place to start, but there’s never a bad time to start being more active whether it’s January 1 or June 15 if it’s something you want to do. New Year’s resolutions can be counterproductive if you feel like you have to get it right this time or wait another year to try again. If being more active is something you want to do but it doesn’t click today or this week or this month, keep your goal in mind and not the timing. For me, I fell off the wagon after only a few days last New Year’s Day, but picking back up on April 1 has tremendously helped how I feel about this New Year’s Day. I’ve also found sharing the experience with others along the way to be super beneficial. Apple’s Activity Sharing is fun to use with friends and family who use Apple Watch, talking about my goals and progress openly has helped me stay accountable, and keeping track of my progress has helped me feel good about my effort. Detail your effort on Facebook or Instagram or Twitter or Snapchat or wherever you feel a sense of community and you’ll be surprised at the encouragement that may come your way. I’m still a few pounds away from where I want to be personally then I want to explore new workouts and basic muscle-building, and Apple Watch has seriously helped me gain confidence in accomplishing this goal in ways that didn’t feel possible before. Going from super inactive to just trying to exercise every day can be a challenging transition, but today it just feels like an essential part of each day after a lot of failed starts in the past. There’s something super effective for me about gaming health with easy-to-capture metrics and achievable short-term and long-term goals. I could diet and exercise on my own but I had no idea where to start before; relying on Apple Watch as a coach has totally made the difference for me. Apple Watch has tremendously helped motivate me to change my life for the better and I’m happier for it today. If you’re embarking on a similar journey with Apple Watch, I would love to hear from you. Happy New Year and best of luck on your goals!

That’s the generation, said Walmart exec Mike Hulett, who drive a lot of marketing decisions by many of the nation’s Fortune 500 companies, including mega-retailer Walmart. Fruit marketers, he said, should take note. Hulett, who grew up in Chelan and is now based in Walmart’s home city of Bentonville, Arkansas, discovers and helps market fresh foods for the global corporation. On Dec. 5, he talked on “Mega-Trends for Fresh Produce Retail” at the Washington State Tree Fruit Association’s 112th Annual Meeting & NW Expo in Wenatchee. Hulett said Millennials, ages 16 to 35, are worth watching because they’re the largest generation in numbers (80 million in the U.S.) with the largest percentage of the nation’s workforce. Ninety-five percent of them are connected online, which makes them a powerful buying force. Most importantly, said, Hulett, as a group their highest value is direct experience rather than hearsay or second-hand knowledge. “They show status,” he said, “through the things they do.” So when it comes to apples, said Hulett, Millennials will prize its texture (crispness, crunchiness) and taste (flavor, freshness) and relate those qualities — good or bad — to their peers, either in person or through social media. Apples, pears and cherries also fit the Millennials’ idea of eating “clean and clear” foods that promote good health and enhance human performance, he said. Fruit also meets Millennials’ demand for convenient foods and “responsible snacking.” Among Millennials, “fresh” is the most sought-after food trend, with 87 percent of them currently seeking and buying fresh foods. “They seek fresh because they want to trust the foods they eat and the companies who provide it,” Hulett said. When marketing to Millennials, he said, “a lot of people in the grocery industry are betting on fresh as the key trend towards customer satisfaction.    Monthly ‘Shop Talks’ is all business WENATCHEE — The Wenatchee Downtown Association has launched a series of information meetings where merchants and employees can learn from fellow business folks. The hour-long monthly sessions — called “Shop Talks” — are set for 8:30 a.m. on the first Wednesday of each month. To begin, the sessions will be held in the meeting room of Merriment Party Goods, 23 S. Wenatchee Ave. Each session “will feature downtown merchants or members of the community and organizations who will connect us — teach us and inform us,” said Linda Haglund, the WDA’s executive director. The sessions are free and will include coffee and morning snacks. Presentations scheduled for coming months include social media, the historic relevance of downtown, insurance and benefits, succession planning, attracting new customers and more. Those planning to attend upcoming Shop Talks should RSVP Haglund at 662-0059 or linda@wendowntown.org.   Express Employment honored for hiring of veterans WENATCHEE — A local job placement company has been recognized as one of a dozen businesses around the state for its hiring of veterans in 2016. Express Employment Professionals of Wenatchee placed nine veterans in jobs in 2016 and participated in numerous veteran-focused job projects, including the Wenatchee Veterans Hiring Event in September. The state Employment Security Department announced award recipients in November in support of a Hire-A-Veteran proclamation by Gov. Jay Inslee. Other award recipients included businesses, nonprofits and government agencies in Yakima, Richland, Spokane, Olympia, Ferndale, Everett, Seattle and Woodland. From July 2015 through June 2016, WorkSource — the job and career arm of Employment Security — placed nearly 7,500 veterans into jobs, said an agency press release. About 85 percent were still employed after six months at an average wage of $17.60 per hour, the release said.   Goodwill is gravy at cafe’s 20th free Thanksgiving meal CHELAN — The Apple Cup Cafe in Chelan celebrated 20 years of serving up its free — yes, free — Community Thanksgiving Dinner on Nov. 24. Owner Ryan Peterson says around 900 people gobble-gobbled 44 huge turkeys and pans full of yams, corn, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes and gravy. And also hundreds of slices of pumpkin and apple pie. Much of the food is donated by the restaurant’s vendors and is prepared and served by scores of volunteers. Peterson’s mom, Dian Prentice, started the meal two decades ago after buying the restaurant, now in business for nearly 60 years. “This Thanksgiving Dinner has been a tradition for me since I was 9 years old,” said Peterson. “It started out as a way for us (Apple Cup Cafe) to give back to the community. But now it’s evolved into the community giving back to the community, sharing what we have with neighbors friends and family.”   Famous Footwear kicks off new store in East Wenatchee EAST WENATCHEE — Here’s some news to lift your soles: Buying shoes here just got a whole lot easier. Famous Footwear, the national chain with scores of shoe brands at more than 1,200 stores, opened its second area location Nov. 23 at Wenatchee Valley Mall.  “We’re in a prime spot next to Macy’s,” said manager Michael Imperato, a 9-year veteran of Wenatchee Valley retail. “It should be easy for customers to find us.” He and co-worker Silvia De Jesus, also a longtime retail pro, have transferred from Famous Footwear at Valley North Center in Wenatchee to open the new store across the river. De Jesus, who’s worked four years at the Wenatchee location, will serve as assistant manager. The new Famous Footwear will have 5,498 square feet of shopping and storage space and around 10 employees. The store opening in East Wenatchee coincides with another location that recently opened in Seattle. “Our decision to open two new stores was based on a recognized consumer need,” said Rick Ausick, president of Famous Footwear. The East Wenatchee store’s grand opening Dec. 10 featured a giveaway of 100 pairs of shoes to the first 100 customers.    Fruit magazine says ‘hola’ YAKIMA — One of the fruit industry’s primary publications, “Good Fruit Grower” magazine, has launched a Spanish-language website to serve the growing number of Latinos working in tree fruit and wine grape businesses.  The site features articles and essays by researchers published in the magazine, plus videos on best horticultural practices.  “Our new site is one more way we serve the grower community, and Spanish speakers are a vital part of that community,” said BJ Thurlby, president of the Washington State Fruit Commission, which owns the magazine.  Info: goodfruit.com/es.   Carl Campbell an unassuming success WENATCHEE — Carl Campbell lives in a 12,000-square-foot Wenatchee penthouse, loves his two big houses on Lake Chelan, has owned and piloted multiple private jets and until recently ran one of the nation’s largest companies of retirement and assisted-living communities. And — just ask anybody — he’s one of the nicest, most modest and quiet-spoken multi-millionaires you’d ever want to meet. “Carl’s a man of high moral character and extremely fair in business transactions, which in my opinion is the root of his success,” said Tom Leonard, an accountant who’s worked with Campbell for more than a decade. “He is a true gentleman,” said Sharon Tompkins, Campbell’s administrative assistant for the past 26 years. “Honest and humble.” Campbell, who at 95 stands at the edge of retirement, recently recapped his life of accomplishment — in health care, aviation, retail development and philanthropy — as he begins downsizing his living quarters and reducing his business responsibilities while expanding his commitment to family, church and community. “It’s time to retire, time for a younger generation to take over it all,” said the still sharp and energetic nonagenarian. “I’ve got other things on my plate.” And a crowded plate it is. In coming months and years, Campbell plans to: Help oversee the sale, announced in September, of the last four properties in his senior living empire to Vancouver-based Prestige Care, Inc., a family-run company which owns 70 senior communities in eight western states. Campbell’s company, Triple-C Convalescent Centers, once had more than 180 properties in 21 states. Step back from day-to-day operations but still be involved in the running of the Carl and Betty Campbell Foundation of Caring Fund, which has donated millions of dollars to local charities, churches and causes, including $1 million to the Central Washington Hospital Foundation in 2011. Resize and remodel his 12,000-square-foot penthouse apartment on the fifth floor of Colonial Vista Care Center down to a 1,200-square-foot living space. He’ll then portion off the rest for additional apartments for tenants. He’ll also continue to occupy his business office behind the Colonial Vista tower. Spend more time with family at his Lake Chelan properties and continue his involvement with the Wenatchee Seventh-day Adventist Church. Maybe even take a few cruises. Retirement, sure. But leisure? That may not come so easily for Campbell. “He’s a man who understands hard work,” said Leonard. “He and wife Betty started in the senior housing industry by performing all the services — administrative, assisting the residents, cooking, cleaning … all the hard work.” Even now when Campbell walks through the halls of Colonial Vista, he takes time to chat with employees and ask about their tasks. “He has great appreciation for the work they are performing,” said Leonard. “He was once in their shoes.” Beginnings Born in Yakima, Campbell grew up during the lean years of the Great Depression, a time that instilled in him a love of family, skills for saving and investing and an early understanding of the healthy diet advocated by the Seventh-day Adventists. Post high-school, Campbell studied to become a certified public accountant and then joined his brother Willis to work in the Alaskan lumber and building trades. He married Betty in 1942, and they were together — romantically and in business — for 68 years. The couple has two children — Kathy Ball, who with husband Marc runs The Guilded Lily in downtown Wenatchee, and Danny Campbell, who with his family lives in California — six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. In 1953, while working construction in Seattle, Campbell fell on a saw and cut off the four fingers of his right hand. Miraculously, a surgeon successfully sewed them back, although their mobility has been limited. “I can still type,” chuckled Campbell, “but only with one digit.” The trauma of losing and regaining his fingers spurred him, he said, “to pray to God, to promise him that if he saw me through this (tragedy), I would serve him the rest of my life.” Campbells pauses for a beat. “He did. I have. And my life has been full of his gifts.” One gift, he said, was a nursing home project in Union Gap that he completed with his brother — an old three-story house converted into a 7-bed nursing home facility. It was Campbell’s first senior living project, and in the next 40 years he’d build or operate around 180 more. Health care pioneers Carl and Betty Campbell moved to Wenatchee in 1953 — “we wanted to live away from the rainy side,” said Carl — and together began the design and construction of Parkside Sanitarium, one of the first full-service nursing homes in Eastern Washington. Carl handled finances and construction; Betty tackled interior design and office administration. It was a division of labor that would last until her death in 2010. “I was the boss,” he laughed, “but she didn’t always think I was.” The Campbells built more senior facilities — some of them assisted living homes, which were revolutionary for the time — in Cashmere, Chelan, Moses Lake, Spokane, Idaho and Oregon. “We were pioneers when it came to assisted living,” said Campbell. “Hardly anyone was doing it. But we saw the need and decided it was a concept we should try.” Their success in senior housing eventually grew to become Triple C Convalescent Centers, a company offering senior options from retirement to assisted living to skilled nursing facilities. Up in the air After Betty, Campbell’s second love was aviation. His office walls are packed with framed photos of airplanes and private jets — Learjets, Cessnas, Beechcraft — many of which he owned. Early in life, he became a pilot and by the time he stepped away from the cockpit (just over a decade ago) had clocked more than 6,000 hours in the air. Eventually, Campbell figured out how to combine his love of winged machines with business. In 1982 at Pangborn Memorial Airport, he opened Executive Flight, an air ambulance and charter business that grew to have 14 jets and more than 100 employees, including 50 pilots and 23 mechanics. The business thrived for 30 years, but the recession of 2008-09 took its toll on charter flights. Campbell and his staff ended charter services in 2012, sold all the planes but one, and now run the Executive Flight facility at Pangborn as an FBO (fixed base operation) service. That means fueling, maintenance and hangar rentals. “Over the years, it became more than a business to me,” said Campbell. “Yes, I’ve always loved aviation, but the air ambulance service touched many lives, helped so many residents here. People still tell me stories how the service helped them or a loved one.” Giving back As the Campbells prospered, they contributed millions. Donations helped fund the Central Washington Hospital Foundation, financed a new home for the East Wenatchee Seventh-day Adventist Spanish Church, built an expansion of the Cascade Christian Academy, funded medical research at various facilities and have helped back charitable efforts for dozens of local nonprofits and civic groups. “There are so many good causes out there, particularly in this area, that deserve support,” said Campbell. So what’s the secret of Campbell’s long and active life? “Oh, I suppose a mostly vegetarian diet, which is followed by many Seventh-day Adventists, has helped me stay healthy,” he said. “But I’m optimistic, too. I look forward to every day, to see what God has in store.” Tourism Summit now free OLYMPIA — Pack your bags. All fees to attend the 2017 Washington Tourism Summit are being covered by a handful of corporate and civic sponsors, including Boeing, Port of Seattle, Visit Seattle, a couple of tribal casinos and others.  Hosted by the Washington Tourism Alliance, the free summit kicks off at 8 a.m. Jan. 24 at the Washington Center for Performing Arts in Olympia. Keynote speaker will be Roger Dow, president of the U.S. Travel Association.  Info: watourismalliance.com/tourismsummit.   Native nonprofit to receive Wells Fargo grant NESPELEM — A Native American lending and business education group will receive a $240,000 grant from Wells Fargo bank. The Northwest Native Development Fund, based in Nespelem, is one of 12 institutions this year to receive such an award, called the “Wells Fargo Works for Small Business: Diverse Community Capitol” grants. Wells Fargo announced in November it will provide $11.2 million in lending capital and grant monies to minority-owned small businesses. All grant recipients are Community Development Financial Institutions, which are private, nonprofit groups that assist underserved populations. The NNDF will use the grant money to provide loans to small business owners who may not qualify for traditional financing and to also upgrade technology and increase technical assistance and coaching to borrowers.   Chelan Seaplanes loses lease, glides to a halt CHELAN — Lake Chelan’s only commercial seaplane service has suspended operations between Chelan and Stehekin following termination of the lease on a portion of its longtime lakeside location. Shane Carlson, owner of Chelan Seaplanes, said Dec. 1 he received a lease termination notice from the property’s new occupants — developers of the planned Sunset Marina LLC and condos — and has been unable to find a new, suitable lakeside location for the 71-year-old flight service. But he’s still looking. In 2009, Chelan Seaplanes took over operations of Chelan Airways, which had been flying the route to Stehekin and other Lake Chelan locations since 1945. The service has operated for more than 30 years on property next to the Lady of the Lake boat facility on Lake Chelan’s south shore. “This is a very sad day for Chelan Seaplanes, and we deeply regret the situation we are in,” Carlson said in a press release. “Most importantly, it’s a sad day for Stehekin and the Chelan Valley. The historic seaplane service has come to an end for now.” Scott McKellar, spokesman for the partnership building the marina and condos, confirmed his company had terminated the flight service’s lease, but said Carlson had known about the change since March. The terminated lease covers parking spaces used by Chelan Seaplane’s customers and an access area to an adjacent property where the planes dock, he said. Docking floats for the seaplanes are connected to a third party’s lakefront property. “We suggested other options to Mr. Carlson,” said McKellar, “but it’s up to him to act on them.” McKellar said Sunset Marina, in partnership with property owners Goodfellow Bros. Inc., will begin construction of the marina-condo development sometime this winter. Developers hope to build the foundation of a lakeside clubhouse while seasonal lake levels are at their lowest. Additional construction of the marina, condos and amenities will launch in the spring. Chelan Seaplanes operated each year between mid-May and mid-October, and in 2016 flew more than 5,000 passengers on scheduled flights between Chelan and Stehekin. The company, one of three Northwest flight services run by Carlson, usually kept one plane — a six-seat DeHavilland Beaver float plane — stationed in Lake Chelan with one full-time and three part-time pilots available. The company flew three scheduled flights daily, but charter runs sometimes pushed that number up to seven flights daily. In addition to Chelan Seaplanes, Carlson operates Friday Harbor Seaplanes, which is based in Renton, and Northwest Seaplanes, which runs scheduled and charter flights to British Columbia destinations. Carlson said he’s hopeful that the air company can resume service soon. He said he’s considered other lakeside locations as a seaplane base, but high costs or poor siting has eliminated most locations. Ideally, a new base would be a location protected from prevailing winds, not far from downtown Chelan and situated near the Lady of the Lake boat facility. Carlson estimated that between 30 and 45 percent of his seaplane customers use a boat-plane combination to visit Stehekin. Carlson said one option to save the air service would be a collaboration among Chelan Seaplanes, the City of Chelan and the Port of Chelan County to build a seaplane base. “We are confident that with the support of the Stehekin businesses and residents, along with those in the Chelan Valley that have valued the service, we will come together with a solution to restore the service and find a permanent home for the seaplane service,” said Carlson. “The service has been on the lake far too long to see it go away permanently,” he said.   Marson and Marson to merge with Tum-A-Lum LEAVENWORTH — Local building supply retailer Marson and Marson Lumber has announced it will merge its four-store chain with a similar-sized lumber and supply company located in Oregon. The 61-year-old Marson and Marson company — with stores in Leavenworth, Wenatchee, Chelan and Cle Elum — begins operating as part of the Tum-A-Lum Lumber company on Jan. 3. The local stores will continue to operate under the Marson and Marson name. “This move is part of our families’ long-term strategy for the growth of the company as well as providing future opportunities for our employees,” said Marson and Marson President Ken Marson. “Tum-A-Lum is a family-owned company with business values not unlike our company’s founders.” Marson said he will continue in company management for at least the next two years. He’s been with the business for 41 years and is the last founding-family member working for the company. The 70-employee Marson and Marson, which operates full-service lumber yards and building supply centers, was founded in 1955 by Gordon and Marydell Marson and Kenneth and Marie Marson. The merger includes the company’s four stores, a truss plant, design center and drywall distribution facility. Closing of the deal means Marson and Marson will become a division of TAL Holdings LLC, the parent company of Tum-A-Lum. “Our company was founded on the same basic business principles as Tum-A-Lum — building honest, fair and ethical relationships with our customers,” said Marson. “I see our ongoing operations as business as usual.” The 110-year-old Tum-A-Lum has three building supply centers in Oregon — Hood River, The Dalles and Pendleton.   Fruit industry experts talk tech, labor, marketing at annual Hort convention WENATCHEE — Change is the new normal, said fruit expert Jim McFerson. And that’s not likely to change soon. Growers, shippers and marketers at the Washington State Tree Fruit Association’s annual convention gave knowing nods here Dec. 5 to presentations — including McFerson’s keynote speech — highlighting dramatic change in the fruit industry over the last 20 years. Technology, research, orchard practices, labor challenges, marketing and packaging — nearly all industry sectors have evolved to meet shifting consumer tastes and the rise of global markets, said experts at the WSTFA’s 112th Annual Meeting and NW Hort Expo. With a theme of “The New Normal: Continuous Change,” the gathering ran through Dec. 7 at the Wenatchee Convention Center. “Advances in science and the digital revolution have brought widespread innovation to the industry,” said McFerson, director of Washington State University Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center in Wenatchee. “They’ve changed our industry in fundamental ways.” McFerson delivered the association’s 37th Batjer Address — titled “Technology Road Map 2.0” — to a ballroom packed with hundreds of industry insiders. More than 1,600 people were expected to attend the three-day expo. The WSU professor’s wide-ranging presentation emphasized some of the last two decades’ key innovations and provided a taste of lecture topics: Advances in fruit storage, including the post-harvest application of SmartFresh, a solution that slows the ripening of apples and other fruits. The redesign of packing sheds into “beautiful, sparkling food-handling facilities” with stainless steel installation that are easily cleaned and sanitized. The computerization of sorting lines that can now find defects — “magic!” — in fruit and improve pack-outs for size and quality. The research, development and breeding of the popular (but difficult to grow) Honeycrisp variety which, said McFerson, is “a lousy apple for a lot of reasons, and a great apple for a lot of reasons.” Innovations in orchard systems — poles, trellises, wires — that promote high-density crops and ease pruning, thinning and harvesting. Development of new rootstocks resistant to pests and diseases that are tolerant to replanting. New cherry varieties that spread harvests from June through September. McFerson said innovations now underway include crop-load management practices that have introduced post-bloom thinning to standard pruning and thinning techniques; growing use of orchard netting for protection from sun and hail; development of mechanical-assisted harvesters — moving platforms and robotic pickers — to aid orchard workers; and installation of reflective fabric (called DayBright) in orchard rows, which has boosted test yields by 23 percent. “It’s all about meeting and exceeding customers’ expectations,” said McFerson. “To do it, we build on research, we build on science.” Related Articles Editor's Note | 2017 certain to be a fascinating year Eye On | Buddy La Fleur's &#8212; Diners get what they like and expect Keeping successes while discarding those disappointments Eye On | Parker Manufacturing &#8212; Built from the family mold Ridge plan raises concern for elk, habitat Retailers agree to stop employee on-call scheduling Advertisements   SOCIAL Facebook Twitter Pinterest Instagram APPS Apple iOS Google Play SERVICES Subscribe Make a Payment Digital Edition E-mail Newsletters Newspaper in Education Special Publications Commercial Print Advertise With Us CALENDAR NCW Calendar Add an Event CONTACT US Paper Delivery Issue World of Savings Anniversaries Engagements Weddings Vacation Stop Letter to the Editor Staff Directory Contact Us MULTIMEDIA Videos Photos Photo Galleries Webcams CLASSIFIEDS Homes Jobs Business Classifieds PARTNERS The Art of Community NCW Foothills Magazine Lake Chelan This Week NCW Medical Directory Quincy Valley Post-Register The Washington Post National Weekly Wenatchee Mom Blog Wenatchee Valley Business World © The Wenatchee World 2017 Terms of Use Forum Standards Privacy Policy

Margaret Rhodes Design Date of Publication: 01.01.17. 01.01.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am 19 Ingenious Design Books to Inspire You in 2017 The best design books have the power to spark new thoughts, theories, ideas, and opinions. Collected below is a diverse collection of 19 such books, published in the past year. Here you’ll find everything from black-and-white photos of Brutalist buildings, to heady essays on graphic design’s role in society, to pretty doodles. Whatever your interests, you’ll find something here to fascinate and inspire you in 2017. American Revolution Bicentennial Standards Manual In 1974 Bruce Blackburn designed a red-white-and-blue, star-shaped wheel logo. The icon was for the upcoming United States Bicentennial, and the idea was that the symbol would appear across all manner of celebratory materials, from postage stamps to buildings. To ensure his logo looked its best in any situation, Blackburn published a set of visual guidelines. This year, Standards Manuals—the same folks who reprinted the MTA and NASA manuals—revived Blackburn’s original ($45).

Now, it’s experiencing a comeback, thanks in no small part to Peter Chadwick. Two years ago the London art director started tweeting out photos of forgotten Brutalist buildings. Today, he’s the author of This Brutal World ($50), a handsome coffee table book from Phaidon that’s dedicated to the raw, concrete style of architecture. The tome highlights recent work, as well as older buildings that have since been demolished. In that sense, the book doubles as a form of preservation.

Les Diners de Gala Salvador Dalí produced many masterpieces in his life, and one of them was a cookbook. Les Diners de Gala was semi-autobiographical, based on the lavish dinner parties of Dalí and his wife, Gala. This year Taschen reprinted the book ($60), which originally came out in 1973. You might not actually attempt any of the 136 recipes (do you really want “Thousand year old eggs”?), but you’ll certainly feast on the surreal paintings and collages that fill the book.

Dear Data For 52 weeks straight, Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec mailed each other illustrations. The two designers had a pact, to create one hand-drawn data visualization a week. The drawings might represent how many animals one designer saw in a given seven-day period, or every time one designer felt a surge of envy. The colorful, curious postcards now fill the pages of Dear Data ($35), the duo’s coffee table book and permanent record of their project.

Designed by Apple in California Designed by Apple in California ($200 or $300) is every inch the Apple product. It took eight years to develop, is bound in white linen, and printed on “specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges.” Longtime Apple photographer Andrew Zuckerman shot all 450 pages of products in the company’s signature style—high definition hero shots of technology, set on a white background.

No matter your answer, Eating With The Eyes ($50) will challenge you to look more closely. Pentagram designer Harry Pearce filled his book with 200 photographs of scenes that are easily overlooked. Sidewalks, dirty walls, crumpled textiles—this is the banal stuff that surrounds us, all the time, but rarely comes across as poignant. Pearce has an eye for finding abstract beauty in it.

Failed It! ($13) is equal parts platitudes and botched photographs. The platitudes are nothing new—for decades, quotable politicians, scientists, and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have touted the virtues of failure. The pictures in Failed It!, on the other hand, feel novel. Or maybe they won’t: many of them resemble amateur, flubbed 35 millimeter prints, like the outtakes from a roll of family vacation photos. Most people would regard these oddly exposed, finger-over-the-lens shots as trash. Artist Erik Kessels, who authored Failed It!, prizes them. Credit: Phaidon Failed It!

This book is for the especially curious, as it invites readers to peer inside structures as small and specific as a tape cassette and as huge and multi-layered as Earth itself. The book includes inside views of historic buildings, pieces of machinery, and even a few entries that are purely fantastical. They’re beautiful reminders, all, that something always lies beneath the surface. Credit: Gestalten Look Inside ($60) is an ode to the cutaway graphic.

It would be “the scientific equivalent of the Bible,” he said, and would read like a how-to manual for humans to rebuild the world, in the event of a mass catastrophe. The Earth and I ($30), which Lovelock co-authored, is not that book—but there are traces of it present. The book is an information-rich account of how the earth came to be, how it behaves, and how we humans impact it. A prestigious list of scientists, including Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winners, contributed chapters. The art in the book is especially noteworthy: illustrator Jack Hudson created it, and though he favors a cheerful, mid-century style, his work for The Earth and I is scientifically rigorous. Understanding the workings of the planet has never looked better. Credit: Taschen Some years ago, the renowned scientist James Lovelock got the idea for a book.

The United States of America If this year’s presidential election made you feel disconnected from some other part of the country, pick up The United States of America ($300). The compendium of 700 photographs, all from National Geographic’s archives, show slices of life from all 50 states. The book stretches across geography and time; some of the early images date back to the 1920s, and the newest ones were captured with state-of-the-art digital cameras. Think of it like an armchair tour through our collective history.

When he finds a particularly magnificent one, he posts it to his Instagram feed, Daily Overview. It’s impossible to tire of seeing our planet from this angle. Last year, the best snapshots from that feed made it into a lush new coffee table book, Overview: A New Perspective of Earth ($25).

Finished in 1985, the book looks at design intellectually. Rand’s essays in the book cited academics. Prints of his logo work for IBM, ABC, and Westinghouse, along with indie work for magazine and book covers, supported his arguments. The manifesto went out of print in 2000, but this year design critic Steven Heller revived it. Credit: Princeton Architectural Press Famed graphic designer Paul Rand also wrote and published books.

Richard Sapper Edited by Jonathan Olivares Richard Sapper, the brilliant German industrial designer behind iconic designs like the cubic Brionvega radio, passed away on the last day of 2015. Luckily for his admirers, the forces and circumstances that shaped his work are not lost. Sapper had spent more than 40 hours in interviews with furniture designer Jonathan Olivares, who recorded them and put them in print. Those interviews fill the pages of Olivares’s book ($95), along with photographs of Sapper’s designs throughout the years.

The World of Charles and Ray Eames Charles and Ray Eames designed several iconic chairs, but their contributions to design—and, really, to society—go far deeper than furniture. During World War II, the husband-and-wife team pioneered advances in materials. They reimagined the office space entirely. They walked the walk, too, by building their home in the image of their modern ideas about design.

Instead, this year, Draplin pulled back the curtain on his process by releasing Pretty Much Everything ($27). The book contains, you know, pretty much everything that informs his work: artifacts, posters, travelogues, case studies, and more.

Sunday Sketching For years, illustrator Christoph Niemann (whose work you’ll find in publications like New York Times Magazine, the New Yorker, and WIRED) would spend his Sundays engaged in a drawing exercise. He’d sit down with a sheet of paper and a random object, then find ways to incorporate the item into a drawing. In this way, bottles of ink became cameras, highlighters became light sabers, and pennies became scoops of ice cream. You’ll find many of Niemann’s visual puns in his new monograph, Sunday Sketching ($34), interspersed with the illustrator’s compellingly honest musings on the creative process.

Internet companies have stormed onto D.C.’s lobbying scene, opening up in-house shops and hiring established lobbyists to gain influence. Google, Amazon and Facebook increased their spending on Washington lobbyists over the last eight years and are closing the gap overall with the telecommunications industry, an older power in the capital. ADVERTISEMENT Comcast, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and Cellular Telecom and Internet Association, the top three telecom spenders, spent $3 million more in the first three quarters of 2016 than Google, Amazon and Facebook. In 2008, the top three internet lobbying spenders spent over $26 million less than the the top three telecom equivalents. Though fourth quarter spending hasn’t been released yet, it’s not likely that gap will close. This has given the companies a bigger seat at the table, and more influence behind the scenes. “The reality is that if you’re not explaining yourself to policy makers, you’re not going to have the policies in place that allow innovation to flourish,” said the Internet Association’s Noah Theran. His organization represents Google, Twitter and Amazon. Telecom and cable corporations who had previously held the alpha role in lobbying have taken notice. “There’s definitely tension between Silicon Valley and the old power structures,” said a communications industry insider. “I think there’s a feeling — a legitimate feeling that this administration and the FCC bend over backwards for Google in particular.” The tension wasn’t always present. Silicon Valley at one point had famously dismissed Washington, D.C., assessing that it could be the new capital of change in the U.S. That attitude shifted as the tech industry saw a greater need to work with Washington. A touchstone was the Justice Department antitrust suit against Microsoft. After having to appeal an initial order to break into two separate business, Microsoft quickly learned that it needed to have a Washington, D.C. presence if it wanted to preemptively ease regulatory problems later on. “Any new industry goes through the growing pains of how and when and why to engage with policy makers and the rapid growth of the internet industry is no different,” said Theran. Trump’s presidency may change how the battles play out for the next four to eight years, however. Trump has had a rockier relationship with some tech companies, including Apple. He at one point during the campaign suggested a boycott of the company’s products over its encrypted phone. The president-elect expressed frustration that Apple did not want to create a backdoor that would allow the FBI to access one of the attacker’s phones. The dispute became rallying point on encryption for tech companies — Apple rivals, Microsoft and Google voiced support for the Cupertino, Calif. based company’s decision to not aid the FBI. Despite this fault-line, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Larry Page and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella were at the president-elect’s meeting with other major tech leaders in mid-December. In the meeting Trump extended an olive branch to some of the companies he had previously battled with. "There's nobody like you in the world," Trump toold the tech executives in the meeting. "There's nobody like the people in this room. And anything we can do to help this go along, and we're going to be there for you."  Several of Trump's children, along with his son in law, Jared Kushner, were in the meeting, which included tech leaders like Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.  Obama’s relationship with tech and internet companies has been more consistent. The president was in step on many issues with tech companies, including net neutrality, cable set top boxes and broadband privacy. His stances on these measures have irked telecom interests. “Everybody is amazed by Google’s sort of cozy relationship with the White House,” said one communications industry insider who asked to remain anonymous. “They don’t even try to hide it.” Telecom companies who previously only battled consumer and advocacy groups at the FCC, now have to face internet companies with White House influence, pushing their agenda as well. They also see a greater White House influence over the Federal Communication Commission. “The influence over the White House over the FCC is greater now than it used to be,” said one longtime industry insider. Because the FCC can pass regulations easier than Congress can move legislation, it’s an attractive spot for companies to achieve their goals. That’s made the FCC the battleground for fights over net neutrality, broadband privacy rules and set top box regulations. During the Obama years, those fights generally kept internet companies happy and telecom, cable and broadband companies less than pleased. Even though Silicon Valley’s relationship with Trump has been thawing, the president-elect’s transition appointments suggest that internet companies won’t have the same benefits they did in the Obama years. That means  telecom, broadband and cable companies may be on the upswing. Trump appointed a trio of experts from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) to his FCC landing team: Roslyn Layton, Jeffrey Eisenach and Mark Jamison. All of them have railed against FCC proposals backed by FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler. Republicans will also have a majority on the FCC and Commissioner Ajit Pai, who many expect to take over as chairman when Wheeler steps down in January, has opposed the Obama-era measures as well. Tech’s old guard is ready to take advantage of what could be a more favorable political climate. AT&T and Verizon, the two major wireless carriers in the United States, spent roughly $16 million and $11 million on federal lobbying last year, respectively. Comcast spent more than $15.5 million in Washington in 2015.  Tags Google, Amazon, Comcast, Microsoft, Apple, AT&T, Donald Trump   Please enable JavaScript to view the featured perspectives by Versa.

No, not the resolutions to be made and opportunities to be sought — we’re talking about the latest crop of gadgets set to hit shelves, from mobile phones to cameras to computers. Why are we so excited? Because there are follow-ups, new mobiles, refreshed phones and more - and they could well be some of the best we’ve ever seen. Here are some of the pocket-fillers that are getting our pulses racing for the next 12 months. SAMSUNG GALAXY S8. We liked the Galaxy S7. A lot. But then, the whole Note 7 drama happened and everyone forgot just what a whopping great handset Samsung had made in the S7. The South Korean manufacturer will be hoping to dispel any misgivings with the S8, which makes the situation pretty enthralling. Throw in early indications that the next-gen Galaxy could be a truly futuristic phone, and you’ve got us hooked. Bezel-free, 4K-equipped and only curved? That ought to do the trick - not to mention a dual-lens camera setup, better VR and a faster chip. As if specs-guessing wasn’t enough to keep us interested, there’s plenty of conjecture that Samsung will wave goodbye to the headphone jack on the S8, too. When will we know for sure? Given the past few Galaxy launches, the likeliest date is late February. APPLE IPHONE 8. With a new Apple smartphone released every year, it stands to reason that we’ll see one in 2017. But why are we excited about it? Well, if rumours on the great gadget grapevine are to be believed, it could be a big one — not least, because it marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. So, there’s every reason to anticipate the iPhone 8’s release — especially if you like all-glass, AMOLED-toting smartphones with wireless charging and no bezels. Because that’s exactly what the early evidence is pointing towards. Oh, and it might ditch the home button, too. Then again, some say it might be the iPhone 7s, which only serves to add a healthy dollop of intrigue to proceedings. NINTENDO SWITCH. Who doesn’t a game or two? But while we previously had to settle either for a porta unit or a stay-at-home console, Nintendo is offering one that will do double duty. y console that’ll do double duty as both living room games machine and go-anywhere gaming tablet? Called the Nintendo Switch, it’s expected to be to due in March (if all goes to plan), and games will play in either mode while its modular controller has options to suit almost every gaming preference. It’ll run on Nvidia hardware, too, although the exact specs are still a mystery. As for the screen, estimates suggest it’ll measure up at around 6.5-inches and there’s a good chance it’ll be touch-enabled. As for gaming titles, there ought to be plenty, including the usual favourites, alongside rumoured support for older content, such as GameCube titles. NIKON D760. Camera-wise, several big names have had some impact in the last couple of years, but Nikon has set tongues wagging with the successor to its successful full-frame shooter, the D750. If leaked specs are to be believed, the Nikon D760 will retain the same 24.3MP, full-frame CMOS sensor, but the processor is said to be upgraded to the rapid Expeed 5. Frame rates should also increase, shutter speeds should be faster than ever — rumours point towards a maximum of 1/8000s — and the ISO should jump higher too. With such a solid foundation to work from, we’d be seriously surprised if the D760 doesn’t turn out to be a stellar snapper. The only problem? We’re almost as excited about its cheaper cousin, the D620, set to be released in the first half of 2017. PANASONIC 4K OLED TV. Panasonic’s 2017 OLED panel looks set to be a 4K whopper of a TV. It’s expected to ship in two sizes (55-innch and 65-inch), but still be seriously slim, with Panasonic’s UHD Premium form suggesting image quality should be astounding. While the manufacturer has kept pretty quiet about concrete specs, they did say that the next-gen screen will have better blacks than ever and will be an improvement over the previous CZ950 model. (That’s no small feat: The CZ950 has arresting picture quality and an equally arresting design.) IMAC 2017. If you’re a fan of Apple’s desktop computers, you’re in for a treat. The Apple may be shy on details for the new 2017 iMac, but the easy assumptions are that it will be more-than-5K-equipped and VR-ready, even if Apple presently lacks its own VR hardware. It will likely get a chip upgrade, too, and there could be some form of Touch Bar integration (if the MacBook Pro is anything to go by). As for the physical side, USB-C seems a sure addition, as does a storage boost and, possibly, a further slimming-down of the shell. GOOGLE PIXEL WATCH. There was the Google Pixel and Google Android Wear. Neither quite nailed it, but both showed promise — and suggested that Apple and Samsung might finally be in for some competition. Now, rumours say we could soon see a combination of the two: An Android Wear watch taking its cues from the Pixel. And we could see it in the first four months of 2017. Plenty of sources suggest there will be two models of Google’s wearable item (codenamed Swordfish and Angelfish), both of which are likely to carry circular screens. MICROSOFT SURFACE PHONE. Rumours of a Surface Phone have been kicking around since 2012, but 2017 might finally be the year we finally get one. Surface machinery hasn’t always hit the mark, but it has generally offered solid hardware that delivers the best Windows experience around. What will be in store? Widespread speculation suggests it’ll run the full Windows 10 desktop experience, thanks to a collaboration with Qualcomm to deliver speedy Snapdragon chips. Unfortunately, we don’t know much beyond that. Some industry insiders suggest there will be three models, differentiated by storage capacity and amount of RAM — we’ll only know when it is released, which should be in the first half of next year.   A version of this story first appeared on Stuff Singapore (http://www.stuff.tv/sg/features/most-anticipated-gadgets-2017). mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Lifestyle READ COMMENTED “I love having camera phones” “Forgive my honesty, but is there a local fashion or modelling scene in Singapore today?” ’Twas the night before Christmas ‘X’ marks the sport ‘White makes you a winner’: Thai skin whitening ad provokes race storm Your new vacation photographer: A drone Ways to cut that bump and reduce bloating Travel deals and steals: Dec 29 to Jan 5, 2017 Three easy ways to motivate your child in their music lessons The most defining beauty moments of 2016 The most anticipated gadgets of 2017 The dark (and often dubious) art of forecasting food trends The best time to retune your career?

Tourism Pahang general manager Datuk Ishak Mokhtar said the application developed by a private company could be downloaded for free from the App Store for Apple phones or Google Play for Android users.    “The application does not only show tourist destinations but also the various activities taking place there, popular food spots and locations of accommodation for the 15 million tourists expected to visit the state this year,” he said.   Ishak disclosed this to Bernama after the launching of the Visit Pahang Year at the Bentong toll plaza today by Transport Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai. He added that users could start downloading the application even though it would only be officially launched on Jan 11 at Jaman Tory Restaurant in Kuantan, which is famous for its smoked meat (dagang salai).                 Commenting on VPY2017, Ishak said the state government had set Jan 20 as the date to declare the start of tourism event at the Urban Transformation Centre (UTC) in Kuantan.      “The ceremony is scheduled to be officiated by Acting Pahang Sultan Tengku Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah and various cultural activities identifying Pahang would be displayed on the occasion,” he said.    Meanwhile, Liow said all Pahang residents should play their roles to ensure VPY2017 achieved the desired objectives, apart from ensuring all state government plans and programmes were successfully carried out.  Liow who is also Bentong MP said all parties needed to give their cooperation to the 3K agenda to attract tourists, namely cleanliness, courtesy and security.           “The Pahang government had promoted VPY2017 with China Post in November when 60 visitors from China were brought to Bentong as mini ambassadors to promote Pahang,” he said.  On the sales of the special vehicle registration series ‘VIP’ to mark Visit Pahang Year, Liow said the federal government had given its approval to the state government in support of the state tourism festival. “This is a gesture of the federal government, as we understand the state government has limited financial resources to promote VPY2017 programmes,” he said.  — Bernama                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Taking a break from war on the mountain slopes of Iraq (VIDEO) Low-cost carriers boost global air traffic in 2016 Gay Travel Awards names Las Vegas ‘Destination of the Year’ Dubai to build Middle East and North Africa’s largest marina US Customs computer collapse leaves thousands of travellers waiting New, younger travellers to book cruise vacations in 2017 So long, 2016!

The family claims that Apple had the patent for a safer version of its "FaceTime" video calling app, but chose to make the less safe version available with the iPhone 6 -- ultimately leading to a car crash that resulted in the death of their five-year-old daughter Moriah Modisette, Courthouse News reported this week. The case dates back to 2014 when Moriah was travelling in the back of her parents' car near Dallas and was hit by another car driven by Garrett Willhelm who was using the Apple "FaceTime" while driving. The erring driver had confessed to the police that he was on "FaceTime" and police had also found that the app was still live when they arrived at the scene. Given the fact that the app fully engages visual components, the Modisette family blamed Apple for its failure to either programme a shutoff into the "FaceTime" or give strong warning about using the app while driving. "Defendant Apple Inc. has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisettes' injuries, specifically since at least December 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the US Patent Office for a 'driver handheld computing device lock-out," the family said in the complaint. The failure of Apple to use GPS tracking to detect the speed of the vehicle in which a user was travelling and shut down the "FaceTime" app was a significant factor in the accident, the family added. The grieving family has sought economic damages along with punitive damages. Want stories like this in your inbox? Sign up for the weekly ET Panache newsletter.

Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft all have phones coming out that appear to be groundbreaking. Let’s take a look at what we have in store for smartphones in 2017. iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus Apple’s upgrade from the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is said to be dramatic. [Image by Daryl Deino] The iPhone 7 series wasn’t a big upgrade from the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but the iPhone 8 series upgrade is going to be huge. According to 9to5Mac, we may see 4.7-inch to 5.8-inch curved OLED displays, an all-glass design with new colors, wireless charging, an embedded (into the screen) home button, and something that has to do with augmented reality. BGR describes how Apple may incorporate augmented reality with their next smartphone in 2017. “The way Apple envisions implementing augmented reality into the iPhone is multi-faceted. For instance, Apple envisions iPhone users being able to point their cameras at any number of objects and have the device itself recognize what’s in frame.” The article adds that as another example, Apple could build functionality that would allow the iPhone camera to completely manipulate faces. This has caused a lot of excitement in the smartphone world. Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung is looking for a comeback after the Note 7 (literally) blew up in their faces. [Image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images] The Galaxy Note 7 recall was the most damaging debacle in smartphone history, so Samsung needs to earn back some of its good will in 2017. According to Tech Radar, the Galaxy S8 is shaping up to be a huge upgrade from the S7 and S7 Edge. “Likely highlights include a 4K screen, a Snapdragon 830 processor, 6GB of RAM and a massively improved camera. There’s even a chance that the Samsung Galaxy S8 will have an iris scanner or a foldable screen, though the latter is somewhat less likely.” The article adds that there could be two different versions of the S8, and both will come with curved screens. One could be a 5.7-inch regular version, and the other, the one that would have the 4K screen, will be 6.1 inches. The S8 could also have a 30MP dual-lens rear camera, an 8MP front camera, and a 4200mAh battery. Despite the Galaxy Note 7 mess, there is still a lot of excitement for the Galaxy S8 on Twitter. Can't wait for next year's release of the Samsung Galaxy S8? Here's a roundup of what insiders have hinted so far! https://t.co/pLF4GY8sdi — MobileOneLLC (@MobileOneLLC) December 12, 2016 All of these Samsung Galaxy S8 rumors are getting me more and more excited for it's launch!! https://t.co/Hq5r1Jycpo — Stephanie Carls (@stephelisecarls) December 21, 2016 Samsung Galaxy S devices usually come out in March, but there have been some rumors that the S8 smartphone will come out in April of 2017. Perhaps Samsung wants to do some major quality control so they don’t run into the same mess they did with the Galaxy Note 7. Microsoft Surface Phone This could be the most unique smartphone in 2017. The smartphone, which will likely run a full desktop version of Windows 10, will be aimed mostly at business users. According to the Express, Microsoft’s new smartphone could come with a stylus as well. However, the same source says the smartphone may actually not look all that unique since it will take design cues from Apple and Samsung. (Hopefully, there will be no lawsuits.) As Trusted Reviews notes, Microsoft is under a lot of pressure to deliver. They have teamed up with Qualcomm to build the device, which may include a high-powered Snapdragon processor. However, putting a full Windows operating system on a very small device certainly didn’t work out 10 years ago with the Ultra Mobile PC series. Perhaps Microsoft has found a way to put their own smartphone operating system on top of Windows 10. They would also have to find a way to provide several hours of battery life. Judging by all the rumors, which smartphone are you most excited by — the Surface Phone, the Galaxy S8, or the iPhone 8? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.

The New York Police Department’s special operations division posted a photo of the unusual tourist on its Twitter account Saturday. The whale was seen swimming along the shores of Manhattan’s upper East Side, close to Gracie Mansion, where the mayor lives. U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Frank Iannazzo-Simmons says officials from his office haven’t seen the whale. But he says based on the photos it appears to be a humpback whale. One such humpback whale was also spotted in the East River last month. Texas family blame Apple’s FaceTime in suit over fatal crash SAN JOSE, Calif. A Texas couple whose 5-year-old daughter died in a crash involving a driver who was purportedly using Apple’s FaceTime video chatting app is suing the tech company. The lawsuit filed in December in Santa Clara Superior Court accuses Apple of not implementing iPhone features that would automatically disable FaceTime based on technology that calculates highway speeds. Apple hasn’t responded to the lawsuit and didn’t immediately respond to an email Saturday seeking a comment. Moriah Modisette was killed in a 2014 Christmas Eve accident near Dallas. The lawsuit obtained by California television KTLA claims police found FaceTime running on the iPhone of the driver who struck the Modisette family at 65 mph. The family claims Apple knew the risks of using FaceTime while driving because the company patented “lock-out” technology in 2008. Efforts to end conflicts in Syria backed by UN BEIRUT The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution Saturday supporting efforts by Russia and Turkey to end the nearly six-year conflict in Syria and jump-start peace negotiations, as a fragile countrywide cease-fire wavered. The resolution also calls for the “rapid, safe and unhindered” delivery of humanitarian aid throughout Syria. And it anticipates a meeting of the Syrian government and opposition representative in Kazakhstan’s capital Astana in late January. The resolution’s final text dropped an endorsement of the Syria cease-fire agreement reached Thursday, simply taking note of it but welcoming and supporting Russian-Turkish efforts to end the violence. Istanbul governor: At least 35 dead in attack on nightclub ISTANBUL An assailant believed to have been dressed in a Santa Claus costume opened fire at a nightclub in Istanbul during New Year’s celebrations Saturday, killing at least 35 people and wounding 40 others in what the city’s governor described as a terror attack. Gov. Vasip Sahin said the attacker, armed with a long-barreled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the club before entering and firing on people partying inside. He did not say who may have carried out what he called a “terror attack.” Media reports said the assailant entered the popular Reina nightclub, in Istanbul’s Ortakoy district, dressed in a Santa Claus costume. There were more than 500 people inside the club at the time, private NTV television reported.

The year 2016 is almost over, and it has been a busy one for gadgets. There were a lot of clunkers in 2016, with the exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7 being the biggest one. Samsung also had the Gear 360 camera, a gadget that turned a lot of people off from 360 degree photography and videos. But there were also some outstanding gadgets in 2016. Let’s take a look: HTC Vive The HTC Vive virtual reality headset is the most impressive gadget of 2016. It was the Oculus Rift that was supposed to garner all of the attention, but HTC surprised a lot of people. The Vive looks like a clunky headset, but is pretty comfortable to use. What differentiates the Vive from other virtual reality headsets released in 2016 is that it comes with two position tracking stations that allow you to have room scale VR. In other words, when you walk around in your room, you are walking around in the VR world as well. The Vive shows transparent blue borders to help you avoid running into the couch or television set. You could meet friends in Altspace VR and talk or even watch movies together. You can transport yourself to Washington’s Vesper Peak and play with your own virtual dog with The Lab. But the HTC Vive may be the most useful for sports. Selfie Tennis allow you to play tennis with yourself in a ridiculous court that has tennis balls dancing like strippers. It really feels like you are playing tennis, and you get a lot of exercise as well. Then, there is HoloBall, a futuristic racquetball game that can substitute for your aerobics workout. Warning — it gets addictive! Apple Watch Series 2 The Apple Watch Series 2 was the ultimate smartwatch in 2016. [Image by Daryl Deino] The Apple Watch was originally released in 2015, and this gadget didn’t become the mainstream hit many expected it to be. However, its users loved it. The Apple Watch 2, however, turned a flawed, but great gadget into just a great gadget. Trusted Reviews gives Apple’s 2016 Watch four stars. “The Apple Watch 2 might not look any different, but the refinements that Apple has made are all spot on. If you want a smartwatch that doubles as a solid fitness tracker then this is a fantastic option.” The 2016 Watch’s Siri recognition is incredible. You can respond to emails or instant messages with your voice and not have to worry (at least 99 percent of the time) about making corrections. Its integration with Google Maps is spot on. If you say, “Drive to closest Best Buy,” your gadget will soon guide you and tap you whenever you need to make a turn. The only thing missing on the Apple Watch Series 2 is cellular capabilities, which Apple left off allegedly because it would eat up a lot of battery life and almost make the Watch useless. However, you can bet that Apple is currently figuring out how to make their next Watch a 4G LTE gadget as well. Apple AirPods Apple surprised everyone with the high-class AirPods in 2016. [Image by Daryl Deino] When the AirPods were first announced in September of 2016, many people yawned. After all, how could a set of wireless earbuds not only stay in your ears, but offer decent sound? When Apple delayed the AirPods, people didn’t yawn anymore; they just laughed. However, when Apple made the AirPods officially available for Christmas, 2016, the gadget was heralded as a “return to form” for Apple. Rolling Stone describes the AirPods as “pretty f***ing cool,” while Forbes describes them as pure magic. This author wrote a review for the Inquisitr, claiming that Apple had finally released a gadget in 2016 that wasn’t overpriced (even if the $159 seems expensive). The AirPods are still hard to find, but once you use them, you won’t want to take them out of your ears — ever.

Phones dominate our list of the six most significant gadgets we expect to see this year. Apple iPhone 8 To mark the iPhone’s 10th anniversary this year, Apple is expected to overhaul the phone’s design. One model could swap its liquid-crystal LCD display for one made of OLEDs (organic light-emitting diodes) that will wrap around the gadget’s edges. OLED displays are thinner, lighter, and more flexible than LCDs. Samsung’s Galaxy Edge phones sport a similar design and have been called gimmicky; Apple appears to be trying to make the feature more useful by enabling the phone to react when you touch any of its sides instead of just one.  Samsung Galaxy S8 As Samsung’s flagship gadget, the Galaxy S could rehabilitate the company’s reputation, which was tarnished by its botched Galaxy Note 7 recall—but only if the phone delights consumers and doesn’t spontaneously burst into flames. The upcoming Galaxy S8 is expected to be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress trade show in late February. The company has already revealed that the phone will feature a new virtual personal assistant based on technology from the startup Viv, which it acquired in October. The S8 is also rumored to pack an extremely high-resolution “4K” display, a second rear camera, and possibly an iris scanner for an added layer of security. Foldable Samsung phone This may also be the year that Samsung releases a foldable smartphone, a design it has been developing for years. As this 2013 Samsung concept video shows, such a device would let you read and view content on a tablet-sized screen that could convert to a smartphone-like size for convenient transport. Other companies, including Lenovo, the Chinese phone maker Oppo, and the Japanese display maker JDI have also created dual-screen and foldable smartphones, but none have been released commercially. Samsung hopes to beat them to market. Microsoft Surface phone CEO Satya Nadella has said Microsoft is working on the “ultimate mobile device.” What might that be? Its Surface series of laptops, PCs, and tablets is missing a phone, but one is expected to launch in 2017. You can expect it to have a metal body to match Microsoft’s other Surface devices and run the Windows 10 operating system through an emulator when connected to an external keyboard, monitor, and mouse. HTC Vive 2 VR headset What gadgets are you looking forward to buying in 2017? Tell us in the comments. A year ago, HTC’s pivot from making smartphones to focusing on virtual-reality technology seemed risky, but its Vive VR system has gained a solid following since its April 2016 release. For its follow-up device, HTC is expected to cut the cable that currently tethers the headset to its user’s PC. Startups have created accessories that let the headset be used wirelessly, and HTC is expected to offer a more integrated solution in the Vive 2. Android Wear 2.0 smart watches Last year wasn’t a banner year for smart watches. But 2017 will bring new watches based on Android Wear 2.0, an updated version of Google’s Android operating system. Because it will let users download and run apps on their watches via Bluetooth, cellular connection, or Wi-Fi, without relying on tethered connections from their smartphones, iPhone owners could use Android Wear devices. Android Wear 2.0 is in the “developer preview” phase and will be publicly released in early to mid-2017.

The news comes after Yahoo-owned research firm Flurry earlier this week revealed that the holiday season was a big hit for Apple’s iPhone and between December 19 to 25, Apple’s iPhone and iPad accounted for 44 per cent of all mobile activations — much higher than Samsung. “This is not the first time Apple has cut back on iPhone production as a similar event occurred this year in the January – March quarter. That cut on production was around 30 per cent,” 9to5mac.com reported. Last year, Apple’s devices accounted for 49.1 per cent of all activations during the same period while Samsung last year accounted for 19.8 per cent of all activations. Apple is also reportedly planning to manufacture iPhones in Bengaluru in association with Wistron, a Taiwanese OEM manufacturer for Apple and will start production by April 2017. The Wall Street Journal says: “Apple plans bigger design changes for 2017, the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone. — IANS About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Foxconn to invest $8 bn in China LCD plant Registration opens for Bank Muscat al Wathbah Businesswomen’s award → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Govt units to submit revised payrolls Ministry mulls private investment in public schools Municipal Council heads in Governorates take oath Municipal Council Chief takes oath Read More ...

Advertisement In early September, Apple confirmed its highly anticipated iOS 10 release date. And on September 13th, the company rolled out the iOS 10 update for select iPhone, iPad and iPod touch models around the world. iOS 10 is a solid replacement for iOS 9 but it far from perfect. iOS 10 problems have been plaguing iPhone and iPad owners in the months since release and many users are calling for a new iOS 10 update to address these lingering problems. Fortunately, help is on the way in the form of a massive iOS 10.2 update for iPhone, iPad and the iPod touch. Apple’s confirmed an iOS 10.2 release and today we want to go over the most important things to know, right now, about the second major update to the iOS 10 operating system. This roundup takes a look at what we know for sure about the iOS 10.2 update. It also outlines a few things you can expect from the upcoming iOS 10.2 release for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch including the iOS 10.2 release time in the United States and countries around the world. Advertisement We’ll continue to add new information to this roundup so check back for regular updates. iOS 10.2 Beta If you want to try the iOS 10.2 update on your device right now, you can. Apple’s pushed an iOS 10.2 beta to developers and the general public. Anyone with an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch can download the iOS 10.2 beta, for free, via Apple’s Beta Software Program. The iOS 10.2 beta is pretty big and there are some very good reasons to think about trying it out on your iPhone, iPad or iPad touch ahead of the official release date. Advertisement You can test the iOS 10.2 update’s new features and you can also test its performance on your phone or tablet which might be a good idea if you’re using an older device like the iPhone 5 or iPad mini 2. Before you install the iOS 10.2 beta, make sure you prepare your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. A little prep work will go a long way toward preventing iOS 10.2 beta problems. And yes, there are a number of issues with the current version of the beta. We’ve noticed lag, issues with connectivity, random reboots, occasional abnormal battery drain, and issues with various apps. If you download the beta, there’s a good chance you’ll encounter an issue or two. To help you prepare, we’ve put together a guide that will take you through the beta installation process. If this is your first time installing a beta on your iPhone or iPad, make sure you take a look at those before you go through with the process. They could save you some time. If you do decide to give the iOS 10.2 beta a go, make sure you report issues as you see them. This will help Apple improve the final product. You might also want to look at our list of reasons to, and not to, install the iOS 10.2 beta on your iPhone or iPad. iOS 10.2 beta and its list of features make it tempting but there are definitely some reasons to avoid the beta. You Can Downgrade from iOS 10.2 Beta If you’re currently on the iOS 10.1 update or the iOS 10.1.1 update you can try the iOS 10.2 beta and drop back down if you decide you don’t want/like the beta. As of right now, you can download the iOS 10.2 beta and drop back down to iOS 10.1 or iOS 10.1.1. Unfortunately, you can’t downgrade to anything older than those two updates. The downgrade process is pretty straightforward. For a detailed list of instructions, take a look at our iOS downgrade guide. iOS 10.2 Release Date Earlier this year, Apple confirmed a new iOS 10 update for December. The update, it said, would deliver the company’s new Apple TV app to iOS users. Apple’s iOS 10.2 beta 2 delivered the new Apple TV app to beta testers so it looks like Apple will release iOS 10.2 sometime later this month. This isn’t confirmed but it appears likely at this point.  The only time Apple confirms specific iOS release dates is when it confirms them on stage during media events. And with no other media events rumored or likely for 2016, we probably won’t get an official iOS 10.2 release date ahead of time. That said, Apple’s left us a potential clue. The company hasn’t confirmed anything but it says it plans to address iPhone 6s random shutdown issues in an upcoming iOS update. That update will apparently arrive next week. From a support document on the company’s website: Outside the affected batch, a small number of customers reported an unexpected shutdown. Some of these shutdowns may be normal, because the iPhone will shut down to protect its electronic components. To gather more information, we will add an additional diagnostic feature to the iOS software update that is released next week. This feature collects a variety of information in the coming weeks that may help us improve algorithms for managing battery performance and shutdown operations. If such improvements can be achieved, we will deliver them through further software updates. The support document was posted on December 6th which means an update should arrive during the week of December 12th, maybe on December 12th itself. (Apple’s gotten into the habit of releasing new iOS software on Monday’s.) Next week or not, the iOS 10.2 release is close. iOS 10.2 Release Time The exact iOS 10.2 release date is difficult to predict but the iOS 10.2 release time isn’t. If Apple sticks to its usual release protocol, and there’s no reason to believe that it won’t, iOS 10.2 will arrive around 10AM Pacific on release day. The same can be said for all of the upcoming iOS 10.2 beta releases. Here’s what that looks like for regions in the United States and countries around the world including Australia and Japan: Eastern – 1 PM Central – 12 PM Mountain – 11AM London – 6 PM Moscow – 9 PM New Dehli – 10:30 PM Shanghai – 1 AM Tokyo – 2 AM Melbourne – 3 AM Auckland – 5 AM Apple probably won’t confirm the release time ahead of release so you’ll want to keep an eye on your device(s) around this time Monday-Friday. iOS 10.2 Update The iOS 10.2 update appears to be a pretty sizable upgrade for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch and we could see even more added to it as Apple tweaks the beta ahead of its official release date. The crown jewel of the iOS 10.2 upgrade, for most people, will be the new emojis. Unicode 9 emoji are included in iOS 10.2 beta. Notable additions include an avocado, shark, croissant, a shark, a carrot, a squid, bacon, a kiwi, and an owl. iOS 10.2 beta includes new emojis. There are also new wallpapers, a setting that allows you to preserve your last known camera settings called “Preserve Settings”, performance improvements, a new Celebration messages effect, new wallpapers for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and some smaller tweaks. It also, as we’ve noted, brings the new Apple TV app. The iOS 10.2 beta also brings a new TV settings section in Settings and a new SOS mode. The SOS mode is only available for users in India in iOS 10.2 beta 3. It was available to a much wider range of users in iOS 10.2 beta 2. Here’s a list of features that arrived with iOS 10.2 beta 1, here’s a list for the more recent iOS 10.2 beta 2 release, and here’s a list of changes on board the iOS 10.2 beta 3. The iOS 10.2 beta 4, 5, 6, and 7 updates are much smaller and didn’t bring any significant changes to the iOS 10.2 update. iOS 10.2 Jailbreak Don’t expect an iOS 10.2 jailbreak on the iOS 10.2 release date. Developers are reportedly working on an iOS 10 jailbreak but well-known security expert Luca Todesco is warning jailbreak users to avoid the iOS 10.2 update when it’s released. Those looking to jailbreak iOS 10 should remain on iOS 10.1.1 because there’s a higher likelihood we’ll see a jailbreak for that version of iOS 10. For more on the iOS 10 jailbreak, take a look at our roundup. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.2 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.2 If You Want Better Security 1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.2 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.2 update brings 12 known patches for potential exploits including one where an "attacker with an unlocked device may be able to disable Find My iPhone."  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.1.1 update and/or the iOS 10.1 update, know that iOS 10.2 brings their security patches with it. If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.2 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered earlier this year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.2 is probably worth a download right now. 1 / 10 22 Responses 09/22/2016 Franklin Marder Reply Why do you waste so much space discussing a release date that has not been announced. It’s as if you are using a template and leave in all of the extraneous stuff. To be useful your posts need to get to the point. 10/02/2016 Scott Reply Thanks for wasting my time reading this. 10/31/2016 juansamaniegor Reply love the new #iOS10 #iMessage but the only thing missing is have profile picture. 10/07/2016 Nick Reply Brevity is unfortunately not your strong point. 10/12/2016 Shitt Reply Bullshitting 10/16/2016 Clyde Reply This article is so badly written, I wouldn’t allow him/her to write a postcard after reading it! 10/16/2016 Franklin Marder Reply My issue is not the quality of the writing but the utterly misleading headline. It is in Beta and there is no known release date. I m a developer and I would know. This is also the second publication of essentially the same article and it just regurgitates Apple’s developer documentation. Publishing anything about a Beta release as if it is final information is misleading and shouldn’t be allowed by any responsible news site. 11/01/2016 liviaemily_6 Reply Guess Apple came 2nd this time since android had it first with the release of nougat… 11/19/2016 moo Reply there was always a squid emoji… 11/25/2016 David OBrien Reply What’s really getting on my nerves with the latest 10.2 beta is that when I go to write a text message… and choose a contact, if I come across one I’ve previously deleted, when I press the “I” and try to remove from recents, NOTHING HAPPENS! And it’s driving me mad! I’ve not seen anyone else reporting this, am I alone? 11/28/2016 Sick Of Adam Mills Reply These articles your write about “X You Should Know About OS Y.Z” have been trash from the beginning, when you first started doing them. Please make it stop! They are awful. It is painfully obvious you know nothing about software, or software development. Please pick any other topic you can think of to write about, excluding software. 11/30/2016 Theo Reply Wish Apple would go back to iOS 9.3.5. I detest so many things about iOS 10. Previously I could swipe to get rid of the lock screen. Now, I/we have to press the Home button. I have an iPad 4 with a non-operational home button. Now I have to spend money on a repair? The whole idea of a touch-screen is to get away from mechanical switches! Another thing: when I get a notification from Gmail of a new email, there is this broad banner that takes up unnecessary real estate on the screen. Then, when I open the email, the keyboard comes up and blocks half the screen. Mostly, I just want to read the email, not reply to it. Previously, a particular app allowed adjustment of font sizes. This feature disappeared with the “up”grade. A “pox on you”, Apple, for killing my enjoyment of my iOS devices! 12/04/2016 Don S Reply I have version 10.0.2 on my iPhone 6s. Am I way behind the times and in danger from security issues? 12/06/2016 Christi Reply iOS being the second biggest mobile platform in terms of volume and first in terms of developers remuneration. iOS apps development are a part of improving business, setting signature presence and building a great brand. Thanks for sharing 12/13/2016 Robert Kazi Reply On this new iOS 10.2 it is impossible to watch my old “home videos” wich I use to sync through iTunes. No way to see those videos on the new “TV” App 12/13/2016 Franklin Marder Reply You may want to look at the iOS version of the VLC app as it is a bit of a can opener for multi-media files. You may have to sync the files via iCloud Drive or Dropbox. 12/16/2016 Nota Reply I can’t find my country for the new security feature after installing ios 10.2 Curaçao, Dutch Caribbean Area code +5999 HELP 12/16/2016 Nora Reply When are you going to fix issue for iMessages’ names disappearing/ not appearing/ or saying ‘maybe’ this person??? 12/22/2016 homemade electronics toys Reply Thiѕ paragraph іѕ trսly a pleasant one it assists new internet visitors, աho are wishing for blogging. 12/31/2016 The Shepherd’s Diet Reply As I website owner I believe the content here is really great, thanks for your efforts. 01/01/2017 enjoy video games Reply Sοme genuinely inteгesting info, weⅼl ѡritten аnd ցenerally ᥙser genial. 01/02/2017 toys electronics gadgets trade Reply Ι read thіs paragraph ϲompletely on the topic of the comparison οf hottest аnd preceding technologies, іt’s remarkable article.

Advertisement In September, Apple released its iOS 10 operating system for select iPhone, iPad and iPod touch models around the world. Since then, the company’s pushed several updates to iOS 10 users. These updates have delivered new features and bug fixes for lingering iOS 10 problems. And while many iOS 10 issues have been eradicated, many remain. iOS 10.2 users are complaining about various issues including abnormal battery drain. Battery drain is a common iOS problem and it pops up every time Apple releases an update for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. iOS updates aren’t supposed to have a negative effect on your device’s battery life so we’re not surprised to see some iPhone and iPad users expressing frustration with Apple’s latest operating system. Advertisement How to Fix Bad iOS 10 Battery Life If your iOS 10 battery life fails to settle down after a couple of days with the new update on board, you have a problem. Fortunately, there are more than a few potential remedies for iOS 10 battery life issues out there. This guide will show you how to potentially fix bad iOS 10 battery life on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Battery drain issues can be tricky but these fixes have worked well for us, and others, in the past. Keep them in mind as we push away from the iOS 10 release date. Battery life issues can popup at any time. Check Your Apps Before you blame iOS 10 for your battery troubles, note that there’s a very good chance it’s something else causing the battery drain on your iPhone or iPad. Advertisement If your battery life starts acting up with iOS 10 on board, the first place to look is at your collection of applications. There’s a very good chance an app, or apps, is hogging your device’s resources and causing the problem. The first place you’ll want to look is your Settings. Go into Settings > Battery and get familiar with the Battery Usage tool that arrived with the iOS 9 update last year. This tool will show you what apps are eating the most battery and when. Look for something out of the ordinary. If you do see something odd, check the App Store for an update. Developers are rolling out bug fixes and iOS 10 support updates that could improve performance. If an update fails to cure the issue, try reinstalling or uninstalling the app completely to see if that helps settle your device’s battery. Use Low Power Mode If you haven’t been using iOS’ built-in Low Power Mode, now would be a good time to get familiar with this important feature. The iOS 9 update delivered a new feature called Low Power Mode. It’s important because it allows you to stretch out the last 10-20% of battery life on your device without having to make a bunch of manual changes. To enable Low Power Mode on your device go to Settings > Battery > Low Power Mode > On. This feature will help you conserve a few hours of battery life. Start using this feature on a regular basis. Use Airplane Mode If you suddenly start experiencing rapid battery drain, it might be because you’re in an area with poor cellular coverage. When you are in a bad service area, your iPhone or iPad will work hard to try and find a signal. This can cause your battery to drain rapidly. This is a perfect time to flip on Airplane Mode. Airplane Mode is found at the very top of your Settings and it will kill all of your connections when turned on. If you’ve done any air travel during the past few years, you’re probably familiar with the feature. Once you’ve entered a new service area, turn Airplane Mode off and you should notice an improvement to your device’s battery life. Disable iCloud Keychain If you don’t use iCloud Keychain, try disabling it to see if that improves battery life. This has worked for a number of people in the past. To disable iCloud Keychain on your device, you’ll want to go into Settings > iCloud > Keychain > Toggle iCloud Keychain off. If it doesn’t have a positive impact on battery, you can always toggle it back on when you need it again. Limit Background App Refresh Do you need your apps to automatically refresh in the background? No? Well then you might want to try disabling the Background App Refresh feature on your device. It could help you conserve battery life. Background App Refresh is handy because it will allows your apps to show you the latest data once you open them. It can also be a resource hog. If you don’t use or care about this feature, go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh > and turn it off for each app that is using too much power. It’s going to be an extremely tedious process for some of you but it could help your battery life. You can also turn the feature off completely if you don’t want to go through your list of applications one by one. If this doesn’t help, you can turn the feature back on for all of your apps or some of them. Manage Your Display Apple’s mobile devices use sensors to adjust the screen automatically in certain lighting environments. Sometimes these sensors work, sometimes they’re a little off. A bright screen can eat up battery life so we recommend getting a handle on your device’s display. First, try turning Auto Brightness off. To do this, go into Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Brightness > Off. Once you shut it off, you’ll have to adjust your screen brightness manually. this is easy with iOS 10. You can adjust it in your Settings in the Display & Brightness menu or you can simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up Control Center. Swipe up and you’ll see a bar that stretches across the length of the first Control Center card. Use it to adjust screen brightness. Restart Your iPhone or iPad If you’re looking for a quick fix, try a simple restart. Hold down the power button for a few seconds and swipe to shut the device down. Hold down the power button again to boot the device back up. Sometimes, this dislodges battery life issues. You can also try a hard reset. To do that, hold down the home button and the power button (volume down and power button on an iPhone 7/iPhone 7 Plus) for about 10 seconds. The device will restart itself. This won’t remove any data. Reset All Settings If none of these fixes help, it’s time to take more drastic measures to fix your bad iOS 10 battery life. The first solution we recommend is a reset of your settings. To do this, go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings and then enter your passcode. If you don’t have a passcode enabled, you obviously don’t need to replicate that step. This process should take five minutes or more and it will restore your settings to their factory defaults. So, make sure you have all of your Wi-Fi passwords handy because your phone or tablet will forget them. Downgrade to an Older Version of iOS If you’d rather drop down to an older version of iOS you can do that. For a limited time. If you can’t tolerate iOS 10’s performance, you can drop back down to an older version to see if that improves your devices battery life. The downgrade loophole will only be open for a short time so you’ll need to act quickly if you want to make the move. For more on the process, take a look at our downgrade walkthrough. Restore the iOS 10 Update If you have a bunch of free time on your hands you can try a restore on your iPhone or iPad. This step should only be used as a last resort because it will temporarily erase everything on your device and could take awhile to complete. You can try restoring from your backup after you install iOS 10. If your iOS 10 battery life issues return after the restore, you will want to try this method again without restoring from your backup. Here’s how to do this on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch: Plug in and backup to the computer or to iCloud. Turn off Find My iPhone – Settings -> iCloud -> Find my iPhone -> Off. In iTunes Click Restore. Follow the prompts and the iPhone will reinstall iOS 10 from scratch. When it completes click Restore from Backup to put your information back on the iPhone or Choose to set up as a new iPhone. Talk to Apple Support Online You might also want to get in contact with Apple support via its website or via Twitter. iOS 10.1.1 is a buggy mess @AppleSupport. Sever battery drain, Calendar app won't even open. What gives? — BLKNGLD (@BLKNGLD_) November 16, 2016 The company runs a Twitter account that takes questions about iOS problems and could help point you in the right direction. Take Your Device Into an Apple Store If nothing on here works for you, and Apple’s online support fails, you could try taking your iPhone or iPad into an Apple Store to have a Genius run some diagnostics. Your issues could be related to a bloated battery, it could be something else entirely. If your device is still under warranty, they might even offer you a replacement. iPhone 6s Battery Replacement Program If you’re using an iPhone 6s, you might be eligible for Apple’s replacement program. The company says it’s replacing batteries for a small set of iPhone 6s models manufactured between September and October of 2015. To determine if your device is eligible you’ll need to locate your iPhone’s serial number. The serial number can be found on the back of the phone or in Settings > General > About. You can also use Apple’s website to quickly check. Once you’ve found your serial number check for these characters located in the fourth and fifth position of the serial number: Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8 Q9 QC QD QF QG QH QJ If your serial number includes one of these in the right position, head to Apple’s website to start the replacement process. Apple will reportedly address this issue in an upcoming iOS update. It’s unclear if that update is iOS 10.2 or another version. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.2 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.2 If You Want Better Security 1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.2 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.2 update brings 12 known patches for potential exploits including one where an "attacker with an unlocked device may be able to disable Find My iPhone."  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.1.1 update and/or the iOS 10.1 update, know that iOS 10.2 brings their security patches with it. If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.2 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered earlier this year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.2 is probably worth a download right now. 1 / 10 24 Responses 09/13/2016 tug Reply this is stupid.. if previously u dont have much issue having all the same settings.. all the same cellular coverage.. the problem is the iOS 10 itself.. asking someone to switch off this and that is not exactly the solution 09/14/2016 Z Reply For me the battery status shows that Messages app took 51% of battery in the background. Ridiculous. Turned imessage off and swiped up messages app from the background and i see a better battery. 09/22/2016 Leo Reply I play a lot of games when i was on the 9.3.5 firmware and battery wasn’t that bad but when I do it on IOS 10 it drains so fast. So obviously theres a problem with it. 10/04/2016 We're The Phucarwe Reply Silly. Nothing in here addresses the inherent battery-draining qualities of yet another Apple downdate. Most of the “enhanced” features are aimed at improving apple’s bottom line rather than your device performance. I’m beginning to think more and more about abandoning a ship I’ve been sailing since the 80’s. C’mon, Apple. 10/06/2016 SUZANNE HAMOOD Reply there need to be yet another update to the IOS10. we should NOT be paying 700.00 for a phone that wont hold a battery charge for 8 hours. I have noticed a HUGH difference and I am not a big phone user. I could usually start off the day with a 100% and if not used much that day end the day with more than 50% Its 2:30 in the afternoon and I haven’t Hardley touched my phone today its at 34% WTF!!! 10/07/2016 Steve miller Reply My 6s battery dies so fast with as much shut off and manual fetch email setting have helped a little but at 1% it seems to last for hours for some reason. I think the battery is still fine but something is ip with the battery indicator 10/08/2016 Jonas Reply Same apps, same settings and the difference is 9% battery drain over night compared to not even 1% on IOS 9. By % that is ridiculous and nearly and insane difference…. As other mentioned, this guide does not have much to do with battery tuning iOS 10, although in general terms it may work, but not for we who haven’t changed anything… 10/09/2016 Elle Reply for some reason my 6 drains at night after i upgraded the ios. Now every time I turn on my phone, instead of my lock screen I see my music screen and I’ve turned off that app. I went form 86% right before bed and woke up to 21%. 10/10/2016 Brian Reply My 5c says the battery life is fine, 50% plus, then without warning the phone will power down. When I try to power it back up, it shows the battery as being dead as a post. So I plug the phone in, and the phone immediately powers up, and shows the battery life as being where it was before it powered down…that was 57% this morning. 10/10/2016 Rene Girardin Reply Here is a link to interesting discussions about iOS 10.0.2 and Fast Battery Drain on all iPhones. All the bla bla about how to lower battery usage is OK but there is a bug introduced in Network Settings. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7685072?start=30&tstart=0 10/11/2016 Matthew Grimsley Reply same with my ipone 6S. happened twice over the weekend. 10/13/2016 Ann Reply I think it’s so funny how our phones have a good battery life until an update comes along, but then it goes to poop and we are informed “Oh it’s probably dat app you using and not iOS 10” seriously??? 10/13/2016 Colin Nias Reply Even the staff in the Apple shops are reluctant to admit there is a problem, even though its plastered all over the internet. My 6 plus has the same issues, 100% in the morning, by 6pm I’m down to 25%. Loads of apps are still working in the background, Facebook and Mail seem to be the main culprits on mine. Apple really need to up their game and stop messing around with things. Listen, if it aint broke, don’t fix it. Simples!!! 10/13/2016 RB Reply Worthless article … “If you previously did not have issues wiith battery power and now do after installing iOS 10, the problem is likely something else and not iOS 10.” Makes perfect sense. 10/16/2016 Luigi Reply Guys I too have the same problem! I am angry!! But is it possible that these Apple release an update that sucks the battery like a ferrari to 240km / h ??? !! But crazy stuff !! It lasts less than half the time of use which I did with iOS 9. But what the heck !!! Apple immediately solve this problem !! Otherwise I swear that I buy an iPhone no longer !! 10/18/2016 jamie pollock Reply full charge at 7am… 3:30pm my iphone 6 shows 90% avail. Nothing special about my setup, I check email and send Texts during the day. I just don’t talk on it much nor use GPS. IOs 10 too. I must be lucky 10/19/2016 Mike Reply ISO 10 is a joke we pay to much and for the phone and service to have to go through this on every major update now it’s the worse it’s ever been I also have a iPhones 5 that says 33% and it just turns off and I have to plug it in and it comes back on with the same amount of power 33% wtf is the deal it’s like the older the phone the worse like they are trying to force everyone to buy the newest phone apple is about to have another class action law suit how many can they take at on time I love my iPhone but there seriously pushing me away and it seem like there doing it to a lot of customers bad business they need to do there homework before they release another update load it to a few different phones and models before you release shit 10/24/2016 Curtis S Reply Privacy > Location Services > System Services Turn off everything except Emergency SOS and Find My iPhone. 10/24/2016 Greg M Reply Hi I have updated my Ipad and now not only at first most of my Apps disappeared, Now it wont even charge to let me check things Surely an outfit like yours has have some accountability for this, this is a disgrace , I had been using this for my business, NOT Happy at all. 10/28/2016 Kai Reply Do not update to IOS 10…I repeat do not update. 10.1 does not help either. Battery life 10 mins if not plug into a charger. Constantly crashes and get stuck in reboot loop. Apple genius swear there is nothing wrong with the software when I brought my iPhone 6 in. Battery life performance at 80% when ran diagnostics, genius solution was to have it replaced. My only solution is to have the phone plug in a portable charger all day and remain plugged everywhere I go. Just waiting on the 7 to be in stock…if same problem arrives, I will be officially done with apple. 10/31/2016 David Harfst Reply This is not a problem with the apps draining the battery. It’s a bug, in my opinion, with how iOS monitors the battery. I’ve had my phone at 80% and all of the sudden it shuts off, and won’t power back on saying the battery is dead. Once I hook it up to power, it comes back on, still says it’s at 80%, and I can then disconnect from power again and it’s fine. This is happenning all the time since upgrading. The latter versions of iOS 9 did this too, but it would have to be down at 20 or 30%. I believe iOS 10.0.1 was better, but since going to 10.0.2, it’s worse again. This is a real pain. 11/03/2016 TS Reply Nothing listed here is a fix. These are all kluge-y awkward workarounds, none of which should be necessary with a properly-functioning OS. 11/20/2016 Mark Clulow Reply TOTALLY Shouldn’t have to go through all this though, this in nonsense. BOOOOOO! 12/31/2016 Kenneth Wilson Reply The problem is definitely the OS. IT seems Apple is trying to push people into buying new phones. Went to Apple. Did the whole reset thing.. no change. The y then suggest it was probably the because it would not charge in their kiosk and to replace it would be $300.00. Take the phone home and the phone charges without any issues. Changed every setting possible with no change. The IPhone 6 would last about 2 hours without doing anything on it. Changed the battery out. still no change. Ended up downloading the Public beta 10.2.1 Beta 2. Phone went from 2 hours to 8 hours with not really using the phone. It still has problems, but at least this helped, But Apple is definitely hiding something. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Gadget Expectations are high from Apple in 2017: What we know about iPhone, MacBook, iPad and AR The new Apple iPhone will be devoid of any buttons and will consist of an edge-to-edge display. The device will carry an OLED display, fingerprint sensor, and camera will be on the display itself. By Mudit Tiwari - Jan 1, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Overall, the year 2016 has been a disappointing one for Apple. Although launched with new features such as no audio jack, the iPhone 7 was not able to create its magic. But, one thing stands true, Whether you love or hate Apple Products, you all wait eagerly for new Apple products and updates. Let us have a look at the new upcoming rumoured Apple Products to be launched in 2017: iPhone Series The smartphone industry is already abuzz with the upcoming iPhone launch. Rumours are that Apple new smartphone will be termed as iPhone 8 or Apple X. The ‘X’ name maybe due to the tenth anniversary of Apple in 2017.  Reports are coming that the new iPhone will be devoid of any buttons and will consist of an edge-to-edge display. The device will carry an OLED display,  fingerprint sensor, and camera will be on the display itself. It is also assumed that the new iPhone will be available in new Space Black and Deep Blue colour variants. iPad Air 3/Pro You all must be knowing that since past two years, Apple has not launched any addition to its ipad Air series, with the last launch being iPad 2 in 2014.  However, news has been doing rounds that 2017 will be the year when Apple will release the iPad Air 3 with hopes of a better camera, 3D Touch, a large 10.5-inch display and a high-speed processor. Moreover, after the release of a 9.7 iPad Pro, we are expecting a new update in the month of March with hopes of the A10X processor, and True Tone Display. New MacBook or Just an update? Apple launched the Apple MacBook Pro in 2016 in 13-inch and 15-inch screen variants and was a major disappointment to the people for its not so good battery life and dependency on adapters to make the accessories compatible with the Thunderbolt 3 port. Therefore, we can only expect an update to upgrade the functioning, specifications and battery life of the MacBook. Apple must also be aware of the new rival- Surface Studio’s all-in-one PC. Apple Augmented Reality (AR ) Tim Cook has already expressed his interest in augmented reality. So all that’s left see is what specifications will the AR be having. According to Apple insiders, Cupertino’s next foray into the quickly expanding wearables market will be digital, augmented reality glasses. Apple has discussed a potential competitor to Snapchat’s Spectacles and Google’s Project Aura with its hardware suppliers and even ordered “small quantities of near-eye displays” for testing purposes.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this 7 security predictions for 2017 What 2017 has in store for cybersecurity Rise of the IoT machines Video Making diversity in tech work for you The high-water line in information security gets higher each year. Just as we think we’ve finally figured out how to defend against attacks, then attackers come up with something new and we are right back to trying to figure out what to do next. For example, ransomware has surged in the last year. Although that kind of malware has been around for years, the current model of encrypting user files to hold data hostage came about just recently. Infections quadrupled in 2016, with the FBI estimating an average of 4,000 attacks a day. A recent IBM survey of 600 business leaders in the United States found that one in two had experienced a ransomware attack in the workplace, and that companies paid the ransom 70 percent of the time. As a result, criminals are on track to make nearly $1 billion this year from ransomware, IBM X-Force said.

Just ask Yahoo. Or the Democratic National Committee. Even the FBI was able to find a firm to hack into the Apple iPhone 5c, which for a while seemed unhackable. For IT and security professionals, this endless fire fighting gets exhausting. Old threats come back in new forms, and new attacks keep making the list of things to worry about even longer. Malicious word macros are back. Exploit kits still love Flash. SMS text messages with one-time codes for second-factor authentication proved hackable. It all makes you want to give up and curl up in a dark corner. But 2016 wasn’t all bad news for enterprise security, and there are some wins that give hope for a more secure future. 1. We’re looking at passwords in a better light Authentication, especially how we use passwords, was a recurring theme with every data breach. Yes, password reuse is still a problem and weak passwords like “password1” and “123456” are still a thing, but we are seeing more people use password managers to secure their online accounts and fingerprint sensors to lock their physical devices. “Biometrics will no longer be seen as novel in 2017, but necessary,” said Daniel Ingevaldson, CTO of security company Easy Solutions. There are fingerprint sensors on the market today with security features including TLS 1.2 and 256-bit encryption, anti-spoofing technologies, live-or-dead detection, and match-in-sensor architectures, said Anthony Gioeli, a vice president at Synaptics’s biometrics division. Apple has had hardware-secured fingerprint sensors in its mobile devices for several years, and now in its newest MacBook Pro. Samsung and Google use similar technology in their latest smartphones. And Microsoft has built in support for biometrics in Windows 10 and beefed up the security in this year’s Windows 10 Anniversary Update. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is also tackling the problem. The draft version of the Digital Authentication Guideline document includes new guidance on password policies, such as allowing for longer passwords; allowing spaces and other characters; removing special character requirements (such as what combination of letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters must be used); and doing away with password hints. NIST also said in the draft that sending unique passcodes via SMS messages should not be used as part of a two-factor authentication scheme, and that stronger authentication schemes should be adopted. Although the guidance is still in draft form and the official public comment period doesn’t start until early 2017, IT departments can use it to start thinking about how to improve authentication, such as rolling out multifactor authentication and changing password requirements. Another bonus: NIST’s Mary Theofanos said mandatory password changes don’t make sense, so IT departments can now work on alternative methods — and stop torturing users. 2. We may finally be taking IoT security seriously Last year, we could see the ransomware wave coming. This year, it’s internet of things (IoT) security — or the extreme lack thereof — that is clearly on the horizon. The distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this fall, which spread through home security cameras, VCRs, and other connected devices, took down the internet and seemed to be the industry wakeup call that finally worked. Made up of compromised IoT devices, the Mirai botnet launched large attacks against French service provider OVH, the website of security blogger Brian Krebs, and networking company Dyn. The last time DDoS was the big story, it was about hacktivists and online pranksters targeting financial websites and other visible targets. This time, botnets are launching large, multivector attacks that can exceed 1 terabit per second — and interrupt internet access for millions.   Security experts have been warning for some time about the millions of devices that are connected to the internet without even the most basic security features, so the Mirai attack shouldn’t have been a surprise. And with Mirai’s source code publicly available, it is safe to assume there are other IoT botnets waiting in the shadows to strike. With all these devices connecting to the internet, we are ripe for an IoT worm, said Lamar Bailey, senior director of security research and development at Tripwire. Fixing the problem will require a lot of coordination, creativity, and persistence, but perhaps people are actually seeing the risks. The silver lining is that the Mirai attack was a “fairly cheap lesson in what a compromised IoT [threat] would look like while there’s still time to do something about it,” said Geoff Webb, vice president of solution strategy at Micro Focus. But IoT vendors need to get serious about security fast — and consumers should avoid their products until they do. 3. We’re getting other benefits on the coattails of new security technology It’s always a good sign when adopting something for security reasons winds up having other benefits. New protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 and HTTP2 will make the web safer, but there are clear performance improvements as well. It’s very likely the uptick in adoption of TLS 1.3 and HTTP2 by web developers will be spurred by the increased speeds the protocols enable, said Ryan Kearny, CTO of networking company F5 Networks. “In 2017, the increase in web speed will spur rapid adoption of TLS 1.3 —- and that will, in turn, make the web more secure,” Kearny said. 4. We’re getting more realistic about security Security was one of those things people never really understood. TV shows and movies didn’t help, with slick graphics and fancy dramatizations of what hacking supposedly looks like. Then, along came the TV show “Mr. Robot,” and the show’s star, Rami Malek, winning an Emmy for his portrayal of Elliott Alderson. “Out of all the attempts that Hollywood has made to tell a compelling story using cyber as the backdrop, Mr. Robot is the most complete,” said Rick Howard, CSO of networking security company Palo Alto Networks. If nothing else, nonsecurity professionals now have a better understanding of just how bad things can get. It’s no longer just that one weak password, one link in an email, or that one old software application that hasn’t been updated. There is no need to oversensationalize the security issues in “Mr. Robot” — the reality is bad enough. That better understanding should help users understand why they need to pay more attention to at least security basics. And why they keep getting breach notices from the likes of Yahoo and Dailymotion. But it doesn’t help that there’s still a culture of silence about breaches among security pros and the companies they work for. No one likes to talk about their failures or to be a headline. But because no one is sharing what mistakes were made, the same breaches keep happening over and over. That’s why the formation of new Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISAC) is a positive — though small — development, a sign of realism creeping into the security professionals’ culture, too. Although existing ISAC and commercial information-sharing platforms are expanding to include more enterprises, they need to become even more widespread. Developers have plenty of places where they can post code snippets and get programming help. IT and security professionals should have forums where they can share their security stories, ask questions without judgment, and learn about what worked for their peers, said Jeannie Warner, a security strategist at WhiteHat Security. “The bad guys have Tor, Reddit, and other social networks to share information and tools. The good guys need to adopt theirs just as freely,” Warner said. It’s easy to see information security as a never-ending stream of attacks. Perhaps the most distressing thing about the year’s outages and breaches is the fact that there is an awful lot happening that IT doesn’t know about. Security experts frequently warn that just because there is no evidence of a breach doesn’t mean there isn’t a breach. That was definitely true at Yahoo: The internet company disclosed two gigantic breaches, but the scariest thing wasn’t the number of victims — it was the fact that they happened years ago and no one even suspected. “We went years with billions of records being sucked out from right under our noses and we didn’t even know it,” wrote security expert Troy Hunt. He called the current mindset “conscious incompetence,” where we know we have a big problem. That’s a better place to be than the previous stage, where the prevailing attitude was, “It won’t happen to me.” The big question is knowing where to go next. “How much more are we going to discover over the next year? Or not discover at all?” Hunt asked. If we’re finally getting real about security, and come out of the shadows, we should finally begin to make real progress. 5. We may finally get security promises we can bank on As consumers, we demand money back when we are not satisfied with a product’s performance or functionality. But IT typically doesn’t get that option with security products. Only 25 percent of U.S. IT security decisionmakers said their primary security vendor is willing to guarantee their product by covering the costs of a breach, including lawsuits and ransoms, according to a recent survey by endpoint security company SentinelOne. But most IT security professionals in the survey said they would like security vendors to offer a guarantee their products would deliver on their promises — and 88 percent claimed they would change providers if a competitor offered such a guarantee. “The industry has reached a tipping point, where security vendors will need to guarantee that their products will hold up against cyberattacks and assume responsibility if they fail to do so,” said Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy at SentinelOne. “Customers are tired of paying additional fees to address security breaches, especially when they have already paid for security defenses in the first place.” There are now a handful of companies that offer security guarantees. SentinelOne’s guarantee covers $1,000 per endpoint, or $1 million per company payout, in the event of a successful ransomware infection after installing SentinelOne’s Endpoint Protection Platform. Cymmetria covers the costs incurred in notifying victims, hiring attorneys, bringing in digital forensics investigators, and repairing the damage in case of an advanced persistent threat gaining unauthorized access, moving laterally through the network, and stealing protected information from compromised systems in organizations that have deployed Cymmetria’s MazeRunner cyber-deception platform. Trusona and WhiteHat Security also have similar product guarantees. As we’ve seen over the past few months, even security products can have vulnerabilities. But in several of the cases, the mistakes seemed fairly basic, even avoidable — not at all at the level of what a security provider should be delivering. Providing product guarantees should wring out such sloppiness from security providers, because they’ll finally pay a real price for their own neglect. “It’s high time people in our industry started putting their money where their mouth is and taking responsibility for what they sell, assuring what they do works,” said Gadi Evron, Cymmetria’s CEO.

Jon C. Ogg, 24/7 Wall St. 6:33 p.m. EST December 31, 2016 The New York Stock Exchange. (Photo: Mary Altaffer, AP) With 2016 behind us, some investors are looking backward to see what worked and what did not. With a 14% rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) this year, the more important issue to consider is what investors should expect for 2017. The Dow has been within 1% of 20,000 for several days now. What if the Dow actually manages to hit 22,000 in 2017? It may be far more possible than most investors might imagine. 24/7 Wall St. has evaluated many of the preliminary views for key companies and industries ahead. Regardless of which candidate voters favored, it is now very hard to find investors who do not view the markets more favorably and more pro-business with higher growth environment. After all, the 8.5% rally in the Dow since the Nov. 8 election is almost unprecedented and is too large to merely assign as a coincidence or as a relief rally. Investors have bought every major market pullback for about six years now, and the bull market is rapidly approaching eight years old. Investors are looking for value and overlooked growth, and they are even looking for upside in popular names that simply have more upside to run. It turns out that many of the 30 DJIA stocks have a consensus analyst price target from Thomson Reuters that calls for substantial upside in the next 12 months. And then investors get to add in the dividends as well. The pro-growth strategies laid out ahead have been a boom for infrastructure companies tied to all sides of major engineering projects and those that process or mine materials. Then there is a lower-regulation and higher-rate environment driving financials and cyclicals. And of course those companies ready to repatriate over $1 trillion in overseas cash are expected to face a much more reasonable corporate tax environment versus other countries. Before just assuming that Dow 20,000 will come and turn into 22,000, it is important to reflect on some real issues. Rallies of this magnitude are rarely, if ever, followed by a straight line higher. Many investors put off traditional year-end profit taking due to expecting lower capital gain taxes in 2017. Many Dow and S&P stocks are now also valued above or very close to their consensus analyst target prices. Many of the Trump-beneficiary stocks also have rallied to the point that much or all of the good news for 2017 already may have taken place. What if the Federal Reserve raises rates more than expected? Will the political infighting of the past decade continue ahead? Also, and sadly, analysts can simply end up being wrong. And we almost never hear about geopolitical risks right now. All of these are risks to the rally not facing a pullback. 24/7 Wall St. showed a preliminary bull-bear case for the Dow in 2016 at 19,700. The Dow was valued just above 19,200 on Dec. 6 when we first looked at a Dow 20,000+, and the Dow has now hit a high of 19,987 as of Dec. 29. Here are some of the key driving forces that could help the Dow Jones Industrial Average get closer to 22,000 in 2017. Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs Group (GS) already has risen to above $240.00 in 2016, and the shares are up 32% just since Nov. 8. Its stock price has passed its $229.00 consensus analyst price target. One reason the Dow has outperformed the S&P 500 since the election is that the Dow’s price-weighted valuation (rather than market cap-weighted for other indexes) is dominated by Goldman Sachs’ 8.3% index weighting, almost three-times the average Dow stock’s weighting. It has accounted for close to one-fourth of the Dow’s post-election gain. 24/7 WALL ST. The Best CEOs of 2016 Some analysts see even more bright skies ahead for Goldman Sachs. Outside of the company landing two top positions in the upcoming administration, HSBC is calling for a $250 target and Deutsche Bank now has a $255 target. If lower regulation allows for more trading, Goldman Sachs’ profit history could dictate even better earnings and far more upside than its paltry 1% dividend yield. Apple Apple Inc. (AAPL) was last seen trading at close to $116, and its 52-week high is just $118.69. Apple’s consensus price target is now up at $132.00 and has climbed slowly higher for months. Apple’s 2% dividend yield could rise handily if the company repatriates its massive overseas cash sum of close to $200 billion, and Apple is valued at only about 11 times next year’s earnings estimate. Credit Suisse just on December 6 reiterated its Outperform rating and $150 price target for Apple with hopes of iPhone 8 super-cycle. Recent reports of the big product being an iPhone 7s in 2017 could jeopardize that, but Apple has the largest cash trove of all companies (by far) and it buys back large amounts of stock. Apple’s 52-week trading range is $89.47 to $118.69, its market cap is $622 billion and its weighting of 4.03% in the Dow is ranked just 10th out of 30 index components. Cisco Systems Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) has recovered to $30.22, and its consensus analyst target is $33.11. It also has close to a 3.4% dividend yield, and the company is a monster when it comes to buying back shares. Cisco shares are valued at 12 times forward earnings. They are still about 10% shy of its 2007 high, and the share price is still less than half of its all-time back in the tech bubble peak in 2000. 24/7 WALL ST. The Best (and Worst) Investments of 2016 The 52-week range here is $22.46 to $31.95, and the market cap is $153 billion. RBC just named it among the top tech picks for 2017 and the firm is calling for a $35 share price for Cisco. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Co. (KO) has been a sleeper, but what if 2017 is the breakout year for the sugar-water giant? Its $41.46 share price is well shy of the consensus price target of $45.75, and the 3.4% dividend yield would imply north of 15% upside. The stock is valued at 20 times expected earnings per share. Despite being more dependent on sugary beverages than rival Pepsi, the reality is that Coca-Cola has been diversifying away from its name brand for years. The stock has been a sleeper for so long, and it mostly has been in a $39 to $44 trading band for the past three years. Coca-Cola still has global expansion opportunities and cost containment opportunities ahead, and it is possible that value investors will begin to focus on what may be a defensive stock with limited downside. Coca-Cola also has raised its dividend for more than 50 years and has a market value of close to $180 billion. Home Depot Home Depot Inc. (HD) has recovered to $134.08 as of December's end, and its consensus price target now has risen to $147. That and its 2% dividend yield would generate upside of over 10%. The stock is valued at 18 times expected earnings for next year. Home Depot ran into some issues after peaking in the summer. But weak consumer and a slowing in housing have now been replaced by a euphoric consumer and expectations for a strong housing market to continue. It seems hard for Home Depot to not participate in this retail and housing upside. Home Depot has a 52-week range of $109.62 to $139.00 and a market cap of $164 billion. Intel Shares of Intel Corp. (INTC) were last seen trading at $36.30, and its consensus price target is now almost $40. Intel’s dividend yield is also close to 3%, and it is valued at less than 13 times 2017 earnings. 24/7 WALL ST. America's 25 Thriving Industries What has occurred is that the personal computer market finally has come back due to gaming, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Intel also has expanded well beyond desktops; it is deep in servers and the Internet of Things, and it is even a growing partner for many chip companies now. Intel’s market cap is $174 billion, and it has traded in 52-week range of $27.68 to $38.36. Nike Nike Inc. (NKE) was the worst stock of 2016, down 17% for the year. With shares last seen at nearly $51, the consensus price target is $62, and that implies 20% upside — with lots of room for its mere 1% dividend yield to grow, on top of share buybacks. Nike is the leader in the athletic apparel market and there have been concerns that “athleisure” has peaked. Brands like Under Armour, Adidas and Reebok also want their piece of Nike’s market. What is amazing about all the negativity here is that analysts expect Nike to grow sales to $41 billion in 2019 from about $32 billion in 2016, with earnings growth expected to be about 40% over the same period. What if everyone has been too negative here? Nike’s 52-week trading range is $49.01 to $68.19, and it has a market cap of $85 billion. Pfizer Pfizer Inc. (PFE) was trading at $32.35, and its consensus price target of $37.65 implies upside of 16.4%, even before considering a dividend yield of almost 4%. Pfizer shares are valued at only about 12 times forward earnings. 2016 has been a dud for Pfizer, with a gain of just 4%, versus a 16% gain so far for rival Merck. Pfizer had been torn in long-term efforts, like whether to move or acquire overseas, deciding if the restructuring would lead to a break-up, and deciding whether to sell some assets. There was also the overhang of political pricing pressure on drug prices. While cheap underperforming stocks are that way for a reason, what if Pfizer has become too cheap versus Merck, or what if it releases some unexpected news or makes a great acquisition in 2017? Pfizer’s market cap is $196 billion, and its shares have a 52-week range of $28.25 to $37.39. Procter & Gamble Last seen trading near $84, Procter & Gamble (PG) has a consensus analyst upside of $91.00. This is still almost 10% in implied upside, without even considering its 3% dividend yield. The consumer products giant has restructured and pared down its brands, but it is still valued at 19.5 times forward earnings. Procter & Gamble has raised its dividend for over 50 consecutive years now. One issue is that it has faced is harder overseas sales comps due to that strong dollar, and it seems hard to imagine that the company can shrink its brands back into a growth company. Still, this is a company that remains quite friendly to shareholders. Perhaps its endless list of brands should just speak for itself. The 52-week range is $74.46 to $90.33, and its market cap is $225 billion, making the company larger than its top three consumer products peers in the United States combined. UnitedHealth UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) was trading at $160.04, and the consensus price target has lifted to $179 now. This implies upside of 11%, before considering its 1.5% dividend yield. What is amazing about the expected upside is that UnitedHealth shares have risen almost 40% in 2016, and 13% of those gains have come since the election. The largest insurer of them all is valued at about 17 times expected 2017 earnings. Being a health insurer under Obamacare turned out to be fine for UnitedHealth, and now it seems that analysts have little fears around a Trump effort to replace Obamacare. It has vacated most exchange operations and is focused on the group market and other value-added opportunities. How the health insurer ultimately will be treated under a regime in which Obamacare gets dismantled remains to be seen. Still, even the lowest analyst price target would imply a 5% drop and the highest analyst target is $200. UnitedHealth has a market cap of over $150 billion, and its weighting is 5.5% of the Dow’s 30 components. Visa Visa Inc. (V) was last seen at $78.02, and it has a consensus price target of $94.20, for an implied upside of 20%. Its dividend yield of less than 1% could have exponential upside, as it is less than one-fourth of earnings. Visa could be a huge winner from repatriation efforts, and a strong consumer spending environment should allow it to ring the register as it wins each time there are credit card transactions. Visa shares are well off of prior highs, but it is still valued at almost 20 times forward earnings. Many investors think of Visa a financial powerhouse now that it is a newer Dow component, but Visa is actually a platform provider with massive room to boost its weak dividend. Still, every company under the sun seems to want a piece of payment technology, and that has weighed at least some on Visa’s dominance. If analysts are right, then Visa shares have pulled back too far from its 52-week high of $83.96. Its shares are actually down since the election, and they have risen less than 2% so far in 2016. Again, there are many circumstances that have to occur for this recent enthusiasm to last. It would only be prudent to expect that some of the typical year-end profit-taking being delayed into next year might bring some selling early on. And it is possible that the strength of the post-election rally has already borrowed from the 2017 upside. Many analysts are certain to update and issue more formal 2017 targets after the start of the year. The formal bull-bear case for 2017 has to be followed by policy and structural changes in Washington, D.C., and a return to more rapid economic growth. The Dow has risen about 8.5% since November 8 alone, and the year-to-date gains in 2016 have been just over 14%. For a relative value between these Dow stocks and the S&P 500 Index, the S&P 500 was last seen valued at 17.3 times expected 2017 earnings per share and at 18.7 times its 2016 estimated earnings per share. 24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The slower pedal could have been spurred by lukewarm iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus sales last quarter.  ( Leon Neal | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple is slowing down its iPhone production by about 10 percent in the first financial quarter of 2017, according to a new report posted this week, citing calculations made from supplier data. This comes after a Flurry Analytics report, which saw Apple tower atop the charts in terms of device activations this holiday season, besting other companies. Cutting iPhone Production Down The report comes from Nikkei, positioning the production cuts as the result of sluggish iPhone sales in the previous quarter. This isn't the first time for Apple to slash production rates for its smartphone line — it had done so in the January to March 2016, after inventory of the iPhone 6s line accumulated at the end of 2015. The experience led the company to curb iPhone 7 production by about 20 percent this year, Nikkei said. Still, iPhone 7 sales were slower than expected. Reuters has already reached out to an Apple spokesperson but wasn't able to get any comments. Other iPhone News Nikkei says that Apple has had difficulty appealing to consumers with new features on its flagship smartphone. The iPhone 7 and its larger dual-camera-wielding sibling, the iPhone 7 Plus, arguably weren't stark upgrades over their predecessors, which is possibly the reason why there's little fanfare behind the two. However, Apple is expected to make headway for a new line of iPhones in 2017, with rumors touting a new iteration that's drastically different from past entries. Tentatively named the iPhone 8, the phone marks the tenth anniversary for the iPhone line, and Apple might finally radically refresh the design this time. iPhone 8 Several rumors have suggested that it could come in three different sizes, and the largest one could feature an AMOLED display supplied exclusively by Samsung. The phones may also sport an all-glass design that'll pave the way for wireless charging, a feature Apple has never given its smartphones. Rumors also point to a 10-nanometer A11 chip under the hood, faster and more power efficient than the previous iteration. It's been reported that TSMC has completed the early design stages of the chip. Advanced biometric features could also be slated for the phone in question, with facial recognition and iris scanning as examples. It remains to be seen what purpose they could serve, if indeed true, but they will likely be alternative unlocking methods, or they could act as another layer of protection during transactions, such as online payments. There's also whispers of a new 5-inch model with a vertical dual-camera setup due for a 2017 release, bearing the same internals as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. We'll know more as 2017 comes into finer view. TAG Apple, iPhone, iPhone 7 © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     Apple Is Keen On Bringing Digital Crown To The IPhone And IPad Posted: Dec 31 2016, 11:54am CST | by Ahmed Humayun, in Rumors | Apple   Patently Apple   Digital crown may be seen on iPhones and iPads in future Usually we get the feeling that the folks at Apple find nothing more enjoyable than filing a good patent application. They patent everything and anything they find even if it never finds a spot in a shipping product at the end. Don't Miss: Latest Science and Medical Discoveries Apple’s patent applications happen to garner the most interest. The latest of such applications brought to the attention of ‘Patently Apple' is the Apple Watch-Like Digital Crown. This will be able to be used on devices including the iPhone and iPad. The crown is an interesting interface feature for the Apple Watch and will allow for new interactions on any device it appears on. In the latest applications 20160378187 and 20160378189 Apple has outlined why it thinks crown will be beneficial to owners of devices which usually do not feature mechanics of such kind. The main aim is to provide feedback to interactions. Apple sees this as a great accessibility feature as well as an interface design. The applications are very wordy and complicated. However in simple terms Apple is bringing a Digital Crown-like interface to the iPad and iPhone. Whether this idea is good enough may depend on the exposure to the Apple Watch but then we wonder if this will ever see the light of day or not as with Apple p’atent applications there is no guarantee if the product actually comes to work.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     IOS 10.3 Beta Release Date Is Set For 10th January-Will Feature A Theatre Mode Too Posted: Dec 31 2016, 12:09pm CST | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Dec 31 2016, 12:11pm CST, in News | Apple     According to the latest rumor Apple is set to release the iOS 10.3 Beta on January 10th with an addition of a new mode called the ‘Theatre mode’. Apple is becoming more prolific with its beta releases for the iOS and macOS. Don't Miss: Latest Science and Medical Discoveries Rumors are already beginning to surface as to what the new iOS 10.3 will bring when the first beta ships. Sonny Dickinson who is generally reliable with his comments has given his say on the subject on Twitter today. He has claimed that the first beta release of 10.3 will be with developers by January 10th. The specific date provided by Dickinson does provoke us to think that he knows something rather than simply putting the pieces together. iOS 10.3 beta 1 is scheduled to seed on January 10th.— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 30, 2016 However Apple can be very unpredictable and may change its plans at the last minute. We may never really know for sure until we see the OTA update pop up on the developers device. Till then let’s just hang on to Dickinson’s word. The release date is not the only thing Dickinson has brought forward today. He has also claimed that the new software will offer a ‘Theatre mode’. It will feature a new accessibility option via a button within the Control Centre. The button is described by Dickinson to be shaped like a popcorn to describe the feature itself more vividly. As the name suggests the new mode will offer features such as dimmed screen lighting, less notifications and maybe even a Night Shift which would change the color of the screen to enhance the movie experience.

Photo Galleries Spokesman-Recorder (501c3) Subscribe Special needs a specialty of Apple Tree Dental December 31, 2016 by Bob Keller Leave a Comment ADVERTISEMENT (MGN On     Appropriate and competent dental care is needed for every population. Apple Tree Dental is a nonprofit group dental practice specializing in geriatric and special needs dental care. Starting 31 years ago in 1985, the clinic was initially founded around the care of older adults and in-house older adults who lived in long-term care facilities or needed home health services. Dr. Michael Helgeson, Apple Tree CEO and one of the founders, told MSR, “The founders of Apple Tree have a strong history in geriatric dentistry. “That group in particular faces a lot of barriers to care, including their general health condition, their cognitive conditions, and other conditions that make it particularly hard to provide those services for them. Also, living in institutions gives them transportation barriers.” Helgeson went through a two-year post-graduate program in geriatrics and special care dentistry. He proudly stated, “There are not too many dentist in the nation that have that kind of training for treating older adults, in particular older adults with more chronic problems such as frail older adults; [there are] also younger adults with special needs. “They may have developmental disabilities, brain injuries, mental health issues, cognitive impairment, or a wide variety of conditions that require some special adaptations and different approaches that a general dentist may not be comfortable with,” Helgeson explained. He also was in the public health field for four years and has experience working with underserved populations, low-income families, and service in rural communities. He brings the background of special care (working with populations that may need modified dental care) and public dental health to his work, which he says “is part of the DNA of Apple Tree Dental.” Helgeson continued, “Many frail older adults end up spending the remaining of their savings on their healthcare needs and the majority, about three-quarters, become dependent on Medicaid when they are in long-term care facilities. The Medicaid program provides very little dental benefits, and it pays very little for dentistry. So there are financial barriers that are faced by that population as well.” Based on this need, the clinic developed new ways of care. They developed mobile, portable dental equipment and bring this equipment to their patients inside nursing homes, which helps to coordinate services with nursing staff and direct care givers. This opens up opportunities to give care where patients live. “Providing care where they live was one of the first innovations of Apple Tree Dental 31 years ago,” said Helgeson. Today, they provide services to over 80 long-term care facilities in Minnesota. “Since 1985, we have developed programs that are similar to the special needs programs that reach low-income children at Head Start centers. We have school-based programs where we provide services to predominantly low-income families at their schools. We are delivering services to a mental health facility down in Rochester for patients with mental illness and chemical dependency.” They also deliver care out in the community through mobile and portable systems. They call their clinics “Centers for Dental Health,” and they provide services to everyone, meaning they are open to the public. Currently, their centers for dental health in Minnesota are located in Holly, Fergus Falls, Coon Rapids, Mounds View, Madelia and Rochester. Their mobile and portable delivery systems serve the communities around those six main clinics. What does the future hold for Apple Tree Dental? “We are looking forward to bridging the worlds of medical health and dental health. Over the last 30 years there has been more and more research that shows the connection between general health outcomes and dental health outcomes. Heart disease and diabetes are two conditions that are generally affected by conditions of the mouth,” Helgeson stated. Apple Tree Dental looks forward to advocating for and educating more communities about special needs dental care and providing dental care to those who need it.   For more information on Apple Tree clinics, visit their website at www.appletreedental.org or call them at 763-754-5780.

Enlarge Image Can Apple's FaceTime be held responsible?Photo by Apple The SUV hit them from behind. It was going 65 mph. It went up, onto and over the Modisette family's Toyota Camry on Interstate 35, north of Dallas. James Modisette, who was driving, was critically injured. His five-year-old daughter, Moriah, sitting behind him, died of her injuries. These are some of the details of a lawsuit filed just before Christmas in Santa Clara, California. Why there? The defendant is Apple. The Modisettes claim that the accident, which happened in December 2014, occurred because the other driver was using FaceTime on his iPhone 6 Plus. According to the Denton Record-Chronicle, the driver of the SUV, 22-year-old Garrett Edward Wilhelm, admitted to police that he was on the phone at the time of the crash. How, though, could Apple be responsible? The Modisettes say that Apple failed to "install and implement the safer, alternative design [...] to 'lock out' the ability of drivers to utilize the 'FaceTime' application on the Apple iPhone while driving a motor vehicle." The lawsuit says that Apple applied for the patent in 2008 and had it issued in December 2014. It claims that Apple could have installed it by the time of the accident. It also says that Apple "failed to warn its users that its product was likely to be dangerous when used or misused in a reasonably foreseeable manner." Therefore, says the suit, the phone was essentially defective when it left Apple's hands. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The driver of the SUV is currently facing manslaughter charges. The plaintiffs claim that Apple's failure to implement safety technology on the video chat service was "a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs' injuries and decedent's death." They say that Apple knew about "the compulsory, addictive and dangerous nature of iPhone usage by drivers," and it "voluntarily and intentionally failed to implement the technology." More Technically Incorrect Watch this scary aborted jet landing in the wind Moscow mocks Obama with Donald Trump-style tweet Uber driver insults famous football coach (who's the passenger) If such an action was to succeed, it would surely open the door to many more lawsuits involving anyone using technology while driving. It would suggest that everything from FaceTime to Facebook used by a distracted driver contributed to any subsequent accident. Tech companies have traditionally defended not immobilizing phones during driving by saying that it's not reliable. As the New York Times reported earlier this year, the companies say they can't guarantee that, in trying to block a driver's phone, they won't block a passenger's device. This may be one of those issues where no company wants to be the first to disable phones. As more accidents are caused by tech-related distracted driving, the pressure on all companies will surely increase. Highway deaths rose this year -- up 10.4 percent in the first half of 2016. That's not to suggest that technology is responsible for all of them. The existence of all sorts of technology in cars, though -- some built-in, others not -- by its very nature must distract. How many devastating crashes involving of drivers using Snapchat or Facebook must there be before tech companies -- or the government -- decide enough is enough?

It also says that Apple "failed to warn its users that its product was likely to be dangerous when used or misused in a reasonably foreseeable manner." Therefore, says the suit, the phone was essentially defective when it left Apple's hands. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The driver of the SUV is currently facing manslaughter charges. The plaintiffs claim that Apple's failure to implement safety technology on the video chat service was "a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs' injuries and decedent's death." They say that Apple knew about "the compulsory, addictive and dangerous nature of iPhone usage by drivers," and it "voluntarily and intentionally failed to implement the technology." More Technically Incorrect Watch this scary aborted jet landing in the wind Moscow mocks Obama with Donald Trump-style tweet Uber driver insults famous football coach (who's the passenger) If such an action was to succeed, it would surely open the door to many more lawsuits involving anyone using technology while driving. It would suggest that everything from FaceTime to Facebook used by a distracted driver contributed to any subsequent accident. Tech companies have traditionally defended not immobilizing phones during driving by saying that it's not reliable. As the New York Times reported earlier this year, the companies say they can't guarantee that, in trying to block a driver's phone, they won't block a passenger's device. This may be one of those issues where no company wants to be the first to disable phones. As more accidents are caused by tech-related distracted driving, the pressure on all companies will surely increase. Highway deaths rose this year -- up 10.4 percent in the first half of 2016. That's not to suggest that technology is responsible for all of them. The existence of all sorts of technology in cars, though -- some built-in, others not -- by its very nature must distract. How many devastating crashes involving of drivers using Snapchat or Facebook must there be before tech companies -- or the government -- decide enough is enough?

What's in Store for Apple in 2017 GO Will Apple dedicate more time and money to the cloud? How about Siri and the Desktop computer line-up? Dec 31, 2016 19:55 GMT  ·  By Adrian Boioglu  ·  Share:  2016 was all about the MacBook. The computer that is going to change the future of ports and connectors was born. We have also got a phone with a missing headphone jack. For some users, this is a big downer. Others are happy with their AirPods.  Next year seems to be a good one for the desktop computer. Will the Mac mini survive? Is the Mac Pro still up for a refresh? Siri on macOS Siri jumped from the iPhone to the Mac in 2016. It was a long-awaited move that failed to amaze users. Sure enough, the implementation is simple and elegant, just as Apple would do it, but the functionality lacks. Siri can find documents for you, play music, calculate free space, open FaceTime, find tweets, or add Calendar appointments, but there is no way to use it in third-party apps. Virtual Assistants are the future of computing. The rise of Alexa from Amazon and Google's Assistant made it difficult for Siri to shine, though. Apple's way of implementing it as a local functionality as opposed to something server- or cloud-driven and the fact that it can be just as good but secure and privacy-aware at the same time were the keys to its success. In 2017, users will want more Siri. Apple's virtual Assistant needs to be more context-aware and respond to queries in a different manner. Another important issue is the cloud situation in Apple's ecosystem. Users are not happy with the 5GB free tier and the fact that iCloud lacks some of the functionality of Dropbox or other cloud services. Cutting the cord Removing the headphone jack from the iPhone was Apple's big bet. But the fact that the AirPods were late made it difficult for users who wanted to listen to music for a few good months. Now it all starts to make sense. The AirPods are Apple's way to show everyone that they can still come up with "magical" technology. Sure enough, these are not the first bluetooth earbuds ever released, but the fact that they pair with your device right away, the long-lasting battery of the case, and the added functionality like taps that pause and play your songs or podcasts make the AirPods a clear winner in the long run. Apple proved that they could come up with a stylish solution to a decades-old problem: tangling earbuds cords and bulky bands attached to bluetooth headsets. How can this evolve in 2017? First of all, we need to see what we really need from a small headset. The AirPods seem future-proof for at least 5 years to come, and other manufacturers are unlikely to come out with something so different that can capture the market. Betting on USB-C The MacBook Pro just got a long-awaited redesign. The fact that we have a lighter laptop that looks amazing and keeps the same 10-hour battery life is pretty awesome. Apple's big bet in 2016 was on USB-C. Whether you like it or not, this will be the standard for ports for years to come. The guys in Cupertino got rid of their famous MagSafe connector just to replace it with a more versatile connector like the USB-C. Angry customers will have to learn to live with that. What comes up after this radical redesign? We may see a new version of the MacBook Pro with an SD card slot, but this may be just wishful thinking from a long-time user like myself. Apple needs to work on their batteries. Sure enough, no breakthrough is on the timeline for 2017. 2017 - The year of the Desktop Mac The Mac Pro is waaay overdue for an update. Will we get a device that has only 6 USB-C Ports? This may turn pro users to other devices and we may see the rise of the Hackint0sh once again. The Mac mini has been neglected for a long while and it may be the first device to disappear. On the other hand, Apple just quit making their beautiful Cinema Displays, so there is no hope for a standalone desktop computer that needs an external monitor. Our big hope is for the iMac. Although the 5K Cinema Displays are gone, Apple may still want to stay in the business for a good desktop computer. The iMac is also due for an update and there is no way users will be left out in 2017. How can the iMac evolve? Well, one can only hope that it won't feature USB-C ports only... Is it time for an iPhone 8? With strong sales like the ones they've got for the iPhone 7, Apple is not in a hurry to release the iPhone 8. However, Samsung is longing for a comeback after the Samsung Note 7 and Google may be trying to come out with a redesigned Pixel phone. It is too early to call the shots for an iPhone 8 in 2017, but users surely want one.

Here are the rumored iPhone and iPad features By Matt Swider | Dec 31, 2016, 02.36 PM IST FacebookLinkedinTwitterGoogle+Reddit Continue reading Apple is readying the iOS 10.3 beta update for January, according to a new leak that allegedly spills the beans on the new iPhone and iPad features. The big highlight to Apple's next major software update is dubbed 'Theatre mode,' according to notable leaker Sonny Dickson on Twitter. While Dickson doesn't go into much detail about the new mode, he does reveal that it includes a new popcorn-shaped Control Center icon. That leads us to believe it's either a 'dark mode' for optimal video viewing (Apple did just launch a bright white TV app), or a new way to silence your phone when taking it into the movies. The iOS 10.3 launch timing checks out The iOS 10.3 beta release date, said to be January 10, comes on the heels of this month's final iOS 10.2 software launch. But the timing isn't surprising for anyone keeping track. Last year, the iOS 9.3 beta arrived in January, too, and it debuted the popular Night Shift mode in successive beta updates. We could be (and hopefully are) in for another mid-cycle game changer with 'Theater Mode,' should it be just as valuable as Night Shift in the end. Even more exciting is the prospect that the final iOS 10.3 update could be timed to launch with a new iPad in March or April, just like the final iOS 9.3 update did with the iPad Pro 9.7.  Anyone up for an iPad Pro 2 running iOS 10.3?

Saturday December 31, 2016 11:28 am PST by Juli Clover We've covered what we expect to see from Apple in 2017 based on the rumors that are circulating so far in our recent What to Expect post. On the horizon are a new iPhone 8 with a radically redesigned body and an edge-to-edge display, a revamped iPad Pro also potentially with an edge-to-edge display, long-awaited iMac updates, and new software, but there's always the chance there's a wildcard update or new product in the works that will surprise us all. A redesigned Apple TV, a new home hub, and augmented reality smart glasses are all products that are rumored to be in the works with no prospective release date. We want to hear from the MacRumors community -- what are you expecting or hoping to see Apple release in 2017? Are there specific features you're hoping Apple will implement in iOS 11, tvOS 11, watchOS 4, or macOS 10.13? Popular wishlist items from last year included a dark mode for iOS, home screen widgets, and a customizable control center. Let us know what you want to see in the comments, and make sure to check our our What to Expect post for the latest rumors. Apple's plans for 2017 will likely become more clear in the early months of the year, and as always, we'll be covering all of the rumors in-depth here at MacRumors. The MacRumors forums are also always a rich resource for talking about upcoming products and rumors, and with the biggest iPhone change in years set to happen in 2017, our forums are the place to be for lively discussions. We'd also like to thank all of our readers and our forum members for making MacRumors the absolute best source for Mac news and advice on the web.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Fires dominate news: Pilot, Bluecut blazes are biggest local stories of 2016 Saturday Dec 31, 2016 at 11:24 AM Dec 31, 2016 at 11:24 AM Staff Reports There was a wealth of big news locally in 2016, but nothing could top the two major wildfires that broke out in a one-week span in August. No sooner had firefighters contained the Pilot Fire that broke out near Silverwood Lake than they were confronted with a monster blaze, the Bluecut Fire that started in the middle of the Cajon Pass. The latter forced authorities to issue evacuation orders for more than 82,000 High Desert residents, including the entire community of Wrightwood. Here's a look at the top 10 local news stories of 2016: BLUECUT FIRE The 36,274-acre Bluecut Fire, which began Aug. 16 and quickly grew, was the fifth largest wildfire reported in the state in 2016. The blaze erupted in the Cajon Pass just hours after fire officials announced the Pilot Fire had been fully contained. Firefighters made aggressive attacks, including using 241,414 gallons of fire retardant on the first day. But erratic winds spread the fire quickly and carried embers up to 2 miles away, touching off new fires. By the end of the first day, authorities had shut down Interstate 15 in both directions and issued mandatory evacuation orders for over 82,000 residents, including those in West Cajon Valley, Wrightwood, Phelan, Oak Hills and southwest Hesperia. The blaze destroyed an estimated 105 homes, 213 outbuildings and more than 200 vehicles, mostly in the West Cajon Valley, and was declared fully contained on Aug. 23. At the peak of the battle to control the Bluecut Fire, 2,684 personnel were actively involved. The Bluecut Fire saw 499,336 gallons of retardant used. Last estimates showed more than $18 million was spent fighting the blaze. Fire officials say investigators still have not determined its cause. PILOT FIRE Firefighters had their hands full in August battling various wildfires in the region. The first was the Pilot Fire, which burned 8,110 acres in the San Bernardino Mountains and Summit Valley. The Pilot Fire began on Aug. 7 near the Miller Canyon off-highway vehicle area off of Highway 138. The California Highway Patrol, for some time, had rolled the wildfire into an earlier incident logged as a "car fire." But CHP officials were not able to confirm whether the two incidents were connected. By the end of the first night the blaze spread to 1,500 acres, prompting a massive firefighting response from local and regional agencies. The blaze quickly resulted in over 5,300 evacuation orders for homes in the southeast Hesperia, Lake Arrowhead, Lake Gregory and Crestline. Firefighters made aggressive attacks, including using 312,000 gallons of fire retardant on the first day. The Pilot Fire was not officially contained until Aug. 16. Fire officials reported no structures were damaged or destroyed. One firefighter suffered minor injuries. The last estimates available from the San Bernardino National Forest Service show the cost at more than $16 million. The Pilot Fire was listed as the 10th largest wildfire in California in 2016. Fire officials say investigators still have not determined its cause. CAJON PASS CONSTRUCTION After nearly three years of construction on Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass, Caltrans held a May ceremony to declare both the $324 million Devore Interchange and $121 million Cajon Pass Rehabilitation projects complete — under budget and ahead of schedule. High Desert commuters had to endure lane closures, bypass lanes, reduced speed limits and limited shoulder access while Caltrans’ contractors worked on the projects. The Devore Interchange Project added lanes and created truck bypass lanes on both north and southbound I-15 at the Devore curve, while the Rehabilitation Project removed and replaced badly worn pavement up and down the Cajon Pass. The result of the construction is pavement that should last at least 40 years and additional lanes that should eliminate one of the five worst traffic bottlenecks in the nation. MURDERS OF APPLE VALLEY COUPLE The murders of an elderly Apple Valley couple sent shock waves through the community — with the lack of information initially available keeping residents on edge for weeks. Louis and Rose Giuntini, longtime Apple Valley residents, were found dead inside their home on Highway 18 on Feb. 29. Sheriff’s officials classified their deaths as homicides but remained tight-lipped on details, prompting concerns from neighbors fearful that a killer may be in their midst. Officials finally broke their silence on March 9, naming a Lancaster man recently released from state prison, Keon Bailey, as a “person of interest” in the slayings. However, it wasn’t until more than two months after the murders that DNA evidence positively identified Bailey — who was killed in a robbery in the South Bay before being identified as the sole suspect in the Giuntinis' slayings. Bailey was also connected to three other crimes in the Apple Valley area that occurred before and after the murders, and another robbery in Long Beach during a crime spree he began just days after he was released from prison. The Giuntinis were recently honored by the Town of Apple Valley with the dedication of a bench installed at the Apple Valley Golf Course in late November in the couple's memory. HESPERIA COUNCIL APPROVES TAPESTRY After almost a year of discussion where many residents expressed outrage and concern over the proposed Tapestry housing project in southeast Hesperia, the City Council approved the project in January. Approval of the 30-year build out project, which will bring 16,196 homes to Hesperia in multiple phases, was quickly met by a several lawsuits against the Terra Verde Group and the city of Hesperia. The Crestline Sanitation District and a coalition of public-interest groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity, the San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society and the Sierra Club, filed lawsuits. Although public discussion has ended on the Tapestry project, many residents told the Daily Press they will remember the seated Council members who approved Tapestry should they choose to run for re-election. DEMISE OF MOJAVE ALUMINUM PLANT The $120 million, 500,000-square-foot aluminum remelt and casting house plant proposed to be built in Lenwood met its demise in 2016. Developer Eric Shen had said the plant would employ up to 450 people and would be a scaled-down version of one the Barstow City Council approved in March 2014. Shen sent a letter to the city saying his Mojave Aluminum Company would not proceed with the building of the smaller plant. He blamed the project's demise on a Dupre Analytics report released in August. The online report accused China Zhongwang Holdings Limited of fraudulent market practices. Shen was named as a "key player" for China Zhongwang's Chairman Liu Zhongtian in the report. Shen's attorney, Dean Kajioka, of Kajioka & Associates in Las Vegas, denied any wrongdoing by his client. THE MAVERICKS STRIKE OUT When the High Desert Mavericks won the California League championship in September, the team was playing for a bookend of titles for the franchise, which won its first championship in its inaugural 1991 season. A month before, the California League announced it would dissolve the Mavericks and Bakersfield Blaze at the end of the year and downsize the league to eight teams. For the Blaze, failures to command a new stadium appeared to seal its fate, while the Mavericks became the second team — the odd man out — in part because of a tense feud that had been stirring for months. The Adelanto City Council voted in January to tear up the $1 annual stadium agreement inked with the team four years earlier, saying it violated the state Constitution and was tantamount to a gift of public funds. The team sued, the city sued, but the damage was done. The lawsuit brought by Mavericks ownership, which has won battles in court so far, is expected to enter mediation as early as the fall. GREEN TREE EXTENSION GETS FUNDED San Bernardino Associated Governments approved a $12.5 million loan for Victorville's Green Tree Extension project in October, securing a much-needed funding source for the city's most significant infrastructure undertaking since the Nisqualli Interchange. Until the loan agreement, the project's financial viability had often been met by skepticism. The city, town of Apple Valley and San Bernardino County later approved the loan as project partners. The loan was widely seen by officials as a signal of inclusiveness within the Victor Valley and it allowed Victorville to project that construction could start in late 2018. The $45 million extension, the final leg of the Yucca Loma Corridor, will stretch Green Tree Boulevard about a mile from Hesperia Road to Ridgecrest/Yates roads, includes a bridge over BNSF railroad tracks and will ultimately create a third arterial connection from Apple Valley to Interstate 15 via the recently completed Yucca Loma Bridge. ELECTION OUSTERS Two councilman in the High Desert who had both served as mayor of their respective cities at some point were ousted from the dais during the November general election: Victorville Councilman Ryan McEachron finished fifth in a race for three seats; Hesperia Councilman Eric Schmidt came in third in a contest with two seats open. The outcome in races in both cities altered the dynamic of the councils and acted as a referendum for change. McEachron, who may have been hurt by his support of toll lanes on Interstate 15, had served on the Council since 2008. Schmidt, who stood behind the unpopular Tapestry master development housing project, was first elected in 2012. Both are well-known businessmen in the region with strong connections to civic, business and community groups. During their final council meetings, both were praised by colleagues and each expressed gratitude for having been given the opportunity to serve. OAK HILLS HIGH HAZING CLAIMS In September, a second former Oak Hills High freshman football player sued the school and Hesperia Unified School District, alleging he was subjected daily to hazing during the 2012-13 football season. It was the second civil complaint filed in two years accusing officials of creating a culture where systemic sadomasochistic sexual hazing occurred. But the alleged issues hit a crescendo when they were exposed to a national audience as part of ESPN's "Outside the Lines" program, which aired in September and highlighted claims by a first plaintiff who filed suit in 2014. That case is expected to go to trial as early as mid-February, while the later case has a trial setting conference scheduled for April, court records show. While the district and school have denied the claims, the attorney representing the former freshman football players has suggested there are likely other purported victims.   About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Contact Us E-Paper Help Subscribe Now Report a Problem Online Services Newsletters/Alerts Archives Story Archive Obituary Archive Photo Archive Advertising Info Advertise with Us Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

The company will no longer be solely known as a software company, as it launched a series of hardware products such as the Google Pixel, Daydream VR, Google Home, and Chromecast Ultra.   ( Google ) Advertisement Google managed to capitalize on Apple and Samsung's weak performance this year. While Samsung's attempt at smartphone dominance literally blew up on its face and Apple was mediocre at its best this year, Google managed to successfully enter the lucrative hardware market by coming up with a slew of premium hardware products. Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL After six years of working with different phone manufacturers to produce Android phones under the Nexus brand, Google finally launched its own line of smartphones under Pixel. The Nexus replacement is a beast of a phone, and aims to showcase the best of what Google and Android has to offer. It comes equipped with top-of-the-line hardware, sleek design, bright HD display, and great camera. If you are disappointed with Samsung's exploding phones and Apple's mediocrity, the Google Pixel will serve as a breath of fresh air. Daydream VR You can now transform your Android phone into a virtual fantasyland with the help of the Daydream VR headset. Enjoy 360 degree games, movies, and panoramic photos simply by fastening your phone into the device. Unlike the control buttons located on the Samsung Gear VR handset, the Daydream comes with a separate controller that you can use to wield and navigate your way into a game. At $79, the Daydream is also more affordable than its main competitors, and is covered in soft material, making it more convenient to wear. Google Home If you want to ask help from Google without having to type on a keyboard or tap on a mobile screen, Google Home is your answer. Google Home is a voice-controlled speaker that allows you to use Google' services, even if you aren't with in front of a computer or a phone. It can answer questions, wake you up in the morning, control the thermostat, and do a lot of other tricks. This device looks a lot like Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Microsoft's Cortana. It currently works with a limited number of smart home devices such as Philips Hue bulbs and Nest, as well as IFTTT recipes. Chromecast Ultra If you want to stream 4K HDR video to your UHD TV, there is no better option than the Chromecast Ultra. It offers fast and powerful streaming in a nifty device. It also comes with an attached ethernet port built into the power adapter, allowing videos to load and play faster. With a plethora of hardware products launched in 2016, Google is definitely no longer just a software company. This was a great year for Google all in all, considering its successful entry in the hardware industry.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     US Family Blames FaceTime For Fatal Car Crash And Sues Apple Posted: Dec 31 2016, 9:26am CST | by IANS, in News | Apple   Photo Credit: Getty Images   A family in the US who lost their young daughter in a car crash recently filed a lawsuit against Apple for allegedly encouraging distracted driving through "FaceTime" video calling app, media reported. Don't Miss: Hottest CES 2017 Announcements The family claims that Apple had the patent for a safer version of its "FaceTime" video calling app, but chose to make the less safe version available with the iPhone 6 -- ultimately leading to a car crash that resulted in the death of their five-year-old daughter Moriah Modisette, Courthouse News reported this week. The case dates back to 2014 when Moriah was traveling in the back of her parents' car near Dallas and was hit by another car driven by Garrett Willhelm who was using the Apple "FaceTime" while driving. The erring driver had confessed to the police that he was on "FaceTime" and police had also found that the app was still live when they arrived at the scene. Given the fact that the app fully engages visual components, the Modisette family blamed Apple for its failure to either program a shutoff into the "FaceTime" or give strong warning about using the app while driving. "Defendant Apple Inc. has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisettes' injuries, specifically since at least December 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the US Patent Office for a ‘driver handheld computing device lock-out," the family said in the complaint. The failure of Apple to use GPS tracking to detect the speed of the vehicle in which a user was traveling and shut down the "FaceTime" app was a significant factor in the accident, the family added. The grieving family has sought economic damages along with punitive damages.

Here are some of the best products that Apple released in 2016.  ( Apple ) Advertisement There are a lot of things to look forward to from Apple in 2017. Everybody is looking forward to the launch of the iPhone 8, which will coincide with the 10th anniversary of the said phone. While Apple did not exactly have a banner year, some of the products the company did release this year is nothing to sniff at. Take a look back at the best products that Apple released in 2016. iPhone 7 Plus While the iPhone 7 Plus is more of a refinement rather than a complete overhaul of the previous iPhone models, it is still one of the best premium phones that are out in the market today, and can be considered a worthy upgrade even if you are making the upgrade from iPhone 6 Plus or iPhone 6S Plus. Most people took umbrage with the fact that it did not come with a headphone jack. However, the iPhone 7 Plus is currently the best iPhone available right now. It has an improved power and battery performance. The phone is also waterproof and has two camera sensors at the back, allowing you to take photos using the portrait mode and come up with beautiful bokeh-like effects. iMac With 5K Retina Display Buying a new Mac computer is a long-term investment on your part, and will also cost you a small fortune. You don't want to be stuck with the wrong model, which is why you need to make sure that you end up with the right fit. If you are looking for a desktop computer that has a large screen and precision display, then this Mac computer is the one for you. This computer has a great Retina display, with plenty of real estate to boot. MacBook Pro 15-inch The new and improved MacBook Pro is much thinner and lighter. It also features a massive trackpad, a brighter and colorful Retina display, and an improved audio performance. The laptop also had a lot of changes that surprised a lot of people, such as the four USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports and the fancy new touchscreen at the top of the keyboard. AirPods This is the perfect accessory for people who love freedom of movement. This listening accessory instantly pairs up with your Apple device. Simply open the lid of the AirPods case near your iPhone and they're instantly connected. Sound quality has improved when compared to the EarPods, especially the bass level. However, if you are an audiophile, know that the AirPods do not offer the same quality that other dedicated music-listening headphones can provide.    Although Apple was not able to produce anything that is groundbreaking this year, most of the products featured here are very much capable machines and accessories, which will prove to be useful down the line.

In 2016, there were major strides in technology that will inevitably change the way we live life, including everything from delivery drones to self-driving cars. And 2017 promises to be just as innovative. The following is a non-comprehensive list of rumored gadgets and gizmos to get excited about for the upcoming year: Apple 1. iPhone 8: The year 2017 marks the iPhone’s tenth anniversary and Apple is said to be going all-out for this celebratory upgrade. Though Apple hasn’t made an official announcement yet, rumors suggest a radical redesign of the phone favorite. The name “iPhone 8” is purely speculation, but the phone is said to have a top-to-bottom, all-glass display. This means it would also be sans home button but have the Touch ID and camera built directly into the display. Apple is also said to be using flexible plastic OLED rather than an LCD, making the device thinner with a better display while consuming less power. The iPhone is rumored to come out in the fall of 2017. 2. iPad Upgrades: According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is also said to be updating its iPad lineup for the spring of 2017. The new models are said to include an improved Apple Pencil stylus and a new variety of screen sizes. Google 3. New laptop running Android’s Andromeda OS: Google did quite well this year with its first phone, the Pixel. Now, according to Android Police, a website that features news, reviews and updates related to Android platforms, Google’s combined Android/Chrome ‘Andromeda’ OS will run a new laptop by Google that’s expected to launch in the fall of 2017. The computer is said to work as both a tablet and laptop. 4.Smartwatch: According to David Ruddock with Android Police, Google is expected to launch its own smartwatch as well and has heard that Google is prototyping the smartwatches. Android Police is not entirely sure when they will be released but have noted that they are 70 percent confident these watches will be released. Samsung 5. Samsung Galaxy S8: Samsung didn’t have a great year thanks to the notorious, exploding Galaxy Note 7, but this next year might be an opportunity for redemption. While tech insiders don’t know a lot about the device, the Galaxy S8 is rumored to include a digital assistant powered by Viv, the artificial intelligence startup that Samsung purchased in 2016, according to Bloomberg’s Jungah Lee. Tesla 6. Tesla Model 3: The new Tesla Model 3 vehicle comes with full autopilot hardware and can update self-driving software over the air. It’s expected to be available in late 2017 and Tesla has coined it their “most affordable car yet” at $35,000 during their unveiling event in March 2016. Microsoft 7. Virtual Reality headset with Windows 10: In 2016, Microsoft announced new virtual reality headsets that will work with a free update of Windows 10. The headsets will start at $299, a much cheaper price than what we’ve already seen when it comes to VR headsets, like the Oculus Rift at $599. Nintendo 8. Nintendo Switch: Nintendo announced the Switch in a video released in fall 2016. The Switch is a new gaming console that works on TVs and as a portable system. The Switch is expected to be released in March of 2017 but we can expect more details of the product on January 12, 2017. Snapchat 9. Snap Spectacles: Snapchat probably doesn’t immediately come to mind during a discussion of tech innovation, but the Snap Spectacles, which are already available in Venice, CA, are expected to spread in 2017. The glasses film a snapchat video from your perspective when you click a button located on the frames and then wirelessly upload to Snapchat. These could very well become a necessity for avid Snappers and are considered much easier to use than the Google Glasses before them. Healthcare 10. Remedy: This product is an app designed to make on-demand and personalized healthcare a lot simpler. The app, along with similar apps like DoctorOnDemand and HelloMD, are expected to be more widely used in 2017. The app allows patients to talk to a physician from the comfort of their own home and even be treated and prescribed medication where possible. This remote treatment will hopefully be able to relieve doctors and hospitals that become quickly overbooked. NEVER MISS A STORY!

Cherlynn Low, @cherlynnlow 12.31.16 in Wearables Comments 866 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Google; logo by L-Dopa When the first smartwatches made it to our wrists a few years ago, we were willing to overlook shortcomings because the product category was in its infancy. But the technology has had time to mature, and 2016 should have been an exciting year in this space. Instead, we saw a number of important brands pull out of the smartwatch race; meanwhile Google deferred major updates to 2017. Smaller but significant companies were swallowed by competitors, and the devices that did launch this year were unexciting at best. Smartwatch sales started to decline in the second quarter, and while the all-important holiday shopping numbers haven't been tallied yet, the future isn't looking good for the category. This year's new watches, such as the Apple Watch Series 2, the Fitbit Blaze and a slew of Android Wear watches, were mostly underwhelming, with merely incremental upgrades. Battery life continues to be unsatisfactory, the cases are usually still too thick, and companies still struggle to balance timeless design with futuristic functionality. Google, which originally planned to launch Android Wear 2.0 this year, is pushing that update to early 2017. The new version will apparently allow for apps that can run independently on smartwatches without requiring a companion phone, something that Apple's watchOS 2 has offered since fall 2015. Speaking of Apple, the Series 2 appears to be one of the few smartwatches that did well this year: It's received mostly positive reviews and appears to be selling decently well, although Apple did not respond to queries on actual sales numbers. Traditional watchmakers continued to smarten up their products this year, with one of the most notable being Tag Heuer and its fancy Connected watch. That thing costs a whopping $1,500, and it doesn't offer much more than the other Android Wear watches. Sure, it's a Tag, but when most Android Wear watches cost between $150 and $400, you realize that you're paying $1,200 more for yet another wearable that needs recharging every two days or so, with a display that's middling at best. The only established watchmakers that succeeded at producing decent devices (think Timex and Fossil) did so by avoiding going fully digital, sticking instead to more-conventional analog designs with hidden sensors for basic fitness tracking. Really, then, the watches that did well this year were the hybrids, with the one big exception being the Apple Watch Series 2. Then come the brands that have basically given up on making smartwatches altogether. A Motorola exec recently said the company is not working on a successor to last year's Moto 360, because it just doesn't "see enough pull in the market" to justify developing an updated model. That this kind of sentiment is coming from Motorola, of all companies, is telling. After all, the Moto 360 was the first Android Wear watch to have a round face and is one of the most well-received smartwatches running Google's software. Similarly, this year Microsoft discontinued its Band fitness wearable. Although it's more of an activity tracker, the Microsoft Band always toed the line, what with its color touchscreen and smartwatch-like features such as phone notifications and third-party app support. Unlike Motorola, however, Microsoft never explained its exit from the field, although it continues to support its suite of health apps that can run on other devices. One of the biggest signs that smartwatches are in trouble, though, was industry pioneer Pebble's recent acquisition by Fitbit for the modest sum of about $40 million. Back in its heyday, Pebble reportedly received bids from Citizen and Intel for $740 million and $70 million, respectively. The startup declined both suitors and went on to launch a new line of fitness-focused smartwatches this year. The Pebble 2 and Pebble Time 2 raised $12 million on Kickstarter, beating the $1 million funding goal. Despite the company's fundraising successes, Pebble failed to resolve its financial woes and eventually accepted Fitbit's offer. With so much consolidation in the smartwatch space, the future of the category looks gloomy. Less competition can mean less innovation, which can result in products growing stale and eventually fading altogether. Still, there have been developments in 2016 that could give the industry a boost. Startup Matrix Industries came up with a way to use body heat to power a smartwatch, which could eliminate (or at least alleviate) the problem of inadequate battery life. Plus, with Android Wear 2.0 slated to arrive early next year, the next generation of smartwatches will likely become more functional, giving users more reason to wear them. We also saw a few watches this year that let wearers control Amazon's Alexa from their wrist, although they ran obscure independent operating systems that barely had third-party app support. The Alexa integration means that these watches can access more than 2,000 so-called skills, letting you do things such as turn on your smart lights or thermostat, ask how much you've spent at specific stores, or buy many, many pairs of socks. You can't do most of that yet with Android Wear's OK Google command, but Alexa's expansion into watches could spur Google to improve its own assistant. So 2016 wasn't a great year for smartwatches. In fact, it was a disappointing 12 months that don't bode well for the future of the category. But there are enough upcoming potential enhancements that the industry could be revived. Components could also get smaller and more powerful over time, as they did with smartphones, eventually leading to sleeker frames housing more full-featured systems. But that's something to look forward to in the future. As for this year's smartwatches? Goodbye, and good riddance. Check out all of Engadget's year-in-review coverage right here.

But it seems fair to say that few companies have come close to matching Microsoft in the sheer breadth and scale of its accomplishments over the last twelve months. Of course, let's not get too carried away - it's not like Microsoft completely changed the world in 2016. But what we saw from the Redmond giant over this past year was a far more ambitious and more confident company than ever before, which delivered some significant improvements, and released some remarkable new products. But perhaps Microsoft's greatest achievement this year was that it got people talking about the company with genuine interest, and even excitement. Microsoft's closest rivals, by comparison, had somewhat more mixed results. Google ditched its much-loved Nexus brand and introduced its new Pixel flagship phones - but while they're certainly very capable devices, they haven't exactly reinvented the wheel when it comes to Android handsets. Another new version of Android, 7.0 Nougat, arrived as well (and now version 7.1.1 too) - but while there are some nice additions and improvements, few people have got to enjoy them so far, with only 0.4% of devices running Nougat over three months after its release. With much fanfare, Google introduced two new messaging apps in May, called Allo and Duo - but they haven't been the runaway success the company would have liked. And Google also massively scaled back its ambitions in one truly exciting area, ditching the development of its own purpose-built self-driving car, and instead realigning its efforts around creating and selling that technology to other manufacturers. Apple's year was marred by a series of disappointments. With typical bluster, it hyped up its new MacBook Pro notebooks beyond all belief - particularly the keyboard-bound Touch Bar that the company touted as some innovative, brand new idea that only Apple could think of, despite it being a refinement of old ideas tried by other companies. Aside from the underwhelming battery life (a problem that Apple solved by removing the estimated battery time indicator from its OS), the high cost of the new laptops was particularly unwelcome, given the usability nightmare that Apple created in forcing owners towards 'dongle hell', thanks to its total disregard for compatibility with other devices, including its own iPhones. Then there was the removal of the headphone jack from the new iPhones, a problem that Apple solved by launching its wireless AirPods - almost two months late - and with which some users are now reporting battery life issues. It released updates that did more harm than good, like the watchOS update that bricked Apple Watches. And of course, what everyone really wanted was new Mac desktops, which are long overdue - so naturally, Apple ignored everyone and delivered nothing on that front. It wasn't all that long ago that Microsoft was thought of as a dull, bland corporation - and to some extent, it's struggled to shake off that image, despite its considerable efforts to do so. But in 2016, Microsoft seemed to break through those antiquated perceptions like never before. In October, Mashable wrote "Admit it: Microsoft is now a braver, more innovative company than Apple", and The Verge published a similar article praising Microsoft for its more bold outlook for desktop computing. Microsoft has succeeded - to some degree - in changing how people think about the company, but it hasn't always done so for the better over the past year. In September, it announced that Windows 10 was installed on over 400 million devices - an incredible milestone, just fourteen months after its release. But that achievement came as a result of Microsoft's clumsy, heavy-handed approach to 'encouraging' Windows 7 and 8.1 users to upgrade to the new OS, using methods that won the company few friends, resulting in scathing criticism from both its customers and the media. Last week, Chris Capossela, Microsoft's chief marketing officer, admitted to Mary Jo Foley and Paul Thurrott on the Windows Weekly podcast that that approach had been "too aggressive". Microsoft also admitted in July that it would fail to meet its target of a billion Windows 10 devices by 2018. Bizarrely, the company blamed that on its phone business, despite Windows phones never having contributed any significant volumes to its device sales. Indeed, just a few months after Windows chief Terry Myerson announced that target in 2015, Microsoft wrote down $7.6 billion on its phone business, along with the loss of 7,800 jobs, in the first round of a major restructuring - and downsizing - plan. The effects of that restructuring had a devastating impact on the Windows phone platform in 2016. Microsoft launched the last of its four Windows 10 Mobile devices in February, the Lumia 650, and all four handsets are now at the end of their retail lives, having sold out in several markets, with no direct replacements on the way. Only a handful of manufacturers have so far signed up to launch Windows 10 Mobile devices, and those that did sold their handsets in meager numbers. IDC estimates that Windows' share of the global smartphone market will be just 0.4% by the end of 2016. Given that 97% of Windows 10 Mobile devices in use are Microsoft Lumias, the company's retreat from the phone hardware market doesn't bode well for its mobile ecosystem. But while things may now appear bleak for Windows handsets, the future may well be a bit brighter. Earlier this month, Microsoft made a major announcement, revealing its plans to bring the full-fat Windows 10 OS to next-generation devices with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. Even more excitingly, it promised support for desktop-class 32-bit x86 applications on these devices through emulation. While many expect that to lead to more power-efficient notebooks and tablets being released in 2017, that announcement naturally led to speculation about the prospect of Microsoft's much-rumored 'Surface phone', which could arrive as early as next year. In August, Microsoft released the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, bringing it to PCs, phones, HoloLens, the Xbox One, and many more devices. Compared with the more modest November Update in 2015, the Anniversary Update was a major overhaul for the OS, bringing a vast range of new features and significant improvements, including upgrades to Cortana, a revamped Action Center, more customization features, a better Windows Ink experience, and a lot more. The update was warmly welcomed by users, although its rollout was tainted by freezing problems that affected some PCs, as well as a very unpleasant issue that disabled millions of webcams. In October, Microsoft announced details of its next major Windows 10 release, known as the Creators Update, which will also bring a broad selection of new features and enhancements to the OS when it arrives in early 2017. That announcement came alongside the launch of an exciting new device. Microsoft unveiled the Surface Studio, an all-in-one desktop PC with a focus on creativity. It features a 28-inch touchscreen with support for its Surface Pen, allowing users to draw and write directly onto the display. Microsoft earned itself widespread praise for the machine, which it says has the thinnest LCD monitor ever built. Many observers commented with surprise that Microsoft had built such a device, saying that it was the PC that Apple should have built. High praise indeed, particularly at a time when many in the creative industries have voiced displeasure at how little Apple seems to care for them these days. Along with the Surface Studio, Microsoft also introduced the Surface Dial, "a new tool for the creative process". The rotary input device can be placed directly onto the Surface Studio's display to offer quick access to context-sensitive features and menus, not just in 'creative' scenarios, but also across other types of app. The Dial is also compatible with other Windows 10 devices, to varying degrees. While Apple turns its back on some of its most loyal customers, Microsoft has been embracing users of all kinds, on all platforms. In February, it acquired cross-platform app development specialists Xamarin, and a few weeks later, it announced that those developer tools would be open-sourced and made available free to devs. It was a stunning announcement, underlining Microsoft's commitment to offering the best and most complete software development experience. That acquisition enabled Microsoft to launch Visual Studio for Mac in November, as well as rolling out a release candidate for Visual Studio 2017, and introducing the Visual Studio Mobile Center, which it described as "a mission control for mobile apps", making development for phones and tablets a smoother and less complex process. Microsoft stayed true to its commitment to embrace cross-platform development throughout 2016, not just for other developers, but also for itself. In addition to releasing all sorts of apps for iOS and Android over the last twelve months, the company raised quite a few eyebrows in November when it announced that it had joined the Linux Foundation as a platinum member. Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Foundation, said that Microsoft would now be "better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people". Coinciding with that announcement, Microsoft also announced a public preview of SQL Server on Linux. In September, Microsoft made another hugely significant announcement - the formation of a new Artificial Intelligence and Research Group, with over 5,000 computer scientists. Earlier in the year, Microsoft's Dave Coplin had described AI as "the most important technology on the planet", adding: This technology will change how we relate to technology. It will change how we relate to each other. I would argue that it will even change how we perceive what it means to be human. Of course, after 'the Tay incident', some might say that Microsoft needs to invest as much as it can in perfecting AI ASAP... As part of its ambitions behind the new research group, Microsoft said that it planned to "build the world's most powerful AI supercomputer with Azure and make it available to anyone, to enable people and organizations to harness its power." It also promised that it will "harness AI to fundamentally change human and computer interaction through agents as Cortana". This month, the company took a big step towards exploring the full potential of its digital assistant when it announced the new Cortana Skills Kit and Devices SDK. With these new tools, companies will have the ability to connect to the assistant in more diverse ways than before, creating a much broader range of user experiences. Manufacturers will also be able to build their own devices powered by Cortana, the first of which was teased a couple of weeks ago by Harman Kardon. Microsoft's latest quarterly financial report revealed a strong set of results across many parts of its business, with a remarkable year-over-year increase of 51% in its Office 365 commercial revenue, 11% revenue growth in Dynamics, and a staggering 116% rise in revenue from its Azure cloud services, with Azure compute usage more than doubling in twelve months. Its success throughout the year pushed the company's share price to an all-time high in October, and it ended 2016 even higher than that. The markets were watching Microsoft closely in June, when it announced its purchase of professional networking platform LinkedIn, in a deal worth around $26.2 billion - its largest acquisition to date. There are some very good reasons for that acquisition, despite its enormous cost, and now that the deal has been completed, Microsoft has begun the process of integrated LinkedIn with the rest of its services. Microsoft further boosted its proposition for professionals around the world in November with the launch of Teams, a new "chat-based workspace" for Office 365, designed to take on Slack. But it hasn't been all work and no play for Microsoft over the last year. At the E3 gaming expo in June, Microsoft revealed its Xbox Play Anywhere program, enabling people to buy a game once and then play it on either their PC or Xbox One at no extra cost, rather than having to pay twice for the same title on different devices. The first Play Anywhere game was ReCore, which arrived in September, but Microsoft hopes that more games publishers will support the feature in the months and years ahead. At the same event, Microsoft also unveiled the Xbox One S, an updated (and much smaller!) version of the console that it launched in late 2013. With support for HDR and 4K video, the Xbox One S has been keenly priced in bundles starting at $299, which usually include a free game - and there have many other promotional deals since its launch to further entice buyers. That's certainly helped to boost the new console's appeal, after years of being consistently outsold by its PlayStation 4 rival. In November, combined sales of the Xbox One and One S grabbed 56% of the UK market, while in the US, Microsoft's consoles outsold the PS4 for four months in a row. But Microsoft also made one more tantalizing announcement at E3: Project Scorpio. Described as the "most powerful console ever", it will include support for native 4K gaming and virtual reality... but there's a long wait ahead, as it's not expected to arrive until the end of 2017. We'll be taking a closer look at what else we can expect from Microsoft during the year ahead in another article, but for now, let me suggest something else that you might enjoy. Rich Woods and I got together to discuss what we're looking forward to across the tech world over the next twelve months, so be sure to check that out here: Scorpio, Surface and sweet, sweet phones: A look ahead to what we're excited about in 2017.

Dai Jia-peng, the general manager of Foxconn’s automation committee, says the company has a three-phase plan in place to automate its Chinese factories using software and in-house robotics units, known as Foxbots. Foxconn produces 10,000 Foxbots a year for automation purposes The first phase of Foxconn’s automation plans involve replacing the work that is either dangerous or involves repetitious labor humans are unwilling to do. The second phase involves improving efficiency by streamlining production lines to reduce the number of excess robots in use. The third and final phase involves automating entire factories, “with only a minimal number of workers assigned for production, logistics, testing, and inspection processes,” according to Jia-peng. The slow and steady march of manufacturing automation has been in place at Foxconn for years. The company said last year that it had set a benchmark of 30 percent automation at its Chinese factories by 2020. The company can now produce around 10,000 Foxbots a year, Jia-peng says, all of which can be used to replace human labor. In March, Foxconn said it had automated away 60,000 jobs at one of its factories. In the long term, robots are cheaper than human labor. However, the initial investment can be costly. It’s also difficult, expensive, and time consuming to program robots to perform multiple tasks, or to reprogram a robot to perform tasks outside its original function. That is why, in labor markets like China, human workers have thus far been cheaper than robots. To stay competitive though, Foxconn understands it will have to transition to automation. Foxconn hopes to automate 30 percent of all factory work by 2020 Complicating the matter is the Chinese government, which has incentivized human employment in the country. In areas like Chengdu, Shenzhen, and Zhengzhou, local governments have doled out billions of dollars in bonuses, energy contracts, and public infrastructure to Foxconn to allow the company to expand. As of last year, Foxconn employed as many as 1.2 million people, making it one of the largest employers in the world. More than 1 million of those workers reside in China, often at elaborate, city-like campuses that house and feed employees. In an in-depth report published yesterday, The New York Times detailed these government incentivizes for Foxconn’s Zhengzhou factory, its largest and most capable plant that produces 500,000 iPhones a day and is known locally as “iPhone City.” According to Foxconn’s Jia-peng, the Zhengzhou factory has some production lines already at the second automation phase and on track to become fully automated in a few years’ time. So it may not be long before one of China’s largest employers will be forced to grapple with its automation ambitions and the benefits it receives to transform rural parts of the country into industrial powerhouses. There is, however, a central side effect to automation that would specifically benefit a company like Foxconn. The manufacturer has been plagued by its sometimes abysmal worker conditions and a high rate of employee suicide. So much so in fact that Foxconn had to install suicide netting at factories throughout China and take measures to protect itself against employee litigation. By replacing humans with robots, Foxconn would relieve itself of any issues stemming from its treatment of workers without having to actually improve living and working conditions or increase wages. But in doing so, it will ultimately end up putting hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people out of work. - Via: MacRumors - Source: DigiTimes More From The Verge The Verge: 2016 Yearbook The best games for your new PC or Mac The 15 best movies of 2016 Behind the scenes at Faraday Future, an electric carmaker on the brink of collapse The Verge 2016 tech report card: Facebook The best apps you didn’t know you needed for your new Android phone Now Trending CES 2017: What to expect at the biggest tech trade show of the year Olympus E-M1 Mark II review: the camera that warps time Dell has turned one of the best Windows laptops into a 2-in-1 hybrid This Article has a component height of 13.

The popular messaging app, which has more than a billion users worldwide, announced earlier this month that it will no longer support a range of older operating platforms by the end of the year. The changes are expected to affect millions of users globally, who use handsets including the iPhone 3GS and Windows Phone 7. WhatsApp said it will be phasing out support for older Windows, Android and Apple models by January, with the service set to end for Blackberry users and Nokia models by mid-2017. Scroll down for video  WhatsApp has announced it will be phasing out support for older Windows (centre), Android (right) and Apple (left) models by the end of 2016, and Blackberry and Nokia by mid-2017 The older smartphone platforms can no longer keep up with the latest features being rolled out for the app, claims a blog post by the Facebook-owned app.  WHICH PHONES WILL LOSE OUT? WhatsApp has announced that it will no longer support a range of older operating platforms by the end of the year. By the end of this year Whatsapp will no longer work on: - Android 2.1 and 2.2 - Windows Phone 7 - iPhone 3GS/iOS 6 In June 2017, WhatsApp will no longer be supported for: - BlackBerry - Nokia S40 - Nokia Symbian S60  WhatsApp made the announcement as it celebrated its seventh anniversary, after first launching the popular messaging platform in 2009. The app, which is now used by more than one billion people worldwide, was launched in the early days of Apple's App Store, when seven out of ten had operating systems offered by Blackberry and Nokia. However, today's smartphone market is dominated by Google, Apple and Microsoft, with almost all newer models running on these platforms. The firm wrote: 'As we look ahead to our next seven years, we want to focus our efforts on the mobile platforms the vast majority of people use.' The full list of platforms being left behind at the end of the year includes: Android 2.1 and Android 2.2; Windows Phone 7 and iPhone 3GS/iOS 6.

Share this article Share 1.5k shares Platforms being left behind include BlackBerry (pictured left), including BlackBerry 10; Nokia S40; Nokia Symbian S60 (pictured right); Android 2.1 and Android 2.2; Windows Phone 7 and iPhone 3GS/iOS 6 Whatsapp was launched in the early days of Apple's App Store, when seven out of ten had operating systems offered by Blackberry and Nokia. However, today's market is dominated by Google, Apple (iPhone pictured) and Microsoft WhatsApp said the Nokia S40 platform and application user interface software on Nokia's broad range of mid-tier feature phones will no longer be supported  The Nokia Symbian open source operating system, launched in 2007, is the oldest OS capable of running the app. HOW DO I CHECK WHICH SOFTWARE VERSION I HAVE? FOR ANDROID PHONES: Go to ‘Settings’, then select ‘About Device’, then choose ‘Software Info’, where the name of the operating system eg. 'Android 6.1' can be found FOR iPHONES Go to 'Settings', then choose 'General', then go to 'About' and scroll down to 'Version' to find the operating system eg. '10.2.1'  WhatsApp explained: 'While these mobile devices have been an important part of our story, they don't offer the kind of capabilities we need to expand our app's features in the future.' Users still on one of the listed platforms are advised to upgrade to newer Android, iPhone or Windows phone platforms.  The firm added: 'This was a tough decision for us to make, but the right one in order to give people better ways to keep in touch with friends, family, and loved ones using WhatsApp.'  In its seven years since being set up by former Yahoo! employees Jan Koum and Brian Acton in Canada, the messaging app has grown from strength to strength.  Last month, WhatsApp officially launched video calling, in a bid to compete with Apple's Facetime and Skype.  In keeping with WhatsApp's data security standards, the new video calling feature will be fully encrypted, protecting calls from being listened into.  The move comes as privacy advocates worry about the potential for stepped-up government surveillance in the US under a Trump administration. WhatsApp, which boasts more than a billion users worldwide, adopted end-to-end encryption early this year, making it technically impossible for the company or government authorities to read messages or listen to calls. FIVE WHATSAPP TRICKS THAT CAN MAKE LIFE EASIER In its seven years since being set up by former Yahoo! employees in Canada, the messaging app has grown from strength to strength See when your messages are read: Go to a chat, tap and hold on any of the messages you've sent, followed by the info option. Mute group chats: Tap on the group chat and the name to bring up 'Group Info', where you will find the option to 'Mute' the chat for eight hours to one week or even a year. Shortcuts to conversations: Tap and hold on the chat and a tab will pop up. Select the 'Add Conversation Shortcut' option and the chat in question will appear as the person's profile photo on your mobile desk top – can only be used by Android users. Send public messages privately: On the top-left hand corner just below the search bar, you'll notice a 'Broadcast Lists'.  Tap on it for the option to create a new list of contacts you want your message to go out to, and message away like you would normally. Make calls: Make sure you're using the latest version of WhatsApp. You should see a new 'Calls' tab alongside the usual 'Chats' and 'Contacts'. Just send a voice call invite to another WhatsApp user and you'll be chatting away in no time.

After reportedly getting out of the standalone monitor business, LG’s offerings, which are available in 4K and 5K varieties, might be the next best option. The fact that you can connect a single Thunderbolt 3 cable from your MacBook to the LG UltraFine 5K Display is quite compelling. Not only will this provide display output, but it will also deliver the necessary power (up to 85W) to keep your MacBook Pro — 13- or 15-inch variety — charged. We recently got our hands on the LG UltraFine 5K Display. Is it a good choice for MacBook Pro owners? Watch our hands-on video walkthrough inside to learn more. That screen… The most compelling thing about this display, of course, is its screen. At 5K, you get 5120-by-2880 native resolution, or 2560-by-1440 when using Retina mode (pixel-doubled). In other words, it’s capable of delivering the same amount of on-screen real estate as the Thunderbolt Display, but it’s Retina-enabled, which makes it a whole lot easier on the eyes. Apple starts users off with a default 2560-by-1440 pixel-doubled Retina resolution, but users have the option of customizing display resolution via macOS’ System Preferences. I find that the default resolution is the perfect balance of real estate, asset size, and crispness. The 27-inch glossy IPS display provides wide viewing angles and supports P3 wide color support just like the new MacBook Pro, along with panels that feature 500 nits of brightness. Unlike its smaller 4K brethren, the 5K display is also 10-bit, which will be great for serious video editing, photo editing, and color grading. Like all modern Apple displays, the LG display is glossy. However, I found that it did a decent job of rejecting glare from light sources in front of the unit while in use. Using Final Cut Pro X, I’m impressed by how tack sharp all of the screen assets are. I can view a 1080p video in full resolution in a relatively small window with tons of app real estate to spare. 4K videos can also be viewed in full resolution, but obviously with less app real estate. Hands-on with the LG UltraFine 5K Display Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more videos As you would expect from a good IPS display, it’s got decent off-axis viewing angles. Color shift, while still noticeable at times depending on the on screen content, is kept at a reasonable level. That said, the panel doesn’t seem to be as good as the MacBook Pro’s panel in this regard. Black levels are less impressive with this display, and I noticed backlight bleed on some of the edges when viewing what should have been a completely black screen. But how often are we staring at a completely black screen? It’s not often for most users, and I don’t think it’s something that should prevent most users from considering the display. LG’s UltraFine 5K Display supports wide color with a P3 color gamut, and 500 nits of brightness — the same specs that are found on the new MacBook Pro. I find that it does an admirable job of matching my 13-inch MacBook Pro’s display in these areas. According to LG’s documentation for the UltraFine 5K Display, there’s also an ambient light sensor included on the top bezel, next to the camera. Sadly, the current version of macOS that I’m using — 10.12.2 — doesn’t feature an “Automatically adjust brightness” setting in the panel’s Display section of System Preferences. Here’s hoping that we will see automatic brightness support implemented in a future release. Speakers Like with most displays, the built-in speakers aren’t suitable replacements for dedicated speakers, however the sound quality is better than you might expect from a pair of down-firing stereo speakers. The speakers are located underneath the bottom bezel and feature a clean-looking four port design. The biggest deficiency when it comes to sound quality on the LG UltraFine is on the low end, but the mids also suffer from muffled sound. The speakers are good enough to get you by in a pinch, but you’ll definitely want to use headphones or a standalone speaker system if sound quality is of any concern. Build quality and design The monitor comes out of the box with its base connected, which means that there are no tools that you’ll need to use. It’s ready to be connected to your MacBook Pro immediately after unboxing. The LG display is comprised primarily of black plastic, which is a stark departure from the aluminum featured on Apple’s now-discontinued Thunderbolt Display. It’s an understated design for the most part, although there is a small LG logo on the bottom bezel. The base of the stand is made out of metal, which lends it a solid foundation. However, everything else, from the stem to the display housing and bezel, is made out of dark plastic. The good news is that the build quality is a step above the typical display, and the plastic isn’t as brittle as the material used on some of the cheaper models you’ll encounter. That said, I found that the display is still somewhat prone to wobble, especially when the height is adjusted to higher levels. Granted, Apple’s Thunderbolt Display lacked height adjustment, but the LG Display is a noticeable step backward in the area of desktop stability. The display’s up and down pivot (up to 4.3-inches) is relatively smooth, but still a far cry from what I’d like to imagine that Apple would have produced if designed in-house at Cupertino. It also features positive and negative tilt to position the screen at an ideal angle. The angle adjustments aren’t as smooth as they were on the Thunderbolt Display, which isn’t exactly surprising, but it’s still several notches above the typical cheap monitor. Although you can’t orient the display vertically like you can with some monitors, you can adjust the horizontal level of the monitor head slightly. This is a feature that’s only to be used when the unit is resting on a slightly uneven surface. The UltraFine display doesn’t sport any physical buttons or joysticks, which means all adjustments are performed via macOS. There’s not even a power button to power the display on or off. When you connect a Thunderbolt 3 cable, the display comes on, and when you disconnect the cable, the display turns off. Putting the MacBook Pro to sleep immediately puts the LG display to sleep as well. Think of it as a true extension to your MacBook Pro, and not so much a separate peripheral. Accessories The LG UltraFine 5K Display comes with a power cable, a lengthy 6-foot+ long Thunderbolt 3 cable, and a VESA cover. The display’s stand can be detached via the switch on the rear, which allows users to mount the stand on a VESA arm using the provided VESA cover. And since the display features an integrated power supply, there’s no power brick to fool with, which helps promote a clean setup. A lack of ports Unfortunately, the display is quite anemic when it comes to additional ports, and this is where it fails to live up to the comparatively generous Thunderbolt Display. Outside of the one Thunderbolt port, which is used to connect your 2016 MacBook Pro, LG only provides three downstream USB-C ports, and these ports are USB 3.1 (gen 1) only, which means a maximum bandwidth of 5Gbps. That’s right, there are no USB-A ports, no SD Card slot, and the USB-C ports are glorified USB 3.0 ports. The port situation is somewhat disappointing. The most obvious reason is that the new MacBook Pro itself is lacking in ports, so it would have been nice to have the UltraFine Display help pick up the slack. But not only that, the ports that are there are slow by today’s standards. Since DisplayPort 1.2, which is bundled with Thunderbolt 3, only supports a maximum resolution of 4K at 60Hz, LG and Apple had to work around this limitation. It’s similar to how Apple had to use its own custom timing controller for its 5K iMac, but exact details have yet to be revealed as to what LG had to do to make this display a reality. From what I can gather, it looks like the monitor is using two streams and stitching them together to make one 5K image. This becomes apparent when closing the lid on the MacBook Pro, and the monitor briefly flickers and shows the two separate images. The lack of an extra Thunderbolt 3 port means that daisy-chaining other devices to this monitor is not a possibility. You’ll need to either put the LG display at the tail end of the chain, or connect to it with a separate Thunderbolt 3 cable. And what if you’re a 15-inch MacBook Pro owner wishing to drive dual 5K displays? You’ll need to use two Thunderbolt 3 cables coming from each side of the MacBook Pro to drive such a setup. Users with older Macs devoid of Thunderbolt 3 will still be able to connect to the display using a dongle, albeit at a lower resolution. Windows users are in a similar boat; the display works, but not at 5K. Integration is key The display may be lacking in ports, but you do get some built-in amenities that might otherwise require added peripherals. On the top bezel you’ll find a 1080p USB camera (with indicator light), and a USB microphone, which makes the display adequate for handling FaceTime calls without any additional equipment. Although the inclusion of a the camera and other equipment increases the size of the upper bezel slightly — cue the “fivehead” comments — it is a considerable plus to have a built-in camera and microphone to facilitate voice and video calls. Some people will loathe the unbalanced top-heavy look of the bezel, but it’s not something that bothered me much during actual usage. When connected to the LG UltraFine Display, users can adjust screen brightness directly from the macOS’ System Preferences. This means there’s no need to finagle with manual buttons or joysticks just to modify the display’s brightness or volume, for instance. I wish there was an easy-to-use Touch Bar shortcut for adjusting the brightness of the external display right from my MacBook Pro’s keyboard, but the Control+Brightness Up/Down shortcut seems to work okay in the meantime. Conclusion The LG UltraFine 5K Display is a solid offering, that’s a decent purchase at $974. Remember that you’re getting an excellent panel, and the only other standalone 5K display available for purchase is one from Dell that’s significantly pricier, older, and doesn’t use Thunderbolt 3. You won’t find the same design polish that you’d find on an Apple-branded monitor, but LG’s offering is generally better than the typical third-party monitor. The one-cable connection, and integration with FaceTime make it a good solution for new MacBook Pro owners who want something that just works. But some of you will probably be disappointed that the display lacks more port options, and the lack of any on-device buttons for brightness control is a little annoying until Apple provides a better software solution in macOS. LG also offers a 4K version of its UltraFine display as well. Both displays are on sale for a limited time at $524.00 and $974.00 respectively. The 4K version lacks support for Thunderbolt 3, but can still provide single cable connectivity via a USB-C cable. The 4K version also lacks the 10-bit panel, camera, and only provides 60W of power, which means that it won’t have enough power to charge a 15″ MacBook Pro at full speed. To add more insult to injury, the 4K model is only capable of supporting USB 2.0 speeds on its downstream USB ports, which means that you’ll only want to connect things like mice, keyboards, and other low-bandwidth accessories. Personally speaking, if I had to choose between these two displays and money weren’t an absolute deciding factor, I’d go with the 5K version, hands-down. LG’s UltraFine 5K display is currently available for order on Apple’s online store, but ship dates are still a few weeks out. The 4K variety is now available for purchase in some local Apple retail stores, but it’s backordered several weeks out online as well. Fortunately, Apple has extended its hefty discounts on both displays until March 31st, so you still have plenty of time to order one before the price goes back up.

Photo Credit: AP advertisement | advertise on newsday Continuing supply problems and relatively weak demand for the iPhone 7 will lead Apple to cut its production, the Nikkei Asian Review reported Friday. Citing data from Apple's suppliers, Nikkei estimated that production of Apple's flagship mobile device would decrease 10 percent in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period a year earlier. advertisement | advertise on newsday When Apple released its latest earnings report in October, CEO Tim Cook addressed the supply and demand issues, which he said were interrelated. The drop in demand was mostly a result of a shift in Chinese consumers' buying habits: people in China were quick to upgrade to the iPhone 6s, a surge that was much larger than the demand increase following the iPhone 5s, and not something that Apple was able to replicate with the iPhone 7. Why the drop in Chinese upgraders? Cook cited several factors, including a challenging foreign exchange rate environment that has resulted in manufacturing supply shortages. Indeed, Nikkei reported that a shortage of camera sensors has curbed Apple's ability to meet demand for the iPhone 7, which has two rear cameras in addition to the front shooter. A production cut signals that Apple isn't immune to the forces that have been shaping the broader smartphone market in 2016. Several analysts predicted that overall smartphone growth would slow this year, with Gartner speculating that the era of double-digit growth is over. TechnologyiPhone through the years But Strategy Analytics reported that smartphone makers around the world peddled 375.4 million units in the third quarter of 2016, up from 354.2 million units a year earlier. It was the industry's fastest growth rate for a year, and the firm expected a higher growth rate for the rest of 2016 than originally forecast. advertisement | advertise on newsday This article originally appeared on PCMag.com.    Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

People barely utter a line of Auld Lang Syne and tech pundits have already flooded the internet with Apple predictions for 2017. The iPhone 8 (or possibly 7s)! New iPads! Craig Federighi’s hair gaining sentience! Yet short of Tim Cook driving Apple off a cliff rather than continuing to make the money needed to produce an actual Apple car (that Maps will drive off a cliff), 2017 will undoubtedly see the usual revisions to Apple hardware and services. So rather than give you the same list as everyone else, we’re thinking about what we want from Apple in 2017 rather than just what we’ll probably get. 1) Release new desktop Macs A new MacBook Pro arrived in November, but the only other Mac updated in 2016 was the MacBook. Desktops? Nada. The most recent iMac revision happened in October 2015. The Mac Mini? 2014. The Mac Pro Phil Schiller got all excited about (“Can’t innovate any more, my ass!”)? No change for over 1000 days. In a recent memo to Apple staff, Tim Cook said “we have great desktops in our roadmap”. We’re glad to hear it. Refining a product line is one thing, but only having two Mac options is taking things a bit too far. 2) Don’t forget the little guys Bar capacity alterations, the iPad mini hasn’t been updated in over a year. We doubt it’ll get all the goodies found in the iPad Pros, but we hope 2017 will bring at least a processor bump, to ensure it’ll run all the latest apps. But the smaller Apple product we’re more concerned about is the iPhone SE. With the guts of a 6S in a 5S case, it brought a powerful small iPhone back to the line-up. It shouldn’t languish – although rather than an update, we’d sooner see Apple kill two birds with one stone by eradicating the bezel from the iPhone 8. Read more Apple iPhone SE review 3) Realise thin isn’t the only way Apple’s obsession with thin continues unabated. Rumour has it when Phil Schiller’s angry, he uses MacBooks like shuriken, embedding them into walls and the occasional intern. But, you know, our Apple kit’s thin enough now, thanks. We’d like Apple to think different. We’d happily choose extra battery life on the next iPhone or notebook rather than shaving a fraction of a millimetre from its form. And we don’t care if our iMac’s a bit flabby if we can still install extra RAM. 4) Give everyone a Touch Bar The jury’s still out on some aspects of the MacBook Pro Touch Bar – we doubt too many people will be using it to mix records, for example. But as a context-sensitive shortcuts bar and to bring Touch ID to the Mac, it’s great. A pity, then, you can’t get one for a desktop Mac – unless Apple somehow magics up its Magic Keyboard a bit more. With Touch Bar essentially being a tiny touchscreen device itself, we shudder at the cost of such an accessory, but, hey, Apple’s never shied away from expensive kit. You might also like MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review 5) Reenergise creatives Not everyone wants to make things, but artists, musicians and other creative types often inspire people. They formed the backbone of Apple’s comeback advertising campaign in the late 1990s, and also kept the Mac platform afloat during its darkest years. Increasingly, though, we hear of creatives – comic artists; web developers – heading elsewhere. Not a flood as yet, but more than a trickle. We’re hoping 2017 will find Apple cementing its appeal with such people, so the platform doesn’t end up with people merely aspiring to be a hipster in a coffee shop, tapping away on a notebook with a fruit logo on its lid. Why it matters Surface Studio is Microsoft's draw-on desktop for creatives 6) Get more telly on our telly We fired up our Apple TV on a US account and there was the new TV app, asking us to add all our channels. In the UK: nothing. In fact, in the year since the new Apple TV’s release, the UK’s only received a half-hearted BBC iPlayer app, and a port of NOW TV’s earlier one, which appears to have been abandoned. It’s no surprise Apple’s US-centric, but in 2017 we hope it’ll investigate what the hold-up is in bringing more British telly to the Apple TV. The lack of apps is bonkers, not least considering they’re all already on iOS (and thereby relatively trivial to port) and – more importantly – the rival (and significantly cheaper) Fire TV Stick. Read more New Amazon Fire TV Stick adds Alexa voice control to the mix 7) Make iOS go pro There’s sort of a tick-tock cycle to iOS, with the iPad getting major new features every other major update. On that basis, iOS 11 should receive some iPad-specific features – and we certainly hope so, because we need an iOS Pro. The current Home screen set-up looks ridiculous on a larger iPad. Split View was a great start, but the app picker remains atrocious, making it nightmarish to find apps if you’ve more than a handful installed. And why can’t we ask Siri to launch pairs of apps side by side to circumvent the fiddly Split View set-up entirely? You might also like Tech Resolutions #1: why I'm swapping my MacBook for an iPad Pro 8) Get more people buying apps Given the way the industry has gone coupled with people’s sense of entitlement, we’re not sure how Apple will be able to fix everyone wanting apps for free. But when we see great products like Status Board discontinued, the developer saying there’s “not a lot of overlap right now between ‘pro’ and ‘iOS’”, that’s a big concern. If Apple sees iPad as the future, it needs to double down on the present, normalising spending a decent chunk of change on quality productivity apps, and ensuring it prominently features them whenever possible. Read more The 24 best apps for your new Apple iPad Pro 9) Raise the iCloud limit Enough’s enough: that 5 GB iCloud limit has to go in 2017. Yes, we know Apple’s giddy about an uptick in its ’services’ bottom line, part of which is people paying for iCloud storage upgrades. But when this negatively impacts on user experience, there’s a problem. Right now, lots of people hit their limit and don’t back up. They even stop taking photos. Even more bafflingly, schools that use iPads can’t upgrade, meaning students run out of space – hardly surprising when armed with kit that shoots 4K video. At the very least, Apple should make the 50 GB tier free for schools. 10) Kill Lightning Yeah, we said it. And, yeah, we know it’d be painful to go through donglegeddon again. But connectivity across Apple products is an illogical mess. For a company that prizes simplicity and elegance, it’s ridiculous you can’t use iPhone headphones with your new MacBook Pro, or USB-C anything with your iPhone. On Macs, Apple’s betting heavily on USB-C, so let’s take iOS along for the ride. And although we know that will hit Apple in the bank account (Lightning being quite the earner), it’s the right thing to do for a company that professes to put the user experience above everything else.

Now we turn to the world of technology to see what trends have been developing in the technology sector over the past year. From an ever-widening scope of business activities being pursued by Silicon Valley’s largest firms to growing government authority over one sector of Internet services, there have been plenty of interesting stories playing out on the stage of America’s tech sector. Tech Giants Grow Their Footprint with Consumers, from Autonomous Vehicles to Grocery Delivery Remember the Standard Oil octopus? On September 7th, 1904, a drawing by political cartoonist Udo J. Keppler wa published in Puck, a humor magazine published between 1871 and 1918. The cartoon, titled “Next!”, depicted the Standard Oil conglomerate as a storage tank with tentacles that wrapped around the steel, shipping and copper industries and multiple government institutions, with one tentacle reaching towards the White House. It’s doubtful that we’ll see a return to U.S. antitrust law as a major legal development, but the comparison to early 20th century conglomerates might strike a parallel with the activities of Silicon Valley tech multinationals. Consider Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent holding company of Google and a host of other small to midsize tech developers. Coverage of Alphabet’s patent application filings has rendered insights into autonomous vehicle, wind turbine and satellite technologies developed within that corporation. Both Google and e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) made moves this year to expand online shopping services to fresh grocery delivery. Amazon itself has been making the transition from e-commerce platform to consumer electronics developer in recent years and has seen success with products like the Kindle, Alexa and the Amazon Echo. At the start of the year, it looked like many of the top tech firms were on pace to have record years in terms of patent grants earned. Through the first quarter of 2016, Samsung Electronics (KRX:005930) earned more than 2,000 U.S. patents and IBM (NYSE:IBM) earned nearly as many, both companies earning patents at a rate that would outstrip their 2015 totals. Increased patent filings among Silicon Valley’s Big 5 (Google, Amazon, Microsoft Corporation [NASDAQ:MSFT], Facebook Inc. [NASDAQ:FB], and Apple Inc. [NASDAQ:AAPL]) since 2009 highlight the increased investment these companies are making in building their patent portfolios. According to Innography’s patent analysis tools, Samsung has earned 9,701 U.S. patents through 2016, IBM has earned 8,008 U.S. patents, Microsoft earned 3,329 U.S. patents and Apple earned 2,712 U.S. patents; it should be noted that these totals include design patents which aren’t included in some annual U.S. patent tallies, like those provided by the Intellectual Property Owners Association. Cloud and cognitive computing platforms continue to be major focal areas for these tech firms. Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform earned an important industrial partner this July in the Predix industrial Internet service developed by General Electric (NYSE:GE). Microsoft’s acquisition of LinkedIn, announced this June, was the largest such corporate purchase in Microsoft’s history and instantly makes it a big player in the social media space. IBM has been putting a lot of focus into its Watson cognitive computing technology, a platform which began moving into the healthcare sector this year through collaboration with Bausch & Lomb on an app useful for performing better cataract surgeries. Virtual Reality Inches Closer to Becoming a Consumer Reality For decades now, the world of consumer technology has been breathlessly awaiting the advent of virtual reality (VR) technologies which can take a human user and immerse that person in a digital environment. At the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show there were several major tech firms exhibiting VR, from Google Cardboard’s open source VR platform to a Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) partnership on a VR platform powered by the Snapdragon 820 processor. Perhaps the first major foray for any tech developer into the VR consumer market has been made by Samsung, which released the Gear VR mobile headset developed in partnership with Facebook’s Oculus VR in November 2015. This May, Oculus announced that more than one million people used a Gear VR headset during the month of April to access some form of virtual reality content. Other virtual reality news coming from the tech sector this year supports the idea that some highly recognizable tech companies should be releasing VR platforms in the not-so-distant future. Microsoft, which has been working on the development of its HoloLens mixed reality platform, announced a new holoportation 3D capture technology implemented through the HoloLens to create social gathering spaces in VR environments. At Facebook’s recent F8 developer’s conference this past April, corporate executives unveiled a 10-year plan for the social media outlet which included new 3D video editing technologies for easier sharing of virtual reality experiences among Facebook friends. Also in April, we reported on a patent application filed by Apple for a VR headset which could integrate with a portable electronic device. Social Media Shows a Poor Ability to Deal With Major Platform Issues Even as more Americans join social media, it seems as though they just can’t stand what they’re seeing once they get there. The annual American Consumer Satisfaction Index released this June showed that customer satisfaction with social media dropped across the board with the biggest losers being Facebook, which dropped 9 percent, and Twitter Inc. (NYSE:TWTR), which lost 8 percent in the customer satisfaction index. Privacy concerns were cited as one of the major issues facing customer satisfaction with social media. And yet privacy is only one of a slew of issues rocking social media this year, especially Facebook. That particular social media firm has been dogged by many issues related to its Trending News section. In May, media outlets were reporting on an anti-conservative bias playing out at the company’s poorly managed editorial division, which some anonymous reports criticized as enabling censorship and for having a poor working environment. Facebook did the best it could to rid itself of human biases by eliminating human workers and instead employing a algorithm to spot trending articles, but by this September that too was derided for enabling the spread of fake news stories. As if promoting unsubstantiated news reports wasn’t bad enough, other news this year indicates that Facebook is used to conduct one-third of the world’s illicit weapons sales. For its part, Twitter was slammed earlier this year for its inability to prevent illicit drug sales through its own social media platform. Facebook, Twitter and others have also consented to a charge from the European Commission to rid their platforms of hate speech but that effort faces issues in the face of U.S. attitudes on free speech. FCC Increases Regulatory Control Over ISPs Amid Growing Dissent Another major story affecting the tech world this year was an increasing regulatory regime building at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the waning days of the Obama Administration. FCC wrested regulatory control over Internet service providers (ISPs) from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) back in 2015 through the agency’s Open Internet Order which reclassified ISPs as common carriers under U.S. telecommunications law. The net neutrality rules invoked by the FCC in its Open Internet Order were upheld this June in a court decision from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals (D.C. Cir.) which agreed with the FCC on the classification of ISPs as Title II common carriers. Emboldened by this new power over ISPs, the FCC has pushed a few measures during 2016 in order to further rein in ISPs. This March, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler released a draft of broadband privacy rules which sought to control how ISPs could use consumer data, especially where advertising was concerned. These privacy rules were the subject of a July hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation in which representatives of the FTC and the cable industry both raised dissents over the lack of consumer harm in triggering the new rulemaking. Despite these criticisms, the FCC passed broadband privacy rules this October which allows ISP customers to opt-out of data collection techniques used for advertising purposes. By the end of the year, however, a tidal change in opinions regarding the FCC’s oversight of ISPs seemed to at least begin. In February, the FCC’s board of commissioners also approved set-top box rules proposed by Wheeler which would require set-top box companies to provide information to competing app developers, giving them the ability to create apps for those set-top box platforms. But by September, one of the FCC commissioners voting in favor of the rules was wondering aloud as to whether the FCC had the authority to implement such rules. The FCC’s Title II common carrier classification could come into even further scrutiny with the planned merger of AT&T (NYSE:T) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX). The vertical merger puts Time Warner’s content development businesses under the same corporate umbrella as one of the country’s largest mobile services provider. If AT&T were to take content from HBO or other Time Warner entertainment divisions and provide it to their wireless consumers at a lower cost compared to other content providers, it could be considered a zero rating practice which runs afoul of FCC net neutrality rules.

China is where development of cutting edge VR technology takes place right now, not US (unless Trump fixes US patent system somehow so that small US startups can use it again – then we are back in business) I’m sitting on 2 provisional applications for VR tech and still can’t decide if I should file them or not – so badly I’ve been burned in the past Post a Comment Respectfully add to the discussion.

If you’re at all curious about whether or not your new iPhone can withstand machine gun fire or a free-fall drop from 1,000 feet in the air, rest assured that someone on YouTube has already filmed and uploaded such an experiment. Don't Miss: Google’s Pixel copied more than just the iPhone’s design That said, we can always appreciate when someone comes up with an original and fresh way to put the iPhone’s famed build quality to the test. And right before the new year, we stumbled across a video from the appropriately named YouTube channel TheBackyardScientist that shows us what happens when you drop a perfectly fine iPhone into molten aluminum. Right from the get-go, things take an interesting turn as the iPhone immediately bursts into flames. And while the iPhone is clearly toast, there is something curiously mesmerizing about this particular method of destruction.

Two groundbreaking pairs of cans were introduced by an unlikely suspect, but with each of them commanding a four-figure price, those breakthroughs might as well not have happened for most people. Apple catalyzed the move toward wireless technology with its omission of a headphone jack in the iPhone 7, while a bunch of smaller players launched terrific wired options that fit into most people’s budgets. So just as it starts to seem like headphones are reaching a peak of consistently high quality, the tech industry is flipping everything on its head and giving us reason to consider buying yet more stuff. Focal’s headphones set new standards for what we can expect at their price points Firstly, we have to talk about the Focal Elear and Utopia. Yes, one of them costs $999 and the other one costs $3,999 (does it matter which is which?) but what they lack in affordability they make up for in having absolutely superb sound quality. French company Focal is much better known for making speakers than headphones, but their debut at the high end of the latter category has been nothing short of triumphant. Both headphones set new standards for what we can expect at their price points. And the reason mere mortals should care is that, beside the exotic materials, Focal has developed a lot of technological knowhow with these cans that the company’s designers say will inform their more affordable products in the future. Even if you never buy a pair, these headphones are a great harbinger of what’s to come. The default expectation for premium headphones will be that they’re wireless Apple’s iPhone 7 headphone jack removal was leaked in January, so naturally tech media spent most of the year debating the reasons the company might have for removing a standard and universally used port. Adopting the Lightning port for audio has some technical advantages, but Apple’s eventual launch made it clear that the company just wanted to push wireless forward. Headphone makers have responded accordingly, with everyone doubling down on wireless models, from Bose’s QC35 to B&W’s P7 Wireless. The most significant effect of 2016 on this front is that it simply sets the stage for what is likely to be a transformative 2017. At some point in the next year, the default expectation for premium headphones will be that they’re wireless. Those that cost upwards of $200 and still retain a wire will have to justify their existence through better sound quality or some other advantage. At the very bottom of the headphone market, Chinese mobile manufacturers made positive noise this year with some very nice introductions. Xiaomi’s established Pistons line kept the $20 market full of good tunes, and OnePlus joined with its massively improved Bullets v2 at the same price point. Meizu’s EP51 showed up as an excellent $65 pair of wireless sports buds, and premium smartphones finally started bundling premium earphones by default, such as with the Nubia Z11. HTC’s audio-focused Android flagship for this year, the 10, also came with some high-quality buds in the box, and LG’s QuadBeats have been consistently good for years. The best all-around headphones launched in 2016, except for Focal’s unattainable duo, were Bang & Olufsen’s second-generation Beoplay H6. They strike the perfect balance between fun and faithful sound, and their design is as sophisticated as it is comfortable and lightweight. The only problem for the H6 going forward? Everyone shopping in their price bracket in 2017 will be hoping to ditch the wire. — Vlad Savov Verge 2016 Report Card: Headphones B 2016 Grade Gold Stars: Focal raised the bar for high-end headphones Sound quality advanced across all price ranges The neckbuds trend died a quiet death Apple’s W1 wireless chip is a real boon for simplifying Bluetooth pairing Needs Improvement: Outside of Apple, wireless connections are still a pain Gaming headsets remain mostly awful Phone makers that drop the headphone jack need to better explain why they’re doing it Streaming music For most music listeners, 2016 will be remembered as the year exclusive releases complicated all our lives. It will also be remembered as the year that access to streaming services became a necessity. At the beginning of the year, the only guaranteed exclusive release on the horizon was Drake’s Views, which was a part of the deal the musician signed with Apple Music in 2015. But most fans didn’t expect that the onslaught of exclusive content would become Apple Music’s primary tool for chasing down Spotify, or Tidal’s fight for continued existence. Following nearly every major album announcement in the past year, fans have had to find out if they will have access to the music through their current streaming service, or if they will need to pay and switch providers. Drake, Beyoncé, Chance The Rapper, Rihanna, Frank Ocean, Kanye West, Gucci Mane, The 1975, Future, YG, 2 Chainz, DJ Khaled, and many other artists released exclusive albums on either Apple Music or Tidal this year. For fans, exclusive releases became a burden Those deals worked out well for artists (they got paid), streaming services (who acquired more subscribers), and labels (the streaming services paid for marketing), but when it came to the fans, exclusive releases became a burden. Despite the inconvenience for consumers, exclusives did help bring in more users and increased engagement for streaming services. Apple Music reached 20 million subscribers a few weeks ago, after just 18 months in the market. Tidal topped 3 million subscribers, which isn’t much compared to Apple or Spotify, but far more than most expected the service to attract. SoundCloud, Amazon, and Pandora entered an already crowded field, each announcing on-demand services to compete with the incumbents. And Spotify crossed the 100 million user mark in June and topped 40 million paying subscribers in September, cementing its spot as the biggest streaming service in the world without even participating in the exclusives game. Exclusives also benefitted listeners in ways many didn’t expect. Garth Brooks, who has notoriously kept his music off streaming music platforms and iTunes for years, signed an exclusive deal with Amazon’s streaming service. Frank Ocean’s deal with Apple Music allowed him to release Blonde — after a very extended delay — independently, and reap the financial benefits. It also caused his old label Universal Music Group to ban exclusives — which could mark the beginning of the end for the music industry’s favorite trend, and allow listeners to stick with one streaming service going forward.. While 2016 may have been an inconvenient year for some music fans, right now it doesn’t seem like exclusives will be a permanent fixture in the music industry going forward. Yes, Drake’s relationship with Apple will continue and you can expect the next Beyoncé album to arrive on Tidal if it’s still around, but from all indications 2016 was the peak of exclusives. Now it’s time to settle in. — Micah Singleton Verge 2016 Report Card: Streaming music B- 2016 Grade Gold Stars: More services, more users, more competition Lower priced streaming offerings from Amazon and Pandora Needs Improvement: Less exclusives UI improvements still needed for Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal In this Storystream The Verge 2016 tech report card The Verge 2016 tech report cards: Virtual reality, TV, and apps The Verge 2016 tech report cards: Headphones and streaming music The Verge 2016 tech report cards: Cameras and gadgets View all 15 stories More From The Verge The Verge: 2016 Yearbook The best games for your new PC or Mac The 15 best movies of 2016 Behind the scenes at Faraday Future, an electric carmaker on the brink of collapse The Verge 2016 tech report card: Facebook The best apps you didn’t know you needed for your new Android phone Now Trending CES 2017: What to expect at the biggest tech trade show of the year Olympus E-M1 Mark II review: the camera that warps time Dell has turned one of the best Windows laptops into a 2-in-1 hybrid The Kissenger simulates kissing your long-distance lover Donald Trump says 'no computer is safe' This Article has a component height of 43.

Apple’s supply chain is equally optimistic about the so-called iPhone 8. Asian supply chain sources told Digitimes that suppliers expect to ship 60 million to 70 million iPhone 8 units in 2017. The device is said to have an all-new design, and feature a 5.8-inch AMOLED display. Image Source: YouTube iPhone 8 small volume production to begin in March Sources told the publication that Samsung Display would be the sole supplier of OLED panels for the iPhone 8. The Korean company would be able to supply up to 20 million display panels per month for Apple’s flagship device. Digitimes added that Nissha Printing could supply touch sensors, while TPK Holding would be responsible for bonding the touch sensors with OLED panels. Sources told the publication that small volume production of the iPhone 8 would kick off in March 2017. Production would be ramped up significantly in May and June, ahead of the phone’s official unveiling in September. It’s worth pointing out that Digitimes has a hit-or-miss track record when it comes to Apple product leaks. However, the publication has been mostly accurate in revealing which suppliers have landed contracts with Apple. iPhone 8 may account for 50-55% of new model shipments The 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will have a button-less, bezel-free design. The fingerprint sensor and home functionality would be incorporated in the display panel. Apple is said to launch two other handsets as well – iPhone 7S and 7S Plus – that will be iterative upgrades to the current 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. Though the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus will employ LCD panels, all three devices would feature wireless charging, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The 60-70 million units of the iPhone 8 that suppliers expect to ship in 2017 are in addition to the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus sales, said Digitimes. Ming-Chi Kuo believes that the OLED iPhone 8 will account for 50% to 55% of shipments of new models next year. The iPhone 7S and 7S Plus will retain the design of their predecessors. Wistron lands contract to assemble 2017 iPhones Chinese-language Economic Daily News reports that Wistron will also be assembling some of the future iPhones. Wistron has been responsible for the iPhone 5C and iPhone SE assembly in the past. It is unclear whether it will be assembling the iPhone 7S, 7S Plus or the high-end iPhone 8. The other two major assemblers are Foxconn and Pegatron. Wistron has hiked its investment in Kunshan, China to $200 million, about $65 million more than its previous budget, reports Apple Insider.

The family claims that Apple had the patent for a safer version of its "FaceTime" video calling app, but chose to make the less safe version available with the iPhone 6 -- ultimately leading to a car crash that resulted in the death of their five-year-old daughter Moriah Modisette, Courthouse News reported this week. The case dates back to 2014 when Moriah was travelling in the back of her parents' car near Dallas and was hit by another car driven by Garrett Willhelm who was using the Apple "FaceTime" while driving. The erring driver had confessed to the police that he was on "FaceTime" and police had also found that the app was still live when they arrived at the scene. Given the fact that the app fully engages visual components, the Modisette family blamed Apple for its failure to either programme a shutoff into the "FaceTime" or give strong warning about using the app while driving. "Defendant Apple has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisettes' injuries, specifically since at least December 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the US Patent Office for a 'driver handheld computing device lock-out," the family said in the complaint. The failure of Apple to use GPS tracking to detect the speed of the vehicle in which a user was travelling and shut down the "FaceTime" app was a significant factor in the accident, the family added. The grieving family has sought economic damages along with punitive damages.

Apple has seen a drop in sales of the iPhone over the last couple of years. The company had to reduce production of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus by about 30 percent last year to cope with the dip in sales. Now, a report from Nikkei has revealed that Apple could cut back up to 10 percent production of the new iPhones this time. Interestingly, Apple had already reduced the initial production orders of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus by 20 percent to avoid a similar situation to that of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. The slowing down of the global smartphone market is one of the reasons why Apple might need to reassess its orders. Parts suppliers from Japan are likely to be affected by the order cutback, as Apple is one of the biggest customers for many component manufacturers. However, they seem to be preparing for such situations by widening their focus to include other customers in addition to the iPhone-maker.

Surprising no one, Apple had a busy Christmas morning, and I'm not talking about Tim Cook giddily opening that new Lego Batman set he's been asking for. The Mac maker's activation servers were working overtime, as all those gifted iPhones and iPads were turned on for the first time. Flurry Analytics estimates that Apple grabbed an impressive 44 percent of mobile device activations from Dec. 19 to Dec. 25., more than double the 21 percent that Samsung grabbed over the same time frame. Huawei ranked No. 3 with 3 percent of activations, and LG's 2 percent earned it the No. 4 spot. This year Hanukkah and Christmas had an overlap, with Hanukkah starting on Dec. 24. Flurry's estimates cover the week leading up to Christmas as well as the first two nights of the Jewish holiday.  Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week The analytics specialist also notes that Huawei and LG were able to earn their respective spots through sheer volume. Both companies offer a plethora of different devices, including low-cost models, that collectively boosted each manufacturer's rankings. Neither Huawei nor LG had a specific model rank particularly highly. The Apple logo displayed on the back of an iPhone, London, August 3. Carl Court/Getty Images The (continued) rise of the phablet The ongoing trend toward large devices and phablets is only gaining momentum. You may recall all the pressure that was on Apple circa 2012-13 to come out with a bigger iPhone, to which Apple's initial response was to launch an entire marketing campaign about one-handed use. Related Stories Nokia Sues Apple for Patent Infringement Apple Boss Justifies Trip to Trump Towers to Employees Here's How Secret Projects at Apple Work 2014's push into phablet territory with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus not only created a massive upgrade cycle for Apple, but also validated and accelerated the shifting consumer preference.  Good news and bad news While Apple's activations are a good sign, they're slightly less than last year, when Apple grabbed 49% of device activations. And last year, Hanukkah was in early December and ended before Flurry's measurement period. Assuming that Apple indeed gets a Hanukkah boost, Apple fared slightly worse when you factor in the timing difference—5 whole percentage points lower for the year that included two days of Hanukkah. Here's the rub: Flurry's estimates only account for percentages, and say nothing of absolute volumes. While it's undoubtedly encouraging that Apple is still the top manufacturer by a healthy margin in terms of holiday device activations, the company's iPhone sales this quarter are very much in question right now. There have been plenty of reports that iPhone demand is waning and that the iPhone 7 cycle may not be as strong as in years past, which makes sense given Apple's seemingly peaking iPhone sales in fiscal 2016. Investors will know in less than a month, when Apple reports fiscal first-quarter earnings at the end of January.

Try switching browsers Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close According to Consumer Reports, there are battery-life issues with new MacBook Pro models. So what should people who've already bought (and maybe unwrapped) a MacBook Pro do? Try using a browser that isn't Apple's own Safari. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Consumer Reports has some bad news for anyone who bought a MacBook Pro this holiday season: it's not giving Apple's new MacBook Pro laptops its seal of approval for the first time ever. According to the Consumer Reports review, there are battery-life issues with the 13-inch MacBook without the new Touch Bar control strip, and the 13- and 15-inch models with the Touch Bar. They all threw up wildly inconsistent battery times in testing. On some trials, the laptops gave out battery life readings that exceeded Apple's own 10-hour estimate. But in other trials, the laptops had less than half of what Apple promises; in one case, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar ran for a paltry 3.45 hours. The average of the test totals seem to be in-line with Apple's 10-hour estimate, but that would be cold comfort to someone whose laptop dies on the first leg of a cross-country flight. So, the publication decided to rate the laptops using their shortest battery life times, which dragged down the computers' overall scores. But while the laptops "did very well in measures of display quality and performance," wrote Consumer Reports' Jerry Beilinson, that wasn't enough to outweigh the battery issues. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. So what should people who've already bought (and maybe unwrapped) a MacBook Pro do? There is a bright spot in the Consumer Reports article: try using a browser that isn't Apple's own Safari. When Consumer Reports testers ran their trials using Google's Chrome browser, they found that the laptops had "consistently high" battery life. Unfortunately for Apple, those Chrome tests don't count -- part of Consumer Reports' testing criteria is that it only uses the default browser to score devices. That would flip the conventional wisdom on browsers and Mac battery life; using Safari instead of Chrome is often recommended to improve your battery life. It's not clear why that has changed with these models. Switching browsers may help in the short-term, but doesn't explain why Consumer Reports found the laptop batteries so inconsistent in its official tests; it could hint at a larger underlying problem. Still, it may at least give Apple users who've already paid big money for these computers a way to avoid these battery life problems. Consumer Reports's review follows on the heels of some complaints by MacBook Pro users who have had issues with the battery life of Apple's newest laptops since they hit shelves in October. I haven't experienced battery life problems on the Touch Bar-less laptop Apple has provided for me, but 9 to 5 Mac, running a battery test trial on one Touch Bar model, found a battery life of 8 hours for the 13-inch model. Its reviewer also reported a 6-hour battery life for the 15-inch model. Apple responded -- sort of -- to user complaints by removing the part of the battery indicator that shows the "time remaining" in a laptop's charge, saying that those estimates can be inaccurate. But, it said, there was no issue with the computers' battery life in general. The company is also already running a small replacement program for short-lived batteries on some iPhones.

By Ross Rubin | December 31, 2016 -- 12:59 GMT (04:59 PST) | Topic: Apple It was certainly a year of ups and downs for Apple, which took steps to shore up many of its products outside the core iOS portable offerings. The Apple Watch got a new user interface, but the smartwatch category drags. Apple TV got a new content navigation app (but not an integrated Apple television service). The redesigned MacBook, of course, got a wee strip of touchy goodness. Even the EarPods evolved into a game-changing wireless successor. But while Apple delivered on its annual iPhone update, there wasn't much beyond a revised Home button with an odd click feel and dual cameras that have been cropping up elsewhere.

Make your digital strategy a success in 2017 Catastrophic botnet to smash social media networks Can more meta thinking free us from current malaise? Why businesses can't ignore the cloud market IT spending to rebound in 2017, led by software, services While nagging accusations of innovation slowdown have the company defending its pursuit of artificial intelligence and continuing to investigate "interesting areas" such as self-driving cars and augmented reality, here are some simple wins based largely on its competitive environment today. Revitalize the iPhone. Apple is more than an iPhone company. But when it comes to revenue contribution, no other product it offers even comes close. As we approach its 10th anniversary and smartphone penetration grows, competitive challenges to the iPhone have never been greater. Google itself is attacking from the high-end and midrange phones released from Chinese manufacturers look increasingly impressive. Rumors have swirled that the next-generation iPhone may have more efficient processors, have an even larger display (bucking mainstream screen downsizing) or used curved glass or plastic but, without further details, those would appear to just be following other companies' leads. However, after the apparent USB-C stopgap that was the Lightning connector, it would be nice to see Apple push wireless charging further mainstream. Expand Siri integration. In 2016, Apple took steps to turn some of its key apps into platforms of their own. iMessage was one natural choice for this given the year's focus on chatbots. But the one that likely has even greater potential is Siri, Apple's voice agent that in many ways started the AI obsession tsunami circling the company like its new campus. Today, only a handful of apps types can integrate into Siri, As with the iPhone hardware, though, Apple can expect growing competition here as Google steps up efforts with Google Assistant and Samsung begins to roll out its own agent based on its acquisition of Viv technology designed by Siri's creators. Unveil a home voice agent approach. I once joked that Apple's answer to Alexa and Google Home could consist of little more than a cannister placed over an iPhone. Beyond the addition of far-field microphones and less reliance on a screen, more thought would surely go into such a product. With Amazon announcing that it sold nine times as many Echo units as it did last holiday, the business case for a voice-driven home agent is being proven out even as questions remain about their utility. Even Google, which processes billions of voice commands every day via Android phones, sees the value of capturing different kinds of requests and commands within the home; there must be some value there for Apple as pumps up Siri and other AI efforts. For privacy and security, change these iOS...

 What to expect from Apple in 2017 Steve Kovach Dec. 31, 2016, 8:00 AM 20,744 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.AP 2016 was a bit of an off year for Apple. iPhone sales were down for the first time in the product's history. The iPhone 7 turned out to be a great phone, but Apple upset a lot of people by removing the headphone jack. The AirPods were delayed two months, meaning most people couldn't get them in time for the holidays. (You'll have to wait until February 2017 for them to arrive if you order them now.) And Consumer Reports torched the new MacBook Pro for its inconsistent battery life. So what does 2017 look like for Apple? Here's what I predict will dominate the conversation around Apple's products next year. It's not an all-inclusive list, but it's the stuff you'll likely care the most about. New iPads AP It feels like an eternity since Apple had anything to say about the iPad. We got the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro this past spring, but every other iPad model is one to three years old at this point.  The lineup is well overdue for a refresh, and it sounds like that may be coming soon. Rumors are all over the place, but it sounds like Apple is planning to release some new iPad models in the spring of 2017. Some reports say the new iPads will have slightly larger screens (10 inches, up from 9.7 inches), and that the non-Pro models will work with the Apple Pencil. Unfortunately, the early reports about the new crop of iPads are so consistent that it's tough to lock down exactly what Apple will end up launching. But it is pretty clear Apple's 2017 will start with the iPad. A greater emphasis on Siri Apple/YouTube Two of Apple's biggest rivals doubled down on voice assistants this year, leaving Siri in the dust. Google launched its excellent new Assistant on the Pixel phone and Google Home speaker. Assistant can tap into Google's vast library of internet knowledge to bring you the answers you want. Amazon continued to define the voice assistant category by expanding Alexa to new Echo devices like the Dot and Amazon Tap. Plus, third parties started integrating Alexa into their gadgets. (Expect to see so much more of that in 2017, by the way.) Despite its five-year head start on the competition, Siri still feels woefully behind. Apple added limited third-party support for Siri, but there are few signs it's really taking off.  What could we see from Siri in 2017? The good news for Apple is it's sitting on a lot of excellent AI and voice control technology, especially thanks to its purchase of a UK-based startup called VocalIQ. I wrote about VocalIQ way back in May. The technology would allow users to control all their Apple gadgets with just their voice, which will be useful in the home, car, and while using the AirPods. Here's what I reported at the time: Because VocalIQ understands context so well, it essentially eliminates the need to look at a screen for confirmation that it’s doing what you want it to do. That’s useful on the phone, but could be even better for other ambitious projects like the car or smart-speaker system Apple is reportedly building. (VocalIQ was being pitched as a voice-controlled AI platform for cars before Apple bought the company.) In fact, VocalIQ only considers itself a success when the user is able to complete a task without looking at a screen. Siri, Google Now, and Cortana often ask you to confirm tasks by tapping on the screen. 2017 would be a great time for Apple to start incorporating VocalIQ's technology into Siri, considering how far ahead the competition is today. Another dull year for the Mac Hollis Johnson/Business Insider The only thing of note to happen with the Mac this year was the launch of the new MacBook Pro. And even that was met with a lot of anger. Many were upset that they had to purchase a lot of adapters to get their accessories to work with the new Thunderbolt 3 port. And then everyone learned the MacBook Pro's battery life was nowhere near as good as Apple claimed. Bummer. It doesn't look like much more is in store for the Mac in 2017. The iMac could get a spec bump and the battery life on the MacBook Pro could (and should!) get fixed, but don't expect much else. Modest improvements to the Apple Watch Hollis Johnson Apple learned a major lesson with the Apple Watch, and has since scaled back expectations for the device and focused on health and fitness instead with the new Apple Watch Series 2. It's unlikely the Apple Watch will get a significant update in 2017, but I wouldn't be surprised if a new model showed up with 4G connectivity so you could use it without your iPhone. A major iPhone refresh A salesman checks a customer's iPhone at a mobile phone store in New Delhi, India, July 27, 2016.REUTERS/Adnan Abidi 2017 will mark the iPhone's tenth anniversary, and it sounds like Apple is gearing up for a blowout. The next iPhone is said to be a major refresh with an all-glass design, no bezels around the screen, and possibly a version with a curved display. Not to mention wireless charging, the death of the home button, and a new screen technology called OLED, which provides deeper, richer colors. By now there are so many reputable reports backing up these claims that it's silly not to believe them. The iPhone is Apple's most important and profitable product. If it feels like the company has shifted focus from other categories to focus on the iPhone, it's easy to see why. It's the product you're going to care the most about and spend the most money on. Expect to start seeing the first design leaks early in 2017. Rebound? After a year full of various stumbles, Apple is exiting 2016 on shakier ground than it started. Besides the next iPhone, there doesn't seem to be too much coming in the pipeline to get super excited about. The big challenge for Apple in 2017 will be to unlock more potential from its products by continuing to improve where it's always been the weakest: AI, software, and other digital services.

On most models, you can choose whether you want to be notified about calls, texts and calendar events. On the Blaze, shown here, you can also link your email account, as well as some messaging programs such as WhatsApp. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers were a popular gift this holiday season. But, once you open up the box, it can be hard to know what to look for outside of the basic setup. That's why we're here to help. For these tips, we're focusing on instructions for the Apple Watch and for Fitbit devices -- the two most popular wearables makers in the United States -- although the suggestions fit most types of wearables. Here are three things to think about as you set up your shiny new wearable device. • Pick a side. I realize this sounds pretty basic, but choosing a wrist can be important for fitness trackers such as Fitbit because your dominant hand tends to move a lot more throughout the day than your non-dominant hand. That, in turn, can affect the way trackers actually log your movement. On Fitbit, for example, you can tell it if you're wearing the device on your more active hand or not in the app that links with your new tracker. On the Apple Watch, during setup you can tell it which wrist you want to wear it on (right or left) and which side you want the digital crown -- Apple's little controller wheel -- to face. That should take care of everyone's preferences for watch orientation. If you want to change this for any reason, you can do so through the Watch app on your phone -- just hit "My Watch" and then go to "General" settings. "Watch Orientation" should be an option for you. • To share or not to share? Many of the features in smartwatches and other wearables have a lot of sharing functions -- so you can share your fitness progress throughout the day, or compete with friends. For some people, this is part of the point of getting a wearable. But, for others, it may be a tracking step too far. So, it's time to get cozy with your privacy settings. For Fitbit users, you can find your privacy settings by heading to your web-based dashboard, and diving into the settings menu. From there, you can control who can see your daily step counts, photos, location and other things that Fitbit tracks. By default, some things -- sleep patterns, your age, your weight, photos -- can only be viewed by you, but some things are also viewable by everyone, such as your average daily step count. Adjust as you see fit. On the Apple Watch, you can also share your activity for the day, but that is not set up by default. Where privacy can get tricky with the Apple Watch is in displaying notifications on your wrist. If you don't want anyone who glances at your wrist to be able to read the start of your text messages, there is a setting that will let you limit what is shown on the watch face. Head to the Watch app on your phone and hit the "Notifications" menu. If you switch on "Notifications Privacy," you'll have to tap to see messages and other notification details. It can be a little less convenient, but it could also save you some embarrassment in a meeting. • Mind your notifications. One thing that can quickly kill the joy of a wearable device is getting too many notifications. It's great to see who's calling or texting, but it can be pretty annoying to be expecting a message and then get a tap on the wrist to let you know that an article about a celebrity you don't know is trending on Twitter. For the Apple Watch, you can set the watch to mirror all your phone's notifications, but that can become overwhelming quickly. A better approach is to head into the Watch app and find your "Notifications" section. Scroll down through all the apps to choose what you want to see on your wrist and what you don't. Keep in mind that you may have to head back here as you install new apps, to set those notifications as you like them as well. On Fitbit devices, notifications vary by the type of device you own, but can be controlled through the Fitbit app by heading to the "Account" section and then tapping on "Notifications." On most models, you can choose whether you want to be notified about calls, texts and calendar events. On the Blaze, one of Fitbit's more advanced models, you can also link your email account, as well as some messaging programs such as WhatsApp. For all models, keep in mind that to receive notifications on your wrist, you will also have to turn them on for your phone.

A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Goose Island’s Sofie might look like a bottle of bubbly, but don’t let it fool you. It’s a sparkling Belgian-style farmhouse ale that packs a flavorful punch. Aged in wine barrels, it features zesty citrus and spicy peppery notes, but finishes off with a creamy, vanilla finish.  Goose Island Fullscreen Zevia Sparkling Apple is a solid alternative for those looking to avoid alcohol. With notes of red and green apples, it’s the perfect crisp, refreshing cider to sip on all night long.  Jenn Rice Fullscreen Thanks to Wines of Chile, you can expand your vino vocabulary and try something new such as this Cono Sur Sparkling Brut. Hints of fruit, honey and white flowers make an appearance, so it's a top option to toast with on New Year’s Eve.  Jenn Rice Fullscreen Torn between beer and bubbly to ring in the new year? Stella Artois Cidre is a well-balanced, crispy and great option. Enjoy it straight out of the bottle or sip it like Champagne out of a proper wine glass.  Jenn Rice Fullscreen At Egg Shop in New York City, executive chef Nick Korbee is constantly looking for bubbly options to pair with brunch and dinner. His current favorite? Sustainably made Da Mar Prosecco. “Eggs and bubbly always make for a fantastic pairing, but you don’t always have to splurge on Champagne,” he says. “The effervescence and acid on the Da Mar complement our savory, flavorful egg dishes perfectly, and the bottle won’t break the bank.”  Egg Shop Fullscreen Cult cider producer Andy Brennan, of Aaron Burr Cidery in Wurstboro, N.Y., is making cider using the Champagne method -- and yes, you guessed it, the cider actually drinks like a fine glass of bubbly. While it’s hard to get ahold of due to popular demand, stop by The North Branch Inn’s bar in the Catskills for a taste of Callicoon Creeks cider (or whatever version they have on hand at the time).  Jenn Rice Fullscreen Just in time for the holidays, SIMI Winery released its first two sparkling wines since 1940. SIMI 1876 Brut features a crisp, refreshing flavor profile of apple, citrus and almond pastry -- making it a great bubbly option to pair alongside soft cheese spreads and oysters.  Jenn Rice Fullscreen For rosé fanatics, SIMI’s 1876 Brut Rosé entices the taste buds with sweet and savory notes of pie crust, candied cherry, apple and fig.  Jenn Rice Fullscreen Crafted with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Blanc grapes, Le Marchesine Franciacorta Rosè Brut Millesimato is an Italian sparkling option you’ll want to stock up on year-round. It’s the perfect rosy hue that’s not too dry and not too sweet and gives off subtle aromas of flowers and raspberries.  Jenn Rice Fullscreen The White Knight Prosecco D.O.C. is a “fresh and flirty” option that will definitely please the palate. With delicate aromas of melon, pear, white peach and green apple, what’s not to like?  Jenn Rice Fullscreen Another amazing option discovered via Wines of Chile is Valdivieso Brut Rosé. As one of Chile’s most prized and celebrated wineries, this crisp, dry and slightly sweet rosé is a bottle everyone will enjoy.  Jenn Rice Fullscreen Crafted from Chardonnay, Glera and Malbec grape varieties, Santa Margherita Sparkling Rose is a rosy pink crowd pleaser. Its nose of white fruits and berries makes it a sparkling option that you can drink (responsibly) all night long.  Santa Margherita Fullscreen Brotherhood Winery in Washingtonville, N.Y., touted as "America's oldest winery," offers a delicious Blanc de Blancs Sparkling Wine that will please any Chardonnay aficionado, as it's crafted from 100% New York Chardonnay.  Brotherhood Winery Fullscreen If you’re looking for a non-wine option, look no further than Awestruck Lavender Hops -- a unique hard cider crafted in Sidney, N.Y. It’s the perfect marriage of citrus and floral and is a fun, purple-hued, fizzy beverage that beer and wine drinkers will appreciate.  Awestruck Fullscreen Hillersden’s Sparkling Sauvignon Blanc caters to both Sauvignon Blanc and Champagne drinkers thanks to its bubbly, crisp and refreshing profile. The winery makes the first single vineyard wine in Marlborough Valley, New Zealand.  Hillersden Fullscreen In Brooklyn, Smith & Vine can’t keep Lini 910 Labrusca Lambrusco Rosé in stock. The medium bodied, fruit-forward Italian sparkling wine pairs well with everything from cheese and charcuterie to bruschetta.  Smith & Vine Fullscreen One of Mumm Napa’s most sought after wines, Cuvée M Red is a sparkling blend made from Pinot Noir and Syrah that will entice the crowds. Its complex bouquet features cassis, elderberries, red plums, cardamom and tobacco.  Mumm Napa Fullscreen Like this topic?

Here are the rumored iPhone and iPad features iOS 10.3 beta already? Here are the rumored iPhone and iPad features By Matt Swider Mobile phones   iOS 10.3 leak points to mysterious 'Theatre mode' Shares Apple is readying the iOS 10.3 beta update for January, according to a new leak that allegedly spills the beans on the new iPhone and iPad features. The big highlight to Apple's next major software update is dubbed 'Theatre mode,' according to notable leaker Sonny Dickson on Twitter. While Dickson doesn't go into much detail about the new mode, he does reveal that it includes a new popcorn-shaped Control Center icon. That leads us to believe it's either a 'dark mode' for optimal video viewing (Apple did just launch a bright white TV app), or a new way to silence your phone when taking it into the movies. The iOS 10.3 launch timing checks out The iOS 10.3 beta release date, said to be January 10, comes on the heels of this month's final iOS 10.2 software launch. But the timing isn't surprising for anyone keeping track. Last year, the iOS 9.3 beta arrived in January, too, and it debuted the popular Night Shift mode in successive beta updates. We could be (and hopefully are) in for another mid-cycle game changer with 'Theater Mode,' should it be just as valuable as Night Shift in the end. Even more exciting is the prospect that the final iOS 10.3 update could be timed to launch with a new iPad in March or April, just like the final iOS 9.3 update did with the iPad Pro 9.7.  Anyone up for an iPad Pro 2 running iOS 10.3?

As with any Apple device, we expect a long list of rumours to surface before we see the actual device. However, this latest by DigiTimes might confirm the biggest change to come to the iPhone lineup. Is Apple working on a curved screen iPhone 8? This latest news suggest that Apple may release a massive new iPhone next year that would feature a 5.8 inch OLED panel. An iphone 8 concept. Photo courtesy: Veniamin Geskin “Apple will launch 4.7-, 5.5- and 5.8-inch new iPhone models in second-half 2017, with TFT-LCD panels to be used in the former two models and AMOLED for the 5.8-inch one…Global shipments of the AMOLED iPhone in 2017 are estimated at 60-70 million units,” the publication notes, citing its source. The rumour further claims Samsung to be the exclusive supplier of OLED panels used in the enlarged iPhone shipping up to 20 million panels a month. An iphone 8 concept. Photo courtesy: Veniamin Geskin This also falls in line with earlier rumours that suggested the Cupertino giant might move to new OLED display panels from the outdated TFT-LCD screens and would abandon the physical home button in favour of an edge to edge display. An OLED panel also opens the possibility of a curved display for Apple as it tries to rival South Korean behemoth Samsung. Apple might be working on a new ‘Jet White’ iPhone 7 The large screen also opens up the phablet segment to Apple as it battles falling sales. Furthermore, 60 to 70 million units also suggest that the tech giant is aiming for high numbers with its new smartphone. That being said, we can expect a lot to change as Apple typically finalises its smartphone designs six months prior to their release in September. However, we do expect Apple completely revamp its new smartphone design as it tries to gain lost ground to other manufacturers.

Texas does not have any law preventing motorists from using their smartphones while driving in its highways.  ( Mario Tama | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple has just been slapped with a lawsuit that alleges its FaceTime application caused a fatal crash that happened in Texas last 2014. The case, which has been filed before the Santa Clara County Superior Court in California last Dec. 23, cited that the company has failed to implement a critical feature that it already has patented. Complaint Based On Apple Patent James and Bethany Modisette, the complainants, allege that such a feature could have prevented the accident from taking place. The incident claimed the life of their daughter and caused serious injuries to several members of the family. The identified technology involves the patent that Apple submitted in December 2008, which has the capability to lock FaceTime when its user is driving a motor vehicle. It was approved in April 2014, eight months before the accident. Texas Car Crash The Modisettes' case arises from the incident that transpired on Christmas Eve of 2014. The couple and their two children, Isabella and Moriah, were on board a vehicle traversing the Interstate I-35 in the outskirts of Dallas. Another car slammed into it and critically injured James and Moriah. Both were rushed to a nearby hospital, but the young girl eventually died due to her injuries. She was only 5 years old when the incident happened. FaceTime And Apple's Purported Liability According to the driver of the motor vehicle that collided with the Modisettes, he was distracted by FaceTime, which was still open on his iPhone 6 Plus when first responders arrived at the scene. "Defendant Apple Inc. has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisettes' injuries, specifically since at least Dec. 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the U.S. Patent Office for a 'driver handheld computing device lock-out," the complaint against Apple stated. The complainants further claimed that Apple's responsibility rests on its failure to manufacture and sell the iPhone 6 Plus with the safety feature that is already available to it. It also pointed out that the company was not able to warn its consumers about the danger posed by its devices and applications when used or misused. Defective Product For these reasons, the Modisette family accuses Apple of letting a device it considers to be defective roll out of its facilities. The complainants further stressed that the action and the liability of the driver who caused the crash is inextricably intertwined with Apple and its culpability. The Modisettes also noted how Apple already has the technology for years and the patent granted to it that guarantees the company can exploit the feature without competition for 20 years. Apple is yet to issue an official statement about the case. The company, however, has already encountered disputes concerning another FaceTime patent, as well as its other technologies in the past. The company is also constantly refining the application due to emergent threats and vulnerabilities. TAG Apple, FaceTime, iPhone 6 Plus, U.S. Patent Office © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

By Emily Bary Dec. 30, 2016 2:07 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large A report on Friday suggested that Apple was cutting 10% of its iPhone 7 production, based on calculations from suppliers. Illustration: Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook called the company’s AirPods earphones “a runaway success” this week and noted that the Apple can’t make them fast enough to keep up with demand. That doesn’t appear to be the case with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The company is reportedly cutting iPhone production by approximately 10%, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. That’s based on calculations from suppliers. Apple ended up trimming production around this time last year, too, the Nikkei Review says. That’s because of an inventory pile-up after the iPhone 6 and 6s didn’t sell as well as planned. The article notes that the smartphone company tried to learn from those mistakes by cutting production of the 7 and 7 Plus by 20% at the outset, but the phones still haven’t been flying off shelves. That could be because the new phones don’t have many features that you couldn’t also find on prior models, so people aren’t inclined to upgrade. And while the 7 Plus has a fancy new camera, the Nikkei Review mentions that Apple is having trouble getting enough camera sensors for its bigger iPhone model. These are some worrisome trends, but Apple doesn’t need to rely on new phone sales as much as it did in the past. The company’s “services” business, made up of things like the App Store and iCloud Storage, is growing quickly. As long as people are still buying music and movies from the iTunes Store and Apple Music, it might not matter too much what kind of phone they use. Meanwhile, the entire production issue could be moot given that 2017, when Apple celebrates the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, has a major launch in store -- the iPhone 8. Apple shares were down 0.8% in Friday trading, to $115.78. For 2016, the stock has returned 12.5%, including dividends, exactly on par with the S&P 500. Big Picture: Apple appears to be cutting production of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. That implies that the phones haven’t been selling as well as the company had predicted.

It would have customisable watch faces, work with iPhone and Android smartphones, a long battery life, and would be cheap. Despite not being first to market, Pebble appeared to have the right mix of features at the right time to get people excited about the concept. By the end of its first Kickstarter campaign, the original Pebble watch had broken all financing records and shattered its goal – raising over $10 million. It proved there was a demand for this kind of wearable technology. The rise Suddenly, everyone was on the bandwagon. Pebble and Sony were joined by Samsung, LG, and Motorola in the smartwatch market. Apple was also rumoured to be working on its iWatch at the time. Huawei launched a watch, Garmin launched a range of activity-tracker smartwatches, and luxury brands started delivering their versions of a connected timepiece. In April 2015, Apple finally entered the fray with its Apple Watch. Despite the increased competition, Pebble wasn’t a one-hit wonder. On 24 February 2015, it launched a new Kickstarter for two new watches: the Pebble Time and Pebble Time Steel. It smashed its previous Kickstarter record and passed a new record set by the Coolest Cooler, raising over $20 million. Even its last-ditch effort in 2016 to raise the money it needed to stay afloat and launch the Pebble 2, Pebble Time 2, and Pebble Core did well by Kickstarter standards, raising almost $13 million. The Fall Although the Kickstarter campaign for the Pebble Time was a success, the company was burning through cash. It raised a further $26 million in debt and venture capital, but it wasn’t enough to keep all its employees. In March 2016, Pebble announced it would retrench 25% of its workers – 40 staff. Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky said venture capital money in Silicon Valley had become tight, which is why they initiated layoffs. “We want to be careful. Pebble is in this for the long haul. We have a vision where wearables will take us in five to 10 years, and this is setting us up for success,” said Migicovsky. Pebble planned to focus on health and fitness features and was set to sell devices in India through a partnership with Amazon. Before the money problems, Citizen reportedly offered to buy Pebble for $740 million, an industry source told Engadget. The source said even after the poor performance of the Pebble Time Round, Intel also offered to acquire it for $70 million. However, Pebble would have to suspend the launch of the Pebble 2, Pebble Time 2, and Pebble Core Kickstarter campaign. Pebble declined. Sold for parts What followed was Pebble being sold for parts. Fitbit recently bought Pebble for under $40 million, which was reportedly not enough to cover its debts. Pebble’s assets, including product inventory and server equipment, would be sold separately. No more Pebble devices will be manufactured. Devices already sold will continue to function, but will not be covered by a warranty. Pebble also warned customers that although its user experience will continue with Fitbit, the functionality of its smartwatches may be reduced in future. The end of Pebble is not the end of the smartwatch, but it does come at a tough time for the wearable business.

Five important technological breakthroughs in 2016 Tech giants' new success mantra: Develop in India for the world Inter-state council a forum to address people's concerns: Modi The year 2016 has been a packed year when it comes to technology, with some of the biggest trends emerging out of India. From a $20 billion investment on setting up a 4G network to Aadhaar now becoming part of the “billion club” that only companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft have been members of. Here are the top 10 technology trends for the year gone by: A Billion Aadhaar In April this year the number of people registered by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) crossed one billion, marking a significant milestone for the country’s digital identity programme. The Aadhaar programme became the first government-funded programme in the world to ever have over a billion users. The only comparisons one can draw are to global technology companies such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft which have over a billion users for their products. The service is today powering schemes such as the Direct Benefit Transfer and going forward, will be used to power the India Stack, a group of digital services that will enable payments, authentication, storage of important documents, enable easier disbursal of loans and even make it easier for the common man to invest in capital markets. Year of Make in India for phones While Make in India has been one of the most popular agendas of the Modi government, the scheme really came into its own in 2016. India saw 35 new smartphone factories being setup with capacity for local production jumping fivefold over the previous year. The growth in manufacturing phones in India has given employment to an additional 37,000 people, with the aim of growing the sectors employment to 50 lakh people by 2020 when production hits 500 million devices. While today the smartphone manufacturing sector in India largely just assembles phones, in the upcoming years there are plans to being component manufacturing here as well which. This will not only require additional skills as a country but also better infrastructure, but will be worthwhile considering the bulk of smartphone demand in the future will be driven by Indian consumers. Google becomes a hardware maker So far Google has been known for making some of the slickest software in the world, with over seven of its products having over a billion users. While the company has dabbled with the idea of making its own hardware for a few years now, nothing really said “Google has arrived” in hardware as much as its Pixel phones. Launched in October this year, the Pixel smartphones from Google is what the company imagines the best hardware to run its Android software and apps is. While the Nexus devices were sort of that, Google now has full control over its own premium hardware. The Pixel phones are directly pitted against the Apple iPhone, with many calling it the iPhones biggest competitor in the years to come. In India, analysts estimate that the Pixel has captured 10 per cent of the premium smartphone market (Rs 35,000 and above) in the country. Reusable rockets Elon Musk’s space venture SpaceX, achieved one of its greatest feats in the quest for affordable space travel in 2016 -- it landed a rocket used to propel a satellite into space back to earth safely. With it the era of reusable space vehicles was back, after NASA decommissioned the space shuttle. By reusing its Falcon 9 rocket (and other future rockets) SpaceX hopes to lower the cost of launching satellites or other items into space by as much as 30 per cent. This along with the already dwindling cost of launching items into space could really make “affordable” space travel a reality. Luxembourg-based satellite manufacturer SES has already signed a contract with SpaceX to launch using one of the company’s reused Falcon 9 rockets. At this stage everything is still an experiment, but with Musk’s push for commercialising test flights, the speed of development is extremely fast. Reliance Jio Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio has been heralded as one of the most revolutionary changes in India’s telecom sector, which will have a larger impact of putting the Digital India dream on the map. According to statistics, Jio users are consuming 40-50 times more data than the average 3G smartphone user, with the service adding 10 million new users every month. While growth is expected to level off in the months to come when the promotions run out, the fact that a large number of first-time users or low end users would have experienced the boon of high-speed net connectivity is enough to push them to pay more for 4G connectivity in the future, or at least that’s the idea. None of this came cheap though. Mukesh Ambani calls Jio the world’s biggest startup that spent between $17-20 billion on infrastructure and other things before even getting its first customer. With a base plan that’s equal to the average monthly Indian spend on mobile talktime and recharge (Rs 150) and higher plans of Rs 499 and Rs 999, it is to be seen how quickly Jio makes back its investment. Year of self-driving Every major car manufacturer and even technology companies such as Google, Apple and Uber are now very much in the race to build self-driving cars. The year 2016 was a milestone for self-driving cars not only because a lot of them finally got permission to begin testing on public roads, but also because the stance of some players such as Google and Uber became clear that they would sell self-driving as a service rather than build cars. While self-driving cars might have grabbed most of the headlines, it’s clear that the first form of autonomous vehicles on roads will be trucks. Otto, a subsidiary of Uber that builds self-driving trucks, made a 120 mile (193 km) run carrying 50,000 beers for Budweiser almost completely autonomously. Self-driving cars are still a way away, but more of the features are slowly trickling into cars, albeit high end ones, already. Tesla’s cars can now drive themselves on the highway, and while the company faced a setback when investigators began looking for malfunctions in its system that could have caused a fatal crash, just this month a video of a Model S swerving to avoid a collision before the crash had even occurred ahead of the vehicle began doing the rounds. Uber out of China On August 1, Uber traded its China business for a 20 per cent stake in rival Didi Chuxing, thus bringing an end to the pipe dream that western firms could successfully do business in China. Muscled out of China with rules favouring local competitors, Travis Kalanick fully turned his attention to winning India. While India was always a large blip on Uber’s radar, thanks to its underdeveloped and shoddy public transport systems and high-fare cabs. With big investments freeing up from China ($200 million a month) a big chunk of that has been diverted to winning in India, apart from an already substantial portion of a $3.5 billion fund raise being allotted to Uber India. Uber’s heavy handed tactics of buying itself into the first place has been objected by current Indian market leader Ola. The Indian firm has accused Uber of “capital dumping” - a term it explained as foreign companies using capital raised or earned abroad to create an uneven playing field in India. Ola, one of the most well-funded companies in Indian used its capital muscle to squeeze all its local rivals, and even bought and shut down its closest rival TaxiForSure. Drone deliveries Drones became a staple of technology terminology in 2015, with everyone from cinematographers to the average joe buying into the “drone culture”. The year 2016 was when some serious applications for drones in the civilian space began to emerge. Among the coolest uses for drones came from e-commerce giants such as Amazon that began testing drones for delivering items to a customer's doorstep. The company made its first commercial drone delivery in the UK, when it delivered popcorn and a Fire TV streaming device to a customer outside Oxford. In India, Amazon’s biggest competitor Flipkart too is dabbling with the idea of delivering products to customers using drones. The company told Business Standard it was working with a few universities that were developing drone technology to really explore their use in e-commerce logistics. Google WiFi at Indian train stations Google began rolling out its free Wi-Fi at Indian train stations in January, and by December had achieved a goal of connecting 100 stations. Going forward, the company plans to connect a total of 400 stations and reach 10 million people a day with its free Wi-Fi. For 2017, it is expected that Google will stick to the same pace, growing its base by a further 100 stations through the year. For the project that’s trying to promote people who’ve never used the Internet to buy into a data pack, that should be a commendable goal. ISRO goes private India’s space agency is looking more deeply at partnering with the private sector as it looks to speed up growth to tap into the massive growth seen in the global space market. While already tapping into private companies to build components for satellites and rockets, it has decided to grow that in the coming years. Not only did ISRO sign over the complete development of two satellites to a private consortium, it also has begun working on plans to setup a separate entity along with private players to build and launch its PSLV rockets for other private players and countries. ISRO is looking at a timeline of 2020 to setup the consortium of private partners, but has begun working on the framework for rules of engagement. The idea is to retain all strategic and social function launches thorough ISRO while commercial launches could be diverted to the private consortium giving the space agency more bandwidth to work on cutting edge research.

Among the coolest uses for drones came from e-commerce giants such as Amazon that began testing drones for delivering items to a customer's doorstep. The company made its first commercial drone delivery in the UK, when it delivered popcorn and a Fire TV streaming device to a customer outside Oxford. In India, Amazon’s biggest competitor Flipkart too is dabbling with the idea of delivering products to customers using drones. The company told Business Standard it was working with a few universities that were developing drone technology to really explore their use in e-commerce logistics. Google WiFi at Indian train stations Google began rolling out its free Wi-Fi at Indian train stations in January, and by December had achieved a goal of connecting 100 stations. Going forward, the company plans to connect a total of 400 stations and reach 10 million people a day with its free Wi-Fi. For 2017, it is expected that Google will stick to the same pace, growing its base by a further 100 stations through the year. For the project that’s trying to promote people who’ve never used the Internet to buy into a data pack, that should be a commendable goal. ISRO goes private India’s space agency is looking more deeply at partnering with the private sector as it looks to speed up growth to tap into the massive growth seen in the global space market. While already tapping into private companies to build components for satellites and rockets, it has decided to grow that in the coming years. Not only did ISRO sign over the complete development of two satellites to a private consortium, it also has begun working on plans to setup a separate entity along with private players to build and launch its PSLV rockets for other private players and countries. ISRO is looking at a timeline of 2020 to setup the consortium of private partners, but has begun working on the framework for rules of engagement. The idea is to retain all strategic and social function launches thorough ISRO while commercial launches could be diverted to the private consortium giving the space agency more bandwidth to work on cutting edge research.

The family claims that Apple had the patent for a safer version of its "FaceTime" video calling app, but chose to make the less safe version available with the iPhone 6 -- ultimately leading to a car crash that resulted in the death of their five-year-old daughter Moriah Modisette, Courthouse News reported this week. The case dates back to 2014 when Moriah was travelling in the back of her parents' car near Dallas and was hit by another car driven by Garrett Willhelm who was using the Apple "FaceTime" while driving. The erring driver had confessed to the police that he was on "FaceTime" and police had also found that the app was still live when they arrived at the scene. Given the fact that the app fully engages visual components, the Modisette family blamed Apple for its failure to either programme a shutoff into the "FaceTime" or give strong warning about using the app while driving. "Defendant Apple Inc. has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisettes' injuries, specifically since at least December 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the US Patent Office for a 'driver handheld computing device lock-out," the family said in the complaint. The failure of Apple to use GPS tracking to detect the speed of the vehicle in which a user was travelling and shut down the "FaceTime" app was a significant factor in the accident, the family added. The grieving family has sought economic damages along with punitive damages. --IANS qd/gb/bg (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Gadget Which phone has a better camera? iPhone 7 Plus vs Google Pixel XL: Check Out The Google Pixel is the first Android phone to use Google Assistant. But Siri continues to get better too. Google Assistant was better at answering questions about differences between competing technologies (e.g., OLED vs. LCD). By Rishabh Rajvanshi - Jan 1, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Few months have passed since the legendary phones of 2016, Apple iPhone 7 and Google Pixel XL, were launched in by the two tech giants. And several reviewers and tech geeks have shared their opinions on the Internet suggesting the which one is better option to choose. But still those who want to purchase a flagship smartphone are getting confused between the two as both of the companies have given their best efforts to make a unmatchable handset. So we have decided to offer a comparison between the camera performance of the two smartphones. Have a look: Google Pixel XL The Google Pixel XL smartphone is creating so much hype in the smartphone market, the smartphone is claimed by the company to boast best smartphone camera ever. Also, the reviewers are comparing its camera pairs with the professional DSLR camera. In addition, some people using the handset are fans of its performance. So clearing out readers that it is not a myth anymore that the smartphone comes with the best camera ever. Camera Specs With f/2.0 aperture and 1.55um pixels drawing in maximum light, the point and click experience seems promising. With a 12.3 megapixel rear and 8-megapixel front camera, all you budding photographers can click your best. Also, DXOMark gives the rear camera 89 points, the highest points ever for any smartphone. App Update The company really has been putting its efforts to offer best photography experience to its users. And for the same, Google has recently launched an update, after acknowledging the lens flare issues in its recently launched Pixel phones, Google is whispered to bring a software update for bug fixing in the mid-November. Bug Fixes After receiving so many complaints about the malfunction in the camera app, Google is gearing up to fix the issues with the minor update, which is expected to dispatch by the end of November. The lens flare issues are found in most of the Pixel devices, causing the drop in image quality when piercing directly at an intense light source. Google, soon after launching the Pixel smartphones on October 13, started receiving complaints from a number of users about the ‘Arc Flare’ aka ‘Halo effect’ on images clicking from the Pixel phones. Isaac, the admin of Google Pixel device in a blog said, “Users are going to have a refreshed software update in the next couple of weeks which is completely intended to will fix the camera lens issues of Pixel smartphones. Currently, the technical team of Google is working on some algorithms which will identify the Halo or ARC flare effects in the camera portion of the Pixel Phones. However, he mentioned that the users need to have HDR+ to grab the benefits of this new software update.” iPhone 7 Plus The recently launched Apple iPhone 7 Plus is touted as the best image snapping camera phone till date. The 12 MP wide-angle lens and 12 MP telephoto lens of the iPhone 7 Plus shooter enables the users to click DSLR-like photographs and videos. In addition, the image and video hosting website, Flickr reported that iPhone models occupy top 10 positions in the list of best camera phones, including iPhone 6, 5s, 6s, and rest. Following are the photography points that makes the iPhone 7 a good camera phone: Shoot with the Perfect Light To get the perfect light for a shot, the manufacturer suggests to tap and hold anywhere on the display of the phone in order to lock AE/AF and then gently slide up or down and play with the exposure depending on the situation of the user. Better Zoom If a user wants to take a better digital zoom of almost 10x, the iPhoneallows them to use the optical zoom with dual 12 MP camera and it will give the excellent shot even if the object, which is required to be captured, is far away from the user. Use 4K Video Using 4K video is extremely prescribed to shot the videos with improved optical image stabilisation and built-in f/1.8 aperture setting. This will not only enhance the video quality but also make it crisp, colourful and look brighter. Time-lapse Video The iPhone 7 also allows users to make much smoother time-lapse videos than ever before. Users are enabled with the device to shoot time-lapse videos and get a closer view of the object’s actions. Capture Photo Most of the times it happens that we would want to click a photo of a particular action along with recording it. Here’s the solution! The users are also allowed to snap an image while recording video through an iPhone 7 by just tapping on the white icon, next to the red record button. Landscape Mode is the Best – To get the best video recorded, capturing it in the landscape mode is highly recommended. Capture HD Video Everyone wants to capture HD photos and videos today. With the latest iPhone, users can now shoot HD quality videos by just adjusting the camera settings, enabling the Record Video at 60 FPS option, which will allow them to record videos to 1080p HD video. Focus the Photo If you need the focus of the photo to be at one point of the frame, the iPhone 7 also enables the users to simply lock the auto focus or auto exposure at the point of focus. Verdict Debates trending on Twitter like “Google shouldn’t try to be Apple” is a fallacy. Rather than suppressing its capabilities, Google played to its strengths. What do you want in a phone, solely depends on you and it influences your expectations and demands. The features available in Pixel, if are what you have been searching for, your prayers just got answered. Yes, the Google Pixel is a lot of money, but it is the real deal. It is a flagship product which commands flagship price. Fair enough. Apple and Samsung just got a run for their money. With the Pixel, Google keeps things nice and easy.

Inexpensive cable tidy tips and products to keep chargers under control By Simon Jary | 31 Dec 16 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Read our Inexpensive ways to tidy up your charger clutter and organize cable chaos, as we review neat solutions and the best cable and dongle cases and bags. In the supposed Age of Wireless our desks, TVs, living rooms and whole houses remain a viper’s nest of trailing, tangled, tense cables. Nowhere are these wires more massed than where you heap your device chargers for phone, tablet, camera, power banks, and even other chargers. There’s probably a knotty pair of old earbuds in there, too. In our house this is a drawer in the kitchen (pictured above) once reserved for handy items such as corkscrews (yes, things to take out actual real corks) and foil cutters, non-standard cutlery and cocktail sticks. What days they were. Now when said drawer is opened it’s like the scene in Raiders of the Lost Arc when Indy is thrown down into the Well Of Souls, writhing with snakes. Fighting through the knotty cables to the corkscrew requires a rolled up sleeve and several minutes of fighting through Lightning, Micro USB, Mini USB, 30-pin, and proprietary charging cables. Sometimes I even come across a FireWire 400 cable, which is then hastily pushed to the back of the drawer again. Manufacturers hardly help. Fitbit, for example, has a different charging cable for each and every one of its activity trackers. And all of them are non-standard and proprietary. Apple is consolidating on Lightning but owners of older iPhones or iPads still have to fish out a 30-pin charger every now and again. And don't mention the dongle hell of owners of the new MacBook Pro, which has USB-C slots that connect to nothing but dongle adapters so you can keep functioning– see Best USB-C cables and adapters. Mercifully many non-Apple products rely on the universal Micro USB cable, which means you can charge most devices with just a couple of these tucked away neatly. That said, we hate Micro USB for its non-reversible form that means you have to squint to see which way round it has to go. For brilliant solutions to fiddly Micro USB and other cable annoyances, read our round up of the best charging cables money can buy, and a couple we pick out for you below. So how do you tame this pit of charger cables? Less cables, less clutter First, reduce the numbers. Throw out any chargers or cables no longer attributed to anything useful in the house. That BlackBerry charger, for instance. Then ask yourself if you really need seven Micro USB cables? Two Lightning should be enough for most iPhone houses… and one 30-pin for the old iPad. Consign the others to landfill, or that bag of cables in the eaves of the loft that you dig through every five years when a neighbour pops round wondering if you have a power brick that would fit his old Sky DigiBox. Now invest in some charger cables that feature more than one charging end. This could halve the number of cables to tame. Content continues below Tylt has a neat charger cable called the Tylt Flyp-Duo Reversible, a 2-in-1 cable solution for charging and syncing data to smartphones and tablets. It’s equipped with both micro-USB and Apple Lightning connectors – great for Android or other Micro USB and Apple Lightning devices. Micro USB is on almost everything not made by Apple: battery cases, power banks, cameras, etc, so this is a great choice if you have at least one Apple device. What's also great about the Tylt is the main USB end is reversible, so you don't have to worry about which way it goes in – which saves a lot of fiddling. The tangle-free Flyp-Duo is available in four colours (black, blue, green and red) and lengths from 30cm to 1 metre. They cost about £11 from Amazon UK or US$24.99 on Amazon.com. We also love the Just Mobile Aluminium Cable Lightning Cable, with both Micro USB and Lightning connectors in a very handy coiled cable. It's £27 from Amazon UK or US$24.95 from Amazon.com. This may look expensive but it's small and super useful, plus fully approved by Apple. Or check out the MicFlip - a fully reversible Micro USB cable that you'll never have to growl at. For most purposes a short cable is fine and will reduce clutter. Even 1ft is too unwieldy for me. As long as it reaches from the wall socket to the surface I’m happy. You can find 4-inch and 6-inch Micro USB and Lightning cables on Amazon. Another neat way to kill cables is to move to the best Bluetooth headphones and best Bluetooth speakers, and free up desk space with a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse, although these require charging (usually via Micro USB) so you'll need those cables listed above. Reduce cable clutter: Lose the plugs, too Unless you’re charging straight from a computer you’ll need a plug adaptor for all those cables. You can but a plug with more than one USB port. The £7 Foxnovo Portable 5V/2A Dual USB Output UK-plug features two – bingo, one less plug required. I’ve also changed one of my power socket wall plates to include not just the two standard plug sockets but two USB slots too. I’d be wary of buying these off eBay or even Amazon, but reputable builders merchants such as Screwfix sell them for around £20. Read our USB wall plate review. We're also fans of compact wall chargers such as the Zendure A-Series 4-Port USB Charger (above), which features 4 USB ports and has different plug faces for travellers too. It costs £25 from Amazon UK or US$29.95 from Amazon.com. Read our Best USB desktop chargers round up for more space-saving charger recommendations. Reduce cable clutter: Pack cables away Now you’ve cut back on the number and length of your charger cables, you need to tame them. We tested a bunch of cheap cable tidy organisers, and here’s our favourites. The simple, zipped Damai Universal Cable Organiser is a case made of waterproof nylon that will fit easily in any drawer or cupboard, or just as simply in your backpack or suitcase when travelling. It features ten elastic loops to hold various cables, earbuds, and five mesh pockets for USB stick flash drives and so forth. As a bonus it comes with three reusable Velcro fastening cable ties, and zips up into a neat and tidy case you can slip out of sight. Available from Amazon for under £10, at the time of writing. The ButterFox Universal Cable Organizer is a smaller version that wraps up small, and so makes an even better travel companion. It uses a drawstring, rather than zip, to secure the wrap-up bag. Available from Amazon for about £8 including shipping, at the time of writing. ButterFox also sells the equally lightweight but larger Universal Electronics Accessories Travel Organiser, a zipped carry case with handle that’s more suitable for bulkier items such as laptop chargers and power bricks. It would make a good organiser for travel plug adapters, mice, power banks and other items as well as the usual charger cables. You can see through the mesh side, and there are two internal net pockets for accessories such as  memory cards, USB drives, etc. Available from Amazon for £8.99, at the time of writing.

(Image: Reuters) A family in the US who lost their young daughter in a car crash recently filed a lawsuit against Apple for allegedly encouraging distracted driving through "FaceTime" video calling app, media reported. The family claims that Apple had the patent for a safer version of its "FaceTime" video calling app, but chose to make the less safe version available with the iPhone 6 -- ultimately leading to a car crash that resulted in the death of their five-year-old daughter Moriah Modisette, Courthouse News reported this week.

The erring driver had confessed to the police that he was on "FaceTime" and police had also found that the app was still live when they arrived at the scene. Given the fact that the app fully engages visual components, the Modisette family blamed Apple for its failure to either programme a shutoff into the "FaceTime" or give strong warning about using the app while driving.

The failure of Apple to use GPS tracking to detect the speed of the vehicle in which a user was travelling and shut down the "FaceTime" app was a significant factor in the accident, the family added. The grieving family has sought economic damages along with punitive damages.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Apple to make iPhones in Bengaluru Local manufacturing is expected to help Apple price its phones more competitively in India as it currently attracts 12.5 percent additional duty on imports. Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 1 Comments Apple is all set to start manufacturing its iconic iPhones in India at Bengaluru, as part of efforts to cash in on the world's second largest smartphone market in a big way. Local manufacturing is expected to help Apple price its phones more competitively in India as it currently attracts 12.5 percent additional duty on imports. The phones would be manufactured by Wistron, a Taiwanese OEM maker for Apple, according to top government sources. "Wistron has plans for setting up iPhone manufacturing plant for domestic market in Peenya," top government sources familiar with the developments told PTI. Another senior government official said Bengaluru has the talent required for quality high technology products and that was the reason for selecting the city. The official added that Foxconn, which also manufactures iPhones for Apple, had come with similar plans to the city some time back. This would be Apple's second big project for Bengaluru. In May, Apple had announced setting up a design and development accelerator in the City to grow the iOS developer community. The announcement was made as part of the visit of Apple CEO Tim Cook to India. The Cupertino-based company has been in discussions with Indian government seeking incentives to set up a manufacturing unit in the country. A group of senior officials from ministries, including commerce and finance, will early next month deliberate on the incentives sought by Apple to set up a manufacturing unit in the country. Apple had asked for several tax and other incentives to enter India in the manufacturing sector. The company has been ramping up its efforts to expand its business in India, one of its fastest growing markets. Apple is also keen on setting up retail presence in India and has sought relaxation in local sourcing norms. Tags  Apple manufacturing iPhones Bengaluru smartphone market Tim Cook Buy, Hold, Sell ?

And what were the issues that kept us busiest? Sat 8:00 AM 13,466 Views 21 Comments Share5 Tweet Email 2016 WAS THE first year of TheJournal.ie‘s FactCheck – the Republic of Ireland’s first and only fully-dedicated fact-checking project. As we turn the corner into 2017, we’re going to take a minute to pause and reflect on what turned out to be a momentous 12 months for politics, journalism, and (as it happened) fact-checking, around the world. We’ll present a tally of verdicts for politicians, and look back on the issues that kept us busiest. Politicians and their verdicts Including our first article on 5 February, we’ve done a total of 89 fact checks, examining more than 160 separate factual claims, up to 16 December. By far our biggest source of inspiration has been you, the reader. Your suggestions by email, tweet and direct message on Twitter gave rise to 37% (33) of all our fact checks. The rest came from TV and radio debate, social media, and we even had one fact check request delivered from the floor of Dáil Éireann. Since we started right at the beginning of the general election campaign, we were able to examine the claims of individuals and organisations from many different areas of Irish public debate, but 71% of our fact-checks (63) had to do with politics, or involved politicians or political parties. A breakdown of verdicts for everyone would be cumbersome and in some cases not particularly meaningful (what would we learn from knowing someone has a 100% TRUE rating, based on just one claim?) Instead we’ve picked out the nine political figures who had the most claims fact-checked this year, with all of them having had at least three claims checked. Here’s how they performed: Source: For a full-size version of this chart, click here As you can see, a series of debates during the general election campaign meant that the four major party leaders at the time had the most claims checked. Sinn Féin’s Gerry Adams had the relatively impressive record of seven TRUE claims out of 14 in total, while former Labour leader Joan Burton had six FALSE claims out of 12. Enda Kenny had a more mixed record, with five claims either TRUE or Mostly TRUE, and four either FALSE or Mostly FALSE. Out of his 10 fact-checked claims, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin had four FALSE, four TRUE or Mostly TRUE, and two Half TRUE. Justin Barrett, leader of the newly formed National Party, attracted a FALSE verdict for every one of his four claims in one fact check in November. By contrast, Mary Lou McDonald, who featured in a TV3 Deputy Leaders’ debate, had three TRUE claims out of three. Climate Change minister Denis Naughten had an odd mix, with one verdict each of Mostly TRUE, Half TRUE and UNPROVEN. Meanwhile, Social Protection Minister Leo Varadkar had one TRUE claim, but one FALSE and one Mostly FALSE, as well. The Big Issues There were four major themes that recurred throughout the year – in the news, in readers’ requests to FactCheck, and therefore in our articles: Water, jobs, industrial action and abortion. Water  Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch=8aaY-CRuwHg&t=) Source: TheJournal.ie/YouTube Arguably the biggest claim of all on this front – and, indeed, the one voted by readers as the False Claim of the Year – was Fianna Fáil’s unflinching denial that their stance on water charges and Irish Water had been anything other than consistent and unmoving. In fact, the party adopted several policy combinations, laid out in detail in our September fact check. When it came to this issue, the claims really did come thick and fast all year. Right2Water activist Brendan Ogle overstated the case in June when he said “big business and agriculture” used 90% of water, but ordinary households paid for 78% of the cost. Then there was former Minister and Labour TD Pat Rabbitte’s often-repeated claim that RTE focused mainly on water protests, largely ignoring the need for water infrastructure improvement. A FactCheck audit of the RTE news and current affairs archive found that this claim simply did not stand up to factual scrutiny. Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch=EHLAq01MNV4&t=) Source: TheJournal.ie/YouTube And earlier this month, with the report of the Expert Commission appearing to move water services in Ireland back in the direction of general taxation, the AAA-PBP made a point of saying that 73% of people had declined to pay their charges, the last time they were asked, in April and May. After a careful analysis, FactCheck came to the conclusion that Paul Murphy and Kieran Allen were probably right, but given a surprising gap in Irish Water’s data, we couldn’t say for sure. Jobs, Apple, multinationals Back at the height of the general election campaign, with jobs numbers being frequently and enthusiastically invoked by the government, and challenged by the opposition, we checked out two major issues, the source of many queries from readers over the past 11 months: the effect of JobBridge and temporary, part-time contracts on artificially putting a gloss on the employment statistics. The reality? Yes, job activation schemes have had a meaningful impact on unemployment levels. Right before Election Day, the unemployment rate would have been 12.6% instead of 8.6%, if people on job activation schemes were counted as unemployed. But no, the schemes don’t really represent a significant factor in terms of employment, during what has been a year of undeniably strong jobs growth in Ireland, whatever way you look at it. And contrary to common perception, as our fact check just a week later showed, a great portion of the new jobs created in the past few years have been good quality, full-time, permanent positions. Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch=ujw-BJ2frwA&t=) Source: TheJournal.ie/YouTube The European Commission’s Apple tax ruling in August gave rise to all manner of statistics being put across the airwaves in Ireland, especially in an effort to convey the stakes at play for Ireland. During one memorable week, it appeared almost as if government ministers were attempting to outbid one another at an auction, as the “number of workers at foreign companies” increased with successive interviews. The dependence of the Irish economy on foreign direct investment is fairly well-established in the public consciousness, and the true scale of employment at multinationals is actually significant enough in its own right that it doesn’t appear to have warranted the kind of progressive exaggeration we saw in September. The company at the centre of the whole debacle had its say, of course. In his response to the Commission’s ruling, CEO Tim Cook claimed that Apple was “the largest taxpayer in Ireland”, a claim repeated by Michael Noonan on the Six One News. The problem was, only Revenue is supposed to know how much every company pays in taxes. And they’re not authorized to tell anyone else. So how could Tim Cook possible know whether Apple is the biggest taxpayer in the country? Who knows. The company didn’t respond to our request for evidence, and the Department of Finance told us confidentiality concerns meant they were barred from commenting. Although that didn’t prevent Michael Noonan from repeating Tim Cook’s claim in the first place. Strike talk There was an almost unprecedented level of debate about industrial action in Ireland in 2016, and naturally this translated into plenty of factual claims on every side of every dispute. Back in March, we corrected the exaggerations and simplifications (as well as the accurate statements) contained in a heavily-circulated meme about Luas drivers and junior doctors. It provoked a strong reaction among readers, becoming the most-read fact check of the entire year. And at the height of the Dublin Bus drivers’ strike in September, we turned our sights to the NBRU leaflet dropped on buses across the capital one morning. When it turned out their claims were almost entirely true, readers shared our fact check en masse, and it formed the basis of a segment on TV3’s Tonight With Vincent Browne (starts at 23 mins). Then there was the $64 million question – is it legal for gardaí to go on strike, the subject of an in-depth fact check in August. While the government’s deal with gardaí avoided the unprecedented spectacle of our police force out on strike, it also inspired other sectors of the public service to re-evaluate their own posiitions – including the nurses. As our fact check revealed, the nursing union boss Liam Doran ran the gamut from FALSE to Mostly TRUE, and everything in between, during an extraordinarily fact-filled 90 seconds on Claire Byrne Live, in November. Abortion and the 8th Amendment With a Citizen’s Assembly beginning in September, and bills to repeal the 8th Amendment going through the Dáil, intensive debate on this perennial and sensitive issue was inevitable in 2016. Most notably, the Pro Life Campaign’s Cora Sherlock was found to have her facts straight, more often than not, in a series of public disputes with: the Irish Times’ Fintan O’Toole (on Ireland’s maternal mortality rate); Labour Senator Ivana Back (on “late-term” abortion); and with AAA-PBP TD Ruth Coppinger (on the subject of Down Syndrome and abortion in the UK). However, Sherlock’s Prolife Campaign colleague Sinead Slattery found herself caught out on TV3’s Tonight With Alison O’Connor, after appearing to read a quote from HSE guidelines on maternal bereavement. The problem was, the HSE guidelines did not say what she claimed they did. Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch=CLYmt03Fqm8&t=) Source: TheJournal.ie/YouTube During the summer, Taoiseach Enda Kenny was accused of misleading the Dáil after badly misrepresenting the results of Ireland’s several past referendums on abortion. FactCheck asked Kenny’s office for evidence to support his claims, and later on, if he would be retracting his statements. We got no response. The major stories of 2016 With the seismic, shocking impact of Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, it was perhaps inevitable that FactCheck would rub up against some bold claims connecting Ireland to the year’s two biggest news stories. Government Chief Whip Regina Doherty misrepresented the facts in October, when she defended the cabinet’s preparations and contingencies for Brexit, by claiming that it would be “illegal” for them to negotiate with the UK before the Article 50 notification is triggered. It wouldn’t, as it turns out. And back in the summer, then candidate Donald Trump announced a plan to visit his business interests in Scotland and Ireland, prompting a petition to ban him from the country, which got us thinking – could he actually be barred from Ireland? It turns out he could, but it was always going to be unlikely. In the end, he cancelled his trip. After the publication of our fact check. (But let’s not rush to conclusions about cause and effect). And finally, a word about “fake news” and social media. Post-’post-truth’ Not that there’s any fear of us forgetting, but remember, 2016 was the year that the Oxford English Dictionary felt was best captured with the phrase “post-truth”. Interestingly, the Society for the German Language also deemed “postfaktisch” its word of the year. While Irish public debate has, mercifully, been spared the kind of blatant lying and redefinition of the meaning of language seen, for example, in the US this year, FactCheck did have one or two brushes with outrageous or viral falsehoods, this year. This included our first ever verdict of “Nonsense”, which was introduced in September, and went to an article on the Winning Democrats website, which claimed “Ireland is now officially accepting Trump refugees from America”. As an example of what’s generally (though without precise definition) referred to as “fake news”, it’s almost perfect. An ideologically-motivated piece on an ideologically-slanted website that appears to produce news (but doesn’t really) A headline that does not match the body of the article Is not supported with any specific evidence in the article And constitutes a baseless exaggeration of an existing story (the people of Inishturk inviting Americans to come and visit) Which is itself centred around an (at best) considerable misquotation from another source. And though the article was originally published in May, it went viral (all over again) in the 48 hours after Trump’s election. As a result, many internet users received the (entirely, ridiculously) false impression that, almost immediately after the result, Ireland had formally opened its doors to Americans seeking asylum because of a president who had not yet taken office. Speaking of fake news, and bearing in mind the year that was in it, in September TheJournal.ie‘s FactCheck took the step of signing up to the world’s first Code of Fact-checking Principles, as part of our involvement with the International Fact-checking Network.

The iPhone X concept is a device we would love to see from Apple in 2017, and it’s something that would absolutely smoke the competition. As often as we joke about Android phones looking the same, Apple hasn’t changed things up drastically from a design standpoint in ages. Sure, they make small design changes go a long way, but an edged panel would bring consumers to a frenzy. That’s what we’re getting from a new iPhone X Anniversary concept render from designer Imran Taylor, who produced the beautiful handset you see in the photos. Our favorite concept phones are ones that keep things in the realm of possibility.  The iPhone X does just that as it has a clean look with rounded edges and the classic home button. From the side you can see the glass extends around the edges, and while it’s minimal, it is striking nonetheless. The display would be 5.8-inches according to Taylor, and of the curved OLED variety with a touch-sensitive lower bezel. The new home button would be able to handle gesture support while the front and back would make use of Sapphire Glass. There’s also a smart connector on the back to go along with wireless charging and a rear Dual Camera setup. As for the build, Zirconia Ceramic was mentioned, which we had to look up. It’s strong and note prone to cracking which makes sense given the oversized display and the whole Bendgate issue. It’s also heat resistant and can deal with electrical waves like a boss. The new iPhone X or iPhone 8 concept render isn’t too flashy and has more than enough class to keep fans happy. It’s also different enough to draw in a whole slew of new consumers, especially ones looking to turn away from the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 next year. For now, we’ll have to dream but we will have our fingers crossed Apple goes edged in 2017.

The news comes after Yahoo-owned research firm Flurry earlier this week revealed that the holiday season was a big hit for Apple`s iPhone and between December 19 to 25, Apple`s iPhone and iPad accounted for 44 percent of all mobile activations -- much higher than Samsung. "This is not the first time Apple has cut back on iPhone production as a similar event occurred this year in the January - March quarter. That cut on production was around 30 percent," 9to5mac.com reported. Last year, Apple`s devices accounted for 49.1 percent of all activations during the same period while Samsung last year accounted for 19.8 percent of all activations. Apple is also reportedly planning to manufacture iPhones in Bengaluru in association with Wistron, a Taiwanese OEM manufacturer for Apple and will start production by April 2017.   First Published: Saturday, December 31, 2016 - 12:18 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus MOST READ TOP NEWS MOST VIEWED State Bank of India cuts lending rate by 0.9% across maturities Home, auto loans cheapest in 6 years as SBI, PNB, ICICI cut lending rates by up to 0.9%, other banks follow Eating at restaurants, hotels to be cheaper; govt says service charge on bill not compulsory Petrol price hiked by Rs1.29 per litre, diesel Rs 0.97 per litre India's core infrastructure sector growth rises to 4.9% in November Big relief to housewives from IT department New Year gift: Home, auto loans set to be cheaper Luxury cars to be launched in 2017 Bikes to be launched in 2017 Service charge in restaurant is not compulsary Prices of petrol in 10 major cities Prices of diesel in 10 major cities RBI introduces facility for NRIs to exchange old Rs 500, Rs 1000 notes up to June 2017 BSE's India International Exchange​ to go live post 'Makar Sankranti' Related News iPhone production to be slashed by 10% in Q1 2017: Report   Check out top 5 best-selling holiday movies on iTunes Apple, Nokia lock horns over patents; sue each other again Apple iPhone 8 with OLED models likely to sport curved panels Apple adds wide range of fresh emojis to iPhone TAGS Apple Apple iPhone Apple iPhone cost Apple iPad iPhone production Gallery 10 Major Cars Launched in 2016 10 Most Expensive Hotels In India Top 10 countries in ease of doing business TOP VIDEOS New Year gift: Home, auto loans set to be cheaper Govt keeps interest rates of small saving schemes unchanged Service charge in restaurant is not compulsary contact Privacy Policy Legal Disclaimer complaint Our Team investor info WHERE TO WATCH Careers Partner Site: DNA INDIA news India States World Technology Science & Environment Health Photo entertainment Bollywood television Music Regional Movie Reviews Hollywood lifestyle People Relationships Travel Food & Recipes Fashion Culture Horoscope Spirituality sports Cricket Football World Motorsports Golf Others Softspot Debate Blogs Exclusive Pics Videos business Automobile Economy Markets Personal Finance Market Stats Companies Real Estate Bullion International Business Photo Gallery India City Mumbai Kolkata Pune Bengaluru Chennai Hyderabad Ahmedabad STATES Andhra Pradesh Assam Bihar Chhattisgarh Delhi NCR Goa Gujarat Haryana Himachal Pradesh Jammu and Kashmir Jharkhand Karnataka Kerala Madhya Pradesh Maharashtra North East Odisha Punjab Rajasthan Tamil Nadu Telangana Uttar Pradesh Uttarakhand UTs West Bengal World Asia Africa Americas Europe Australia-Oceania Technology Gadgets Mobiles Gaming Apps Internet & Social Media Science & Environment Space Environment Discoveries Science Hindi Home देश प्रदेश दुनिया खेल-खिलाड़ी कारोबार ज्ञान-विज्ञान मनोरंजन ज़ी स्पेशल सेहत तस्वीरें वीडियो भविष्यफल Marathi Home मुंबई महाराष्ट्र भारत विश्व स्पोर्ट्स बार कल्लाबाजी हेल्थ मंत्रा ब्लॉगर्स पार्क युथ क्लब Exclusive फोटो व्हिडिओ भविष्य Bengali Home Kolkata State Nation World Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Blogs Health Photos Videos Slideshows Weather Inverstors Home About ZMCL Listing Document Shareholding Pattern Presentations & Releases Board of Directors Financials-Annual Financials-Quarterly Q&A Transcripts Code of Conduct Notices © 1998-2016 Zee Media Corporation Ltd (An Essel Group Company), All rights reserved.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: December 31, 2016 12:54 pm Consumer Reports surprised customers when it refused to give recommended ratings to Apple’s new MacBook Pro series. Consumer Reports has said it stands by its findings on Apple’s new MacBook Pro battery results. Consumer Reports’ director of electronics testing Maria Rerecich, in response to 9to5 Mac’s suggestion to run battery tests on MacBook Pro again, quoted several reasons for not going forward with it. Maria pointed out the team is confident of its results as they were performed using the right equipment and results were monitored closely. Rerecich’s statement to 9to5 Mac reads, “In this case, we don’t believe re-running the tests are warranted for several reasons. First, as we point out in our original article, experiencing very high battery life on MacBooks is not unusual for us – in fact we had a model in our comparative tests that got 19 hours. Second, we confirmed our brightness with three different meters, so we feel confident in our findings using this equipment. Finally, we monitor our tests very closely. There is an entry logged every minute, so we know from these entries that the app worked correctly.” Consumer Reports surprised customers, as well as Apple’s Senior Vice President Phil Schiller, when it refused to give recommended ratings to Apple’s new MacBook Pro series. The site, which conducted several tests on MacBook Pro 2016 series to evaluate display, performance etc noted that battery life of the laptops was ‘highly inconsistent’. Schiller tweeted out saying, “Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data.” Read: Apple MacBook Pro 2016 series fail Consumer Reports’ battery tests Consumer Reports’ team conducted tests on the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar and a 15-inch MacBook Pro. However, according to the website, the MacBook Pro battery life results were ‘highly inconsistent from one trial to the next’. It is worth noting these are the first set of MacBooks to not receive recommended ratings from Consumer Reports. In our review, we did not face any issues with the battery, except for one time when the battery seemed to have drained inexplicably. A full screen-on test on the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar with 100 per cent brightness, music streaming and playing at full volume and me working on Safari, Notes and Chrome gave us 4 hours and 20 minutes of juice, which is not bad. Meanwhile, Consumer Reports has put out another report with steps to fix Apple MacBook Pro’s battery issues. The report lists adjustments that can be made to the device that’ll help, though the root cause of the problem hasn’t been identified yet. “It’s possible that a software update from Apple would be able to correct the problem,” the report says. Must Read: Apple MacBook Pro 2016 review: Ideal for the power user Apple unveiled its new MacBook Pro series at its event on October 27. The new MacBook Pro series is supposed to be faster and change the way we interact with our computers. The new MacBook Pro series has a TouchBar and no function keys. The new generation MacBook Pro comes with four Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports and one 3.5mm headphone jack. Apple’s new MacBook Pro series is the thinnest and lightest one yet. Apple claims the MacBook Pro features the ‘brightest and most colourful Retina display yet’ with 500 nits of brightness. The device starts at Rs 1,29,900 for the 13-inch variant (256GB) without the TouchBar. The one with TouchBar costs Rs 1,55,900 for the 256GB version and Rs 1,72,900 for the 512GB storage option. The 15-inch display variant of Apple MacBook Pro is available in India at Rs 2,05,900 for 256GB storage variant. The 512GB option costs Rs 2,41,900. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple Best of Express PM Modi frames UP fight: Growth exiled for 14 yrs, give us majority EntertainmentDangal box office collection day 11: Aamir Khan film all set to take over Sultan as biggest hit of 2016 EntertainmentRaees: Dear Shah Rukh Khan, why are you so 'Zaalim' on us?

By Agamoni Ghosh December 31, 2016 06:47 GMT Sluggish sales has compelled the company to cut back production of iPhone 7 range from Q1 of 2017Reuters Apple is expected to cut the iPhone 7 range production by nearly 10% according to information based on data from suppliers as the phones have not been selling as expected. Nikkei reports that sluggish sales has compelled the company to cut back production from Q1 of 2017 and rather focus on the iPhone 8 that is going to be released in 2017, which also marks the 10th anniversary of Apple's iPhone. Although the iPhone 7 Plus featuring a dual-lens camera module is popular and high in demand due to the shortage of these camera sensors Apple has not been able to meet demand for the units. The company had slashed output for the iPhone 6s as well January-March 2016 as accumulated inventory of the model was unlikely to sell out and still remains with the company. Apple was pipped to get an advantage for iPhone 7 sales given the Galaxy Note 7, its closest competitor had to be discontinued due to safety hazards associated with the device. However, as per the report Apple has not been able to take advantage of the situation as Apple's holiday numbers are not expected to be that great. Earlier reports have hinted that despite the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, Samsung loyalists have stuck to their favourite brand. For Japan in particular the report claims the demand for the iPhone 7 is rather high partly due to the phone's compatibility with contactless IC chip readers used for services such as cashless payments. Sadly, Japan makes up just about 10% of the global smartphone market and its demand pattern cannot over power a general sluggish trend.

Opinion Anna Scantlin Contributing Editor | December 30, 2016 23 shares 10 13 0 0 0 0 0 0 0               2016 was kind of a weird year for mobile. We had some great new additions like the Google Pixel; we saw the Galaxy S line go from good to better between the S6 and the S7; the HTC 10 was a remarkable improvement over the HTC One M9; both LG and Lenovo had some creative ideas with their modular G5 and Moto Z, respectively; even Apple had a pretty solid year with the release of the iPhone SE and the iPhone 7. However, we’ve had some blunders as well. The Note 7 is probably the most notable, and recently reports have been surfacing stating that some Google Pixel and Nexus 6P devices have been mysteriously shutting down at 30-40% battery life. There’s also that weird phenomenon where manufacturers seem to think that removing the 3.5mm headphone jack is a good idea, but I would argue that most consumers don’t feel the same way. Thinking about the things I would like to see happen in 2017, I’ve come to the conclusion that there’s really not a whole lot on my list that I’m hoping for. I’m actually quite impressed with how far smartphones have come in such a seemingly short amount of time and feel that I really don’t have much of substance to complain about. Still, nothing is perfect, and there are still a couple of things that I would be happy to see come to fruition in 2017’s smartphone lineup. Better battery life I don't think I’ll ever feel like battery life shouldn’t be improved upon. The longer I can go without having to plug in my phone, the better. At this point I’m just happy that I can last an entire day (and often more) without absolutely needing to plug in my phone, but I would love to safely go a few days or longer without having to worry about charging my phone at all. The 3.5mm headphone jack stays Although more and more OEMs seem to be hopping on board with the idea – or are at the very least rumored to – I still don’t consider the move beneficial at all. I’m hoping this situation ends up like microSD cards; maybe it is old and outdated technology, but a lot of people still find it convenient and useful. USB-C for iPhones I’ve always harbored a resentment towards Apple for their chargers. Apple has always had different chargers even after smartphone manufacturers agreed to streamline their proprietary connectors to one universal connector, micro USB. I saw the usefulness in Apple’s chargers, but as somebody who frequently switched between iOS and Android it was somewhat of an annoyance to have to carry around two sets of chargers, and then later replace an entire collection of 30-pin connector accessories with Lightning. Fortunately, Apple seems to be embracing the new standard that the rest of the tech world is heading towards using, USB Type-C, as evidenced with its presence in Apple’s MacBook laptops. A Type-C port existing in MacBooks make me think that it’s possible for Apple to ditch Lightning in favor of Type-C in iPhones eventually, although probably not in 2017. No more glass backs Aside from aesthetically, I never understood the appeal of designing a phone with glass fronts and backs. It’s bad enough when you drop your phone and it lands face down and you spend a moment or two praying to your deity of choice that the glass didn’t shatter, but it’s kind of dumb when you do the same thing for the back of your phone as well. I didn’t understand it with my old iPhone 4S and I don’t understand it with the Galaxy S7. Glass is breakable, slippery, and a fingerprint magnet. It’s just not a good material to use on the backs of phones. I’m excited to see what 2017 brings us, but I really hope to see some of these ideas implemented as well – particularly better battery life and keeping the 3.5mm headphone jack around.

The Melville, N.Y., high school junior wanted Apple AirPods. The same wireless earbuds that he'd been waiting patiently for since October. “The most fun part of a new product is that exciting feeling of waiting as launch day approaches,” he explained just before the holiday weekend, with thinly veiled exasperation. “So I was let down by the delay, but even more so by Apple’s inability to pin down an exact release date. A company with such wealth and scale should be able to consistently deliver on time, and it's disappointing whenever they don't.” Joseph was hardly alone. Though a limited quantity of the AirPods made it to market a couple of days before Christmas, a number of other high-profile products announced this fall, including the Samsung Galaxy Note7 smartphone and the GoPro Karma drone, weren’t available for holiday shoppers. Jonathan Sweetwood, owner of Unique Camera (which sells a variety of audio, video, and photography equipment) in Wayne, N.J., explains that when a consumer decides on a product only to find out that it's not available, it complicates what should be a straightforward transaction. “With some people it’s, ‘I’ve got to have the Apple AirPods,’” Sweetwood says. “But with others, we try to get down to the root of what their needs are and we try to find them a comparable product.” What’s behind these disappointing product launches? At least part of the blame goes to Wall Street. According to Jonathan Yarmis, a former electronics analyst with Gartner and now principal analyst with the Yarmis Group, the reason for these product delays is that with an eye toward the stock market’s expectations, companies are compressing their product development cycles. “Everybody now feels this incredible pressure to come to market quickly,” he explains. “We used to go to CES to find out what products were coming in the coming year. Now you go to CES to see what’s coming on Tuesday.” Though each product that wasn't available this holiday season followed its own path—some were recalled because of safety problems, and others were merely delayed—Yarmis sees a common theme: an accelerated product development cycle that leaves little time for testing and even less time to fix a problem once it's discovered.  When there's a glitch, Yarmis explains, it often results in finger pointing between competing factions within the company. “You have two conflicting groups within an organization," he says. "The marketing people who are saying 'Now! Yesterday!' and the product development guys who are saying, 'This isn’t simply a matter of issuing a press release. There are technological challenges. There are testing challenges.’” Increasingly, Yarmis notes, the marketers are winning these intramural battles. What does that mean for you? “The consumer is now the beta tester,” Yarmis says, half jokingly. As for Joseph, he didn't give up on his quest to make 2016 the year of the AirPod. He searched a site called iStockNow and tracked down a pair at a nearby Apple Store at Long Island's Roosevelt Field Mall.   Here’s a look at five "woulda, coulda, shoulda" products from late 2016 that stumbled on the path from introduction to consumers' hands. Samsung Galaxy Note7 The Product: Samsung’s top-of-the-line smartphone was introduced in August to compete with the iPhone 7 for this fall’s phone upgraders. The Problem: Shortly after the introduction, reports began filtering in that the lithium-ion batteries in these phones had begun exploding. That led to a recall, and then when replacement phones also started catching fire, to a second, wider recall that resulted in all of the phones being pulled from the market—sending consumers to other models. The Resolution: After the recalls—and a Federal Aviation Administration ban on Note7s on airplanes—Samsung finally gave up on introducing a Note7 model, and even took measures to make it impossible to use any Note7 phones still in consumers' hands. Apple AirPods The Product: Apple’s iPhone 7 was largely notable for what it didn’t have: a traditional headphone jack. While Apple fans debated the dongle question, Apple expected that the AirPod wireless earbuds that it announced at the same time would resolve this issue.  The Problem: The iPhone 7 hit the market in October, but the Air Pods remained in limbo. The company kept quietly pushing back the street date. Apple hasn't specified a reason for the delay, and published reports speculated on causes ranging from problems with Bluetooth to manufacturing problems. An Apple spokesman referred us to this statement, issued by the company in October: "The early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers." The Resolution: Though a few lucky and/or resourceful Apple fans will get their AirPods this year, most users will have to wait until 2017. GoPro Karma Drone The Product: The Karma, which folds to fit in a backpack, was touted by many as the product that would make drones a mass-market phenomenon. The Problem: Three weeks after its mid-October introduction, GoPro received reports of several “in-flight failures,” a.k.a. drones falling out of the sky. The good news was that no injuries or property damage were associated with the failures. GoPro, with little help from the FAA or the Consumer Product Safety Commission, neither of which claimed jurisdiction over this issue, began its own recall. (Unlike a recall backed by regulators, the GoPro effort lacked governmental authority behind the effort to remove the product from store shelves.) The Resolution: The Karma was an important product for the struggling company, so GoPro went the extra mile to appease the consumers it inconvenienced. In addition to a full refund, early adopters of the Karma also got a $300 camera from the company. The Karma is now expected to return to store shelves early in 2017.  DJI Mavic Pro Drone The Product: This modestly priced personal flying machine was set to vie with the GoPro Karma for a share of the growing market of casual drone users. The Problem: Partly because of the Karma recall, demand for the Mavic Pro outstripped supply. The company failed to make its aggressive October launch date and reportedly began shipping small quantities of preordered drones in November. Later orders were subject to a backlog of around two months. The Resolution: Amazon currently lists the release date for the product as Feb. 10, 2017. Beats by Dr. Dre BeatsX The Product: Call them AirPods for the fashion conscious. The Beats version of Apple’s wireless earbuds, which share some technology with the AirPods, were also introduced in September and supposed to hit the market a month later. The Problems: The BeatsX seemed to share the same logistical issues—and the same delays—as the AirPods. The earbuds were scheduled to hit the market in mid-October, but that deadline has quietly slipped. Apple now says the BeatsX will be available in February. The Resolution: Dr. Dre undoubtedly has his pair already, but for the rest of us, the Beats X should be available in early 2017.

LOUIS, MO (KTVI) - Ballwin police are looking for the people involved in a smash and grab burglary that happened at an Apple repair shop early Friday morning. The owners of the I-Tech Shark store SAY someone used a boulder to do their dirty work. The crime was all caught on camera. Four people smashed their way into the I-Tech Shark Apple Repair Shop in the 14,800 block of Manchester in Ballwin. Owners say broke in at around 1am and boldly made a b-line to the back of the shop where they took more than $10,000 in Apple merchandise in less than 5 minutes. It was all captured on surveillance video. The store has been at the location for about three years and had two break-ins. The first was last January. Now they want the people in this video to pay for their crimes. "They knew where they were going. They went straight to the back, to our merchandise. That was strange. People don't go back there. If they did this, and other crimes, I hope they are caught and do a good amount of time," said Michael Slyman. Owners say none of their customer's phones were taken. The thieves left the register and iMAC at the front desk in tact. We're told none of of the other near by businesses were affected.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 31 December 2016 | MYT 8:00 AM Tiny AirPod will cost a bundle to replace by troy wolverton Whopping fee: Apple's charging a US$69 (RM309) replacement fee for each one of its wireless headphones, the company disclosed recently on a customer support web page. — Bay Area News Group/TNS If you lose an AirPod, you'll have to pay Apple a pretty penny to replace it.  Apple's charging a US$69 (RM309) replacement fee for each one of its wireless headphones, the company disclosed recently on a customer support web page. That's about 43% of the total cost of the US$159 (RM713) gadgets. And if you lose your charging case, you'll have to pay the same amount.  The iPhone maker announced that it's begun taking AirPod orders. The new gadgets come with a one-year limited warranty that only covers defects, not wear-and-tear from regular use. If you're having battery problems after the warranty expires, Apple will charge US$49 (RM219) to replace the ones in the AirPods themselves and another US$49 (RM219) to replace the one in their charging case.  If you damage the AirPods or the case – a situation that's likely not covered by the warranty – you'll have to pay US$69 (RM309) to replace the case and the same amount for each headphone.  Apple unveiled the AirPods in September when it rolled out the iPhone 7, the first of the company's smartphones to lack a headphone jack. The company is pushing wireless headphones as a replacement for wired ones that relied on that jack. — The Mercury News/Tribune News Service You May Be Interested Niagara Falls light up with US$4mil upgrade this holiday season Secure your accounts Doubles 'goddess' Goh is now single Another viral video of another Ipoh 'daredevil' Traffic crawl along major highways Quality homes below RM400k Others Also Read Bubu waiting to greet travellers during Visit Sibu Year Analysts negative on Felda deal Fund Managers' pick advertisement Latest News Seattle’s cloud-computing boom is new force driving regional economy What is cloud computing?

Apple AirPods: UK price, availability and do they work with Android? By Luke Edwards 30th Dec 2016 Features Tweet Apple AirPods are the new wireless earphones for your iPhone or iPad, but when can you buy them in the UK, how much do they cost and do Airpods work with Android mobile phones? Here's all you need to know about Apple AirPods. Apple has taken a big step towards its totally wireless future by releasing the wire-free AirPods earphones. These are two independent earphones that pop snuggly into your lug-holes, to offer battery-powered listening and voice recognition. The critical reception of Apple's AirPods has been rather mixed, as the earphones have plenty of positives but also a fair few negatives. And as they're rather pricey here in the UK and in other countries, purchasing them can be a tricky decision. That's why we've compiled this all-you-need-to-know AirPods guide, so you're fully informed before commiting to Apple's wireless ear buddies. Apple AirPods UK price The Apple AirPods are a cool new technology for the company so, as you’d expect, they’re not cheap. You’ll need to splash out a hefty £159 to snap up a pair of these, which includes the wireless charging case and a Lightning-to-USB cable to charge the case's built-in battery (which in turn charges the AirPods). Lose any part of the setup, be it an earpiece or the charging case itself, and you’re a bit stuck really. Bearing in mind that’s easy to do with them all wirelessly separate, you might want to consider adding insurance to that price tag too. Apple Airpods setup process: How do I pair my earphones with my iPhone, iPad and other Apple devices? One of the great advantages of AirPods over other wireless headphones is their simple connectivity with Apple devices. Hold them and the charging case near one of your Apple gadgets and they’ll automatically pair using NFC, then instantly work across your other Apple devices, including Watches, Mac computers and iPads. It's all perfectly seamless, thanks to iCloud. Apple AirPods: Do they work with Android devices? AirPods do indeed work with Android phones and other devices, but the experience isn't so seamless and user-friendly. AirPods can be connected to Android devices, as well as computers, just like you can pair up normal Bluetooth headphones. But you’ll need to pair them the old fashioned way, by finding them in your device's BT settings. You also won’t get access to all of the best AirPod features, while battery life may also suffer if not used with Apple devices. How good is the battery life of Apple AirPods? AirPod battery life is good, but it can also be great. Thanks to the wireless charging case you can go for up to 24 hours between charges, or so claims Apple. Your AirPods will last for five hours on a charge when connected with an iPhone 7, with other less optimised devices lowering that. But pop them back in the case and a 15-minute charge will offer three more hours of use, totalling 24 hours in all before the case also runs out of juice. Not bad at all then, presuming you’re using an iPhone 7. Apple AirPods are more than just wireless earphones One of the really fun features of the AirPods is the way they work. They’re 'always on' and so always connected. As a result, all you need to do is pop them in your lugholes to listen. Infrared sensors let them know when they’re in your ears and ready for action. And if you drop from two to one when using them with an iPhone, it’ll switch from stereo to mono so you get the complete audio experience in that one ear. When you want to skip track, change volume or ask Siri something, you just double tap an AirPod's external surface. Thanks to motion sensors it’ll react immediately, allowing you to verbally request a command - and this is accurate too, thanks to the built-in smart mics (see below). Do the Apple AirPods have voice recognition and Siri support? Voice commands with the AirPods is a super smart experience thanks to beamforming built-in mics, which work with the motion sensors to detect when you’re talking. This can then filter out background noise to offer the best possible voice recognition and audio quality, ideal for both Siri controls and for calls. All these smarts and sensors are run by Apple’s M1 chip, developed specifically for the AirPods. That means smart controls while also offering the most efficient use of battery. Are the Apple AirPods good for exercise? The Apple AirPods design has been the subject of much debate. Some enjoy the minimalism and style, while others have called them ugly, cheap and basic. It comes down to personal preference. What doesn’t, however, is their fit. While the AirPods sit snugly in most ears. there are no options to change earbuds for a different size of fit. So if these don’t comfortably lodge in your ears, bad luck. They should sit fine for day to day use, in most people’s case, but don’t expect them to remain in place while running. It’s a shame since the price tag is so high, meaning most people will need to spend even more if they want running headphones too. That’s a double shame when you consider these work with the Apple Watch, which could let you run with music minus your phone. AirPods vs EarPods: Is there a difference in sound quality? Despite being newer, the Apple AirPods are reportedly the same as Apple's EarPods in terms of sound quality. That’s not bad, but not great either. Expect a decent amount of bass, but not heavy boom. These replicate AAC audio, says Apple, but won’t necessarily blow you away. That fit, with plastic earpieces that don’t mould to the ear, may be part of the issue - meaning more background noise bleeding in. The lofry asking price makes this issue more of a problem for those seeking higher quality audio reproduction. If these were run friendly, the quality issue may have been more easily overlooked. But since AirPods are for day-to-day use, sound quality is a seriously important feature for many.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Apple sued over girl’s death at hands of driver ‘distracted’ by FaceTime video call By Ethan Baron / December 30, 2016 at 5:59 PM Five-year-old Moriah Modisette was killed when Garrett Wilhelm allegedly rear-ended her family’s Toyota Camry with his Toyota 4Runner at 65 miles per hour on an interstate in Denton County, Texas in 2014. Now Apple is in Santa Clara County Superior Court fighting a lawsuit by the surviving family members. Apple is responsible for the girl’s death, her parents and sister alleged in the lawsuit, because Wilhelm had the firm’s FaceTime video-calling app up on his iPhone 6 Plus before and during the “distracted driving” crash — while Apple sat on patented technology that could prevent people from using FaceTime while driving at highway speed. Apple, the suit said, applied in 2008 for a patent on a “driver handheld computing device lockout” intended to stop texting while driving at highway speed, and should have applied the technology to FaceTime. The lockout could be achieved using the accelerometer and GPS already in phones, suggested the suit, which accused Apple of “gross negligence.” None of the allegations have been proven in court. Apple did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Wilhelm, 21, was charged with manslaughter, according to the Denton Record-Chronicle. “Wilhelm, who was 20 at the time, told police he was using his cell phone when the accident occurred,” the paper reported in August 2015. “The call was still active when the phone was located at the accident scene.” Wilhelm’s jury trial is scheduled for Feb. 27, the paper said. The lawsuit cites data on increasing mobile-device use by drivers and rising traffic fatalities. Texas allows adults to use cell phones while driving. The city of Denton, where the crash occurred, had a ban on texting while driving, but it didn’t apply to interstate highways, the Record-Chronicle reported. The suit was brought by the dead child’s parents, Bethany and James Modisette, and her sister Isabella, all injured in the wreck, James critically. They are seeking unspecified damages, according to the lawsuit filed Dec. 23 and published by Courthouse News Service. Photo illustration: An iPhone held up in front of the Apple logo.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Rollover crash turns Apple Valley intersection into four-way stop Friday Friday Dec 30, 2016 at 5:59 PM Dec 30, 2016 at 6:07 PM Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker APPLE VALLEY — Authorities said a woman suffered minor injuries after a rollover crash on Highway 18 Friday afternoon. The crash caused a Toyota Tacoma pickup truck to overturn and crash into a traffic controller at the intersection of Highway 18 and Quinnault Road, briefly blocking eastbound lanes and turning the intersection into a four-way stop. Apple Valley Sheriff’s station Deputy G. Teplansky said the crash occurred just before 3 p.m. Friday as the Tacoma and a white Cadillac were headed east on Highway 18. The woman in the Tacoma slowed for a red light but the driver of the Cadillac failed to slow in time, Teplansky said, causing it to skid and strike the rear of the truck. The Cadillac then skidded underneath the Tacoma, causing the truck to overturn before it crashed into the controller box and a nearby crosswalk sign. Teplansky said the truck landed on its wheels. The woman in the Tacoma was taken to a local hospital with a complaint of pain, while the passengers in the Cadillac reported no injuries on scene. No other injuries were reported. Teplanksy said Caltrans personnel were requested to repair the traffic control box. The intesection was expected to remain as a four-way stop for about three hours until their arrival, but eastbound lanes were open by 3:30 p.m. The cause of the crash is not yet known, but Teplansky said alcohol, drugs or speed are not believed to be contributing factors. The crash remains under investigation by the Apple Valley Sheriff’s station. Paola Baker may be reached at 760-955-5332 or PBaker@VVDailyPress.com. Follow her on Twitter at @DP_PaolaBaker.

However over the years, Chinese OEMs have managed to ramp things up considerably by introducing an avalanche of products that are comparable in performance, but sometimes at half the price. This has led to many Chinese brands dominating markets that companies like Apple and Samsung have typically flourished in. However it seems that nothing lasts forever because according to a report from DigiTimes, various Chinese OEMs such as Huawei, Xiaomi, and LeEco are apparently looking to cut back on component orders in Q1 2017. While China is indeed a massive market with huge potential, it seems that the market is already saturated not just with phones from local companies, but also foreign ones from the likes of Apple and Samsung. This by no means indicates that any of these companies are in trouble, but rather it is just them reacting to the market and situation as it is. In fact a recent report has also revealed that Apple could potentially be looking to cut back production as well by as much as 10% in the first quarter of the new year, so this shouldn’t really be that surprising. However both LeEco and Xiaomi have plans to launch in the US, so if successful production could ramp back up again to meet the demand in the new markets. Filed in Cellphones >Rumors.

The arguments over illegal state-aid and the €13bn in back taxes which the EU’s Margrethe Vestager ruled that phone giant Apple owes this State will, thankfully, start to grind through European courts. The drawn-out legal appeals process will provide some sort of relief from the public relations flack put up by the principal players which included a lot of the faux outrage over the Brussels’ ruling from the Government and Apple. Much heat was generated last summer but, despite the size of the tax demand, markets were nonplussed. Shares in Apple — a behemoth valued at €593bn and which holds a remarkable cash hoard of over €200bn — have risen since Ms Vestager’s August decision. READ NEXT Paul Mills: Amid the risks, our leaders need to up their game Investors view a tax bill of €13bn as so much chump change for the world’s most valuable corporation, and the phone giant’s shares ended the year 10% higher. There was also no market evidence that rock-bottom costs of borrowing for the Government here flickered at all, despite it committing to appealing a ruling that would have given it €13bn, an enormous windfall that would lop a significant chunk from the country’s debt pile. For any state, never mind one that has so recently emerged from near bankruptcy, to turn down a sizeable bounty suggests that big issues are playing out behind the scenes. As the Irish Examiner reported before the ruling, in April, there were signals that the Government had accepted it had lost Ms Vestager’s state aid investigation, but had anticipated a decision involving a much smaller fine, maybe one amounting to as little as €150m. The Government nonetheless decided at this early stage to appeal any adverse ruling that implied the State had cut some sort of sweetheart deal with a multinational. Later, ministers and officials explained their decision to appeal the decision with comments about sovereignty and defending the State’s tax regime from Brussels’ bureaucrats. Ireland and its tax dealings with US multinationals has not been alone in facing scrutiny from Ms Vestager’s probe. But the €13bn clawback from Apple ensured the unflattering international spotlight on Ireland’s tax dealings would not fade away, as had happened with other high-profile adverse EU rulings. Apple is box office after all. Almost all the candidates in the race for the White House had slammed Ireland over so-called tax inversion deals. And it’s easy to forget that it wasn’t Brussels but Washington lawmakers who first drew up the allegations that Ireland had cut a too sweet deal with the most valuable company in the world. A Senate sub-committee committee, in May 2013, claimed US taxpayers were losing billions of dollars in global revenues generated by Apple. The same hearing heard that Apple had paid next to nothing in tax on the global billions passing through two or three firms incorporated in Ireland. The Senate committee’s investigation caught the Government on the hop. It was also to provide a handy roadmap for a newly installed Commission in Brussels to pursue its own investigations into tax arrangements of multinationals in Europe. In the mix, too, are the renewed plans by commissioner tax czar Pierre Moscovici to revive the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base proposal, which even if adopted in a scaled-back version would call time on Ireland’s tax lure that includes the 12.5% rate and ‘knowledge box’ incentives. Yet the Government has effectively a two-way bet in its appeal against the Commission’s encroachment: Launch the appeal and be seen to fight for a continuing flow of projects into Ireland at a time when the election of Donald Trump promises tougher times ahead for US investments in Europe; or after long years legal wrangling if it were to lose the appeal and collect a substantial windfall. But there is another tax issue involving Apple that TDs should probably pay more attention to. In July this year, the CSO, through no fault of its own, had to revise Irish GDP growth figures for 2015 and following common Eurostat rules came up with the infamous 26.3% annual growth surge. No normal advanced economy records enormous growth numbers. The revision led to the partly amusing, partly offensive jibe by Nobel economics laureate Paul Krugman of “leprechaun economics”. The Irish Examiner subsequently reported that Apple was the main driver behind the extraordinary revision, as it re-arranged its international tax affairs by transferring huge amounts of its intellectual property here. Recently, the Irish Examiner reported Apple had communicated with the CSO last summer, reminding the Government agency of its confidentiality rules. Apple’s exercise was an accounting procedure but, presumably, involved contract manufacturing in China being counted as if it were done on Irish soil. It will be revealing to see what happens to GDP figures here as Apple ramps up production of new phones in the future. Apple’s accounting had another huge effect in widening the country’s tax base. Ask many senior economists and they will tell you that Apple was also the leading multinational that helped lead to the Government last year collecting €2.3bn more than anticipated in corporate tax revenues. But no Government minister or official will admit as much. Next week, the Finance Department will release the 2016 tax returns which will show again that corporate tax revenues are taking in a huge haul. It’s time the secrecy surrounding this other Apple tax issue was lifted.

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Driverless New Year: Self-Driving Startups To Watch in 2017 By Johana Bhuiyan PUBLISHED: JANUARY 01 2017 2016 was the year of many things. For the auto and tech industries, it was the year the companies that already placed their bets on self-driving technology began showing their hands. Auto giants -- some of which were increasingly aware that they were moving into relatively uncharted territory - began buying up or otherwise forging partnerships with tech startups. GM acquired Cruise and partnered with Lyft. Ford acquired Chariot and Israeli machine learning and computer vision startup SAIPS. As the hype around driverless cars grew, so did the demand for teams with backgrounds in AI and machine learning -- both relatively nascent fields. Even the biggest tech companies, namely Uber, were left wanting. So, Uber also went on somewhat of a purchasing tear and acquired then six-month-old self-driving trucking startup Otto and put Anthony Levandowski, its co-founder and one of the founders of Google's self-driving project, at the head of all of Uber's autonomous efforts. The ride-hail company then bought out AI startup Geometric Intelligence and tapped its co-founder Gary Marcus to head up Uber's new AI lab. Investors took notice and also began placing their bets -- if they hadn't already. Around the same time as the Cruise acquisition -- which was seen as a coup for Silicon Valley -- A16z invested in aftermarket autonomous startup Comma.ai. Shortly after, Andy Rubin's Playground invested in aftermarket car tech startup Nauto. The list goes on. This demand will likely continue as companies trudge forward in the competition to build and develop self-driving cars. That means investors will be paying attention to startups with the skills to build any aspect of the self-driving stack as some of them increasingly become potential acquisition targets while the others take on the biggest names in transportation. In no particular order, here is a non-exhaustive list of the startups we'll be watching: Chris Urmson's Self-Driving Startup Call it premature, but investors will be keeping a close eye on what the former chief technology officer of Google's self-driving project will be doing. Urmson, who left Google in August, is starting his own autonomous startup, sources told Recode. We don't know much about the company except that Urmson likely plans on developing the full stack of autonomous hardware and software and then licensing it to automakers. So how do we know it's worth watching? Well, for investors, the company looks like a win-win. Urmson -- a much sought-after engineering talent himself -- has already approached big names from companies like Uber, Tesla and Apple. So at the very least, the yet-to-be-named or -launched company is certainly an acquisition target purely for the talent, if nothing else. But at most, not only does Urmson have the technical know-how, he seems to have a path to market in mind, according to sources. So it could prove to be a worthy investment even as an independent company. Zoox Zoox, which recently closed a $200 million round at a $1 billion valuation, is building a fully electric fleet of self-driving vehicles to be used in a ride-hail service. The company has yet to unveil its vehicle or much of its plans but is one of the few startups attempting to build a car from the ground up. That's a hard problem that even Waymo -- Alphabet's self-driving subsidiary -- and Apple have reportedly decided against pursuing. That's exactly why several sources say the company had difficulty raising its most recent round. But it's also what makes the company intriguing. However unlikely or difficult it may seem, if Zoox is able to build everything from the vehicle to the self-driving software to the ride-hail platform, it will be the only company to do so without partnering with other players. In 2017, fresh off a new infusion of cash, it's likely the company will have to officially show off some part of its full fledged robot-taxi service. Drive.ai Drive.ai recently launched out of stealth with one pitch: The solution to all your self-driving uncertainties is deep learning -- a type of machine learning. The company's co-founder Sameep Tandon insists the startup is the only company using deep learning to power the entire autonomous system. That means it's powering everything from the sensors and cameras, to the vehicle's decision-making, to the way the car communicates with people and things around it. The company, which has raised $12 million to date, also launched having already secured a few commercial fleet partnerships for which the company will retrofit their software and hardware stack into vehicles in order to collect, test and verify real-world driving data. Not to mention, its founders - who wouldn't give too many more details about the partnerships - claim to be among the few people with extensive backgrounds in deep learning. Nuro.ai Though it was co-founded by Jiajun Zhu and Dave Ferguson - two of the top self-driving engineers from Google's car shop - the robotics and AI startup Nuro.ai won't focus only on transportation. While the first in its suite of products will be a fully self-driving car -- which the company hopes to launch in the next two to four years -- Nuro also plans to draw from the wide range of machine learning and robotics experience its staffers have to build a series of AI-powered products. The company, still in semi-stealth mode, has raised some money - though its head of product Michael Hanuschik wouldn't disclose how much. But again, purely based on talent, the company may be worth the attention. Nuro's team includes engineers with robotics, artificial intelligence and self-driving experience who had a hand in either developing or shipping an unusually wide range of products including Nexus cameras, Google Image search, the Mars Exploration and Curiosity Rovers, Google street view, Google's self-driving cars and a number of surgical tools. nuTonomy This MIT spinoff, which has headquarters in Singapore and Massachusetts, has made significant strides that rival its more established competitor, Uber. In a matter of months, the company beat out Uber and other players and was named Singapore's official autonomous research and development partner, it partnered with Uber's Southeast Asian rival Grab and launched a self-driving pilot [seen here] in both Singapore and Massachusetts. To date, the three-year-old company has raised just under $20 million. NuTonomy is also testing its vehicles in Michigan and in the U.K., where the company said it has a partnership with Jaguar Land Rover. Varden Labs Varden Labs is a stealth self-driving company that graduated from startup incubator Y Combinator as part of the Winter 2016 class. The company recently raised $4.5 million in seed funding which was led by Maven Ventures. Notably, both Maven and Y Combinator were investors in Cruise. There's very little known about the startup, but the site and past coverage of the company focus on developing autonomous technology on the cheap. The co-founders of the company, Michael Skupien and Alex Rodrigues, previously retrofitted golf carts to drive autonomously around the University of Waterloo in 2015 and other college campuses. "We constructed a self-driving vehicle for public roads faster and cheaper than anyone in history. In an industry filled with billion dollar titans we are fast, lean and creative," the site reads. The company expects to launch officially in February and should disclose more details on its plans then. More Auto-Tech Startups To Watch These other companies wouldn't qualify as self-driving startups in their current iterations but have ambitions to lend some or all of their capabilities to power autonomous tech: Pearl Auto, Nauto, Driversiti, Quanergy, and Zendrive. © 2017 Re/Code under contract with NewsEdge.

Picture: AP/Evan Vucci James CovertNew York Post FOR TIM Cook, the end of 2016 could not have come soon enough. Apple’s chief executive has been battling lacklustre results at the Cupertino, California-based tech giant, with critics blaming ho-hum sales on an increasingly “stale” line-up of gadgets — including the iPhone. The New York Post reports the most recent evidence came Friday, with a report from Japanese news agency Nikkei that Apple will slash production of the iPhone 7 by about 10 per cent because it “has sold more sluggishly than expected.” The downbeat news echoed this spring, when Mr Cook was forced to announce a dismal milestone: Quarterly sales of the iPhone — by many measures the most successful consumer product in history — dropped for the first time ever. “This, too, shall pass,” Mr Cook insisted on a call with Wall Street analysts in April. “The future of Apple is very bright.” Some investors aren’t so sure. Mr Cook had pleaded that the iPhone 6S — whose sales dropped 15 per cent and 16 per cent in the spring and summer quarters, respectively — was more or less a placeholder product ahead of the iPhone 7. But when the iPhone 7 got unveiled in September, the biggest difference reviewers found between it and the 6 models was that it lacked a headphone jack — a switch that many actually found annoying. The new iPhones did not impress everybody. Picture: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images/AFPSource:AFP The news was the latest disappointment for Apple shareholders, who have weathered a bumpy ride this year. The stock rose 10.8 per cent this year, but that’s short of the Dow Jones industrial average, which added more than 15 per cent. It’s not just stale product updates that are now plaguing Apple. Lately, execution under Mr Cook looks slipshod. The iPhone 7’s painful pivot for customers came as Apple announced the AirPods, a wireless set of headphones to accompany the jackless iPhone 7. But the $179 AirPods soon got delayed past a promised October shipment date and weren’t available to many customers until after Christmas. The snafu was a particular embarrassment for Mr Cook, who was tapped as Steve Jobs’ successor in 2012 partly for his prowess in running a tight supply chain for products. Touring the New York Stock Exchange earlier this week, Mr Cook claimed the AirPods were “a runaway success” — a typically vague pronouncement with no numbers in it. Separately, this fall Apple received a mixed reception to a long-awaited upgrade the MacBook Pro. The biggest redesign of Apple’s flagship laptop in eight years added a sleek “touch bar” to replace the row of function keys above the keyboard. Reviewers mainly noticed, however, that the new MacBook Pro’s battery life fell short of the previous model’s. Apple sales Looking ahead to 2017, many are pinning hopes to the next iPhone. A rumoured “iPhone 8” is expected to get a significant overhaul, possibly with a bigger screen and a body that’s made entirely of glass. Still, many investors remain troubled about the company’s direction, as new projects including an Apple car have reportedly run into problems. “There’s no question Apple’s best days are behind it,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said earlier this year. In addition to its product problems, Mr Sacconaghi continues to cite the challenge of tacking any significant gains onto Apple’s already massive market cap, which is still the world’s biggest at nearly $620 billion. Indeed, the biggest reason to buy Apple shares, according to many bulls, has nothing to do with the company’s products. Rather, it’s the prospect of a massive stock buyback in the event that Apple gets a tax holiday from the Trump administration to bring its mountain of overseas cash back to the US.

Will 2017 be the year when the self-driving car really takes off? Will companies like Apple continue to dominate consumers’ wish lists, or will new startups emerge to challenge the larger, more established brands? For every groundbreaking development that comes along to shift the ways people live their lives, there are plenty of examples like virtual reality — buzzy tech that flooded news feeds and found a place on every “tech trends of 2016” list — that have yet to live up to the all the hype.  CBS News asked some experts for their thoughts on how technology might make its mark in 2017.  Shift in consumer tech 2017 may be a year when we continue to see innovative updates to already existing tech rather than a big, splashy new device that makes waves. The era of the “one, big, monumental ‘thing’ that everyone is focused on” seems to have hit a “plateau,” CNET senior editor Dan Ackerman told CBS News.  “You know, we are at the point when even the coolest, most exciting phone that came out hit a plateau in development. You see things like laptops have this continued evolution,” Ackerman said of the focus on updates to what has already been on the market.  One thing that Ackerman said to look out for is the rise of the self-driving car. Autonomous vehicles have certainly been in the headlines lately. Just before Christmas, Uber shifted its self-driving car pilot program from San Francisco to Arizona as communities continue to struggle with how to regulate this radical new approach on the roads.  Ackerman said that, despite these setbacks, 2017 could be the year when self-driving cars become more present. “Expect to see a ton of developments in terms of automatic tech and car tech,” Ackerman added. “As a New Yorker, I don’t think about having a car, but the only kind of car I would have is a self-driving car. For skeptics, it’s very important seeing them on the streets. They’re much faster that anyone could predicted. I think we’re on the cusp of having them be a thing. Of course, Uber had to withdraw them from San Francisco, but you’re going to see a lot of interest in that space very soon.” Another piece of consumer technology Ackerman thinks will really take off this year is the OLED TV. These high-end televisions could be the trend that will be most visible in everyday households. For those not familiar, televisions that use OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diodes) have even better picture quality than standard HDTVs.  “OLED TV is nothing new, but they will be much more mainstream next year,” Ackerman predicted. “When we first saw OLED TV, you know, the technology blew us away at CES maybe four or five years ago. But it was just a handful of very high-end TVs. Hopefully 2017 is the year they will be less expensive and get more mainstream-priced.”  The rise of artificial intelligence From Siri and Cortana to cybersecurity, smart homes and even smart toys, artificial intelligence has increasingly found a place in a wide range of industries and applications. For Sergey Gribrov, a partner at Flint Capital, a venture capital fund that focuses on businesses in VR and augmented realty among other fields, AI will start to move “big data” aggregation in a direction of making people’s day-to-day lives easier.  “You have AI in cybersecurity, for instance, where AI can be used to predict cyberattacks. Look at AI with wearable devices where it is looking at wide amounts of data, culling that information, and synthesizing it quickly. You’re now moving in a direction where AI is using this data aggregation and using it to make predictions,” Gibrov told CBS News.  While Gibrov chatted on the phone, he accidentally activated his Alexa, Amazon’s digital personal assistant that is used through the Amazon Echo speaker device. For Gibrov, it was a funny accident that underscored a point — AI has become pretty ubiquitous already in a way that no longer seems like science fiction. “You know, you have AI telling you what your schedule is, what time you wake up. More and more, you have AI kind of helping you doing things in all aspects of life, at home and at work,” he stressed. “AI will start just analyzing data to predict the future. Look at self-driving cars — you go into your car and turn right, the AI in your car will know, will be able to predict where you would head as part of your routine. Maybe it knows where you are going to go shop. AI will help us guide us as we go on our ways.” Of course, the arrival of ever-smarter machines prompts familiar concerns. As the legendary physicist Stephen Hawking once put it, AI could be either “the best or worst thing ever to happen to humanity.” Will more advanced AI pose a threat to human agency? Gibrov said that is a common fear, but he views AI as the ultimate assistant — not a replacement for human decision-making. “Hopefully, we will not get into a point when AI will replace people — I don’t think that will happen. I think we will get AI to outsource what we don’t want to do. People will have more time to do the things they enjoy doing. That’s what I think we’ll see even more of in 2017,” he said. Social media in the year ahead From the president-elect to teenagers bored in class, social media is pretty much used by everyone. For Victor Pineiro, vice president of social media at Brooklyn-based digital agency Big Spaceship, it is always difficult to predict exactly how people will adopt new trends or use existing platforms in the future.  “My favorite example is one of the saddest of social media trends. Vine died and went away,” he said, referring to the Twitter-owned platform for making and sharing six-second videos. “Vine is a good example of a social platform that everyone thought would be ‘x’ and it actually ended up being ‘y.’ It was supposed to be the video version of Twitter, but most people were actually taking in content made by just like 10 or 20 major influencers. It was a form of entertainment, it was ‘TV’.” For Pineiro, who in 2013 was named one of Business Insider’s 30 most creative people in social media, the past year showed that people are moving toward being what he called “passive content creators” — a trend that looks to continue into 2017.  “Less people are posting, it’s more of a ‘lean back’ experience. Then again, there is still a lot of content being created with Snapchat. I mean, one of the big trends on social is Instagram copying something like Snapchat. My theory of what is happening, what Snapchat was able to do that Instagram wants to emulate, is moving to a platform for content creators who create messy and in-the-moment content that goes away and doesn’t matter. It disappears, it’s more ephemeral — people are looking for those fleeting moments, rather than something set in stone.” Pineiro also highlighted the fact that live video is an interesting development for a company like Facebook that has seen its sheen of “cool” chip away as older consumers become more of its core audience than millennials or the younger “Generation Z.” “For a lot of 2016, the best brands could do was create a live video and find a way to put non-live videos into the live video format to get more views — they were using Facebook’s new tools to their benefit,” he said of brands and users looking for ways to find relevance through a social platform that is something of a dinosaur in tech years compared to the Snapchats of the world. Another social media trend he’s keeping an eye on is the rise of fake news and its impact on real-world events. Moving forward, “Facebook has to be held accountable for the information and misinformation that it is feeding” its audience, Pineiro said. The new tech leaders When looking at the year ahead, Ackerman said it will be interesting to see who emerges dominant in the larger tech space.  “It’s become tougher recently for one company to really be at the lead,” Ackerman said. “Look, it’s hard for a small startup company to capture the attention that bigger companies have, but that being said, there are exciting exciting new spaces out there.”  Sometimes, one gadget on its own could be enough to seize the attention of consumers and win over skeptics — but that kind of success is rare.  Pineiro used the example of Google Glass, which debuted to huge publicity but ultimately failed to capture the consumer’s imagination.  “It became kind of the slow-motion failure of a product that we all saw. Now, you see this completely different approach to something similar with Snapchat Spectacles,” Pineiro said. “It’s marketed as a toy and not a tool, and so far, I’m very curious to see what Snapchat does. What does this mean as Snapchat for a platform moving forward? I foresee Snapchat heading into this heightened territory for AR [augmented reality] where they are downplaying the tech as a ‘toy’ and keeping it in that millennial state of mind. They are taking away the barriers between somebody’s experiences and giving them the ability to share them.” Does this mean social media companies like Snapchat could move from the world of apps to become consumer product leaders? Ackerman said that he has his eye on companies like Amazon and Google also following this trend — tech companies that aren’t traditional gadget-makers moving into the hardware side of things.  “You know you have Amazon and Google moving into this space rapidly,” Ackerman said. “You have very big data-driven companies that have more information at their disposal than hardware companies and they are continuing to move into the hardware space. That’s something to look out for in the new year.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) NEW YORK (AP) — If you’re cleaning out your closets for the new year, or need some spare cash after the holidays, your old stuff can help fill up your wallet. A number of websites and apps make it easier to sell used smartphones, furniture and clothes. Here’s where to go to sell your unwanted stuff and earn some extra bucks: GADGETS If you got the latest tablet or smartphone during the holidays, don’t let the old ones go to the forgotten junk drawer. Gazelle and NextWorth will buy your unwanted electronics depending on its condition. Recently, Gazelle was offering $215 for an iPhone 6s in good condition on Verizon’s cellphone network. Other options include Apple, which will pay you in Apple Store gift cards for some products. And retailers Target and Best Buy will take your electronics online or at some of its stores in exchange for gift cards. You can also try selling unwanted electronics on eBay, which may charge listing fees, or Facebook’s recently launched marketplace, which is free, and found within the social media company’s app. CLOTHING For women’s, men’s or children’s clothing, there’s Poshmark. The company charges $2.95 for items sold for under $15 and takes 20 percent for items sold for more than $15. With ThredUP, the website will send you a box to fill with brand-name women’s or children’s clothing that it tries to sell for you if. You can keep 5 percent to as much as 80 percent of the amount an item is sold for, depending on the sell price. At Tradesy, you can list designer bags, shoes and clothing, with Tradesy taking as much as 17.8 percent of the sale price. You can also selling used clothing on eBay, which may charge some listing fees. FURNITURE For couches, mirrors and other household items, try Craigslist or Facebook marketplace. Some good photos in the listing, and measurements of the items, can help them better attract a buyer. But with those options, only accept cash or online payments such as PayPal, since requests to pay by check can be a sign of a scam. If you live in New York, Washington or northern New Jersey, AptDeco lets you list used furniture and can arrange for shipping and delivery, but charges sellers 23 percent of the price an item is sold for. GIFT CARDS If you got a gift card over the holidays you know you won’t use, you can sell them at a number of sites including CardCash, Cardpool and Giftcard Zen. How much money you get depends on a number of factors, including how likely someone else will want to buy it from the gift card seller. Recently, CardCash was offering $87 for a $100 gift card from Target, a 23 percent loss. You can also trying selling it on your own through eBay. TOYS For unopened toys such as Lego sets or American Doll dresses, try the Brian’s Toys website. It will quote you the price it will pay on its site, or download the Brian’s Toys app, which lets you scan the toy’s barcode for a quote. You can also try eBay, Craigslist or Amazon to sell unwanted toys. _____ Contact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani . Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Crunch Network It’s The Jons 2016! Posted yesterday by Jon Evans (@rezendi), Columnist 0 SHARES Next Story Consider ethics when designing new technologies Happy New Year! 2016 was … well, we will not soon forget it. Brexit; Trump; the Grim Reaper’s celebrity killing spree; and, on the upside, a lot of magnificent tech achievements and breakthroughs. But The Jons are not about that. The Jons, an annual award named (in an awe-inspiring fit of humility) after myself, go to tech’s more dubious achievers. And hoo boy were there a lot of those this year. And so, with no further ado: the second annual Jon Awards For Dubious Technical Achievement! THE YES THERE IS SUCH A THING AS BAD PUBLICITY AWARD FOR SPONTANEOUS BRAND COMBUSTION To Samsung, whose Galaxy Note 7 phablet was called out by name before every single flight I took for months, for fear that one would explode and kill us all. You’d think you couldn’t even pay for such publicity. Turns out you can, but it’ll cost you nearly $20 billion. THE GRINCH WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS AWARD FOR REALITY DISTORTION FIELD DISRUPTION To that nasty John Carreyrou, who just wouldn’t stop picking on poor victimized Theranos, which, as a direct result, is now basically dead. Doesn’t he know that truth doesn’t matter any more in our post-factual world? They believed their technology worked. Or, I mean, at least they hoped it did. Or would. One day. Shouldn’t that be all that matters? It’s only blood tests, after all. THE MINISTRY OF PEACE AWARD FOR IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH To Julian Assange, for his transition from a self-proclaimed “we open governments” anti-authoritarian crusader to the (figure)head of an organization that literally reposts Russian press releases. O Julian, Julian, wherefore art thou, Julian? THE YOU DON’T KNOW JACK AWARD FOR PREMATURE FORCED OBSOLESCENCE To Apple, of course, for eliminating the headphone jack from the iPhone; killing MagSafe in favor of USB-C on new MacBooks; and then refusing to supply any other ports on those MacBooks, meaning that, remarkably, that if you go to an Apple Store and buy a new iPhone and a new MacBook, you cannot plug the former directly into the latter. THE DIE DAMN YOU WHY WON’T YOU DIE FREDDY JASON TERMINATOR AWARD FOR PIGHEADEDLY CONTINUING TO EXIST To Bitcoin, which has been pronounced dead more times than Michael Myers, and yet somehow still keeps lumbering along, slowly, crudely, and seemingly unstoppably. THE BROGAN BAMBROGAN AWARD FOR BEING BROGAN BAMBROGAN IN THE BROGAN BAMBROGAN SCANDAL This story had all the allegations: a hangman’s noose! A VC tripling the salary of a PR rep after starting to date her! The sacrifice of great technology on the altars of marketing and self-promotion! Counter-allegations of toxic misconduct and abusive behavior! Alas, the lawsuits were settled without trial. But still. Brogan BamBrogan! THE PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE MAN BEHIND THE BLOCKCHAIN! AWARD FOR CONNING THE TECHNICALLY INEPT To Craig Wright, for briefly half-convincing people who should have known better that he is “Satoshi Nakamoti,” Bitcoin’s creator (he isn’t) and provoking this incredibly long, incredibly credulous, incredibly cringeworthy London Review Of Books piece by someone who’s clearly never written a line of code in his life. Don’t read it: read Sarah Jeong’s hilariously barbed Twitter takedown of it. THE BUT REALLY, WHAT IS TRUTH ANYWAYS AWARD FOR RESPONDING TO FAKE NEWS WITH ONTOLOGICAL DEFIANCE To Facebook’s PR team, who, desperate to disavow any responsibility for widespread American belief in so so much ludicrous bullshit, literally asked a journalist that: On the phone with Facebook PR and they literally ask me "what is truth" — Nellie Bowles (@NellieBowles) November 15, 2016 THE YOU SOUNDED LIKE AN IDIOT EVEN BEFORE YOU ADDED THE WORD CYBER AWARD FOR BELIEF IN CYBER BOOGEYMEN UNDER THE CYBER BED To the San Bernardino District Attorney’s office, for claiming that the infamous iPhone 5c used by mass murderer Syed Farook had to be unlocked for fear that it contained a “lying-dormant cyber pathogen” that might attack American infrastructure. They are more likely to find Amelia Earhart on that phone than this. https://t.co/IuwvmdqcpL — Jon Evans (@rezendi) March 4, 2016 THE ONLY NINETY MORE MAGIKARP TO GO BEFORE I CAN EVOLVE A GYARADOS AWARD FOR BRIEFLY DIVORCING WHAT FELT LIKE HALF THE PLANET FROM REALITY IN FAVOR OF VIRTUAL JACKBOOTED EXPLOITATION To Pokémon Go, of course, the release of which prompted many millions to stampede through cities seeking to ambush and brutally imprison helpless, innocent virtual creatures who, after being forced to savagely fight one another in vicious Thunderdome-like arenas, are ultimately transferred to a mysterious “professor” who will doubtless perform unspeakable experiments on them. All of which is clearly laying the cultural groundwork for the autocracies to come. Fight the fascism! (And kindly overlook the fact that I’m midway through level 24 myself, and have evolved at least one Gyarados.) THE IF YOU KEEP WIPING AT LEAST SOME OF THAT EGG MIGHT COME OFF YOUR FACE AWARD FOR PRIDE GOING BEFORE A VERY HUMPTY-DUMPTY-LIKE FALL To the creators and investors in “The DAO,” who put $150 million into a “distributed autonomous organization” built atop Ethereum’s blockchain, amid much fanfare and claims of inviolable, unstoppable software. After the DAO was (as I warned) hacked and its money siphoned out, though, it was remarkable how fast the very same people who until then had trumpeted “irrefutable computer code … not influenced by outside forces … not controlled by its creators” switched to calling for the intervention of creators and outside forces to repair the damage caused by the code. So much for the courage of one’s convictions! THE SECURITY BY NOT LETTING THE LEFT HAND KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT HAND IS DOING AWARD FOR KEEPING YOUR USERS MAXIMALLY UNSAFE To Yahoo!, who didn’t just discover this year that they’d suffered two separate userinfo hacks, one for half a billion users and one for a whole cool B; they also installed a not-unlike-a-rootkit tool to scan incoming emails at the NSA’s behest — which would be bad enough — but best of all, they apparently did this without telling their security team. Wow. Congratulations, of a sort, to the winners of the Jons! All recipients shall receive a bobblehead of myself made up as a Blue Man, as per the image on this post,1 which will doubtless become coveted and increasingly valuable collectibles. And, of course, all winners shall be remembered by posterity forevermore. 1Bobbleheads shall only be distributed if and when available and convenient.

While WinX DVD Ripper Platinum and three other featured media programs are hitting the discount shelve, a new wave of online sales is coming, playing like a Christmas Deal sequel. Every Windows computer owner on the planet is in the invitation list of the whopping 80% off gift “party”: https://www.winxdvd.com/specialoffer/holiday-offer.htm Digiarty’s consumer market is seeing a new boom in the past year (2016), especially in the year-end when most DVD collectors and movie addicts can afford both time and money to be couch potatoes. “We Windows program team hit a record high of daily sales on Boxing Day 2016, stirring up frenzy in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and many other countries,” Angie Tong, Manager of Digiarty Software says delightfully. For consumers, holiday means spending money like water, yet partly unconsciously. The discounted gift pack is trying its utmost to help cut down revelers’ expenses during New Year and deliver holiday joy by providing affordable solutions for flexible video and music enjoyment on and off holiday trips, briefly: WinX DVD Ripper Platinum – digitalize holiday movies and newly released DVDs; rip any DVDs to MP4, MPEG2, AVI, WMV, FLV, MOV and other videos for use personally in hard drive, media server, etc.; convert DVDs to video/audio files that can be played on iOS/Android/Windows tablets, mobile phones, PC, Mac, TVs and game consoles. WinX HD Video Converter Deluxe – make any kinds of videos freely editable, usable and sharable; downsize and convert HD/4K/8K video files for playing on the go, for example, on Apple iPhone 7, iPad mini, iPod Touch, Apple TV, Samsung/HTC/Google/Huawei phones, Sony PSP, Xbox and more; download videos or music from over 300 popular online websites; make photo slideshows and edit camera-shot videos for holidays. WinX DVD Copy Pro – make lossless backup for classic movies, cherished DVDs with scratches and new DVDs containing bad sectors and copy protections – the outputs can be DVD disc, ISO image file, MPEG2 video and VIDEO_TS folder; copy DVD chapters, extract audio/video part; mount DVD ISO image and burn ISO image or VIDEO_TS folder to DVD disc. 5KPlayer – play DVDs, videos, music and radios on a computer; stream or mirror media files from iPhone/iPad/iPod to Mac/PC/Apple TV with built-in AirPlay sender/receiver/mirroring and screen recording features; download online videos at free will. Looking back on the past year, Digiarty not only reinforces the entrenched programs, but also rolls out a trendier product line.

With on-track development planning, Digiarty is confident to be a major driving force in the industry in the looming Year 2017. Pricing and Availability “WinX 2017 New Year Gift Pack” wrapped with a full-featured DVD ripper, an HD video converter, a DVD cloner and a media player is at the lowest price ever – $30.95 for 1PC and $39.95 for 3 PCs, up to 80% off discount.

Swiss watchmakers, who once dismissed smartwatches as a fashion accessory, are racing to grab a share of a fast-growing market via technology partnerships and stepping up investments. "If it is true that Apple has sold around 20 million Apple Watches and has a market share of around 50 percent, then the potential is enormous," said Jean-Claude Biver, head of LVMH watch brands including TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith. "A luxury market arises as soon as people want to differentiate themselves from the masses. That is the case here as well. With our know-how, Swiss quality and prestige we have the best preconditions to master this segment too," he told Swiss paper SonntagsBlick. TAG Heuer, for instance, partnered with U.S. technology firms Google and Intel for its TAG Heuer Connected watch, whose first units offered at just under 1,400 Swiss francs ($1,375) apiece sold out quickly last year. The Swiss watch industry, which includes Swatch and Richemont, may overall be selling fewer timepieces as exports decline 15 months in a row but it is not facing an existential crisis as in the 1970s, Biver said. He said the industry was instead consolidating as top brands boost market share.

The usually reliable SamMobile reports on a tip-off that Samsung is working on new AirPod-style earbuds of its own to launch alongside the phone in a few months, though as yet it's not clear if they'll be bundled with the handset or offered as an optional accessory. The company already makes the Gear Icon X set, but these will be a new line, source say. Also up in the air is a decision on whether the Galaxy S8 will ditch the 3.5mm audio jack or not - apparently some prototypes still include the port while others don't. Sounds legit That's just about all we know about these wireless earbuds right now, and they don't even have a catchy name yet. Samsung recently bought audio company Harman, so we may see some of that acquired technology and expertise appear in the new wireless gadget. The South Korean company has also announced that it's unveiling a host of high-end audio gear at the CES expo next week, including a wireless speaker and a sound bar. It's unlikely that the new headphones are ready to be shown off yet, but it's possible. So we can add wireless earbuds to the list of features we're expecting from the Samsung Galaxy S8 - a list that already includes a 4K screen, 6GB of RAM, an iris scanner and maybe a curved screen. The phone is expected to launch anywhere between February and April.

Tuesday 3 Jan 2017 / Tehran - 07:06 / GMT - 03:36 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology Sun Jan 01, 2017 1:4 Future Apple AirPods May Use Magnetic Ear Hooks to Keep Them off Ground Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Apple’s new AirPods have been generally well received since their release, but some users have been complaining of one major issue — they tend to fall out and when that happens it would be very easy for them to get lost. The solution? Well, according to new Apple patent uncovered by Patently Apple, it’s a magnetic mechanism that wraps around the user’s ear. The magnets attract each other through the ear tissue, keeping the AirPods in place and ensuring that they don’t get lost. Of course, it’s not certain if Apple filed this patent with AirPods in mind — one of the images clearly shows a wired pair of headphones, and the patent was filed in June. The concept, however, would help keep both wired and wireless earbuds in place. The issue of keeping AirPods in the ear has been arguably the biggest issue related to the AirPods, and for good reason — they’re pretty expensive little devices, so losing them is definitely not something you want to do. It’s possible that Apple decided against using the ear hooks for aesthetic reasons — Apple is known for its excellent design and the ear hooks in the patent don’t exactly look great. Not only that but the design of the charging case would have to change with the ear hooks. Some reports indicate that the patent could be implemented with future versions and given the hullaballoo surrounding keeping AirPods in, we wouldn’t be totally surprised. It’s also possible, however, that Apple patented the design but ultimately ended up nixing it. Apple isn’t totally new to the concept of ear hooks — the Apple-owned Beats uses ear hooks for its Powerbeats line, but those earbuds are a little more sports-focused than the AirPods, which are more aimed at day-to-day use. It will be interesting to see if Apple does end up implementing the concept of ear hooks. One thing, however, is for sure — users will seriously appreciate a way to keep those pricey earbuds in their ear.         LATEST STORIES (8) Iraqi Chopper Striking ISIL Positions Near Tal Afar Saudi Arabia's Costly War on Yemen and Its Great Losses in 2016 Iraqi Special Forces Recapture Another Neighborhood in Eastern Mosul Iraqi Special Forces Evacuate Civilians from Danger Zone in Mosul Elite Iraqi Forces in Battle with ISIL Militants in Mosul Mosul Operations: ISIL Terrorists Scatter in Fear After Tough Offensive by Iraqi Popular Forces Over 32 Killed, 61 Wounded as Blast Hits Sadr City Area of Baghdad Iran Opens Line of Small Caliber Ammunition NIOC Approves Qualification of 29 Foreign Energy Firms for Int'l Tenders Eternal Condemnation: Marking the First Anniversary of Sheikh Nimr’s Execution by Riyadh Turkey Mourns Victims of Istanbul Nightclub Attack Official: Iran's Petchem Exports to Hit 20mln Tons by Yearend Fabulous Fireworks Across World Greet 2017 Iran Ups Steel Exports by 51 Percent in 8 Months Damascus: Militants in One More Town Joining Peace Agreement with Syrian Gov't Iraqi Chopper Striking ISIL Positions Near Tal Afar TEHRAN (FNA)- Iraqi choppers struck at ISIL gathering positions near Tal Afar, West of Mosul.

Last year they caused a massive fire which burnt down 1,000 homes. Hong Kong celebrated with a street party and a massive fireworks display over Victoria Harbour. Police expected 330,000 people to attend, "South China Morning Post," reported. Police said 330,000 people were expected to watch Hong Kong's fireworks In Irkutsk celebrations were dampened following the deaths of 77 people over the past month due to contaminated alcohol sold as bath oil, triggering an emergency declaration. In Singapore there was a large fireworks display over Marina Bay. Hotel Marina Bay Sands posted a photo on Twitter. 1530 Half an hour after its southern neighbor, the isolated Democratic People's Republic of Korea celebrated new year. Fireworks lit up the capital Pyongyang as custodians reportedly rang national treasure the Pyongyang Bell.  State-run television broadcast the display. 1500 Japan, South Korea, East Timor, part of Russia and part of Indonesia all clocked over to 2017. Millions of people visited temples across Japan, including at Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, which expected 3 million visits over the next three days. "Japan Today" reported up to 35 percent of the country's television audience will watch the annual four-hour "Kohaku Uta Gassen" variety show.  Millions of people in Japan make midnight temple visits to welcome the new year In the Korean capital of Seoul, hundreds of thousands of people ushered in the new year with massive protests against disgraced President Park Geun-hye. 1440 US President-elect Donald Trump sent an unusual new year greeting to his Twitter followers.  "Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love," he wrote. 1430 About 5,000 people gathered to welcome the new year in the northern Australian city of Darwin, according to national broadcaster ABC. The central city of Alice Springs was on the same schedule. 1400 The eastern Australian state of Queensland, including a reported 90,000 people in the city of Brisbane welcomed the transition with fireworks. The city's official Twitter account posted a picture of festivities. Papuan capital Port Moresby, further regions of Antarctica and Guam, where surfers had reportedly enjoyed a final great swell of the year, entered 2017 at the same time, a Tweet from a local newspaper showed. 1330 Half an hour later, clocks in the southern Australian city of Adelaide ticked over.  1300 Midnight celebrations in Sydney kicked off with more than one million people lining the shores of Sydney Harbor. The biggest fireworks display in the city's history paid tribute to many artists who had died in 2016, including a shower of purple fireworks as Prince's "Purple Rain" played and fireworks in the shapes of planets in a nod to David Bowie. A Tweet from the City of Sydney showed a snapshot of the display. About 500,000 people in the Australian city of Melbourne, and the people of Vanuatu, Micronesia, the Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, parts of Antarctica, and parts of Russia all gathered to welcome 2017 as well. 1200 The Republic of Nauru, the tiny island nation home to hundreds of refugees mandatorily detained by Australia immigration authorities, was next in line to celebrate the new year. The island's official Twitter account posted a picture of revelries in the country, which has all but banned foreign journalists. Other areas to celebrate included some eastern parts of Russia, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands, which has recently suffered widespread internet blackouts. 1100 - Mainland New Zealand welcomed the new year with a midnight fireworks and laser display in Auckland. It launched a reported 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of fireworks over five minutes from the city's iconic  328-meter Sky Tower in front of an estimated crowd of 30,000. 1000 - The people of Samoa, Kiribati and Tonga were the first in the world to celebrate the New Year. A total 400,000 residents of the Pacific islands, brought in 2017 with feasts and cheers. Parts of Samoa including its capital Apia were flooded by continuing heavy rains, forcing celebrations under cover. Almost straddling the international date line, the small country legally switched over their time zone in 2012 to avoid being 23 hours behind major trade partner New Zealand.  Following the three Pacific Islands the 600 residents of New Zealand's remote archipelago of Chatham, about 680 kilometers (422 miles) southeast of the main islands will pop the Champagne corks. Half an hour later, mainland New Zealand and the population of Fiji will begin the countdown. More than one million people are expected to gather for Sydney's fireworks display  "This year, sadly, we saw the loss of many music and entertainment legends around the world," fireworks co-producer Catherine Flanagan said. "So celebrating their music as part of Sydney New Year's Eve fireworks displays is an opportunity to reflect on the year that has been and what the future may hold." In Germany, people were preparing to welcome in the new year beginning with the ceremonial broadcasting of cult British TV classic Dinner for One. Authorities in Germany placed bans on the right-wing extremist National Party of Germany (NPD) and the populist, anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) from holding rallies in Cologne, the site of mass sexual attacks by immigrants on the evening of December 31st last year, citing safety concerns. The city beefed up security  this year. In Madrid thousands of locals and tourists celebrated one day early on Friday night thanks to a city clock that tests its bell early.  In the square of Puerto del Sol revelers met each 12 strikes of the bell tower with cheers and revelry at midnight, eating a grape with each chime to bring good luck. This New Year's Eve December 31st will be one second longer than usual as keepers of the time add a leap second to compensate for the Earth's slightly slower rotation.

By Oliver Cragg January 1, 2017 08:00 GMT Close Assassin's Creed film UK launch trailer 20th Century Fox Michael Fassbender pulls double-duty as modern day convicted murderer-turned-kidnapee Callum Lynch and Spanish assassin Aguilar de Nerha in 15th century Spain, with Lynch living out the memories of his murder-maestro ancestor under duress from shady mega-corp Absetergo - the public face of the power-hungry order of Templars, who are waging an eternal war with the order of assassins over the MacGuffin-tastic Apple of Eden. Can Assassin's Creed finally dilute the poisoned well of sludge that is the video game-to-movie adaptation genre? Nope. When the first trailer for Assassin's Creed arrived in May 2016, fans of the top-selling video game series quickly tore it apart on message boards and social media – but not for the kind of reasons you might expect. Any potential backlash against a perceived lack of authenticity to the source material failed to materialise. Even the film's re-vamped take on the Animus – now a mechanical creation that resembles an arcade claw crane that spent the weekend in 'The Matrix' – drew little ire from the Creed's faithful fan-base. Instead, it was music producer-turned-rapper-turned-living embodiment of the human ego, Kanye West, that drew the most flak, as the outspoken musician's "I Am A God" played over the meticulously spliced footage. The scuzzy bass notes and West's boastful rhetoric was too ostentatious, too ill-fitting, cried many, leading to re-cut trailers with other, "better" music. The track is notable by its omission in the final film, but in hindsight, after watching the portentous train wreck that is director Justin Kurzel's game-to-movie adaption, the track's self-aggrandising style (but certainly not its quality) aptly represents the bull-headed, self-important tosh depicted on screen. French video game publisher Ubisoft's second license to tread the murky film-of-the-game waters (after the far superior, but still naff Prince of Persia: Sands of Time) suffers throughout from woeful acting, a repulsive, stodgy colour palette, and a screenplay that would be laughable if it understood what normal human emotions are. As an example, here are two choice dialogue exchanges from Assassin's Creed, presented without comment: "Why the aggression?" "I'm an aggressive person." "What now?" "We fight." Assassin's Creed opens with a sequence that sets the stage for the film's humdrum plot and inexorable tone in stunning fashion, as the lead character, Lynch (Fassbender), is executed by lethal injection. Minutes away from this scene, a flashback shows a younger Lynch walking in on his mother's blood-spattered corpse – murdered by her spouse for reasons unknown. Lynch battles with the concept of free will – a feeling you might share when considering walking out of the theatre20th Century Fox Both of these events are not exactly what they seem at first – Lynch is merely being sedated by Abstergo, and the deeper relationship between his parents plays a not-so-crucial role in film's inane climax – and the film would like you to think that there is a broader web of conspiracy and intrigue running beneath these cold, clinical moments. Instead, these "edgy" sequences come across as a desperate attempt at framing the film's endless reams of flimsy, psuedo-philosophical/theological pondering on free will, ancestral bloodlines and faith as having some kind of grave importance to Lynch's narrative destiny, rather than being what it actually is: nonsensical waffle that even literary hack Dan Brown would scoff at. As a whole, the po-faced, unfettered, unwarranted sincerity – both visual and verbal – sits at odds with premise's inherent ridiculousness – we are told in a grand revelation that the film's uber-MacGuffin, the Apple of Eden, contains the genetic code for free will – but it also has no place in a film that features what are ostensibly superheroes, dressed in (relatively well designed) hooded, dagger-clad garb who fearlessly and acrobatically leap off towering structures Tom Daley-style, but without a pool to soften the landing. Somehow though, the cast fall hook line and sinker for the relentless gloom. Fassbender grimaces and gurns his way through every scene as both the insanely gullible Lynch, and the mostly wordless, part-time protagonist, Aguilar. Marion Cotillard's emotionless, monotone delivery resembles what an audition for Hal 9000 in a 2001: A Space Odyssey remake might sound like, and Jeremy Irons hams it up in typical villainous Jeremy Irons fashion, but without any interesting to actually say. 1 of 2 Cotillard and Fassbender's scenes frequently descend into a mixture of vapid dialogue and vacant expressions20th Century Fox Cotillard and Fassbender's scenes frequently descend into a mixture of vapid dialogue and vacant expressions20th Century Fox Fassbender's Spanish accent is... quite something.20th Century Fox Aside from a scant number of interjections from the ever-excellent Michael K. Williams, dreary humourlessness quickly becomes the status quo. Not every mainstream action film needs to adopt Marvel's glib twang, but an unwaveringly solemn tone isn't a solid foundation for a thrilling romp. The film's most offensively boring scenes take place in the modern day, with the rooftop chases and fly-by shots found in the actual assassin-y bits establishing a vaguely convincing vision of what the Spanish Inquisition would look like if it took a detour in Middle-Earth. The appearance of trick blades, smoke bombs and other series staples combine well enough with the impressive parkour stunts – the latter assisted by a fluid camera that neatly emphasises verticality, cutting constantly between shots beneath and above the fleeing heroes. Series fans may find some solace and enjoyment in these free-running, blade-swinging scuffles, with promising actress Ariane Labed's fleeting, but engaging role as the apple of Aguilar's eye and fellow assassin Maria a particular highlight. Unfortunately, the past-present divide never fully resolves itself, with the constant cuts to Lynch undulating wildly while strapped into the Animus a jarring reminder that what we are witnessing in 15th century Spain is ultimately pointless window dressing for the dismal stodge set in the modern day. Our verdict Assassin's Creed Assassin's Creed ends with a sequel tease, implying with all the subtlety of a dagger to the face that the assassins and templars will be locked in cinematic duels for years to come. After suffering through a 110 minute smorgasbord of dispassionate performances, faux-intellectual posturing and clunky storytelling, this felt like a threat. Another video game-to-film adaptation rotten apple (of Eden).

A number of websites and apps make it easier to sell used smartphones, furniture and clothes. Here’s where to go to sell your unwanted stuff and earn some extra bucks: Gadgets If you got the latest tablet or smartphone during the holidays, don’t let the old ones go to the forgotten junk drawer. Gazelle and NextWorth will buy your unwanted electronics depending on their condition. Recently, Gazelle was offering $215 for an iPhone 6s in good condition on Verizon’s cellphone network. Other options include Apple, which will pay you in Apple Store gift cards for some products. And retailers Target and Best Buy will take your electronics online or at some of its stores in exchange for gift cards. You can also try selling unwanted electronics on eBay, which may charge listing fees, or Facebook’s recently launched marketplace, which is free, and found within the social media company’s app. Clothing For women’s, men’s or children’s clothing, there’s Poshmark. The company charges $2.95 for items sold for under $15 and takes 20 percent for items sold for more than $15. With ThredUP, the website will send you a box to fill with brand-name women’s or children’s clothing that it tries to sell for you. You can keep 5 percent to as much as 80 percent of the amount an item is sold for, depending on the sell price. At Tradesy, you can list designer bags, shoes and clothing, with Tradesy taking as much as 17.8 percent of the sale price. You can also sell used clothing on eBay, which may charge some listing fees. Furniture For couches, mirrors and other household items, try Craigslist or Facebook marketplace. Some good photos in the listing, and measurements of the items, can help them better attract a buyer. But with those options, only accept cash or online payments such as PayPal, since requests to pay by check can be a sign of a scam. If you live in New York, Washington or northern New Jersey, AptDeco lets you list used furniture and can arrange for shipping and delivery, but charges sellers 23 percent of the price an item is sold for. Gift cards If you got a gift card over the holidays you know you won’t use, you can sell them at a number of sites including CardCash, Cardpool and Giftcard Zen. How much money you get depends on a number of factors, including how likely someone else will want to buy it from the gift card seller. Recently, CardCash was offering $87 for a $100 gift card from Target, a 23 percent loss. You can also trying selling it on your own through eBay. Toys For unopened toys such as Lego sets or American Doll dresses, try the Brian’s Toys website. It will quote you the price it will pay on its site, or download the Brian’s Toys app, which lets you scan the toy’s barcode for a quote. You can also try eBay, Craigslist or Amazon to sell unwanted toys.

Please find your seats and silence your phones… it’s time now for the 12th annual Pogie Awards! This time of year, the web teems with “best products of the year” articles. But the Pogie awards are different. These are awards for the best feature ideas within products—even if the products themselves aren’t so hot. The point is to celebrate the inspiration that struck some designer or engineer—and to hail that idea’s successful journey out of committee, past the lawyers, and into the hands of the public. So what were the best ideas in tech of 2016? The envelopes, please! The Bright Idea Award The Smart Charge light bulb is an LED bulb, and that’s a great start. In other words, it lasts practically forever, and uses very little power. It’s the size of a normal bulb, so you can screw it into any lamp or fixture. Its big idea? In case of a power failure, this bulb stays on. It’s got its own battery backup. When the power’s out, this bulb behaves exactly as it always has, for a total of four more hours of light. (The battery recharges whenever the power isn’t out.) You’ve performed your last frantic hunt for a working flashlight. View photos The Smart Charge light bulb stays on even in a power failure.More But here’s where your mind will fall apart: You can still turn this bulb on and off from the wall switch, even when the power is out. How the—?? (It has something to do with checking the impedance of your house’s wiring. All I know is that the bulb doesn’t come on unless there’s at least one non-smart appliance on the same circuit, like a normal lightbulb.) The Sharp Focus Award Next up: The Sharp Focus Award. This year, the award goes to a strange, lovely little feature of the iPhone 7 Plus: Portrait Mode. The 7 Plus has two camera lenses: one wider angle, one a 2X zoom. Clever software lets you blend the zoom to any degree between them (or, using digital zooming, go all the way up to 10X). But the two-lens setup has a second benefit: It lets the camera tell the foreground subject apart from its background. And with that knowledge, the phone can create a soft blurry-background look, like what you see in professional portraits. View photos Blurry background brought to you by iPhone 7 Plus.More Now, the blur in this case is not optically created, the way an SLR makes it. It’s created with software—a glorified Photoshop filter. And Apple’s (AAPL) not the first company to try it. Some Samsung phones, years ago, offered a similar feature. But without dual lenses, those phones didn’t have great luck distinguishing the subject from its background, and you often wound up with hideous “leaking” of the blurriness effect. Apple’s effect on the other hand, generally looks fantastic, even when the outline of the subject is complex (like frizzy hair). As long as the distance is right and the light is good, the results are fantastic. One for the Kids Award We move on now to the One for the Kids Award. Booster seats for kids are kind of big and frustrating—basically, they’re not portable. Every time your kid gets in a taxi or a rental car or another family’s car, guess what? No booster seat. But the MiFold booster seat is so small, you can carry it anywhere. Instead of lifting the kid up, it pulls the seatbelt down, achieving the same safety effect without the bulk. View photos The MiFold folding booster seat in its opened-up position.More Read More Great, great idea. Find My Ride Award The winner of our Find My Ride award this year is the Uber Beacon, a wireless light that Uber drivers will soon be putting on their dashboards. Because it can glow any color, your app tells you what color to look for when you order your ride—so when the car pulls up, you’ll know it’s here for you. No more guessing games after dark. No more getting into the wrong Uber by accident. View photos You’ll never get into the wrong Uber again.More A simple, great idea. Straight Orientation Award And now we come to what the committee calls the Straight Orientation Award! And it goes this year to one particular feature on one particular drone. It’s called Smart Mode, and it’s on the Yuneec Typhoon H. This might take some explanation. In most drones of this type, the right joystick controls the flying direction. But that can be tricky if the drone has gotten turned around in flight. Suddenly, pushing the joystick forward doesn’t fly the drone forward; it may zoom in some totally unexpected direction, depending on where the nose is pointing. View photos The Yuneec Typhoon H eliminates confusion if your drone has gotten turned around in the sky.More But in Smart Mode, the drone always flies the way you’re pushing the stick, no matter which way the drone is facing. It’s brilliant, it’s optional, and it’s ingenious. Music to my Feet Award I’m particularly pleased that we can offer the world’s musicians a little something this year, in the form of the Music to my Feet Award. These days, many musicians don’t use sheet music on music stands; instead, they use iPads or phones or laptops to display the score. But then how do you turn the page in the middle of playing, when your hands are on your instrument? The iRig Blue Turn solves that problem neatly. It’s an inexpensive, compact, wireless foot pedal that lets you turn the page with a toe-press. View photos Turn your music pages by foot.More Total Recall Award These days, the internet places thousands of claims on our attention! In the course of a week, we read stuff in our email, in texts, in chats, in tweets, and on hundreds of web pages. Which is why the phrase for the new millennium is: “Oh, where did I read that?” Wonder no more! Atlas Recall is a photographic memory for your computer. It remembers every document, every web page, every email that’s crossed your screen—so you can search for it and pull it up later. View photos Atlas Recall tries to remember everything that’s ever crossed your screen.More It’s got its bugs and limitations, as I wrote in my full review. But remember: These awards go to the best ideas, not the best products—and this idea is sensational. The Pogie Ultimo 2016 And finally, we come to our biggest award of the evening: The Pogie Ultimo! The one idea that has the most potential to improve the lives of the downtrodden technology-using masses with a single, ingenious stroke. And that award goes to mesh WiFi! From the dawn of wireless, we’ve expected one WiFi router to broadcast WiFi signal to every corner of our homes. It’s an impossible task. Walls and corners and ceilings kill that idea. The result: DEAD SPOTS. But the new thing in routers this year is mesh networks. Instead of one WiFi transmitter, it’s a set of them, which you’re supposed to space evenly through your house. The result is a single “mesh network,” a roaming network, that blankets the entire house in good, strong, signal. (Their marketing pitch goes like this: Expecting a single router to fill an entire home with WiFi is like expecting one speaker to fill every room with music.) View photos Mesh WiFi networks: the end of dead spots.More Mesh WiFi smashes the dead-zone problem like a sledge hammer on an ant. It’s gorgeous, joyous, and drop-dead simple to set up.

PHOTO/ Bloomberg.com Apple Inc. wants India to offer tax concessions on iPhones that the company plans to manufacture in the country, a person with knowledge of the matter said. The company wrote to the industry ministry last month seeking lower import and manufacturing duties, the person said, asking not to be identified citing rules on speaking to the media. The concessions should continue even after the government rolls out its goods and services tax which is expected to subsume all existing tariffs, the person said. The Cupertino, California-based manufacturer of iPads and iPhones is keen to kick-start operations in the world’s fastest growing phone market as growth slows in countries such as China. Apple trails rivals selling cheaper handsets in the $2 trillion Indian economy and producing devices in the country could accelerate the roll out of its iconic retail stores to capture burgeoning demand in the world’s second-most populated nation. Apple’s path toward a bigger slice of Indian sales hasn’t been smooth. Its application to open stores was rejected as it fell foul of local rules that typically require at least 30 percent of components to be made locally before a foreign company can sell through their own outlets. Apple makes most of its products in China and doesn’t currently meet that criteria. Apple’s spokesman in India, and Mattu J.P. Singh, a spokeswoman at India’s Commerce and Industry Ministry didn’t immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants companies to make products in the country as part of his “Make in India” policy, aimed at reaping the benefits that come from manufacturing facilities and jobs. His administration doesn’t want technology companies to sell products and take advantage of its vast consumer base without making their own capital investments. The company wants to start discussions with the tax department on future liability on its India earnings, the person said. It has also sought competitive advantages compared to other economies where they are already manufacturing. While Foxconn Technology Group — Apple’s main manufacturing partner — has expressed plans to assemble phones in the country for brands like China’s Xiaomi Corp., most iPhones are put together in China. The Taiwanese company only began making its first smartphones in India in the middle of 2015.

And Asia can take the lead as we wave goodbye to human fallibility By Tak Lo 1 Jan 2017 Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on LinkedIn Share on Google Plus Share on Sina 5Comments Lee Sedol, one of the greatest modern players of the ancient board game Go, takes on Google’s AlphaGo. He lost the series 4-1 in an event that shows beyond doubt, AI is here to stay. Photo: AFP Facebook. Google. Apple. Baidu. Not a day goes by when we don’t hear of something related to artificial intelligence in the news. But AI (sometimes confused with machine learning, which is simply a technique within AI) wouldn’t be where it is today if it weren’t for one seminal event in 2016: AlphaGo beating Lee Sedol. It’s the tech equivalent of Leicester City winning the Premier League, or the Golden State Warriors winning 73 games in the NBA. It’s the unimaginable happening, right in front of our own eyes. In March last year, an AI program that trained itself to play the ancient game of Go beat the 18-time world champion. The reason it was such a feat for AI, was because Go is about feel, strategic judgment and winning multiple battles across the board – and a computer cannot simply memorise all possible combinations of board pieces, assess the situation, construct and execute a strategy to win, like chess. An artificial intelligence named Jarvis is now helping run Mark Zuckerberg’s household So the programmers of AlphaGo, from Google DeepMind, set up the basic heuristics of the game, allowed AlphaGo to analyse previous games and then split its brain so it could play itself millions of times. Imagine the 1983 film War Games in which a computer was taught to learn by playing tic-tac-toe against itself. This time, however, the game is Go. The results were stunning. AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol convincingly, 4 games to 1. So much for human intuition. And to add insult to injury, the Korea Baduk Association awarded AlphaGo the highest Go grandmaster rank. This event was important because it made clear that AI was here to stay. Of course, AI is also receiving a big push from Facebook and Google as they invest billions of dollars through OpenAI and DeepMind to democratise the technology – not to mention countless acquisitions of AI talent. But the corporate activity merely proves that big-business has plans for AI, whereas AlphaGo beating Lee Sedol signals the possibility that AI could indeed be more capable than humans. A Terminator of American jobs went unnoticed on Trump’s judgment day: artificial intelligence And that is a conceit that an AI investor like me is comfortable with. There are certainly some things that machines are better at than humans. In fact, there are many things that machines should be better at. Self-driving cars is one example. Imagine a world where traffic accidents are a relic of the past and very few lives are lost. Imagine a future where your cancer prognosis is not misdiagnosed by multiple doctors and visitations, but instead you are told in one go what cancer you have, how long you have to live and what stage it is at. Imagine a future where your frustrated customer service hotline calls are replaced by an AI that recognises everything you say and responds in the best way. In many ways, the human variability that makes us all frustrated will be replaced with machine predictability. WATCH: Google unveils prototype of self-driving car Many people are aghast when I mention the predictability versus variability argument. “Human fallibility is great!” they say. “It’s what makes us alive!” Bollocks. Human fallibility and variability are great for art, where it is a necessary requirement to produce even greater art. It’s great for startups, when we are looking for the next big innovation and we don’t know where to look. But it’s absolutely terrible for things like cancer detection, driving, aviation and a whole host of things that don’t need human intervention or decision-making. Alibaba Cloud to use artificial intelligence to smooth Hangzhou traffic flow I am biased, of course, but I’ll make two predictions about AI for 2017 and beyond. One, AI will be the biggest thing since sliced bread. You can consider corporate activity like Facebook, Google, Snapchat, Baidu as a signal of trust. You can also trust the direction of car companies like GM, Mercedes-Benz, Uber, and Tesla towards autonomous cars. And you can trust academics, the White House and other longitudinal thinkers when they say past academic research, computational power and large accessible data sets will together create a perfect storm for AI impacting our lives. All signals show AI will be big. Another prediction: Asia will be big in AI. If you look at the data trends, there is a tonne of AI research done in China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. In fact there are more cited publications in China than in the United States. The main problem, however, is the cultural barriers to sharing this knowledge between Asia and the rest of the world, many of which stem from language differences. But there is another barrier. In the West there is a tenancy, even incentives, to commercialise research, but the same dynamics are not present in Asia. Nevertheless, the underlying core principle can not be denied – AI’s potential in Asia is rising and Hong Kong would do well to find a way to ride this wave. ■ Tak Lo is the founder of Zeroth, a Hong Kong-based accelerator programme for Asia-focused AI and machine learning startups On Reflection Tak Lo Newsletter Sign-up Asian insights and analysis direct to your inbox. your email address A valid E-mail address is required.

Apple earlier had planned to open their own flagship stores in several cities including Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, but due to the government compliance of requiring manufacturing in India, the process was delayed. Tim Cook’s recent visit to India was a positive sign on the efforts of the Cupertino based tech giant, to fully initiate and integrate it’s services in the Indian market. The manufacture of iPhones will considerably bring down costs of duties and taxes and will allow Apple to sell at competitive prices and at par with US price which is usually Rs. 10,000-15,000 cheaper. Apple will also bring their full suite of in store experiences, like training and Genius bars, to improve service and warranty standards in India, which have usually had mixed reviews. Apple is selling large volumes of phones in India, and iPhone sales hit 2.5 million from Oct 2015-September 2016 raking in 9,997 Crore in revenue for the tech company here in India.   likethis What's your reaction?

This Week In Games: Isaac Returns The Man Who Worked On The Original Game Boy Explains Why Nintendo Created The DS What We Didn't Like (And Really Didn't Like) About The Assassin's Creed Movie Gita Jackson Jan 2, 2017, 5:00am ⋅ Filed to:  assassin's creed ubisoft vgchat Share Two of us saw Ubisoft's attempt at transmedia franchising, and we did not care for it. Not one bit. Gita Jackson: Here's a good place to start, I think: was there anything you liked about this movie? Mike Fahey: I'd heard you were a tough interviewer, but I didn't think you'd hit me with such a difficult question right out of the gate. Gita: Let's be positive! I'm sure there's at least one thing you liked. I can think of about.... three things I thought were at least not horrible. Fahey: I'd say the fight choreography was good. The combat was exciting to watch, even if in the grand scheme of things a lot of it felt pointless. Gita: I definitely agree. One of the better modern action movies in terms of that, I'd say. I could follow the action scenes really well, which I think is a problem in, say, the Marvel movies. I knew exactly who was getting punched and why (at least in the short term question of "why"). There were also some moments where the cinematography was nice. While the colour grading was driving me up a wall, there were a couple of scenes where the camera work was really graceful, and the shots were framed in a painterly way I appreciated. I don't think Justin Kurzel is a bad director by any means. Just, wasted on this project. Fahey: I will give you the cinematography as well. There were some very lovely shots, even if they were either white and grey or beige, depending on the time period. Gita: That colour grading. Good god. I have some serious thoughts on that. Fahey: By all means, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Mine amount to intense stares at the screen, sighs and head shakes. Gita: This is a little nerdy, so I apologise. A guy I went to college with made this great video about the colour grading in the Marvel movies that pointed out something I never really thought about, but now am definitely noticing more and more. None of those movies have true black values. The blacks in Marvel movies aren't very dynamic or crunchy, so on the whole they all look a little washed out. This movie had that problem as well, and in spades. The blacks weren't black so none of the colours popped. Ever. I think the only truly rich colour in that movie was red, and I remember exactly one scene where the red of someone's cape was striking. It was a study in beiges, grays and browns. A snooze fest for my eyes. Fahey: Between the muted colours and the dreadfully slow pacing, I'm surprised I stayed awake through the entire thing. Well, technically I started dozing off during Callum's final visit to the Animus, but my brother hit me awake after the first snore. That one sleepy-time incident aside, I spent most of the film riveted for all the wrong reasons. I was on the edge of my seat as Michael Fassbender's Callum Lynch, following his first journey into his ancestor's memories, repeatedly told Marion Cotillard how hungry he was, only to be led to a place that did not feature food. "I'm hungry." "Come with me." And we're in a room filled with computers. Someone get that poor man a steak. Gita: Michael Fassbender was really trying his hardest, wasn't he? And Marion Cotillard was not trying whatsoever. Jeremy Irons seems like he was having a blast, though, and I respected him and his turtlenecks. One thing that really bothered me, and always bothers me, was how all over the map both Fassbender and Cotillard's accents were. Where was Marion Cotillard's character from? England? France? The US? The moon, which she does not believe we landed on? Fahey: Jeremy Irons is a treasure at his worst, and by that I mean the Dungeons & Dragons movie. Since that performance, I just like watching him eat scenery. To be fair, he got to play evil and British, at least one of which he is in real life. Fassbender is a German playing a Spaniard and an American. No wonder the poor man went crazy and started singing in the middle of the movie. Marion Cotillard might be too French to play anything else. Gita: Fassbender's Spanish sure was.... something. Fahey: I was surprised they decided to keep all of the Animus dialog in Spanish. In the games that stuff is all automatically translated. Gita: I kind of liked that touch — I would have liked it more had a tall person not been sitting in front of me, blocking my view of the subtitles. There was a brief moment when I thought I would have preferred a movie entirely set in the past, but then I realised that in the regression sequences I had no idea what was happening. Fahey: You didn't miss much. The Animus portions of the movie were a series of fight scenes involving something about a prince and a city and some Templars. Fassbender may have had a girlfriend, or maybe they were just plucky assassin pals. At one point, hanging in a dungeon side-by-side, they touch foreheads and recite the Assassin's Creed together. All of that resolves into a big nothing. The point of the Animus sequences are to determine where Lynch ancestor Aguilar hid the Apple of Eden from the Templars. That information is eventually gleaned in a scene completely unrelated to the whole prince/city/Templar plot. I guess he needs to synchronise with his ancestor's memories in order to gain access to the correct one. It's a video game conceit that doesn't translate to film very well. Gita: Somehow, Marion Cotillard muttering "leap of faith..." doesn't have as much gravitas as actually doing it in a video game. Fahey: My brother and I burst out laughing at that point. Uproarious laughter. It was as if she suddenly transformed into a teenage fan watching the movie instead of an active participant. That and "He's synchronizing!" I don't think Marion Cotillard knows how to wear a coat? Gita: Good god. Did you know the two friends I saw this with kinda liked it? Neither of them are gamers but they were into the concept and lore. I told them to get stoned and read the wiki. Fahey: I've heard from folks on Twitter who liked it as well. I just can't get over all the bad. Gita: I think if I was folding laundry I'd have enjoyed watching this. Fahey: Maybe that's my problem. I am not good at folding laundry. But I can see how being distracted might keep me from noticing how many times they told Callum that he was their only hope of finding the Apple of Eden and that they needed it to end human violence. Did you know he was their only hope of finding the Apple of Eden? Gita: They need it to cure violence. Fahey: I heard something like that. Gita: I CANNOT believe that was the plot of that movie. Marion Cotillard curing violence. With science. Fahey: Using a man she rescued from being executed for killing a pimp. Callum Lynch was sentenced to death for murdering a pimp. We don't see the murder. But pimps are pretty bad, right? Gita: Did you notice that they never said what the Apple of Eden, you know, does? Fahey: I understood as much about the Apple of Eden following the movie as I did after playing 100 hours of Assassin's Creed. It glowed. It's definitely a glowy thing. Gita: Even though this movie was absurdly, punishingly long, did you get the sense that there was about a half hour of it that was hastily cut before release? Fahey: I do like that after centuries of searching it turns out this all-powerful whatsit was sitting in a chest at a church down the street from Abstergo. No digging, no deciphering riddles. Just sitting in a chest. So yeah, I feel like some cuts were made. Gita: There is definitely a cut of this movie, somewhere, where Callum's familial relationship is established more, so the ghost of his mum welcoming him into the Assassin's Creed makes more sense. And there's definitely a cut where Michael K. Williams gets to, you know, DO ANYTHING AT ALL. I wish I had seen the version of this movie where the final act felt earned at all. Because that would have been an ok movie. Fahey: For the benefit of those who haven't seen the film, the final act features an uprising by the other Assassin ancestors inhabiting the Abstergo facility, as Callum fully synchronizes with his deceased assassin kin, becoming an expert warrior and fully committing himself to the Creed, which he speaks out loud with his dead mother. Gita: It's important to note that in the lead-up to this scene, Fassbender whips his shirt off erotically, and remains shirtless throughout. Fahey: Dammit, there's another good thing I missed. Gita: I don't know if I'd watch this movie again. But I'd go back for seconds on shirtless Michael Fassbender stabbing things. Fahey: And climbing. Was it just me, or did you spend part of the movie looking at the scenery, wondering how to climb it? Gita: Oh for sure. The one shot I genuinely liked and thought was really, really nicely framed was the final successful leap of faith. The stunts in this movie were great. Fahey: The leap of faith gave me tingles, yes. The best part of the ending is how Fassbender, Williams and the equally-underused Michelle Lin, three dangerous fugitives from Abstergo's compromised testing facility, waltz right through security at Templar headquarters during the a special event commemorating the acquisition of a powerful artifact they'd been fighting over for centuries. Maybe Fassbender sneaks, but Williams and Lin walk right through the security checkpoint. Gita: No, Fassbender kinda just has that bizarre conversation with Cotillard and then walks on through. No one in this movie talks like a person talks. Not once. Fahey: You are correct. They speak like they're characters in a video game, and if that was a conscious decision on Justin Kurzel's part, it's so crazy it's brilliant. Speaking of crazy . . . I am not letting Fassbender's singing go, Gita. Gita: You know, it's so frustrating. I've seen Frank. The guy can actually sing! What even was that scene? I feel like I'm having an existential crisis. Why did any of that happen?! Fahey: From the mouth-foaming seizure after his first failed leap of faith to the crazy-eyed, howling rendition of Patsy Cline's "Crazy," I am at a total loss. Gita: The entire middle portion of the movie is just a question mark. Nothing that happened for a good 45 minutes mattered. At all. I just remember Fassbender shadow boxing himself. Fahey: I did get in some good head shaking and sighing and OH GOD THE SHADOW SPARRING. You figure a guy who murdered a pimp would be made of sterner stuff. As the movie ended, with a shot of three members of a shadowy secret organisation posing on a rooftop for no reason as the camera panned around them, I had an idea for a change that would have made everything about this movie ten times better. Gita: Tell me. Fahey: Michael Fassbender plays Aquilar. Kevin James plays Callum. Gita: FUCK. I'd watch it. Comments OriginalFranz Guest Jan 1, 2017, 11:51am Jeremy Irons is underrated and has been neglected by hollywood for some time now. Reply 0 akeashar @akeashar Jan 1, 2017, 11:56am The commentary about there not being black reminds me of a discussion I had with an artist that was doing some design work for me. Despite the concept work I'd given her and my feedback on the roughs, she refused to use black in the design work because she said that there is no actual colour black, just shades of really dark grey. So unhappily, the design work ended up with the dark grey instead of black, and she kept her artistic integrity. So, I guess, if they're going to stick to their guns, you're just not going to ever get a pure black in any media, so prepare to continue to be disappointed. I'm really not surprised after my interactions with the one artist, that people in other media follow the same model. (The design work was done a number of years ago, long before the Marvel thing) Reply 0 rammo123 @rammo123 Jan 1, 2017, 7:45pm Everyone knows the only true black is the heart of a dragon. Reply 0 jacka @jacka Jan 1, 2017, 8:11pm //EDIT: nothing to see here. Came off a little too presumptuous and art-wanky. Last edited January 1, 2017 8:17 pm Reply 0 akeashar @akeashar Jan 1, 2017, 11:15pm But art-wanky can add to the discussion at hand! Amusingly, as a followup, a couple of artists were doing art of the character for a duo NYE stream last night, and when it came to discussing colouring the pic with Prisma markers the question from the veteran of animation and decades of art asked 'Is it meant to be really dark grey, or is it actually black?' They had a good laugh with the 'There is no black in reality!' anecdote and went with black. Reply 0 cbrate @cbrate Jan 1, 2017, 12:11pm Is is it true that the director never played and still hasn't played any Assassin's Creed? Reply 1 namiwakiru @namiwakiru Jan 1, 2017, 5:18pm Oh god that annoys me. I suppose there was books and films, but look at the fella who did Silent Hill, made the cast play the games to understand the material. Ok, the movie still wasn't the greatest, but the effort was there. This is how we get the Resident Evil movie franchise, people!! Reply 2 Evil Monkey @evilmonkey Jan 2, 2017, 11:38am Just like how Michael Bay had never seen even one episode of Transformers before making the flims, yet here we are about to be subjected to the fifth one. Reply 1 gunnermcdagget @gunnermcdagget Jan 3, 2017, 12:47pm If the director played Assassin's Creed then the movie would be about a guy who accidentally climbs walls while trying to chase people. Reply 0 mase @mase Jan 1, 2017, 7:28pm The movie actually emulates the look and story of the game pretty well. Where the movie fails is that it doesn't grasp that those who will see it are more interested in the memory segments than the main character and the mechanics and political bs in the "current" settings. Reply 0 djbear @djbear Jan 2, 2017, 12:07am Video game movies all face the same double edged sword. Do you cater to the Video game fans? Which has the potentional to drive away the wider movie goer base who have not played/Heard of the games? Or do you cater to the wider movie viewing audience which can result in alienating the video game fans. This is why Video game movies tend to not do well because Directors either try to do both or lean to heavy to one side. Reply 1 mase @mase Jan 2, 2017, 11:26am Has there ever been a video game movie that leaned heavily into the "appeal to the video game audience" side of things? Reply 1 Evil Monkey @evilmonkey Jan 2, 2017, 11:58am I haven't played any of the Warcraft games, but I'm told the movie sticks pretty close to the source material. Definitely one of the most enjoyable video game movies too. Reply 2 caspertheangrypirate @caspertheangrypirate Jan 2, 2017, 5:56pm I went and saw the movie and what I got out of it, the whole thing was just... jarring. I completely agree with dialogue being abhorrent and now that I think about it, I can't recall a scene where two characters had an actual conversation in one take. By the end of the movie it was actually painful to listen to people talking and I just wanted more scenes in the Animus. Action scenes were really fantastic, it was nice to see a couple of moments that really put my mind back to the fights against 5 or 6 guards at once where the whole thing just feels like a well choreographed murder session. And then there was the finale, what a disaster. Without going into details, I found the final 30 minutes of the movie to just be anti-climatic. There's so much potential for them to say, put this one movie into 3 films, better develop the characters and actually provide some context into the world they're playing around in. The timeline of the whole movie (someone feel free to correct me if I've misinterpreted it) seems to be fit into the space no more than a week, which if the games were anything, was nowhere near enough time to have the bleeding effect.

Wall Street Daily Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us WSD Team Contact Us Archives Ensure Email Delivery Frequently Asked Questions Broker Listing This Flaw Threatens to Crush Android’s Growth Potential Published Tue, Nov 1, 2011  |  Justin Fritz, Executive Editor New data shows that the Android operating system continues to gain ground against Apple’s (Nasdaq: AAPL) iPhone. With 190 million users, Android adoption has more than doubled since 2010. And in its last earnings announcement, Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) said it expects to pull in $2.5 billion from mobile advertising revenue next year. But this rampant growth will come to a screeching halt if Google doesn’t address one glaring issue with its Android platform: fragmentation. You see, there are currently several versions of the Android operating system floating around. And it’s becoming a huge problem. So today, I’ll share three reasons why fragmentation threatens to cause a mass exodus among Android users… ~ Chances Are, Your Android Phone Won’t See An Update After a Year When Google pushes out an operating system update – which includes things like bug fixes, browser enhancements, performance adjustments, etc. – the company doesn’t have total control over delivering it to users. It’s up to the phone manufacturers to send updates. And since device makers like to add their own finishing touches to the software, the rollout can often take months. Heck, many users are lucky to get new software releases at all. Most Android phones fall at least one upgrade behind just months after hitting the market. Even the mega popular Droid couldn’t keep its operating system current after the first year. If you compare that to the original iPhone, which stayed current for at least three years, Android is falling behind very quickly.   ~ Users Aren’t Receiving Timely Security Enhancements Improvements that help defend against major security breaches are among the most critical of all updates. Back in May, Google rushed a quick security update out the door to block hackers from skimming your login data from public Wi-Fi networks. But at the time, only 0.3% of Android users were able to get the update. The rest had to wait for the hardware manufacturers to make the necessary adjustments. Worst of all, many Android smartphones never saw the security overhaul at all! ~ There Are 300,000 Android Apps… But Not for You The Android Market might not boast as many applications as Apple’s App Store. But its users are now the most app-hungry – accounting for 44% of the apps downloaded between April and June, according to ABI Research. That number could have been even higher, though, if all users had access to the entire app library. With developers designing apps that are only compatible with the most dominant versions of Android, millions of consumers are out of luck. If this continues, people will begin to realize that staying current requires buying an iPhone instead. Granted, Google’s not completely to blame here. But unless the search giant wants to see Android’s momentum run out of steam in short order, it needs to do everything in its power to make system updates as easy as possible for phone makers to integrate. Google’s new major operating system release, Ice Cream Sandwich, does put Android smartphones and tablets on the same page. So that’s a good start. But even Google’s flagship Nexus One phone – which I’ve owned for less than two years – isn’t powerful enough to receive Ice Cream Sandwich. Hopefully this new operating system can at least keep devices aligned from this point forward. Because if my next Android smartphone ends up coming with a two-year shelf life, as well, then the iPhone 7 (or whatever number Apple is up to at the time) will likely be calling my name. And I’m sure I won’t be alone. Good investing, Justin Fritz Justin Fritz joined the financial publishing business seven years ago (after a brief two-year stint teaching seventh-grade English).

Comments (1) jerry says: November 2, 2011 at 1:33 pm I agree completely. My contract is up in December and I have already been researching the iphone, something I swore I would never do. My friends that have iphones don’t have all the rebooting issues and bluetooth issues that android has on their phones. It’s a shame cause I really like google but I use my phone for business and can’t be having problems all the time.

Gaming News Game Reviews Game Trailers GR Originals Strategy Guides Hot Topics: Worst Games of 2016 Destiny Final Fantasy 15 Watch Dogs 2 PS4 Pro Xbox One PC Apple’s Siri Really Likes Super Mario Run By Riley Little | 2 days ago  Fans have discovered that Apple’s now infamous Siri will actually answer questions about it playing Super Mario Run. Evidently, the A.I. quite likes Nintendo’s latest iOS offering. Many have assumed that a special deal was reached between Nintendo and Apple following the announcement that Super Mario Run would be arriving on the latter’s in-house operating system, iOS, before any other. What’s become apparent since the announcement of the game is that a marketing agreement appears to have been put into place on the Apple App Store, but gamers have quickly discovered that the deal for Super Mario Run‘s timed exclusivity doesn’t appear to have ended there. As gamers have learned in the wake of Mario’s debut on the App Store, the built-in ‘assistant’ known as Siri actually has quite an affinity for Nintendo’s pudgy plumber and his first-ever adventure on Apple hardware. When asked whether or not Siri has played Super Mario Run, the ever-witty A.I. will retort with one of a bevy of various lines that reference the game and the Mushroom Kingdom as a whole. In fact, some may dare to say that the virtual assistant’s comments could be enough to light up even Bowser’s dark heart. A compilation highlighting all of the known Super Mario Run replies can be seen below, via GameXplain. As the video indicates, simply asking Siri whether or not it likes Super Mario Run is enough to trigger these responses, but something additional will also occur for anyone that says “It’s Mario time” to the application. Indeed, it’s one of the more interesting easter eggs that Apple has placed within Siri thus far, and it just goes to show the relationship that Nintendo shares with the Cupertino, California-based company. If it weren’t already obvious by now, Nintendo has plans to bring its iconic IP to new audiences – with mobile games for outside hardware being a big step in that direction. With that said, other initiatives include film and television for Nintendo’s many properties, although no one is quite sure just when this particular move will come to bear fruit. Even then, the premise of seeing the company’s mascots through new mediums is sure to be enticing for many longtime and casual fans. For now, however, gamers can have a few minutes of fun by talking to Siri about Mario. On the other hand, those unable to do so can instead go about registering to be notified of Super Mario Run‘s imminent release on Android. Super Mario Run is currently available on iOS devices, with Android platforms set to receive the game in 2017. tags: Apple, iOS, Mario, Mobile, Nintendo, Super Mario Run Load Comments Latest Features Latest News Latest Reviews Latest Videos © 2009-2016 Game Rant, LLC ABOUT CONTACT US PRIVACY POLICY COPYRIGHT ADVERTISE

I was 19 years old. It was the same day that Apple Computer incorporated. The number one song on the Billboard Hot 100 was "You Don't Have to Be a Star" by Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis, Jr. The number one movie was Clint Eastwood's "The Enforcer." Gerald Ford was still president of the United States, although President-elect Jimmy Carter was named Time Magazine's "Man of the Year" on January 3. Among the new members of the 95th Congress sworn in that day, almost 40 years ago, was Utah's Orrin Hatch. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Utah's senior senator in 1977, Jake Garn, just one and a half years older than Hatch, retired from his Senate seat one year shy of a quarter century ago, or four Senate terms ago. There are older senators than Hatch currently serving (two), but none longer. Only eight senators in the history of Congress have served longer than Hatch and, if he were to serve and complete a seventh term, only three senators would have served longer – Robert Byrd, D-West Va.; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; and Strom Thurmond, R-South Carolina. Political legacies are funny things. Despite decades of senatorial service, Byrd and Thurmond are mostly remembered for racist beginnings and pandering endings. Inouye's greatest legacy pre-dated his election to the Senate. Time served is not a legacy. Doing the right thing at the right time is the hallmark of a legacy. Conservatives value the experience that often attends age. But Hatch didn't begin his Senate career as an old man. He was 43 years old when he defeated 18-year incumbent Frank Moss, not much older than Utah's junior Sen. Mike Lee when he defeated 18-year incumbent Robert Bennett. In fact, candidate Hatch famously asked his old opponent, "What do you call a senator who's been in office for more than two terms? You call him home." Four years ago, when facing what he perceived to be a tough convention fight in the 2012 Republican primary, Hatch promised delegates that if they elected him, he would not seek to serve a seventh term. Of course, between then and now a lot has changed in Utah politics. The state Legislature's compromise on the Count My Vote initiative, SB 54, saved the caucus and convention system in Utah but cleared the way for Hatch to avoid another grueling and contentious convention. Rather than having to stare down his right-wing opponents, he can avoid repeating that embarrassing and costly experience by simply gathering signatures from the broader GOP — a no-brainer for a clever candidate as long in the tooth as Hatch. But questions still remain for conservative voters. Chief among them involves the last two years of Hatch's current term. The historically disruptive election of Donald Trump makes the next two years the most important in a long time. A lot of politics and policy will occur before the 2018 mid-term congressional election. Would Hatch serve Utah voters better by focusing on his official duties over the next two years or by spending most of that time running for re-election? And, no, he cannot do both effectively. Every minute he spends on his re-election is a minute not spent on official duties, and vice versa. Of course, that is the way it is every election, but this time it is different in scope and magnitude. Every minute Hatch spends on a seventh re-election bid is the equivalent of hours and days spent away from official duties in the era of Trump. Hatch will not be able to mail-in political influence. In fact, in the era of Trump, the board is wiped clean on all previous or imagined influence. If there is any real message to come out of the 2016 presidential election it is the old, crony, establishment way of doing business is over. As they showed in the 2010 mid-term election, voters might believe that a 40-year incumbent is no longer the right sort of person to engage the volatility of the Trump era. The key to Hatch's success will be the immediacy of his impact, not the prospect of his impact. He has two years to make a difference. Nobody cares what he has done for 38 years or what he promises to do until he is 90 years old. His past will be as politically meaningless as his future if and substantive action is not forthcoming from him between now and the 2018 mid-term election. In other words, the key to Hatch's legacy will occur over the next 730 days, not the past 38 years, and there will be no legacy for him if he spends that time running for re-election. Paul T.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     The IPhone 7 Is Not Selling Well Posted: Dec 31 2016, 11:43am CST | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Dec 31 2016, 11:45am CST, in News | Apple     The iPhone 7 May Not Be Selling Well Enough As Apple Aimed For It is a usual tradition that the latest iPhone sell very well in the initial months of the launch. The sales often outperform the previous model’s sales during the same quarter. Don't Miss: Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 However according to Nikkei this may not be the case with the iPhone 7. In fact the sluggish sales are causing the company to cut down on the production of the iPhone 7 duo. As per the data received from the suppliers Nikkei has estimated the slow stock production to be around 10 percent. The first sign of the reported slow down was observed by Apple in March. Its Q2 earnings showed that even though the iPhone 6 upgrades were high they were still not up to snuff with sales of the users who upgraded to the iPhone 6 in 2014. It is still too early to make a final statement if the iPhone 7 will be able to outsell the previous model or not but we will know soon enough.

Gift cards are a popular present at the holidays. The National Retail Federation says more than half of consumers plan to give one in 2016. But they aren’t always wanted, as research organization CEB TowerGroup estimates that $1 billion of the $130 billion spent on gift cards in 2015 went unused. (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP) NEW YORK — If you're cleaning out your closets for the new year, or need some spare cash after the holidays, your old stuff can help fill up your wallet. A number of websites and apps make it easier to sell used smartphones, furniture and clothes. Here's where to go to sell your unwanted stuff and earn some extra bucks: GADGETS If you got the latest tablet or smartphone during the holidays, don't let the old ones go to the forgotten junk drawer. Gazelle and NextWorth will buy your unwanted electronics depending on its condition. Recently, Gazelle was offering $215 for an iPhone 6s in good condition on Verizon's cellphone network. Other options include Apple, which will pay you in Apple Store gift cards for some products. And retailers Target and Best Buy will take your electronics online or at some of its stores in exchange for gift cards. You can also try selling unwanted electronics on eBay, which may charge listing fees, or Facebook's recently launched marketplace, which is free, and found within the social media company's app. CLOTHING For women's, men's or children's clothing, there's Poshmark. The company charges $2.95 for items sold for under $15 and takes 20 percent for items sold for more than $15. With ThredUP, the website will send you a box to fill with brand-name women's or children's clothing that it tries to sell for you if. You can keep 5 percent to as much as 80 percent of the amount an item is sold for, depending on the sell price. At Tradesy, you can list designer bags, shoes and clothing, with Tradesy taking as much as 17.8 percent of the sale price. You can also selling used clothing on eBay, which may charge some listing fees. FURNITURE For couches, mirrors and other household items, try Craigslist or Facebook marketplace. Some good photos in the listing, and measurements of the items, can help them better attract a buyer. But with those options, only accept cash or online payments such as PayPal, since requests to pay by check can be a sign of a scam. If you live in New York, Washington or northern New Jersey, AptDeco lets you list used furniture and can arrange for shipping and delivery, but charges sellers 23 percent of the price an item is sold for. GIFT CARDS If you got a gift card over the holidays you know you won't use, you can sell them at a number of sites including CardCash,Cardpooland Giftcard Zen. How much money you get depends on a number of factors, including how likely someone else will want to buy it from the gift card seller. Recently, CardCash was offering $87 for a $100 gift card from Target, a $13 loss. You can also trying selling it on your own through eBay. TOYS For unopened toys such as Lego sets or American Doll dresses, try the Brian's Toys website. It will quote you the price it will pay on its site, or download the Brian's Toys app, which lets you scan the toy's barcode for a quote. You can also try eBay, Craigslist or Amazon to sell unwanted toys.

Beyond minor 10.2.x updates, we have no idea what Apple could be working on for iOS 10.3, but thanks to proficient leaker and tipster Sonny Dickson, we now have an idea about when to expect it, as well as a hint of a new feature. In a pair of tweets on Friday, Dickson wrote that the first developer beta for iOS 10.3 will be released on January 10th, as well as include the debut of something called “Theater mode.” There’s no other solid details mentioned, besides that Theater mode will be accessed via a new “popcorn-shaped” icon in Control Center. Previous rumors have mentioned that iOS 10.3 will primarily focus on improvements for the iPad, but this is the time we’ve heard about a Theater mode. It’s really anyone’s guess what this new feature does or how it works, including whether it could be a type of “dark mode” for mobile devices. Going by the popcorn icon tidbit, it could be a setting for use in a movie theater or other similar location, automatically turning off things like sounds, notifications for calls and messages, haptic feedback, and the screen lighting up. Who knows how that would be an improvement over the existing “silent” mode switch, however. The good news is that we won’t have long to wait to see if this rumor pans out. January 10th is just over a week away, so we’ll quickly find out if iOS developers get access to a new beta.

autoevolution cars moto news car reviews spyshots driven cars newspaper green Compare Cars BAC Calculator   Editorial Coverstory Motorsport Testdrives archive Auto Shows Tuning Car Finder Photo of the Day Glossary of automotive terms Masthead RSS Feeds Steve Woz Shows Us the Real Difference Betwen a Tesla and Chevrolet Bolt   31 Dec 2016, 19:15 UTC · by Vlad Mitrache / Home / News / U-turn Earlier this year, Apple co-founder and all-round nice guy Steve Wozniak got all excited about the Chevrolet Bolt. It got to the point where it almost started stinking of GM publicity stunt, but Woz isn't the kind of guy you can buy easily. Besides, he's an EV enthusiast and Tesla owner, so he's pretty committed to the cause, so it's unlikely to side with a traditional carmaker such as GM. However, when Chevrolet started handing out test drives this autumn, Woz announced he would trade in his Model S for a Bolt the second the car became available. As you would expect, a statement like this made a lot of eyebrows raise, but Steve was there to answer all questions and expose his reasons in great detail. The thing that made his choice so hard to understand was that he's not constrained in any way by the financial aspect. So who in their right mind would snub a Tesla for a Bolt? Well, there are a few aspects that are worth mentioning. For one thing, the Bolt appears to be the first electric car that's decent enough to consider besides a Tesla, so perhaps Woz is just looking for a change. Then, there's the practicality aspect: the Bolt is taller, easier to get in and out, and has a much smaller footprint. These traits make it an ideal daily driver for those who venture into urban areas as well. Woz did not trade his Model S in - in fact, just two weeks ago, his wife bought him a new one. Now, though, he's announced that his Bolt will be arriving on January 3, so he did keep half of his word. In a move that put all doubts to rest, Woz confirmed his plans for the future with the two EVs he owns: the Tesla is going to be the road trip car (apparently, he takes a lot of them), while the Bolt will become the daily driver. Since very few of us actually know what the Bolt drives like, we're going to have to take Woz's word for it and accept that this is a set up that makes sense. But it definitely highlights a problem for the Bolt: the fact there aren't any compatible fast-charging stations, and even if there were, the car isn't built to take advantage of them. Maybe this will change in the future once the infrastructure gets built, but that means condemning those who bought the car until then to painstakingly slow charging. For now, though, the Tesla remains the only real alternative for zero-emissions road trips. Woz confirmed.

(AP) — A Texas couple whose 5-year-old daughter died in a crash involving a driver who was allegedly using Apple's FaceTime video chatting app is suing the tech company. The lawsuit filed this month in Santa Clara Superior Court accuses Apple of not implementing iPhone features that would automatically disable FaceTime based on technology that calculates highway speeds. Apple hasn't responded to the lawsuit and didn't immediately respond to an email Saturday seeking comment. Moriah Modisette was killed in a 2014 Christmas Eve accident near Dallas. The lawsuit obtained by California television KTLA claims police found FaceTime running on the iPhone of the driver who struck the Modisette family at 65 mph. The family claims Apple knew the risks of using FaceTime while driving because the company patented "lock-out" technology in 2008.
