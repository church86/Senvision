Follow TechnoBuffalo For the first time in the company’s history, Apple is selling refurbished iPhones through its online store. Some models are being offered at steep discounts, making the iPhone cheaper than ever. Unfortunately, Apple’s latest models aren’t yet being offered through Apple’s refurbished store. That includes the iPhone SE, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus, the latter two of which were released in September. If you don’t mind owning the older models, you’re in for some good savings. An unlocked iPhone 6s with 16GB of storage is selling for $449, which is $80 the regular asking price. Meanwhile, an iPhone 6s Plus with 64GB of storage is just $589. That’s $110 less than usual. It could make a good holiday gift With the holidays on the horizon, Apple’s timing couldn’t have been better. There are a variety of ways to get your hands on older iPhone models but going through Apple guarantees quality. Here is what Apple says on its site: We test and certify all Apple refurbished products and include a 1-year warranty. All refurbished iPhone models also include a brand new battery and outer shell. Supply is limited and availability is guaranteed once we receive full payment. As 9to5Mac notes, refurbished models include a brand new battery and outer shell, so you’re essentially getting a brand new device. The devices also come unlocked and SIM-free. All colors and sizes are being offered through its refurbished store.

Samsung Rival Patents Advanced Mapping System For The iPhone By Corazon Victorino On 11/08/16 AT 6:52 PM Close Apple has just been granted a new patent for “augmented reality maps” by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This new patent appears to be a snippet of what the Cupertino giant could have been preparing all along, ever since CEO Tim Cook stated months ago that augmented reality is bigger than virtual reality.  On Tuesday, patent 9,488,488 — filed back in Feb. 12, 2010 — was published on the United States Patent website. Based on the abstract of the document, the patent is for a technology that lets a “handheld communication device” capture and show real-time video stream of the environment upon detection of “geographic position, camera direction and tilt of the image capture device.” Simplifying what the document states, AppleInsider says the technology being described in the patent is a mapping system that presents real-time augmented reality views of a user’s surrounding environment. The Apple-centric news site also indicated that an advanced sensor is used by this technology to gather digital information, such as street names, points of interest and other elements that are overlaid on top of the live video being captured by a smartphone’s camera.  Related Stories Apple Eliminates Fake Apps From iOS App Store Jet White iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus: Apple May Reportedly Add Color Option Microsoft Selfie App Arrives In Android Play Store To use the technology, a user should launch the Maps app and open the AR feature that activates the rear camera. The mapping system then works by correlating data from several components of the iPhone like the digital compass, gyroscope, accelerometer and GPS. The system is also said to provide users with a seamless AR experience when switching from live video to bird’s eye view. In the patent, augmented reality is described as a technology that supplements reality with additional information. The implementation of this technology would be visible in the points of interest and objects that will appear on top of a video feed of the surroundings. In terms of its practicality, the “augmented reality maps” are said to come in handy for users visiting a foreign city.  The emergence of this new patent comes months after Tim Cook exclusively spoke with ABC News’ “Good Morning America” and revealed that augmented reality (AR) is going to be the bigger technology than virtual reality (VR) in the near future.  "There's virtual reality and there's augmented reality -- both of these are incredibly interesting, but my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far,” Cook said at the time. "Virtual reality sort of encloses and immerses the person into an experience that can be really cool, but probably has a lower commercial interest over time.”   Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

When asked whether the Government was right to appeal the ruling that Apple should pay €13 billion in back tax, 47 per cent said yes, 39 per cent said no. With the majority clearly in hand, Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan will file their appeal with the European Union Court tomorrow over Apple's record 13 billion-euro (US$14.4 billion) tax bill that will potentially triggering years of litigation.   Bloomberg reports that "The nation will file its appeal against the European Commission's decision to force Ireland to claw back alleged tax subsidies, in a case that will test the EU's powers to use state aid law in what governments argue are national affairs."   The challenge at the EU General Court in Luxembourg will join a handful of pending appeals by other EU nations and companies that received similar decisions in the past year, targeting tax rulings regulators deemed to be unfair. The EU's Apple decision was the biggest ever state-aid payback demand.   Earlier today Noonan said at the European Parliament in Brussels that "The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission's analysis and the decision has left the government no choice but to take an appeal to the European courts, and this will be submitted tomorrow."   Reuters noted back in September that the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) will also be the court in any appeal that Apple brings forward as well.   "The court usually backs the Commission, but lawyers say it sometimes disagrees in state aid cases where it usually comes up against countries. Some lawyers say ECJ judges are influenced by political considerations and that if the Commission's rulings prompt a major spat with the United States and member states don't support the Commission, the court may hesitate to enforce a tax demand of up to 13 billion euros plus interest.   However, so far, the big guns of France and Germany have voiced support for the Apple ruling. In Apple's specific case, the UK declined comment.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Earlier today, Apple began selling refurbished iPhone models on its U.S. online store for the first time. For those unfamiliar, refurbished items are generally items that have either been returned or subject to repairs. That said, Apple ensures that ever refurbished item it sells is up to par with the company's internal standards for quality and performance. Additionally, refurbished items from Apple come with a one-year warranty. DON'T MISS: Evidence suggests Apple is working on the biggest mobile game-changer since the original iPhone As it stands now, the only refurbished iPhone models available are of the iPhone 6s variety. Still, the savings are such that you might want to take a look at what's available if you're not married to the idea of having Apple's latest and greatest. Specifically, you can pick up a 16GB iPhone 6s for $449, a 16GB iPhone 6s Plus for $529 and a 64GB iPhone 6s Plus for $589. Sure, you can get these devices for a lot less on sites like Craigslist or eBay, but sometimes it's worth paying a bit extra for that warranty, a seamless return process, and in turn, peace of mind. What's more, each device comes with free shipping and free returns. Even better, the wait time for new orders is just about 2 days and all colors are available.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 8, 2016 at 3:16PM Highly respected microprocessor analyst David Kanter recently posted an article on his website, Real World Tech, detailing an interesting discovery. He says Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has finally managed to design its own graphics processing unit (GPU) for integration into its A-series chips used inside both its iPhone and iPad series of products. Image source: Apple.  Perhaps more surprisingly, Kanter says that Apple launched its first custom graphics processor design inside the A8 chip that powered the iPhone 6-series smartphones. The company has presumably iterated upon that original design with the graphics processors found inside Apple's A9 and A10 Fusion chips released in subsequent years. Before building its own graphics processor, Apple relied on designs produced by graphics specialist and longtime Apple supplier Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF). Let's take a closer look at what Apple's custom graphics processor means for Imagination Technologies, if anything. Imagination Technologies still in the loop Kanter begins with an explanation of the three major components of a typical GPU: A modern GPU, like the ones inside Apple's iPhone and iPad, has three major components that must all work together in harmony to render a scene. The first is the fixed-function graphics hardware, which is responsible for tasks like processing API commands, triangle rasterization, and raster output. The second is the shader core, which is the heart of the GPU and executes programmable shaders (e.g., vertex, geometry, pixel, and compute shaders). Last, the graphics driver is the software that runs on the CPU and ties everything together, coordinating the activities of the GPU. According to Kanter, although much of Apple's graphics processor design is custom, there's still quite a bit of technology inside the design that comes from Imagination. Here's Kanter with more details: Apple's GPU appears to still use some of the PowerVR fixed-function graphics hardware. However, based on a variety of public evidence, it is clear that Apple has replaced the programmable shader cores with their own more efficient and higher performance design. To take advantage of the custom shader cores, Apple also developed their own driver and compiler to emit code for its architecture. The overall result is that while Apple's GPU shares some heritage with PowerVR, it is a unique and proprietary design. What's interesting is that Imagination Technologies didn't report anything unusual from a licensing or royalty payment perspective as Apple transitioned from the A7 chip to the A8 chip. Indeed, during Imagination's fiscal year ended on April 30, 2015, the company reported royalty revenue growth of 9%. The company said unit shipments from non-MIPS processors -- in other words, Imagination's PowerVR graphics -- were flat year over year while the average royalty rate in non-MIPS processors went up because of "a better mix." If Apple's move to more customized GPU technology led to a significant reduction in per-unit royalty payments to Imagination Technologies, then the company's average non-MIPS royalty rate should have gone down rather than move up 9%. Apple is a large enough customer of Imagination's that a significant content reduction in Apple's devices would lead to a large drop in non-MIPS royalty revenue. Investment takeaway The conclusion, at least for now, is that even though Apple has built up significant graphics technology expertise in-house, it still relies on valuable intellectual property that Imagination Technologies developed. Since Imagination's PowerVR licensing and royalty performance have apparently been unaffected by Apple's move to a custom graphics processor, it might be reasonable to expect Imagination Technologies to continue to collect royalty payments for the foreseeable future, even as Apple continues to advance its own graphics processor designs.

At KansasFest, internet archivist Jason Scott told me that the people still using Apple IIs do it earnestly, as a “nonironic” expression of their passion for one of the most groundbreaking computers ever created. "The Apple II fanatics here, the programmers of Apple IIs, the people who have Apple IIs that they're just bringing here to have repaired or to learn more, everybody is coming at it with the sense that this is some part of my life,” Scott said. “Either a minor or a major or a forgotten part of my life. And they're here, they're not judged, everyone loves what they're doing. It's not a stepping stone to something else." Image: John Brooks And so the September release of ProDOS 2.4 was huge news in the small but passionate Apple II community. What is ProDOS 2.4? It’s a fanmade operating system update for the computer, the first in 23 years. The operating system runs faster than ProDOS 2.0.3, which Apple released in 1993. It also adds native support for older 5.25” floppy disks on “newer” Apple IIs from the late 80s and early 90s, a hugely convenient feature for a community that is trying to copy and preserve old software before it is lost forever. Apple II users no longer have to dual boot their computers to run those programs and can more easily copy them to USB drives. Making it was a feat of modern programming skill and competency—each and every byte of memory usage had to be allocated precisely due to the computer’s performance limitations, each line of code vetted to make sure it was as efficient as possible. “There’s very little memory ProDOS is available to live in,” John Brooks, ProDOS’s programmer, told me. “It was a scramble to find every byte I could. I was writing functions that would take 50 bytes or something, but I only have 700 total to play with. It had to be rewritten between 150 and 200 times to squeeze everything in there.” Brooks, who used to code Sega Genesis games for Electronic Arts, started coding his own Apple II+ in 1979, when he was 10 years old. He says that he started work on ProDOS out of a sense of nostalgia, and a desire in the community to preserve older programs before the floppy disks they came on degraded. “I have a collection of 1,000 5.25” floppies in a storage room that need to be migrated to modern computers—programs I had written or things that were unique. More and more of them are becoming unreadable because they’re physically deteriorating,” he said. “Those are records of the dawn of an era that we’re never going to get back if we don’t save them. I want to preserve as much of that as possible.” Scott, for his part, said that ProDOS 2.4 is the “OS news of the year.” “This upgrade is a valentine not just to the community who makes use of this platform, but to the ideas of hacker improvement calling back decades before 1993,” Scott wrote in a blog post announcing the release. “The amount of people this upgrade benefits is relatively small in the world.” Topics: Comfort Content, apple ii, internet history, history, apple, Kansasfest, culture Contact the author by email or Twitter.

All three major labels have signed licensing deals with the service, which was originally announced last year, as have independents Merlin, PIAS, Believe Digital and InGrooves.   Magic Works, the London-based company behind Electric Jukebox, says deals have also been signed with all major pan-European publishing licensors, including Universal Music Publishing Group, Sony/ATV, Warner/Chappell Music, PRS For Music and SACEM, and that it plans to rollout out the service into international markets in 2017.      “I’m trying to make music streaming as simple as buying a toaster,” Magic Works CEO Rob Lewis tells Billboard. The first models -- available in three colors, red, blue and charcoal, each with a built in microphone to enable voice search -- go on sale in the U.K. tomorrow (November 09) and cost £169.00 ($209) for the device and a year of access to the company's catalog of music. After that year, owners will need to pay £52.00 ($64) for a yearly ‘premium pass,’ which enables on-demand access to the full catalog. Users who choose not to renew their subscription after 12 months will still be able to use the service, but will only be able to access editorially curated and celebrity playlists, supported by advertising.   Sheryl Crow, Robbie Williams and British TV personalities Stephen Fry and Alesha Dixon are among the ‘celebrity curators’ signed up at launch, all of whom are shareholders in the business. Sheryl Crow has even filmed a cheery, demonstrative trailer of how the Electric Jukebox works for its website.       Prior to launching Electric Jukebox, Lewis was founder and CEO of Omnifone, a digital music company that partnered with Swedish telecoms provider Telenor in 2007 to launch one of the first mobile music subscription streaming services.   Lewis exited Omnifone -- which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year and quietly bled some talent to Apple -- several years ago, and is keen to point out that Electric Jukebox is an entirely different proposition to mobile-based streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music, TIDAL, Deezer and Amazon. Whereas they largely target young, music and tech savvy millennials, Electric Jukebox is after what Lewis calls the casual and older music fans, who have yet to sign up to a monthly subscription service and, he says, are never likely to.   “The reality is that after 11 years of pushing consumers really quite aggressively towards these services, whilst also seeing the number of places selling CDs diminishing quite extraordinarily quickly, there are still a very small number of people in the world who have taken up this idea of music subscription,” says Lewis, contrasting the rate of streaming adoption with that from cassette to CD.    “The whole world moved from cassette to CD very quickly because you bought a CD player, you pressed play and off you went. It was so easy to adopt. I think [a fault of] myself and everyone else who was involved in the early days of streaming is that we failed to make it as fun, easy and simple as the old format changes,” he says.    To that end, Lewis hopes that Electric Jukebox will attract a mass market audience of casual music fans “who like to listen to music at home with the family and at social gatherings, but doesn’t have an affordable, fun and easy way to join this revolution.”   That’s despite it actually costing $50 more than a regular streaming subscription, which is usually not tethered to a TV set or the home, over a 12-month period (£169.00 compared to £119.00). If consumers continue subscribing to the service for a number of years, the price does incrementally fall below that of its competitors, but that’s a stout 'if.'   “We’re not targeting Spotify or Apple Music or Deezer consumers,” defends Lewis, citing independent research conducted by YouGov for Electric Jukebox that says only 8 percent of U.K. consumers currently subscribe to music streaming services. “We’re after the 92 percent of people who have been left out of streaming. Who play old CDs or listen to the radio and haven’t yet found a path to this wonderful idea of having access to all the music in the world.”    “We know that we’re taking on some of the goliaths - the Apples, the Amazons, etc. - and we have to be nimble and entrepreneurial in order to be able to achieve our goals,” he adds, citing a sustainable business model that, like the iPod and iPhone, draws revenue from the sale of hardware as well as subscriptions. That, says Lewis, has generated strong support from across the industry.    “What we have shown the music industry is that we can monetize a massive market of consumers who have failed to adopt to a new format. By bringing them into a world of streaming, we hope to make the music industry bigger.”   FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

Apple Releases iOS 10.2 Beta 2 to Public Testers, macOS 10.12.2 Beta 2 to Devs GO The new TV app on iOS 10.2 depends on Videos app Nov 8, 2016 22:00 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  We reported the other day that Apple started seeding the Beta 2 builds of the upcoming iOS 10.2, watchOS 3.1.1, and tvOS 10.1 operating systems to developers enrolled in the company's Apple Developer program. As expected, approximately 24 hours after registered developers were able to install the new Beta builds of iOS 10.2, tvOS 10.1 and watchOS 3.1.1 on their supported devices, now public beta testers can do that as well either by following our in-depth tutorial on how to install an iOS 10 Public Beta or by updating their existing Beta 1 installations. As mentioned in our initial report, the biggest new feature of the iOS 10.2 Public Beta 2 or Developer Beta 2 milestone is the addition of the new TV app that Apple unveiled last month during its "Hello Again" event where the Cupertino company announced new MacBook Pro models. The TV app will be installed automatically on your supported iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch device, along with the Videos app in case you removed it from your device.

The latest round of funding for the Menlo Park, Calif., startup raises its market value to a staggering $1.55 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal, even before it has put a single vehicle on the road. Zoox, which is currently in "stealth" mode, reportedly to keep competitors from learning what it's doing, has attracted high-profile executives from Alphabet, Apple and Tesla Motors who joined the company to help develop its vehicle. Zoox In the Zoox ride-sharing service vehicle -- The Boz -- passengers would face each other. The company was founded by Australian animation designer Tim Kentley-Klay and Jesse Levinson, a Stanford University engineer working with the university's autonomous vehicle team. Levinson also worked with Sebastian Thrun, Alphabet's first self-driving car designer. Zoox initially stated its driverless cars would be manufactured for ride-hailing services like Uber, according to IEEE Spectrum. When the company was initially formed in 2013, it published computer renderings of its gullwing-door concept car "The Boz," a sports car that closely resembles video game vehicles from the movie Tron. "At Zoox what we're creating ... is not a self-driving car any more than the automobile is a horseless carriage. We're not building a robo-taxi service, we're actually creating an advanced mobility service," Kentley-Klay said at the White House Frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh last month, according to the WSJ. "You can really think of it as Disneyland on the streets of perhaps San Francisco, and that means a vehicle which is smart enough to understand its environment but it's also importantly smart enough to understand you, where you need to be, what you want to do in the vehicle and how you want to move around the city." IHS Automotive has predicted that by 2025 there will be 300,000 self-driving cars and just as many driverless vehicles on the road; by 2030, there will be 2.2 million self-driving and driverless cars on the road; and by 2035, there will be 11 million self-driving and 10 million driverless vehicles in operation. As the auto industry races toward shipping fully autonomous vehicles, self-driving technology startups have become attractive acquisition targets for traditional automakers and others. For example, General Motors earlier this year, acquired three-year-old Cruise Automation for its deep software talent and rapid development capability -- a move designed to further accelerate the automaker's development of autonomous vehicle technology. In July, ride-sharing service Uber acquired Otto, a maker of self-driving technology for delivery trucks. Ford Motor Co. plans to begin mass producing a fully autonomous vehicle by 2021 that it will sell for ride-hailing markets such as Uber. Ford's vehicle will be manufactured with no steering wheel, gas or brake pedal. In other words, a driver will not be required.

Resend activation e-mail Infinite Loop / The Apple Ecosystem The complete guide to living a newfangled USB-C (and Thunderbolt 3) lifestyle Finding good, safe cables and accessories takes more work than you'd think. by Andrew Cunningham - Nov 8, 2016 9:35 pm UTC Login to bookmark 190 Enlarge / You're going to need some help if you want to switch from the current array of ports to USB-C and Thunderbolt 3. Andrew Cunningham If you put in an order for a new MacBook Pro, welcome! You’re about to enter a brave new world, one where all your ports look the same as each other but remain totally different from every other port on whatever laptop you were using before. It’s not just the MacBook Pro making this transition. More and more laptops and phones are either including a USB Type-C port or switching to it entirely, and, going forward, this standard is going to get even harder to avoid. We’ve been big fans of the technology’s potential since before we even knew what it would look like. And while in practice it has created more than a little confusion, it should still be an improvement over the jumble of ports that we’ve had to live with previously. That said, the future looks brighter than the present, especially if you happen to have a phone or tablet or laptop that completely forgoes all other ports in favor of USB-C. Dongles, adapters, and new cables will easily be the norm for the next half-decade or so until everyone catches up, and it’s frustrating to have to dig through piles of Amazon listings to find stuff that will get the job done. The list below won't cover every possible use case for USB-C, but it should at a bare minimum help you replace all the ports on your old MacBook Pro. It represents an unexpectedly large amount of research and comparison shopping, not just for cables and adapters that will work with both USB-C PCs and Macs, but also cables and adapters that will do so without breaking your stuff or creating fire hazards. Table of Contents USB Type-A Micro USB Mini USB Lightning Video out: DisplayPort, HDMI, DVI, and VGA Gigabit Ethernet Thunderbolt and Thunderbolt 2 Card readers What if I just want USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 cables? How about flash drives? About USB-C and Thunderbolt docks USB Type-A Enlarge / Monoprice's four-port USB-C to USB-A hub. Monoprice Is there an official adapter? Yup. Apple sells a simple white USB-C to USB-A dongle for $19, and it will be $9 until the end of the year. The company’s VGA and HDMI display adapters also include a single Type-A port for convenience’s sake. What else is there? This is by far the most common type of adapter people are going to need, and lots and lots of companies have stepped up to answer the call. If all you want is a little one-port nub, there are plenty of no-name adapters you can grab on Amazon, and they’re often in a two-pack (handy for when you inevitably lose one). These from Rankie will run you $8 and they’re well-reviewed, and I use this one from Nonda because it’s aluminum and comes in different finishes that match the various MacBooks. If you want to turn one USB-C port into multiple USB-A ports, Monoprice sells a four-port USB 3.0 hub for $17 and a seven-port version of the same hub for $27. These are great for accessories like printers or webcams but less great for high-speed data transfers, since all of those ports are effectively arguing over the bandwidth provided by a single USB 3.0 port. These dongles also only provide USB Type-A; some hubs that we’ll recommend later can also do other things. Micro USB Enlarge / Cable Matters' USB-C to micro USB cable. Amazon The standard USB Type-A connector is the most common one on the host end, but the thing you’re plugging in will often use micro or mini USB (these are technically all part of the Type-B family of connectors, as is the larger one used for USB printers). Micro USB is the smaller of the two, and it’s nearly omnipresent in everything from Kindles to high-end cameras to smart home accessories to older and lower-end Android phones. You can use one of the USB-A dongles above with your current cables, but here are some other options. Is there an official cable? Not really; Apple virtually never used micro or mini USB (the service port on older Apple TVs is the only example I can think of). Apple will sell you Belkin’s version of the cable for a hefty $20 or $14 with the discount—it’s very Apple-like in aesthetics and in price. What else is there? This $7 3-foot cable from Cable Matters has USB-C on one end and micro USB on the other; a longer 6-foot cable costs $8. Reviews and the manufacturer’s product page indicate that this cable supports faster 5V/3A charging speeds, something that some other cables don’t do. If you don’t care about those faster charging speeds, Monoprice offers a similar cable in a variety of lengths and colors for a little less money. Monoprice also sells 3- and 6-foot USB-C cables that have the ugly, bulky “Micro-USB 3.0” connector on the other end. This connector cropped up in some slim external hard drives and very occasionally in phones. If, for whatever reason, you need to convert the other way—if you want to take a micro USB cable and plug it into a USB-C port—Anker sells a two-pack for $8. These have been verified as spec-compliant by Google engineer and USB-C cable testing vigilante Benson Leung. Mini USB Enlarge / A mini USB to USB-C cable. Monoprice It has become rare these days, but you’ll still sometimes run into the larger mini USB connector in DSLRs, external drives, and other accessories. Is there an official cable? No, and there’s not an Apple-blessed version of the cable in its online store either. What else is there? The same Cable Matters micro USB cable we recommended above comes in a mini USB version; right now both the 3- and 6-foot versions will run you $8. Monoprice has a 1.5-foot version for $4.49. Lightning Enlarge / Apple's Lightning to USB-C cable is the only one you should buy, for now. Apple The brewing civil war between USB-C and Lightning is probably the most frustrating thing about Apple’s hardware ecosystem right now. Buy a brand-new iPhone 7 and a brand-new MacBook Pro today, and without an adapter or separate cable you won’t have any way to connect them to each other. The latest versions of all of Apple’s external mice, trackpads, and keyboards all charge via Lightning, too. Is there an official cable? Yes. Apple sells both 1m and 2m versions of the Lightning to USB-C cable for $25 and $35 respectively, or $19 and $29 with the discount. This is expensive, but Apple gave me one of these with our MacBook Pro review unit, and the good news is that these cables are much thicker and sturdier than the USB-A to Lightning cables that come with iPhones, iPads, and other peripherals. They should be less prone to fraying than the old cables, and hopefully once Apple starts including USB-C to Lightning cables in the box with iPhones and iPads they’ll feel similarly sturdy. What else is there? Again, there are lots of small- and no-name companies out there rushing to capitalize on this brand-new market that Apple has created, and Amazon is flooded with options of questionable quality. Fortunately, we have an easy litmus test to tell probably fine cables from possibly not fine ones, and that’s Apple’s MFi certification program. As of this writing, none of the USB-C to Lightning cables listed on Amazon appear to be MFi-certified, and relatively reliable and respectable companies like Anker, Monoprice, and AmazonBasics don’t offer them either. Not only does this mean that the cables may not comply with Apple’s specs, but your phone or tablet may yell at you for using non-compliant accessories. Honestly, you probably already have a bunch of Lightning cables sitting around—your best move in this case is to continue using those cables with a USB-A to USB-C adapter when you need to plug one into your MacBook or MacBook Pro. It’s annoying, but if you don’t want to pay Apple’s prices, it’s the safest possible option right now. You don’t want to mess around when you buy cables or adapters that you rely on for charging, and I can’t stress this enough—bad ones can damage your devices and be serious fire hazards. Video out: DisplayPort, HDMI, DVI, and VGA Enlarge / It ain't pretty, but this VGA and HDMI dongle will connect your stuff to most monitors. Amazon Are there official adapters? Yes. Apple provides separate HDMI and VGA dongles for $69 each, or $49 with the current discounts. These also include a single USB-A port and another USB-C port that can be used for charging—not something you’ll necessarily need for the MacBook Pros, but handy for the one-ported MacBook. Just note that none of these laptops will be able to drive a 4K display at 60Hz over HDMI. You’ll still need to use DisplayPort for that. What else is there? Let’s start with DisplayPort, since those ports are still the only way to do 60Hz 4K. Cable Matters sells a $29 cable that will run directly from a DisplayPort-enabled USB-C port to a monitor, taking advantage of USB Alternate Mode to carry a native DisplayPort signal over the cable. Google will sell you one for $40 that works just fine with Apple’s stuff, if you’d be more comfortable with a bigger brand name. If you’d rather use an adapter for an existing DisplayPort cable, Cable Matters will sell you one of those for $20. Things get trickier if you’re looking for something to go from your USB-C port to a Mini DisplayPort adapter or cable. Amazon reviews for the products that do crop up are mostly mixed to nonexistent. Odds are your monitor uses a full-size DisplayPort for input rather than mini DisplayPort, so if that’s the case we’d recommend you just replace your cables rather than messing with mini DisplayPort adapters for your current cables. As for VGA and HDMI, Cable Matters will sell you an ugly-ish but well-reviewed and functional dongle that provides both of those connectors plus USB-A and gigabit Ethernet (the Ethernet will work fine without extra drivers in Windows but “may” need drivers under macOS, which is common with USB Ethernet dongles). Aukey has a standalone VGA dongle for $16 and a standalone HDMI dongle for $20. And while USB-C to DVI connectors are less common than the others, CableCreation has one available for $19 (its VGA and HDMI adapters are also $16 and $17, respectively, they just don’t look quite as Apple-y as the Aukey versions).

The company is only selling Unlocked SIM-Free iPhone 6s models for now. These come at a relatively lower price from Apple with full one-year warranty in the United States. Consumers will save $100 on the base 16GB iPhone 6s, although the new iPhone 6s base model now comes with 32GB storage for $549. As of now, Apple is offering different colour options, but only in 16GB and 64GB storage variants. The 16GB iPhone 6s starts at $449, while the 16GB iPhone 6s Plus is priced at $529. Meanwhile in another news, Apple might introduce a ‘Jet White’ variant for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models, as reported by a Japanese blog Mac Otakara. While it doesn’t mention when Apple can add the new variant to the existing lineup and also the source doesn’t seem reliable, so you should take it with a pinch of salt.

By Jason Cipriani | November 8, 2016 -- 20:45 GMT (12:45 PST) | Topic: Apple If you've recently broken your iPhone and don't have insurance or AppleCare, you can save yourself some money and purchase a refurbished iPhone directly from Apple. As MacRumors reported, Apple recently added iPhones to its refurbished storefront for the first time. In the past, Apple has used the same website to sell refurbished Macs, iPads, iPods, Apple TVs, and accessories. The listings are currently limited to 16GB or 64GB iPhone 6S models, all of which are unlocked and will work on nearly any wireless carrier. review Apple iPhone 6s: More than just a speed-bump The iPhone 6s provides major improvements over the iPhone 6 in terms of performance, camera quality and the new 3D Touch technology. Read More When purchasing a refurbished device instead of a new one, your overall savings depend on the model and storage. Apple no longer sells a 16GB or 64GB model of either size iPhone 6S, making it tough to do direct price comparisons. However, you most certainly will save money by going the refurbished route if a 64GB phone will work for you. For example, you can buy a refurbished iPhone 6S Plus with 64GB of storage for $589, or a new iPhone 6S Plus with 32GB of storage for $649. One of the biggest advantages of buying a refurbished phone from Apple is the fact the company thoroughly tests each device and guarantees it with a full one-year warranty from the date you purchase it. Apple also replaces all outer shells and batteries on refurbished devices, which makes the device feel and function like a new phone would. Purchasing a refurbished device from Apple may still be more expensive than buying a used phone off Craigslist or eBay, but at least you have the peace of mind in knowing it has been checked, repaired, and certified by Apple.

Technology 1 0 0 November 8, 2016 MacBook Pro 2016 Shipping: November 11 Soonest ETA For Earliest Buyers? Venus Montalbo The initial batch of MacBook Pro 2016 units is most likely already shipping, with reports that November 11 could be the earliest possible date of arrival of these new Apple laptops to customers. If you pre-order the MacBook Pro 2016 model with Apple Retina Touch Bar display and your credit card was recently charged by Apple, it could mean that the order is now being processed and shipping of the unit is already on the horizon. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] As Apple prepares for the first batch of shipments of the MacBook Pro 2016 (both the 13-inch and 15-inch models with Touch Bar), earliest customers can expect to receive it this week, specifically starting Friday, according to reports. Those who ordered the new laptop model on the day of Apple’s “Hello Again” launch event (October 27) or a day after were the ones who reportedly received credit card charges on Monday. “Delivery dates for the first batch of shipments generally fall between Nov. 11 and Nov. 17, with some of the first wave reporting a date range ending as late as Nov. 25,” AppleInsider further explained. This week is the shipping date for those who ordered the new MacBook Pro under original 2-3 weeks. I've to wait a month #TouchBarIsComing — Alejo MirandadeLarra (@AlejoMiranda) November 7, 2016 Looks like Apple has started charging cards for the new MacBook Pro line. Hopefully we will start seeing shipping movement this week. — Mark Dalton (@TheMarkDalton) November 7, 2016 My order of the new MacBook Pro is processing. Hopefully shipping shortly. — Aaron Zollo (@Zollotech) November 7, 2016 Website 9to5Mac confirmed reports about the imminent shipping of the new MacBook Pros explaining at the Cupertino-based tech giant usually starts delivering orders soon after charging their customer’s credit cards. However, it seems like the order status has not been changed yet to give an expected delivery day. “Apple usually changes orders from ‘Processing’ to ‘Shipped’ after charging cards, at which time customers should have a more accurate estimated delivery date provided compared to Apple’s original estimated week-long window,” the site noted. More on the expected shipping schedule for the MacBook Pro 2016, it seems like those who ordered the Touch Bar-enabled laptop late will get earlier shipment timeframe. From their original expected delivery time, which is at the end of December, the shipping schedule showing up as of the moment is early or mid-December. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] The Macbook Pro 2016 is Apple’s refreshed version of its flagship laptop line and one of its significant highlights is the Touch Bar, which is featured on both the 13-inch and 15-inch models. It is a second Retina display located above the upper part of the keyboard, replacing the Fn keys. The power button with Touch ID is also incorporated in this new feature. Pocket-Lint further described Macbook Pro 2016’s Retina Touch Bar display. “This OLED panel supports up to 10-points of touch and is full colour, designed to change its options depending on what you’re doing on your Mac. It will offer things like volume sliders, shortcuts in your browser, text predictions when typing and tools when using more advanced programs.” Although the new MacBook Pro comes with this new cool feature, Apple received a backlash from its followers mostly because of the massive price hike of the devices compared to previous models and for the huge price difference of the Touch Bar-free and Touch Bar-equipped model. The 13-inch Macbook Pro without the Touch Bar is available for $1,499, while the model with this feature is $300 more expensive. Meanwhile, those who wish to get the 15-inch MacBook Pro will have to shell out $2,399 Just ordered the new @apple MacBook Pro. All I can say is, at that price, my books better write themselves. — Jamie McGuire (@JamieMcGuire) November 2, 2016 I was impressed by @Apple's new MacBook Pro. Then I saw the price ???? $600 more than I payed for my pro SIX years ago. — SadSynth (@_SadSynth) October 30, 2016 Brits are not happy about the price jump for Apple's new MacBook Pro.. Related Articles: https://t.co/6lfmivztSA — iPhone News (@iphonenewsooyuz) October 30, 2016 I honestly cannot get over the price of the new MacBook Pro. — Matthew (@mattybriggs1) October 30, 2016 Also, here’s a review for the new Macbook Pro: <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lQtrmjubfEo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Explaining Apple’s pricing for these new MacBook Pros, Phil Schiller, Senior Vice President of Worldwide marketing for Apple, said the following, as cited by iDropNews. “Affordability is absolutely something we care about. But we don’t design for price, we design for the experience and the quality people expect from Mac. Sometimes that means we end up at the higher end of the range, but not on purpose, just because that’s what it costs.” If you’re planning to buy the MacBook Pro, its expected availability in Apple stores starts around November 15.

Apple mixed reality ambitions could result in... a revolutionary TV? by Chris Smith 08 November 2016 0 shares Read Comments Apple is working on a new television set that will incorporate ‘mixed reality technology’ according to noted tech evangelist Robert Scoble. Speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon (via Wareable), Scoble said the new TV set has been in the works since the time of Steve Jobs and will be revealed within a year. He said Apple has a whopping 600 engineers on the project, with the whole deal based around the tech from the PrimeSense start-up it bought way back in 2013. He said: “Tim Cook and Steve Jobs, I believe, sat down and talked about the future of TV and in 11 months they are going to show you the future of TV – because they are building the PrimeSense sensor right into the television, into the iPad and into the iPhone… so you can do this kind of mixed reality. "Apple has 600 engineers working on it. There was a patent released this morning – they've been working on mixed reality, or augmented reality, for five years… minimum.” Related: Apple TV review You may remember PrimeSense as the company that helped Microsoft create the criminally-undervalued Kinect Sensor. Scobel claimed whatever Apple unveils by October next year will “blow even his mind.” The patent he refers to involves an AR mapping system for iPhone, which will offer real time augmented views of a real-life environment. Where this would all tie in with a television set Apple is thought to have abandoned long ago remains to be seen. Does this all seem a little far-fetched to you too?

joshua stein about | projects | rss | e-mail | github | twitter The 2016 MacBook Pro posted to this is not a weblog on nov 8th, 2016 with tags apple, mac, and nerd I've been using an 11" MacBook Air as my primary computer for six years. It's a great computer that satisfied a lot of requirements I had for a laptop: thin, lightweight, small form factor, excellent keyboard and touchpad, mostly silent, but not an Atom or Core M processor. I've done a lot on this little computer, like compiling and maintaining an Android ROM, writing the Rails, iOS, and Android apps for Pushover, creating Lobsters, recording and editing 40 episodes of Garbage, and lots of OpenBSD development. The current model I have is a Mid-2013 MacBook Air with a 1.3Ghz Core i5 with 4Gb of RAM and a 256Gb SSD. These are not terrible specs (unless you are one of those complaining that the new MacBook Pro doesn't have 32Gb of RAM to run your text editor written in JavaScript) but I've recently been bumping up against its limits. I would run out of disk space while editing large podcast episodes in Audacity, and the 1366x768 non-Retina screen has started to feel a bit cramped in Xcode. Certainly using the HiDPI screens on my Samsung ATIV Book 9 and Chromebook Pixel have ruined me for non-HiDPI screens. Compromises When the 12" Retina MacBook came out, I bought it hoping to retain the form factor of my Air and get a larger and higher resolution display. Unfortunately, I returned it after a short while because I disliked the keyboard so much. The key travel was so shallow and would bottom out with much of my key presses, causing pain in my fingers. The basic premise of the 12" MacBook felt like a big compromise: if you were willing to put up with the lack of ports and an uncomfortable keyboard, you could get something very small and lightweight in return. I'm no stranger to such compromises, but this was not one I was willing to make for my primary workstation. As WWDC 2016 came and went with no mention of updated Macs, I anxiously awaited the next Apple event to see what would replace my Air. When the first photos of the new MacBook Pro "leaked", I was disappointed to see that it had adopted the terrible keyboard from the MacBook and replaced the physical Escape key with the TouchBar. As the Air has typically been the cheaper Mac laptop, both in cost and in materials like its screen, I watched the October Keynote hoping the TouchBar and keyboard mess would be confined to the Pro while leaving the Air to "just" a spec bump and a Retina screen. The demos of the Touch Bar made it seem completely impractical for doing anything more than adjusting screen brightness or volume. You can see it in this woman's posture, how awkward she looks hunched over trying to peck at the tiny screen under her finger. And the thought of a DJ actually using that tiny bar to produce music instead of a physical drum machine had me laughing. The Touch Bar seems like a poor solution for problems no one had.   As the Keynote dragged on, I learned my 11" Air not only didn't get a Retina update, but had been completely discontinued. The 13" Air didn't get an update but will probably be discontinued soon as well. While there was good news in that the new 13" MacBook Pro would be available with physical function and Escape keys, it would be considered a low-end model with weaker specs and only 2 Thunderbolt/USB-C ports. Since it was clear my upgrade path had just narrowed to basically one machine, I ordered the "low-end" model with physical function keys, 16Gb of RAM, and a 512Gb SSD for $2,044 (with a USB-C Lightning cable, of course, so I could actually do iOS development with it). New Compromises I used the new MacBook Pro for a couple days, and just like the 12" MacBook, I ended up returning it. Its keyboard, while better than the 12" MacBook, still represents a compromise that I'm not willing to make. I am not cobbling together e-mail replies at a coffee shop. I am a professional software developer and my job requires tons of typing every day. My development environment is completely keyboard-driven, my text editor is completely keyboard-driven, and all of the work I do on remote servers is entirely keyboard-driven. I need my keyboard to work reliably, I need to be able to make keystrokes (which include arrow keys, key modifiers, Escape, etc.) accurately, and I want the keyboard to just work without thinking about it or having to change my typing habits depending on which computer I'm on. The 2016 MacBook Pro's keyboard does none of that for me. The keys have very low travel, which results in a hollow, unreassuring feedback when typing. Since its keys are very close together and also very short, it can be hard to find accessory keys (like the arrows or backspace) quickly by feel. 2015 MacBook Pro 2016 MacBook Pro Aside from the keyboard, the 2016 MacBook Pro also introduces a number of other compromises. The magnetic MagSafe power connector is gone, replaced by an all-purpose Thunderbolt/USB-C port. I'm no stranger to USB-C, having a 2015 Chromebook Pixel that can charge via USB-C, but I'd still take the proprietary MagSafe over a standard USB-C charger any day. Losing MagSafe also takes with it the LED on its connector, which lets you know when the laptop has finished charging without having to power it up or unlock it. The new USB-C power brick that comes with the 2016 MacBook Pro also loses the little wings on it which serve to wrap the rest of the cord neatly. Much has been said elsewhere about all of the dongles required with the new MacBook Pro since it only has 2 (or 4 on the TouchBar model) USB-C ports with nothing else. No more DisplayPort, HDMI, USB-A, or SD card slot. This doesn't bother me too much since I rarely use any of those ports when I'm not at my desk, but I don't understand why Apple wouldn't include at least one USB-A port on this first model year of the transition. Some tried to reason that if Apple included that legacy port, customers would never transition to USB-C, which just seems silly to me. My Chromebook Pixel from 2015 has two USB-A and two USB-C connectors, and I use them both and have accessories for both types. Conveniently, my Pixel has a USB-C port on both sides, allowing it to be charged from either port depending on where the laptop is sitting in relation to the wall wart. On the 2016 MacBook Pro, the "low-end" model that I got has both of its USB-C ports on the left side with nothing but a headphone jack on the right side (which also lost its optical output). If I have to lose MagSafe, at least give me the convenience of being able to charge on both sides. So now the iPhone 7 has no headphone port and only a Lightning port, and this MacBook Pro which came out after it has a headphone port and no Lightning port. Connecting an iPhone to the new MacBook Pro (which is required for anyone doing iOS development) requires a new cable since the one included with iPhones is USB-A. What a mess. While Apple did eventually lower the price of its adapters after so many people complained, they could have just included a few basic ones (like USB-A to USB-C) in the box especially given its high price. It's pretty standard for PC manufacturers to include adapters with them when they have non-standard ports for things like video out and Ethernet. Remember when the iPhone actually came with a dock in the box? Apple finally removed the startup chime (something I've had to do with 3rd party software for years), and made it automatically power on when the lid is opened, like Chromebooks do. I welcome both of those changes. The new Retina display is brighter than the previous one, and certainly a welcome upgrade from the 1366x768 display on my Air. I didn't get a model with the Touch Bar, but I predict it ends up being just like Force Touch, or 3D Touch on the iPhone. It's an extra feature that developers can write clever functionality for, but because not all users will have the hardware available (or they won't want to use it), developers can't rely on it being used for any critical or even routine functionality in an application. There will always have to be an additional way of triggering that functionality on hardware that doesn't have Force/3D Touch (or now the Touch Bar), so aside from showing it off in some demo videos, it won't get widely used. Once the novelty wears off, users will go back to using the keyboard and touchpad because so many other things will still need to be done through them. The Touch ID sensor addition is nice, though I don't think I'd use it much since I would prefer to keep my Mac locked by a passphrase. If you see photos of the Touch Bar in use, you'll note that the software Escape key shown on the Touch Bar is always offset to the right quite a bit. This is because the Touch Bar's display doesn't actually extend all the way to the right because of the Touch ID sensor, and so for for symmetry, Apple made it not extend all the way to the left either. But rather than just leave that blank space on the Touch Bar, why couldn't Apple have put a physical key there the same width as the Touch ID? You know, like the Escape key, right where the Escape key was before. Too Many Compromises My main gripe with the 2016 MacBook Pro is that so many of these compromises were just unnecessary. The 13" MacBook Air is, as close as makes no difference, the same thickness as the new MacBook Pro, yet the Air has a full-depth keyboard. The butterfly keyboard on the 12" MacBook and now the Pro were created just to solve the problem of how to fit more stuff underneath it in a thinner laptop. It was not created as a superior keyboard, yet it found its way to the MacBook Pro just because it let Apple shave a few millimeters off its height. The touchpad is now comically large and gets touched more while typing. Was anyone complaining that the touchpad wasn't large enough before? The "low-end" Pro only has two Thunderbolt/USB-C ports while they were able to fit four in the same exact enclosure on the "high-end" version, implying that this was purely a cost-saving measure (on a laptop that still costs $2,000). So with all of that said, I was still in the position of needing a new Mac after returning my 2016 MacBook Pro. (For anyone about to say that I should have ditched Apple and got a better laptop from a different vendor: I make my living developing a product that has an iOS app, so I am tied to the Mac platform for much of my work.) A quick comparison between the 2016 MacBook Pro and its predecessor showed that the specs were not appreciably different in terms of performance, storage, RAM, screen resolution, etc. and I would still retain the great keyboard, MagSafe, and accessory ports. 2013 MacBook Air 11", 2015 MacBook Pro 13", 2016 MacBook Pro 13" So with that, I bought an Early-2015 13" MacBook Pro with a 2.9Ghz Core i5, 16Gb of RAM, and a 512Gb SSD, on which I am now happily typing. I'm not terribly happy at having to buy a one-and-a-half year old computer, or having to pay the same price as the 2016 model with the same performance, or knowing that I could have bought this same exact computer a year and a half ago when it came out instead of having to wait all this time with my 11" Air. But at least I'm happy to type on it.

Apple is sharply reducing the prices of its USB-C adapters for its new MacBook Pro laptops after hearing loud complaints from many users about the cost and need for the dongles that will let them use their new machines with legacy peripherals that they already own. In an emailed statement sent to eWEEK on Nov. 7, Apple said it announced the USB-C adapter price cuts that will be good through the end of 2016 to address the concerns of the company's customers. Under the new pricing plan, all Apple-branded USB-C to USB adapters will be $9 instead of $19; while Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapters will sell for $29, instead of $49. USB-C to Lightning cables will be $19 instead of $25 for the 1-meter version, while the 2-meter version will be $29 instead of $35. In addition, the Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport adapter will be $49 instead of $69. Some 85 percent of Samsung's troubled Galaxy Note7 smartphones have been returned since a massive recall in September and October due to battery fires and explosions. But the company is still working to encourage owners to return the remaining phones as soon as possible. To hasten Note7 returns, Samsung is releasing a software update that will cut the available charging capacity of the recalled handsets to 60 percent so they will have shorter battery lives, the company announced in a Nov. 4 statement. "As of today, nearly 85 percent of all recalled Galaxy Note7 devices have been replaced through the U.S. Note7 Refund and Exchange Program, with the majority of the participants opting to receive another Samsung smartphone," the company said in the statement. Oracle is finally getting its hands on NetSuite, a provider of cloud enterprise resource planning applications. The move is designed to bolster the growth of Oracle's cloud software-as-as-service business and give it greater access to the important midmarket space. Oracle officials said in a statement early Nov. 5 that enough shares of NetSuite had been tendered to enable Oracle to move forward with the $9.3 billion acquisition, adding that the deal will close Nov. 7. The announcement of the deal this weekend came as the Nov. 4 stock tender deadline that Oracle had set was passing. Soon, smaller companies won't have to pay extra for its Access database management application. Microsoft said it's bundling the Access database with its Office 365 plans for small and midsize businesses. Next month, Microsoft will be rolling out Access, which is presently included with Office 365 ProPlus, E3 and E5 plans, to Business and Business Premium subscribers as part of a client software update. The company plans to dole out automatic installations to customers over a two-month period from Dec. 1 through Jan. 30, 2017.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Technology 3 0 0 November 8, 2016 MacBook Pro 2016 Shipping: Customers To Receive Touch Bar Model Soon? Brad Faber On Monday, news regarding MacBook Pro 2016 shipping began to surface. According to AppleInsider, a few customers who were early purchasers of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar have begun seeing that Apple has now charged their credit cards. This is a sign that a new MacBook Pro may soon be showing up on their doorstep. “Multiple reports collated by AppleInsider and other sources show that Apple is gearing up for the first wave of shipments of the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, in every configuration. The credit card charges being made on Monday seem limited to those who ordered machines on the day of or the day after the Oct. 27 “Hello Again” press event.” #MacBook #Apple – MacBook Pro with Touch Bar shipping status : For those of you that are constantly checking your… https://t.co/oKZU6AHMGg pic.twitter.com/SkEX2PcOaY — Tech Science & Money (@www_appsnews) November 8, 2016 More information on MacBook Pro 2016 shipping was made available by Jordan Kahn of 9to5Mac. According to that report, Apple customers usually receive their products a short time after their credit cards are charged, but as of Monday, orders had not been updated to show an expected delivery date. “Apple typically begins shipping devices shortly after charging credit cards, but so far it appears to have not yet changed the status of orders to provide an expected delivery day. Apple usually changes orders from ‘Processing’ to ‘Shipped’ after charging cards, at which time customers should have a more accurate estimated delivery date provided compared to Apple’s original estimated week-long window.” MacBook Pro 2016 shipping for the Touch Bar model may be just around the corner. AppleInsider reports that the first wave of customers typically receives their shipments between November 11 and November 18, with the wait lasting until November 25 at the absolute latest. AppleInsider also states that customers who ordered their MacBook Pro a little bit later (those who ordered two or more days after the Hello Again event) do not appear to have had their credit cards charged. However, some have seen their expected delivery dates move up from the end of December to mid-December, meaning it could still arrive in time for the holiday season for some who may have purchased it as a gift. For in-store purchases, baseline models are reportedly expected to be available around November 15, but it will be a longer wait for the more advanced models. The news of MacBook Pro 2016 shipping should be a big source of excitement for those who have been excited about the product since it was first announced. When the newest version was first unveiled, Apple marketed it as “the thinnest and lightest” MacBook Pro to date. The 13-inch model was reported to be 17 percent thinner than the last model, and the 15-inch model was said to be 14 percent thinner. Many other exciting features were revealed as well. The biggest element that stands out about the new MacBook Pro is the revolutionary Touch Bar feature. AppleInsider describes the Touch Bar as being “application specific,” giving users “dynamic buttons and input options” and providing fast entry to popular tools. The new model will also feature a Touch ID fingerprint, which enables a user to log into their device or even make payments with only his or her fingerprint. Meet the MacBook Pro’s new Touch Bar with TouchID https://t.co/cCzisxHaBQ pic.twitter.com/qX3A3mJULR — Engadget (@engadget) October 30, 2016 Updates regarding MacBook Pro 2016 shipping and the volume and frequency at which they are going out should continue to be in the news as well. DigiTimes recently reported on how the demand for the product is expected to be strong, and there are market watchers who expect shipments to surpass 15 million units this year alone. “Thanks to the recent rising MacBook Pro shipments, some market watchers expect Apple’s MacBook shipments to reach 15 million units in 2016, with shipments staying at that level in 2017.” The MacBook Pro 2016 with Touch Bar is also very expensive, with prices ranging from $1,789 to over $4,000. But if it is in your price range and you have already made a purchase of this new, state-of-the-art product, it may be time to look for an update. Your MacBook Pro 2016 shipping status could change very soon, especially if you were an early buyer.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Nov 8, 2016 at 2:32PM Services have become an incredibly important part of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) business, which now brings in more revenue than either the Mac or the iPad. Meanwhile, Apple's guidance left a little to be desired. In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu, CFA, break down the results from the latest earnings release. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 28, 2016. Dylan Lewis: One of the things I thought was particularly interesting with the commentary from this report was, you look at the services segment, you look at the last couple quarters, you've seen service segment revenue up 20%, and they're really touting this number. Most recently, it was $6.3 billion, which is roughly 13% of revenue. At this point, we're coming up on two full years of them breaking out services as a product segment. Looking backwards, we've seen a huge step change in the fiscal Q1 quarter. In 2015 fiscal Q4, we were at $5.1 billion. That hopped up a full billion dollars in the following quarter, fiscal Q1 2016. So, I'm really curious looking forward what that segment might look like. Theoretically, we should be in the step-change quarter. It'll be interesting to see if they can sustain that growth, or if we're going to continue to see them hum along at more or less flat sequential growth. Evan Niu: Yeah, services is becoming huge. Like you said, it's $6.3 billion. And if you look at the past four quarters, this is now basically a $25 billion business. That's bigger than the Mac, bigger than the iPad. It's their second-biggest business at this point, which is kind of crazy to think about, because Apple is typically not that great at services in general. Particularly because the services revenue, most of it is not coming from a subscription service like Apple Music that bills every month. That's certainly part of it. But it comes back to what we were talking about earlier, which is the whole installed base-related purchases. A lot of that services revenue comes from them relying on their users buying content and apps on the App Store reliably. That's why that number is important, and I'm surprised they didn't give it. Not a whole lot of it is occurring, monthly subscription fees that you can count on every month. So, it is important, but they're doing a really good job of growing that number. It's a pretty big business now, $25 billion. Lewis: It's huge. I think, you hit on the installed base thing, if there are any issues with them growing that installed base, it stands to reason that the services segment won't continue to grow the way that it has. That's kind of the relationship there, and that's why you always see the step change happen in fiscal Q1, because that's when they sell a ton of iPhones. You're going to see those two things move together. That's certainly something that I'm watching in the coming quarter, because they're pointing to it more and more in their conference calls. I think it's an indication of a lot of other elements of their business. Niu: Absolutely. Lewis: Looking forward and looking at the guidance that they provided, for the first time since physical Q1 of last year, Apple is guiding for year-over-year growth next quarter, which I think is a welcome sign for a lot of investors. The company is expecting revenue to come in somewhere between $76 billion and $78 billion. When we say year-over-year growth, fiscal Q1 last year, they posted revenue of $75.8 billion. So, it's not going to be huge, but it is positive growth. Niu: I'll take it.  Lewis: Yeah, at this point, looking year-over-year declines for a little while, it's certainly a welcome trend to see. I think some people are maybe a little disappointed in this guidance, given some of the tailwinds that the business has right now at its disposal. This is something we've talked about in previous shows. One of the major competitors, the Samsung Note 7, being off the market, you would think would be a much larger catalyst for Apple than maybe they're letting on. Niu: Yeah. They declined to give any meaningful comment on whether or not they think they'll benefit, but I think pretty clearly that they will. And now there's even reports that the Galaxy S7 Edge is catching on fire. I don't know if you've seen it, there's not as many of them. But there were reports starting in September. That was a month ago. Again, it's not as widespread, but there are a handful of cases across the world, like in China and the Philippines with the S7 Edge -- which is one of the phones that Samsung is pushing people toward. And here's the crazy part -- one of those phone was a replacement for a Galaxy Note 7. So Samsung gives a customer an S7 Edge to replace his Note 7 that caught on fire, and the S7 Edge catches on fire! It's just a mess. Lewis: That's a bad brand experience there. Niu: I think, going back to their guidance, I do think, the one thing that stood out to me as far as not so great in the guidance was the gross margin guide. The revenue guidance was fine because it'll be nice to get a little growth, even if it's not a lot. We had three consecutive quarters of negative growth up top at this point, so I think anything is nice. On the profitability side, I was surprised, too, because in the fourth quarter, Apple always enjoys a lot of operating leverage when their revenue scales up to these really high levels. Usually, you see margins expanding in a pretty meaningful way, usually to the point where you're at 40%. They're guiding to basically upwards of 38.5%. So, 50 basis points shy of what I would expect them to guide to. And, for what it's worth, last year they did 40%. Lewis: In fairness on that 40% figure, that was also a quarter where they realized $550 million or so in a patent dispute agreement with Samsung. I think that added about 40 basis points to that margin number. I think the true margin number was like 39.6% or so. Niu: But if you go back another year, it was still like 39.9%. It's still pretty close to 40%. And I know it doesn't sound like a lot, 50 basis points, but when you're talking about a business this big, every basis point counts. One basis point is like $7.6 million. So, multiply that by 50, and that's gross profit, coming straight down through the income statement. They've been talking a lot about commodity costs and component costs being very favorable. So, I'm wondering why that guidance wasn't stronger. It's also possible that there are some currency effects, because they've been battling the strengthening dollar for a really long time. That's very much hurting them, because about two-thirds of revenue comes from outside the U.S. The strengthening dollar has been hurting them for many quarters. So, that could also be part of it. I think that might have been why the original market reaction was negative. If you're watching after hours, the stock jumped on the iPhone number as soon as it was released, started getting back those gains as people read through the numbers and started digesting them a little bit.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 8, 2016 at 3:16PM Highly respected microprocessor analyst David Kanter recently posted an article on his website, Real World Tech, detailing an interesting discovery. He says Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has finally managed to design its own graphics processing unit (GPU) for integration into its A-series chips used inside both its iPhone and iPad series of products. Image source: Apple.  Perhaps more surprisingly, Kanter says that Apple launched its first custom graphics processor design inside the A8 chip that powered the iPhone 6-series smartphones. The company has presumably iterated upon that original design with the graphics processors found inside Apple's A9 and A10 Fusion chips released in subsequent years. Before building its own graphics processor, Apple relied on designs produced by graphics specialist and longtime Apple supplier Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF). Let's take a closer look at what Apple's custom graphics processor means for Imagination Technologies, if anything. Imagination Technologies still in the loop Kanter begins with an explanation of the three major components of a typical GPU: A modern GPU, like the ones inside Apple's iPhone and iPad, has three major components that must all work together in harmony to render a scene. The first is the fixed-function graphics hardware, which is responsible for tasks like processing API commands, triangle rasterization, and raster output. The second is the shader core, which is the heart of the GPU and executes programmable shaders (e.g., vertex, geometry, pixel, and compute shaders). Last, the graphics driver is the software that runs on the CPU and ties everything together, coordinating the activities of the GPU. According to Kanter, although much of Apple's graphics processor design is custom, there's still quite a bit of technology inside the design that comes from Imagination. Here's Kanter with more details: Apple's GPU appears to still use some of the PowerVR fixed-function graphics hardware. However, based on a variety of public evidence, it is clear that Apple has replaced the programmable shader cores with their own more efficient and higher performance design. To take advantage of the custom shader cores, Apple also developed their own driver and compiler to emit code for its architecture. The overall result is that while Apple's GPU shares some heritage with PowerVR, it is a unique and proprietary design. What's interesting is that Imagination Technologies didn't report anything unusual from a licensing or royalty payment perspective as Apple transitioned from the A7 chip to the A8 chip. Indeed, during Imagination's fiscal year ended on April 30, 2015, the company reported royalty revenue growth of 9%. The company said unit shipments from non-MIPS processors -- in other words, Imagination's PowerVR graphics -- were flat year over year while the average royalty rate in non-MIPS processors went up because of "a better mix." If Apple's move to more customized GPU technology led to a significant reduction in per-unit royalty payments to Imagination Technologies, then the company's average non-MIPS royalty rate should have gone down rather than move up 9%. Apple is a large enough customer of Imagination's that a significant content reduction in Apple's devices would lead to a large drop in non-MIPS royalty revenue. Investment takeaway The conclusion, at least for now, is that even though Apple has built up significant graphics technology expertise in-house, it still relies on valuable intellectual property that Imagination Technologies developed. Since Imagination's PowerVR licensing and royalty performance have apparently been unaffected by Apple's move to a custom graphics processor, it might be reasonable to expect Imagination Technologies to continue to collect royalty payments for the foreseeable future, even as Apple continues to advance its own graphics processor designs.

Apple Now Selling Refurbished iPhones Online Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Now Selling Refurbished iPhones Online Image courtesy of William Hook November 8, 2016 3:46 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler buy a new old phone apple iphone iPhone 7 devices smartphones trade in refurbished iphones refurbished online sales Before today, you could purchase a refurbished iPad or Mac — but not an iPhone — online from Apple. That’s changing as the tech company is now offering customers the chance to purchase refurbished iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus online.  9to5 Mac reports that Apple’s online refurb store is stocked with iPhones for the first time. The eight phones listed, which cost either $529 or $589, will save customers an estimated 15% compared to purchasing a brand new device. According to Apple’s website, the refurbished phones are unlocked, SIM-free, include a new battery and outer shell, and come with a one-year factory warranty. “We test and certify all Apple refurbished products,” the company says, noting that supplies are “limited and availability is guaranteed once we receive your full payment.” Apple’s decision to sell refurbished phones online comes nine months after Apple began accepting trade-ins of newer iPhones with cracked screens and other dings. Still, 9to5 Mac reports that the phones are probably coming from the company’s iPhone Upgrade Program, which likely saw an influx of iPhone 6s devices with the recent release of the iPhone 7.

Home News Mobile Devices, Tablets & Phones iPhone 7 could come out in a new - Jet White color The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are at the moment available in five colors - jet black, matte black, silver, gold and rose gold By: Lana Jelic | Mobile Devices, Tablets & Phones News | Posted: 6 days, 4 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Jet Black proved to be extremely popular with the buyers of the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and now there are rumors that Apple might add a new color for their new flagships - Jet White.     According to a report from the Japanese Apple blog Mac Otakara, the supply chain suggests that Apple is considering this option although nothing has been confirmed yet.   The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are at the moment available in five colors - jet black, matte black, silver, gold and rose gold. The new glossy white color might not seem like a bad idea, and it could boost the sales of the new iPhones, especially considering how popular the Jet Black color is.   However, Apple previously launched new colors for their devices only with the release of the new iPhones with the exception of the iPhone 4 which came out in the new white color a year after the launch.

This should come as no surprise to those who’ve long perceived the Mac platform as inward-looking, limited in compatibility, and generally worse value for money than comparable Windows alternatives. Pros are smart with their tools and their money, after all. But the change with Apple’s 2016 generation of MacBook Pros is that those downsides have been amped up — more expensive and less compatible than ever before — to an extreme that exposes the fallacy of the continued use of the Pro moniker. These are Apple’s premium laptops, its deluxe devices, but not in any meaningful way computers tailored for the pros. A MacBook Pro is now simply what you buy if you’re in the Apple ecosystem and have a higher budget and expectations than the MacBook can fulfill. Those complaining about Apple's current Mac lineup are not haters, they're lovers. They've spent 10+ years and 5+ figures on Macs. — Jeff J. (@lapcatsoftware) October 29, 2016 The backlash from among pro Mac users that’s arisen in the wake of this new product launch is unprecedented, drowning out even the widespread grumbling about the loss of the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 just a month prior. Just take a look at this studious blog post from Michael Tsai, which gathers together the broad negative consensus from among Apple's most passionate followers. The Mac community finds the specs underwhelming, even on the 15-inch model, which uses power-sipping AMD Radeon graphics instead of the world-conquering Nvidia Pascal chips. Emotions are running so low that people are even speculating about whether Apple should do with the Mac what IBM did when it sold off the ThinkPad line to Lenovo. This is partially because Apple hasn’t had a class-leading professional Mac computer for years — the Mac Pro is 1,054 days old now — and the new laptops have given an outlet and reason for expectant fans to vent. Many people were clinging on to their aging MacBook Pros in the vain hope of seeing a major spec and performance upgrade that simply didn’t materialize, and that's been frustrating. Here's how the 15" #MacBookPro 2016 component specs compare to the 2012 model: CPU: +8.9% to +13% MEM: +33% GPU: +53% to +184% /cc @mjtsai pic.twitter.com/uucjBzXe6C— Felix Schwarz (@felix_schwarz) October 28, 2016 The updated MacBooks from Apple have newer chips, but not that much newer, with Apple using yesteryear’s Intel Skylake CPUs and not this year’s Kaby Lake. They have faster storage, which is an indisputable benefit, but they also max out at 16GB of RAM. For consumer or casual use, that’s perfectly adequate, but "for a developer work machine, 16GB is the uncomfortable minimum requirement," as web developer Baldur Bjarnason points out. Apple seems surprised by the predictable backlash at betraying the trust of its most loyal customers Here’s the thing: if these new MacBooks simply didn’t carry the Pro label, we’d all have a lot less to complain about. It’s perfectly okay for a company to craft expensive, niche devices that will only match the particular needs of a select group of people. But over the course of the past decade or two, the entire tech industry has moved away from labeling things as exclusive or luxurious, opting for more inclusive language. If you can’t afford the premium model, that implies you’re not wealthy enough; but if you can’t afford the pro version, maybe you’re just not that into it. A subtle, but important distinction. And so it is, that we’re now living in a world populated by the PS4 Pro, DJI Mavic Pro, Surface Pro, iPad Pro, Beats Pro, Logitech Pro Gaming Mouse, and many others. Those of us old enough to remember ATI, the Canadian graphics card company that was taken over by AMD, will remember it pioneered many of these tags with such historic GPUs as the Radeon 9500 Pro, 9800 SE, X800 XT, and so on. They’re all meaningless as far as the company is concerned, but it just so happens that the "Pro" appendage is more meaningful to users than slapping on a "Plus" or "XL." With the obvious exception of leisure-time devices like the PlayStation console, a "pro" piece of consumer electronics is generally interpreted as a signal to actual professionals that this machine is for them. I'm out of apologia juice for defending Apple going with 4 USB-C ports on the new MacBook over a useful mix and keeping the MagSafe. — DHH (@dhh) October 28, 2016 Apple’s folly is in not recognizing just how passionate and committed its professional audience is. But the company should already know that all the iOS app developers that generate its unparalleled third-party software ecosystem are doing their work on Macs. It should be aware of their RAM requirements and the improvements they most want to see. "Pro" used to mean something when it came at the end of MacBook model names Beyond developers, there are the photographers and video producers that have made Mac computers the central hub of their home and work studios for many years, thanks to Apple’s early prioritization of high-quality displays and intuitive software. Leaving them without an SD card slot or an included adapter runs entirely counter to Apple’s fundamental principles of having a coherent ecosystem and a more user-friendly approach than the (previously) cold and aloof Windows PC manufacturers. Apple used to be a friend to creative professionals, and now that it’s acting against their wishes and interests, it seems surprised at their impassioned negative response. The backlash to the new MacBook Pro is so bad that Apple has slashed its accessory prices and LG's monitors to appease. Seems unprecedented — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) November 7, 2016 MacBook Pros were once professional computers that could also appeal to an aspiring consumer audience. They were pricey for a general-purpose laptop, but justifiable as a luxury purchase or as a device that pays for itself by making its user more efficient and productive. But today MacBook Pros are very definitely consumer devices that only gesture toward a professional audience without truly endeavoring to appease it. The new Touch Bar is not a pro feature. It’s cool, it works really well, and it has tons of potential for the future, but it clashes with professional workflows, many of which involve external monitors and keyboards. Apple showed how DJs might use it, but those same people would probably prefer to have dongle-free USB ports for the rest of their gear and a MagSafe charging adapter in the event of some inebriated clubber tripping over their cables. None of Apple's additions improve professional workflows yet, and its subtractions will lead to plenty of headaches The ultra-flat keyboard with 0.55mm key travel is also not professionally minded. Its purpose is overall thinness, but I know of no app developers, globetrotting businesspeople, or digital artists that had "more thinness" anywhere near the top of their priority list of MacBook Pro improvements. Professional writers might have asked for more tactile response, not less, and Apple's keyboard alterations seem to primarily serve to optimize and harmonize its design rather than enhance any functionality. Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pros carry on the Pro moniker dishonestly. At least we should all hope that's the case — because if Apple actually believes that these new laptops are suitable and sufficient for intensive professional needs, then the company's long and happy relationship with creatives may be heading toward a calamitous breakup.

Our Paper Paper Archive Our Apps Daily Horoscope Home News Sport Showbiz & TV Life & Style Travel Tech Pics Casino Gaming Reviews Tech News Home Tech Tech News If this iPhone 7 rumour is true you might want to wait before buying one If this iPhone 7 rumour is true you might want to wait before buying one APPLE'S iPhone 7 could be getting an all-new colour scheme and it could be the one everybody wants. By Dave Snelling / Published 8th November 2016 APPLE RUMOUR: The iPhone 7 could be getting a new colour scheme Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus only launched in September but it seems the devices could already be getting a new feature. According to Japanese website Mac Otakara, Apple looks set to unleash their flagship smartphone in an all-new "Jet White" colour. The iPhone 7 already ships in five colours including Silver, Gold, Black, and Rose Gold. There's also the new, and extremely popular, Jet Black finish which has completely sold out across the globe. In fact, this model is in such demand even Apple themselves have run out of stock with fans having to wait 4-6 weeks to get one. MacOtakara COMING SOON? Apple could release an iPhone 7 in Jet White So will Apple actually unveil a white model? Mac Otakara has been correct before about features coming to the iPhone 7 including the Jet Black colour and loss of the headphone port. But it's also got a few things very wrong including predicting the iPhone SE would arrive in bright pink. So, for now, if you're hoping for the iPhone 7 in white we wouldn't hold your breath but it certainly looks pretty tasty. EXCLUSIVE: New Apple Store opens in London take a peek inside Thursday, 13th October 2016 APPLE is opening its new flagship store in London and Daily Star Online has had an exclusive tour. 1 / 23 The last time Apple introduced a white colour scheme was when the US tech giant unveiled the iPhone 5c. This device was released on September 20, 2013, along with its flagship counterpart, the iPhone 5S. Three years later the iPhone has been hugely improved with the 7 and 7 Plus now including a bigger display, updated camera, faster processor and water resistant design.

The smartphone’s “jet black” tone has proved enormously popular, selling out across the world. 1 A screenshot from Mac Otakara, showing the rumoured “jet white” colour Now the tech giant is rumoured to be planning to unveil an even shinier colour. A Japanese website called Mac Otakara claimed Apple fans will soon be able to get their hands on an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus in virginal white. However, Apple experts at Mac Rumours warned the “rumours may not materialise and should be treated with a proverbial grain of salt”. The website wrote: “Mac Otakara has accurately leaked information about Apple’s upcoming plans in the past, including the new Jet Black color and no 3.5mm headphone jack on iPhone 7. “It was also correct about several other iPhone 7 details, including its naming, flush Home button, longer earpiece cutout, and lack of Smart Connector.

 You'll get some pretty sweet perks if you use Apple Pay on the web Kif Leswing Nov. 8, 2016, 2:16 PM 6,339 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP Earlier this year, Apple announced the second phase of its mission to "kill cash." It introduced Apple Pay on the web: Basically, if you're shopping in Safari on your Mac, instead of putting in your credit card and address, you can use Apple Pay and your fingerprint to check out quickly.  If you've got one of the new MacBook Pros, you can use the built-in fingerprint scanner. Otherwise, your computer will use your iPhone's fingerprint scanner.  Apple Pay checkout buttons have already started popping up around the web. But Apple wants to give its users even more incentive to use it. So it's offering various deals and perks if you use Apple Pay on the web, according to a holiday page it posted on Tuesday.  One big deal, for example, is 50% off a one-year subscription to the New York Times. Adidas is offering one or two-day free shipping. Instacart is offering a month of free delivery.  Here's the full list of deals: Adidas: Enjoy one- or two-day free shipping from Adidas. Casper: Buy a mattress and receive a $50 iTunes gift card from Casper. Grubhub/Seamless: Win a $50 gift card for you and a friend! New diners will also receive $10 off their next order from Grubhub. Instacart: First-time customers get one month of free Instacart delivery. Jackthreads: Get 20% off great holiday looks from JackThreads. Jet: 10% off first three orders and $5 JetCash Lululemon: Get a $25 gift card if you spend over $150 from Lululemon.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Feature-packed iOS 10.2 public beta arrives - here's how to try it first Feature-packed iOS 10.2 public beta arrives - here's how to try it first by Chris Smith 08 November 2016 0 shares Read Comments Apple has released its latest iOS 10 public beta, bringing with it a number of neat new features for iPhone and iPad users. The update, which can be downloaded by anyone enrolled in the public beta program offers a preview of the new TV app, designed to make it easier to find content across multiple video apps and services. The TV app was announced at Apple’s Mac event last month and will also be present on the Apple TV’s tvOS software. It will allow users to sync content between both devices and pick up viewing where they left off. Related: 7 Common iOS 10 probkems and how to fix them Elsewhere, there’s new Unicode 9 emojis, which include a clown, bacon, a selfie, a cowboy hat face, a sneezing face and a whiskey glass among other completely essential items. The beta also brings some brand new camera options, including the ability to preserve the last-used capture state (e.g. square, video, slo-mo, etc.). There’s also support for an SOS feature which will send out a call for help when a user presses the power button 5 times in a row. The Messages app gets a new ‘Celebration’ effect, while iPhone 7 owners will also be able to enjoy three new wallpapers. The update is certainly more significant than the iOS 10.1 release which fixed a few bugs and added the new Portrait camera mode for iPhone 7 Plus users. Apple released the iOS 10.2 beta to developers last week. The completed version will probably be rolled out to everyone next month. Want an early peak? You can sign up for the beta here. Once registered, you'll need to install a profile granting you early access through Software Updates. We'd advise you to only install on a secondary device that has been recently backed up.

The app closely mimics the design of Apple's dedicated support website, providing a list of the products owned by each user along with options for scheduling repairs in an Apple Store or chatting with Apple's support staff. It also has a section for recent repair requests and other information related to Apple product maintenance. Need help? Apple Support app is your personalized guide to the best options from Apple. Find answers with articles tailored to your products and questions. Call, chat or email with an expert right away, or schedule a callback when it's convenient. Get a repair at an Apple Store or a nearby Apple Authorized Service Provider. Apple Support is here to help.Apple Support appears to be limited to the Netherlands at this time, but Apple may be testing it in a single market before opting to roll it out to other countries. Rumors late last year suggested a support app was in the works, but it wasn't clear at the time if it would be a standalone app or something built into an existing app. Tag: Apple Support [ 29 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) dannyyankou 6 days ago at 11:24 am Wow, a new service from Apple that doesn't start out in the US.

While at the same time Apple has announced its own line of Apple Watches. The preorders for the Gear S3 have been available since yesterday, the 6th of November and they will hit retailer’s shelves just before the Christmas season pops up. These devices are going to be available at stores such as Amazon, Macy’s, Best Buy and obviously on Samsung’s personal website. The Samsung watches are going to be available in two different models the Classic model and the Frontier one. The price is going to be the same for both of the versions, and they will cost $350. The only difference being the aspect that they bring and that the Frontier model is going to come with LTE support. The Frontier one is going to come with LTE support because it is an outdoor themed watch, and in case of a sticky situation it might come quite in handy. Samsung’s Gear S3 is going to be quite large in size. They will ship with 42 mm cases, and it will be 0.51 inches thick. Both of the devices are water proof and also dust resistant. The display they will sport is a 1.3 inch display, and they will also come with Samsung Pay compatibility giving the user the option to leave his wallet at home. The smart watches are going to come with 4 GB of internal storage space and they are going to be powered by 380 mAh batteries that can last up to three days after a full charge. The price of the devices might still vary a bit, since they will come in 4G versions as well and that price is going to be decided their network carriers.

With the expected increase in users who would be buying stuff online, fake shopping apps have started to pop up like crazy on Apple’s App Store. To remedy this, the Cupertino giant is doing some purging of bogus apps.  The New York Times ran a story over the weekend about the upsurge of rogue apps in Apple’s iOS App Store. These apps are said to be from developers in China, and they are either relatively harmless or very annoying with the amount of pop-up ads they contain. Meanwhile, others could have been designed to retrieve customer data such as credit card information. Security experts have said that China is the biggest source of fake apps that manage to pass through Apple’s monitors because their developers simply change the names and credentials and resubmit similar apps once the bogus ones have been caught.  One of the producers of fake apps that was identified by Apple is Footlocke Sports. The developer was found to have been the source of bogus apps for Celine, Puma, Nike, Canada Goose and more. Related Stories Jet White iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus: Apple May Reportedly Add Color Option Microsoft Selfie App Arrives In Android Play Store Apple Not Releasing iPhone SE Successor In 2017? The biggest mistake that consumers can make when stumbling upon any of the fake shopping apps is ordering items from them that are never going to arrive. This is reportedly just a trick that is mainly there to capture the attention of users and lure them into purchasing items by entering their credit card info, according to AppleInsider.  In response to the issue, Apple has now removed the fraudulent apps from Footlocke Sports and reassured users users are safe from scams as the navigate the App Store. “We strive to offer customers the best experience possible and we take their security very seriously. We've set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure,” Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said. Since other bogus apps are still lurking on Apple’s App Stores, PhoneArena advises that everyone should be in the lookout for shady apps. The tech news site claims that to easily spot if an app is a phoney, users should check out its description for bad English and find out if its it has questionable reviews. Also, whenever possible, consumers are reminded to check the official websites and trusted online stores of the things they want to purchase. This way, the possibility of getting scammed is very minimal.  This is not the first time that Apple removed apps from its App Stores over certain issues. In September, the tech giant started to evaluate apps for problems and identify which ones were not updated. The difference between then and now is the fact that the cleanup that was conducted before targeted apps that were bereft of updates.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Firefighters knock down structure fire in Apple Valley on Monday night Tuesday Nov 8, 2016 at 11:01 AM Nov 8, 2016 at 11:01 AM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero APPLE VALLEY — Fire officials were investigating a Monday night carport fire that burned a motorhome, truck and boat in the 9800 block of Mockingbird Avenue. Apple Valley Fire Protection District personnel responded to the blaze a little after 10:20 p.m. after receiving reports of a structure fire. As firefighters were en route to the fire they received additional reports of explosions. Firefighters arrived on scene and found a “large” carport fire that threatened nearby exposures, including a home and garage, according to Capt. Rich Unferdorfer. Responding firefighters went into an aggressive attack and knocked the fire out in under 20 minutes, he said. A nearby office trailer sustained minor “side damage” from the fire, but the garage and house did not sustain any damage. The carport, motorhome, truck and boat were all deemed a complete loss and firefighters remained on scene for extensive mop up until 1:30 a.m. Unferdorfer said three AVFPD engines, brush patrol, prevention officer and a battalion chief responded to the blaze. CalFire also responded with an engine and battalion chief, he said. The cause of fire was under investigation Tuesday morning, Unferdorfer said.

Comparing Microsoft's New Surface Book to Apple's MacBook Pro Apple and Microsoft both announced new notebooks designed to appeal to business and consumers alike. Is the new MacBook Pro or Surface Book right for you? Let's See How the Screen Sizes Measure Up One of the first things to consider before buying a MacBook Pro or Surface Book is screen size. The MacBook Pro ships in both 13-inch and 15-inch varieties. The Surface Book with Performance Base has a 13.5-inch screen. Anyone looking for a larger screen will need to choose Apple's option. Both computers, though, feature outstanding display clarity and quality. Check Out the Processor Options On performance, Microsoft's Surface Book with Performance Base has a slight edge. The device ships with a sixth-generation Intel Core i7 processor and support for a higher-end graphics chip in the Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M. Depending on the version customers pick, the lower-end MacBook Pro models come with an Intel Core i5 chip, while bigger models have Intel Core i7 processors. On the graphics side, Apple offers up to an AMD Radeon 455. Both options top out at 16GB of RAM. The Surface Book Has a Touch Screen If a touch screen is important, the Surface Book with Performance Base is the best option. Apple has decided against a touch screen in the MacBook Pro, saying it doesn't fit well with a notebook. Microsoft, however, believes it's a must-have. Customers ultimately will determine which company is right. The MacBook Pro Has the Touch Bar While the MacBook Pro doesn't have a touch screen, it does have what Apple calls the Touch Bar. The component is a multitouch strip that sits above the keyboard and gives users access to software controls. Apple has opened the Touch Bar to third-party developers to ensure apps come with the software functions users want. Depending on its developer support, the Touch Bar could be either a gimmick or the MacBook Pro's secret weapon. Choose Between a Pure Notebook and a Hybrid PC Customers ultimately will need to decide whether a hybrid is important to them when choosing between the two computers. Apple's MacBook Pro is a standard notebook with a clamshell design. The Surface Book comes with a hinge that allows it to be used as both a notebook and a tablet. The difference is an important one that shouldn't be overlooked. The Surface Book Supports a Stylus Unlike the MacBook Pro, the Surface Book supports a stylus. Using the Microsoft Surface Pen, users can draw on the screen, sign documents and perform other creative actions. Since Apple's computer doesn't support a stylus or any touch input, for that matter, creative professionals might find a more suitable option in Microsoft's computer. Big Battery Life Could Be a Decisive Factor Apple promises 10 hours of battery life in the MacBook Pro, delivering solid mixed-use performance during the day. However, Microsoft is the clear winner here, offering up to 16 hours of battery life. While mileage may vary depending on how the computers are used, the Surface Book is the best option for anyone needing a bit more battery life to get through the day. Neither Model Is Over-Equipped With Ports Neither the MacBook Pro nor the Surface Book with Performance Base is a real winner when it comes to port support. Apple's MacBook Pro comes with four Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. The Surface Book ships with two USB 3.0 ports, an SD Card reader, a headphone jack and a Mini DisplayPort. Which computer wins depends on the accessories owners want to plug into their machine. Software Compatibility Considerations The Surface Book runs Windows 10 Pro, which is compatible with numerous applications of every description for consumers and business users. It also includes some important security enhancements. The MacBook Pro runs on macOS Sierra, which also works with a huge stock of existing applications. While Apple has done a fine job of adding more support for third-party applications, Windows is still the platform most developers design their apps for first. It All Comes Back to Pricing Inevitably, some customers will choose their computer based on price. However, neither option is cheap. The Surface Book with Performance Base starts at $2,399 and goes up to $3,299 for the highest-end option. Apple's Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro starts at $1,799 for the 13-inch model and tops out at $2,799 for the highest-end version. Customizations to the machine will push the price higher.

First up was Microsoft, which showcased the Surface Book with Performance Base, a new version of its popular two-in-one hybrid computer. Just a day later, Apple announced its long-awaited MacBook Pro update that includes a new Touch Bar feature. Both the Microsoft and Apple computers have nice designs, the latest software and enough processing power to appeal to power users. Both are also compact but come with powerful features that could make them attractive options for home and business users alike. Altogether their specifications are good enough that they likely will be among the most sought-after notebooks during the holiday season. This slide show takes a closer look at the Surface Book with Performance Base and the new MacBook Pro to see if either of these computers has an advantage. Check out the following slides to learn more about the similarities and differences between these two notebook PCs.           Don Reisinger is a freelance technology columnist.

(AAPL) Is Leaning on iPhone Suppliers Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be facing declining iPhone sales, but two reports show the company is dominating the industry profits and determined to remain in that position. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% In the last quarter, AAPL accounted for an astounding 103.6% of all smartphone industry profits. However, determined to maintain its fat margins — and provide a little tailwind for struggling Apple stock — the company also is said to be leaning on its suppliers to cut prices on iPhone components. Apple Scoops Virtually Every Cent of Smartphone Profits AppleInsider details a report by BMO Capital Market analyst Tim Long on the current state of Apple’s iPhone business in relation to the overall smartphone industry. It paints a striking picture of a company that has continued to see its marketshare erode, yet has managed to essentially shut out its rivals when it comes to actually making money off smartphones. It’s always been clear from Apple’s earnings reports that the iPhone is critical to the company’s bottom line. In its last quarter, the iPhone accounted for $28.16 billion in revenue and was the biggest contributor to Apple profit. Those numbers were down significantly compared to a year ago. This reflects the fact iPhone sales have slipped during the same time period. Compared to 13.6% of world smartphone sales in Q3 2015, this year AAPL has captured just 12.1% of the market. Rivals running Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android rising to a commanding 87.5%. However, market share doesn’t equal profitability, as Tim Long’s report shows. 5 Best Stocks to Buy After the Presidential Election Apple has historically punched far above its weight when it comes to making money from its mobile phones, but in Q3, the company absolutely dominated its rivals. While virtually every other smartphone manufacturer lost money, iPhone sales accounted for 103.6% of industry profits (the greater than 100% number reflecting the losses suffered by the competition). Apple’s rival in the smartphone wars, Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), placed second with a mere 0.9% of smartphone profits. The iPhone SE and Apple Profit Boosting Strategy At roughly the same time the Apple Profit story was breaking, MacRumors published a report by KGI Security analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. In it, Kuo outlines two of AAPL’s strategies for maintaining such high margins on its iPhones. According to Kuo, Apple will skip refreshing the iPhone SE next year. Its smallest and most affordable phone already has sufficient technical specs for it to remain a viable option for another year. If it’s good enough to satisfy demand, why spend the money on an upgrade? Having no new iPhone SE saves AAPL on development costs and manufacturing start-up costs. However, Kuo predicts that Apple will go further. In addition to not releasing a new iPhone SE model next year, he thinks the company will lean on its suppliers to cut their prices on iPhone components. Some — like Samsung — will push back, but others will likely cave in an attempt to retain Apple’s business. If Apple achieves any success in its efforts to cut production costs, it not only avoids the cost of releasing a new iPhone SE, but it also makes the existing models even more profitable. Even if iPhone sales continue to slide going into 2017 (and the ramp-up to the 10th anniversary iPhone 8) as predicted, with better margins, Apple profit won’t take as big a hit. And AAPL will continue to dominate smartphone industry profits despite a dwindling market share. Monday Apple Rumors: iPhone 7 May Get 'Jet White' Color Option It’s worth noting that part of the reason for Apple’s incredible spike last quarter can be attributed to the hit Samsung took over the Galaxy Note 7 debacle. That doesn’t take away from the fact that no other other single smartphone manufacturer seems to have anywhere near the same leverage to command the combination of discounted components from suppliers and premium pricing from consumers. Apple has never been shy about using that clout, and it shows. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

May Bring to the Next-Gen iPhone SE This Fool thinks that Apple's next generation small, low-cost smartphone could include a number of features carried over from this year's flagship iPhone models. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 8, 2016 at 1:00PM According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, by way of MacRumors, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) isn’t planning to release an updated version of the iPhone SE during the first half of its fiscal year 2017. The success of the iPhone SE line, though, practically guarantees that the company will release an improved version of the phone at some point.  Image source: Apple.  Let's go over three features that I expect to be present in a future iteration of the iPhone SE. 3D Touch Every iPhone model Apple sells today, aside from the iPhone SE, comes equipped with 3D Touch. The SE didn't get the technology probably because Apple wanted to give customers a reason to buy more expensive phones, and because 3D Touch probably adds significant cost. But by the time Apple gets ready to mass-produce and sell an updated iPhone SE, 3D Touch will no longer be a major point of differentiation within the iPhone product stack. Instead, it will probably be a “must-have” feature for any new iOS device sold. Manufacturing costs for the technology will also probably come down as manufacturing yields improve. When Apple refreshes the iPhone SE, the inclusion of 3D Touch is a must. New display For a while now, Apple has been transitioning to displays that can render a wider color gamut. Apple’s iMac and MacBook Pro computers, 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and iPhone 7-series smartphones all include displays capable of rendering the DCI-P3 color space, which Apple says is 25% larger than the traditional sRGB color space that Apple’s devices have previously been limited to. The next iPhone SE should include a wide-color display. If it does, it's also likely to include many of the other display quality enhancements that Apple introduced with the iPhone 6- and 7-series devices, including improved viewing angles, greater contrast ratio, and more. A new display would also probably dramatically improve the delivered user experience relative to the current iPhone SE model, potentially helping to spur demand. Improved camera One of the nice things about the iPhone 7 is that it not only includes a wide-color display, but it also has cameras capable of capturing images in wide color. Should the next iPhone include a new wide-color display, Apple should also update the iSight and front-facing cameras to be able to capture images in wide color. Doing so would be easy for Apple, which could recycle the sensors inside the front-facing and rear-facing camera from the iPhone 7 in the future iPhone SE. Apple may be able to include optical image stabilization, though it’s not clear if Apple would need to make modifications to the iPhone SE’s shell to accommodate that technology.  When should investors expect the new iPhone SE? If Kuo is correct that an updated iPhone SE won’t arrive anytime soon, it might make sense for Apple to simply hold off until March 2018 to release such a product. The current iPhone SE is still a credible smartphone that offers strong performance and features for the price, and it’s likely to remain so over the next year. Looking at it from another angle, right now there seems to be a popular view that fiscal year 2017 is something of a transition year for Apple ahead of what's expected to be an iPhone 8 "super-cycle" in fiscal year 2018. By saving an updated iPhone SE for fiscal year 2018, Apple could be better positioning itself for nice year-over-year iPhone revenue and unit growth comparisons.

The TV app provides one place to access TV shows and movies, as well as a place to discover new content to watch. Apple also introduced a new Siri feature for Apple TV that lets viewers tune in directly to live news and sporting events across their apps. “Using apps on Apple TV, iPhone and iPad has become the primary way for so many of us to watch television,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. “The TV app shows you what to watch next and easily discover TV shows and movies from many apps in a single place.” The TV app will be available for Apple TV, iPhone and iPad and always stays in sync so that when users begin watching on one device they can easily continue where they left off on their Apple devices. Key features in the TV app include Watch Now, which is where viewers will see their collection of shows and movies from iTunes and other apps; Up Next, which queues rentals and purchases in the order you are likely to watch first; and Recommended, a handpicked collection of personalised content aimed just at you. The TV app will be available next month as a free software update for the fourth-generation – but only in the US.

Should the next iPhone include a new wide-color display, Apple should also update the iSight and front-facing cameras to be able to capture images in wide color. Doing so would be easy for Apple, which could recycle the sensors inside the front-facing and rear-facing camera from the iPhone 7 in the future iPhone SE. Apple may be able to include optical image stabilization, though it’s not clear if Apple would need to make modifications to the iPhone SE’s shell to accommodate that technology.  When should investors expect the new iPhone SE? If Kuo is correct that an updated iPhone SE won’t arrive anytime soon, it might make sense for Apple to simply hold off until March 2018 to release such a product. The current iPhone SE is still a credible smartphone that offers strong performance and features for the price, and it’s likely to remain so over the next year. Looking at it from another angle, right now there seems to be a popular view that fiscal year 2017 is something of a transition year for Apple ahead of what's expected to be an iPhone 8 "super-cycle" in fiscal year 2018. By saving an updated iPhone SE for fiscal year 2018, Apple could be better positioning itself for nice year-over-year iPhone revenue and unit growth comparisons.

Waited So Long to Release New MacBook Pro Computers DigiTimes says yield issues with several components led to a delay in the launch of Apple's new MacBook Pro computers. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 8, 2016 at 12:00PM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) 2015 MacBook Pro refresh principally consisted of bringing slightly faster processors, modestly larger batteries, and Force Touch track pads to the prior-generation models. Late last month, Apple released new MacBook Pro models that represented much larger leaps forward than what last year's models did.  Image source: Apple.  The changes that Apple brought to this year's models were sweeping. Among them were sleeker form factors, much better displays, speedier processors, a new Touch Bar with Touch ID support in place of the function keys, new keyboards, and improved Force Touch track pads.  The investment community might be wondering why it took Apple so long to get these redesigned MacBook Pro systems out. Per a new report from DigiTimes, we now have the answer. Blame manufacturing yields on some components DigiTimes, citing "sources from the upstream supply chain," says that Apple is "said to have delayed the product's shipment schedule by a quarter due to low yield rates for some components." The components facing these yield challenges, the report says, included batteries, keyboards, and hinges. Component manufacturing yield issues can lead to both supply issues (not enough good product gets made) as well as cost-structure problems (defective products have a non-zero cost to manufacture but ultimately generate no revenue, raising the average cost for the ones that ultimately are salable). It's little wonder that Apple decided to hold off on bringing these new systems to market until yields on these critical components improved. Apple reportedly "placing aggressive orders" for new MacBook Pro components Although the DigiTimes report offered an explanation for the delay in bringing these new MacBook Pro computers to market, the article was primarily focused on Apple's component order patterns for the systems. This is interesting stuff, so let's take a closer look at what it had to say.  Per DigiTimes' sources, Apple is "optimistic about the sales" of these new MacBook Pro computers. That optimism, DigiTimes reports, has led to Apple "turning aggressive" with respect to component orders "after the launch in October." Furthermore, those same sources reportedly told DigiTimes that "MacBook Pro shipments in 2017 are also expected to stay at the same level as in 2016." According to market research company IDC, the personal computer market is expected to decline by 7.2% in 2016. During the first three quarters of the year, Apple's personal computer unit declines have been wider than those that the overall personal computer market have suffered; this means that Apple has been losing market share.  Metric Q1 2016 Q2 2016 Q3 2016 Apple Mac unit shipment growth (12%) (11%) (14%) PC market unit shipment growth (11.5%) (4.5%) (3.9%) Data sources: Apple, IDC. Should the personal computer market decline again in 2017, Apple simply shipping the same number of MacBook Pro computers in 2017 as it does in 2016 would imply a return to market share gains. The revenue growth story could be more interesting than the unit shipment story Apple returning to year-over-year unit share gains in the personal computer market would be a positive, but the real story here could be the potential for growth in revenue share. Remember, Apple's new MacBook Pro products are priced at premiums to what the prior-generation models were priced at. Furthermore, Apple is keeping some of its prior-generation models around at the same price points that they were at before the new MacBook Pro systems launched. If Apple is able to keep its MacBook Pro unit shipments flat in 2017 relative to what they were during 2016, it is likely that its average selling prices on those systems will be significantly higher. This could lead to Apple's Mac-related revenue growth (and thus revenue share growth) being much more robust than its unit (and unit share) growth will be.

Equipped with sensors, a camera, and a potent machine learning algorithm to fine tune the baking, roasting and reheating food capabilities of the smart oven, the device is a work in progress with promising results. As easy as oiling and seasoning your food then placing it in the oven, the rest is done by the machine, which recognizes what items have been placed within the tray. You can also tune it to your personal preferences so you’ll never get a well done dish if you’re a fan of medium rare. When all is said and done, you’ll get a notification on your phone telling you to come pick up your meal – that way, you’ll never have to hover over the oven in your kitchen to periodically check up on your food. You’ll even be able to view certain metrics surrounding the cooking process, from the internal temperature at different spots throughout the heating fluctuations, to a time lapse of your food as it goes from raw to juicy to mouthwatering. Moreover, because the oven is the one doing all the work, you’ll no longer need to preheat your food either: just pop it in and let the machine get to it. Currently able to recognize 23 different foods, future iterations should expand the oven’s repertoire. The team is currently accepting pre-orders for the device, which will retail at $1500 USD and will arrive in a little over the month (during the holidays). With a sleek design and intelligent capability to cook your food for you, the modernized oven is a refreshing sight for those of us with limited cooking abilities, and hopefully one that will improve with time should the team see success with its initiative.

 Apple raided a bankrupt startup to make Apple Music better Kif Leswing Nov. 8, 2016, 12:29 PM 3,709 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook AP Apple has hired at least 16 employees and purchased technology from bankrupt British startup Omnifone, TechCrunch reported on Monday. The obvious use for the ex-Omnifone talent and technology would be to make Apple's streaming music service, Apple Music, more reliable and better.  Omnifone was founded in 2003 and previously provided cloud tools to companies that wanted to do online music streaming, and even administered online music subscriptions for companies like Sony and BlackBerry.  The technology and expertise could help Apple as it tries to catch up in the streaming music business, which is currently dominated by Spotify. Deal or no deal? To be clear, Apple has not confirmed that it purchased Omnifone, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this summer.  It's possible that Apple purchased technology and hired Omnifone's staff without purchasing the company's outstanding debts and client obligations. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.  A report from Omnifone's bankruptcy administrators from earlier this summer had previously suggested that Omnifone had found a buyer for parts of the company for $10 million, TechCrunch reported.  Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company had completed four acquisitions in the quarter from July to September during Apple's most recent earnings call.  Apple usually does not announce its acquisitions, but when news outlets learn about an acquisition Apple usually provides the following statement, which essentially confirms the deal: "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans." In July, an Apple spokesperson pointed out to Business Insider that in the matter of Omnifone the company had not given its standard statement for confirming acquisitions.

Apple removed hundreds of fake retail and product apps from its App Store last week after The New York Times and the New York Post started asking about the counterfeit apps. The counterfeiters ranged from retail chains like Dollar Tree to big department stores like Nordstrom to even designer brands like Christian Dior. While some only offered endless pop-up ads, others asked users to enter credit card details or contained malware that could steal personal information. SEE MORE: Apple Says It Killed The Headphone Jack Out Of 'Courage' Security experts told The New York Times that most fake apps are created in China and somehow manage to slip through Apple's review process. In the past, the tech-giant's review process has been criticized for being too tough on app developers, but it seems something might have changed. Earlier this year, an Apple official said in an interview that half of all apps are now approved within 24 hours and 90 percent are approved within 48 hours. One Apple spokesperson responded to the issue in a statement, saying "We���������ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk.���������  Despite efforts to remove them, new imitation apps continue to appear. Developers might change their app's content after it has been approved or resubmit similar products after fakes have been uncovered. Apple allows users to report suspicious apps. Fake apps tend to have no reviews and no history of previous versions, and often, their menus don't make sense or use poor English.

Stock This underappreciated GPS maker could be a great long-term play at current prices. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 8, 2016 at 11:30AM Things looked bleak for Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) just two years ago. Its automotive GPS device business, which generated most of its revenue, was being disrupted by smartphone-based mapping apps. That pressure caused the stock to tumble from the low $60s in July 2014 to the low $30s by Jan. 2016. But since then, Garmin staged a remarkable rebound, rallying 26% year-to-date and outperforming the NASDAQ's flat growth. Yet I believe that Garmin could still have room to run next year, for a few simple reasons. Image source: Garmin. Market share growth in wearables The strongest reason for buying Garmin is its impressive growth in the wearables market, which is more commonly associated with companies like Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). That's because Garmin offers a wide variety of specialized wearable devices for certain activities -- like swimming, golfing, and jogging -- instead of "general use" devices which cover a wider range of activities with fewer features. That approach helped Garmin grow its worldwide wearable shipments 107% to 1.6 million units between the second quarters of 2015 and 2016, according to IDC. That placed the company in fourth place in the overall market after Fitbit, Xiaomi, and Apple (in that order) with a market share of 6.9%. That growth also made Garmin the fastest growing wearables maker in the world. In the smartwatch market, IDC reports that Garmin's shipments surged 324% to 600,000 units between the third quarters of 2015 and 2016. That growth, which again outpaced the growth of all other rivals, made Garmin the second biggest smartwatch maker in the world after Apple with a 20.5% market share. If Garmin's growth continues at its current trajectory, it could become a major threat to Fitbit and Apple over the next few quarters. Garmin's high-end Fenix Chronos. Image source: Garmin. Wearables growth is offsetting its auto weakness Garmin's big wearables push has offset the ongoing weakness of its automotive GPS business. Last quarter, Garmin's automotive revenue fell 21% annually and accounted for 30% of its top line. However, that was a significant reduction from 40% of its sales in the prior year quarter. Meanwhile, fitness revenue surged 32% annually and accounted for 26% of Garmin's top line, thanks to robust demand for its Forerunner and Vivoactive devices. Outdoor revenue, bolstered by strong sales of its rugged Fenix GPS watches, rose 28% and accounted for 20% of Garmin's top line. The marine and aviation GPS businesses, which are less prone to disruption from smartphone-based GPS apps, both reported double-digit sales growth. All those positive tailwinds boosted Garmin's total revenue by 6% annually to $722 million. Analysts believe that Garmin's revenue and earnings will respectively improve 5% and 8% for the full year. Low valuations, high dividends, and buybacks That single-digit growth might not impress growth-oriented investors, but its trailing P/E of 18 is much lower the industry average of 31 for scientific and technical instrument companies. It's also comparable to Fitbit's P/E of 18. Garmin also pays a hefty forward dividend yield of 4.2%, which is substantially higher than the S&P 500's average yield of 2.2%. Fitbit has never paid a dividend, while Apple (which is only an indirect play on wearables) pays a 2% yield. Garmin has raised that dividend annually for four straight years. Garmin also regularly buys back stock to tighten up its earnings. Over the past 12 months, it spent 13% of its FCF on buybacks and 67% on dividends -- indicating that it still has room to raise both to boost shareholder value. The bottom line Garmin's growth and recovery over the past year demonstrates how valuable diversification is for hardware makers. If Garmin hadn't leveraged its strength in GPS devices to expand into wearables at the right time, its dying auto GPS business could have wrecked its top line growth. Instead, its wearables business is now replacing the automotive one as its most important unit, and its top and bottom line growth are getting back on track. Combine that recovery with its low valuation, solid dividend, and long record of buybacks, and I believe that Garmin could be a compelling long-term buy at current levels.   Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

However, Apple has started turning aggressive after the launch in October.   Thanks to the recent rising MacBook Pro shipments, some market watchers expect Apple's MacBook shipments to reach 15 million units in 2016, with shipments staying at that level in 2017.   One supply that will benefit from strong MacBook Pro sales is Wistron who has reportedly landed orders for the OLED Touch Bar keyboard.   The market watchers pointed out that the keyboard is rather difficult to build and its original Singapore-based supplier was having difficulties meeting Apple's demand prompting Apple to shift orders to Wistron, according to Chinese-language Economic Daily News.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

With Apple losing its cool, it’s finally Microsoft’s moment Tim Jonze Once, Apple ads told us that PCs were for dorks. But now its own products are overpriced, dongle-tangled and everywhere. Perhaps it’s time to reopen Windows? The Apple/Peep Show ads were smug and annoying and made you realise Apple didn’t understand Peep Show. Photograph: Apple Contact author @timjonze Tuesday 8 November 2016 12.07 EST Last modified on Tuesday 8 November 2016 12.49 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger About a decade ago, Apple ran a series of adverts featuring the comedians Mitchell and Webb, designed to highlight the difference between Macs and PCs. The ads didn’t bother explaining what the spec differences were, or even showing you pictures of the products they were advertising (Alan Sugar would have fired the bladdy useless lot of ’em on the spot). Instead, Apple’s whole purpose was to point out how much cooler its computers were compared with PCs. On the left, David Mitchell was in full Mark Corrigan-mode as the PC, wearing a brown suit and explaining how family holidays are best represented in pie-chart form. On the right, Robert Webb slouched around with his hands in his jeans, breezily explaining how effortlessly creative he was as a Mac. It wasn’t a great advert series. It was smug. It was annoying. And it made you realise that Apple didn’t understand Peep Show. (People rooted for Mark, and Jez wasn’t cool. Super Hans using his MacBook to order psilocybin on the dark web would have been cool, although the Advertising Standards Authority might have had something to say about that.) But you accepted the point: PCs were stuffy, out-of-touch, virus-ridden machines suitable only for grey office drones to run spreadsheets on. Your dad had one, and it kept freezing whenever he tried to show you the email he had received saying he was due £5,000 compensation as the victim of a road accident. The Apple experience, on the other hand, was a constant dress-down Friday full of pictures, music and movies. The reason Apple got away with this ad was because it was – undoubtedly – a very cool company. Throughout the 00s, it changed the way we consumed entertainment and shaped the ways in which we interacted with each other. What is more, it did so in the form of nice white curvy things that, compared with the grey/black boxy PCs, made the world seem a better place (if, by better, you mean a permanent episode of Black Mirror where we would sooner press handheld blocks of plastic than converse with our friends and family). Apple was so cool it had a quasi-spiritual air, with feverish launch events and a leader who singlehandedly pioneered normcore. Compared with all this, what did Microsoft have? Clippy, a crudely animated paperclip that was supposed to help you write covering letters. The distressing news, then, for people who have spent approximately the economic output of Moldova on Apple products over the past two decades, is that Apple in 2016 no longer seems very cool. In fact, it now seems a bit of a mess, as out-of-touch and unfriendly as Mark Corrigan. Its products look increasingly samey or – worse – plain ugly. Its innovations, such as the Touch Bar, look like the kind of thing a toddler might come up with at an hour’s notice (“Put some iPad ... here!” *toddler points above the number keys on a nearby laptop*). It raised its already extortionate prices to cash in on Brexit (technically our fault that one, but still). And it seems to be on a mission to make everything as incompatible and user-unfriendly as possible. Currently, Apple is selling a whopping 17 different dongles for all the different bits its devices no longer serve properly. Meanwhile, its compatibility is a car-crash example of capitalism gone rogue: even the iPhone’s new standard Lightning headphones won’t connect to Apple’s latest line of laptops without an adaptor. It all points to a grand strategy whereby come 2036 you won’t be able to type at all without special gloves that have to be individually purchased to fit each finger, and then will only allow you to spell out the word “plonker”. Where once Apple had an app for things you didn’t imagine were possible, now it has a dongle for things that were perfectly possible before you needed a dongle. Oh, and on top of all this, it has now got a CEO called Tim (embarrassing) who wears a fleece and doesn’t seem to think he’s Jesus. It’s all wrong. But if Apple’s cachet is fading, who does that leave us with? Surely not Samsung – its phones literally blow up in your hands. Step forward ... Microsoft and Bill Gates! Once, he was derided as a squeaky-voiced billionaire who couldn’t possibly be as cool as that guy who tucked his roll-neck shirt into stonewashed dad jeans (weird times, looking back now). These days, Microsoft’s co-founder is doing some pretty cool stuff. Such as pouring his billions into philanthropic projects fighting malaria in Africa. And helping to eradicate poverty. Of course, ending life-threatening disease is only technically cool if you can make nice, shiny computers on the side, but Microsoft seems to be sorting that side of things out too. At a recent launch event, it turned its attention to the world’s “creatives” – tempting designers and musicians to cross the bridges and start taking a Surface Pro to their nearest organic coffee store. Is such a shift really possible? It could be. After all, even Clippy seems to have harnessed his valuable retro appeal of late, starring in memes with all the nonchalance of a piece of animated stationery who always knew he was about more than page indentation advice. Have the tables turned? Has Mark finally got the whip hand over Jez? The ball’s in your court, Apple. You were cool once. But now you need to sort out your products and at least try to end measles. Failing that, how about making something we can plug a USB stick into?

We review the new 13in MacBook Pro, a laptop which has caused controversy due to a pack of connections. By Alistair Charlton November 8, 2016 17:21 GMT The 2016 MacBook Pro is slimmer and lighter than ever, borrowing its design from the smaller MacBookIBTimes UK Apple is earning itself a fair bit of controversy these days, isn't it? First we saw the iPhone 7 arrive with a two-year-old design and, the horror, no headphone jack. Then along came the new MacBook Pro, a laptop which starts at £1,449 and mercifully has a headphone jack – but only one other type of connection for everything else. These two products arrived within weeks of each other and brought with them a whole heap of controversy; critics cried that Apple had lost its way. For the MacBook Pro reviewed here consumers will need to quickly learn all about USB Type-C and accept that, for now at least, dongles and adapters are a part of Apple life. Make no mistake; this is going to be a difficult transition and it will be costlly, fiddly and downright annoying in the short term. But bear with us because Apple's arrogance/courage will eventually make sense. The entry-level 13in MacBook Pro has just two Thunderbolt ports for all accessory, peripheral and power connectionsIBTimes UK The new MacBook Pro is split into three key segments. At the top is the 15in model which comes with Apple's new Touch Bar, then there is a 13in Pro with the Touch Bar and an entry-level option which has a 13in screen but no Touch Bar. This laptop, reviewed here, also has just two ports compared with the rest of the Pro range which have four. (We will be reviewing the Touch Bar model soon). In other words, this is the base MacBook Pro and, even at £1,449, the cheapest. Below it sits the 13in MacBook Air (from £949) and the 12in MacBook (from £1,249). The 2016 Pro takes a lot of its design from the MacBook. It is available in silver and space grey (as reviewed), it has a black Apple logo which no longer lights up; it has the same keyboard with larger keys but less vertical movement than the last Pro; it has the same Force Touch trackpad which offers the sensation of clicking without actually moving. This model does not feature Apple's new Touch Bar, but does have a new keyboard and larger trackpadIBTimes UK The larger key sizes are welcome, and while they make a satisfying and premium-sounding 'click-clack' noise, their shorter travel makes them less comfortable than before. It is comfier than typing on a glass iPad screen, but not as cushioned as on the Pro we've owned since 2014. And while the trackpad is insanely clever, the way it makes you think it clicks when it doesn't, its massive size meant we kept resting our hand on it and right-clicking by accident. The click feels less precise than its predecessor, but we feel this is something we will adjust to in time. Navigating across its glass surface is as exquisite as ever and a reminder that Apple really gets this right. The new MacBook Pro is a beautiful laptop which once again proves Apple's hardware and design divisions are at the very top of their game. Lighter and thinner than before, to look at and hold it is simply stunning. The screen too is beautiful; it has the same Retina resolution as before, but with boosted brightness, contrast and colour gamut. The new Pro is a beautifully made laptop, but its lack of ports is going to frustrate some usersIBTimes UK But there must be much more to a laptop than merely looking good; especially one with Pro in its name. This is where things get complicated, because Apple has made such fundamental changes here that anyone hoping to introduce the new MacBook Pro into their life without stress, confusion and additional costs is in danger of being left frustrated. This laptop has just two Thunderbolt 3 ports, which are physically the same as USB-C (as used by several new Android smartphones and will likely soon become a common standard across the technology landscape). Either port can be used to charge the laptop, but doing so leaves you with just one for connecting a screen, portable hard drive, phone, camera or any other accessory. Suddenly using the 2016 MacBook Pro reminds us of the 2008 MacBook Air, which had a single USB port. On second thought, even that had separate ports for charging and connecting to a display. A £30 hub is needed to connect the regular USB cable of our iPhone 7 and SD card from our cameraIBTimes UK Apple wants the world to go wireless, but this transition via the new Pro is a difficult one to make. No SD card slot means that transferring photos from camera to laptop requires a third-party adapter or a camera with wireless capabilities. Charging the iPhone 7 means buying a new cable. Editing videos with help from a scratch disk also requires an adapter, and so too will most external displays. Consumer backlash has already forced Apple to cut the prices of its adapters in a bid to restore confidence among buyers who suddenly need a bagful of cables to make the new MacBook Pro work with everything they already own. The most common, letting you attach a regular USB device, is £9, down from £15. This is, of course, the worst-case scenario. Eventually Apple expects USB-C and/or wireless to become the norm and feature on your hard drive, display, camera and everything else. But for now you will want to buy adapters, dongles or a port-filled hub to plug everything in. New for the 2016 MacBook Pro is a space grey colour option, available alongside silverIBTimes UK Apple is no stranger to forcing the world to ditch old technologies and upgrade; floppy disc, CD, DVD, Firewire, Ethernet, headphone jack, USB, SD cards, MagSafe, HDMI. All gone over the years, diluted down to a single type of port. There is clear logic here, just as there is with making all cars electric, but both transitions will take us down long, winding, expensive and at times uncomfortable roads. The destination here is computer port euphoria but it is also so far away, behind the dense, low-hanging fog of dongles and adapters, that average consumers might have a hard time seeing it clearly enough to think investing at least £1,449 now is a good idea. The counter argument is that shoppers spending that on a laptop won't mind an extra £50 to £100 on dongles, but then whatever happened to Apple's 'It Just Works' mantra? The new Pro works by itself just fine and is a brilliant computer in isolation; it has class-leading design, strong (if not spectacular) performance, impressive battery life, a great screen and a good keyboard and trackpad. The 13in Pro's trackpad had grown by 50% and now features Force Touch. The keyboard also has a shallower key travelIBTimes UK But viewed as a whole, when slotted into our existing lives, the MacBook Pro loses some of its shine. This is a beautiful laptop with the same excellent software as ever, but it feels like it has arrived too early and to a difficult crowd. We spent £30 on a hub from Amazon to send charging, two regular USB ports, SD and microSD slots all to one of the Pro's two Thunderbolt ports. It is a good solution for the average user, who needs to plug in USB sticks, a back-up drive and a SD card. But add a couple of display adapters and things quickly get expensive. Our verdict Apple MacBook Pro 13in (2016) These are early days. Better and cheaper adapters will arrive soon. We will all eventually buy displays and hard drivers with Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C, but that could be several years down the line. How many businesses still use Windows XP? This change will not happen overnight and right now the day you forget your hub is going to be incredibly frustrating. But, all that being said, we are mostly enjoying the new MacBook Pro. As writers we are not pushing the laptop particularly hard, both in terms of performance and ports. For our use case the Pro gets a lot right; the keyboard gets better and more comfortable the more you use it, and the more your muscle memory adjusts to the shorter key travel. The screen is gorgeous and the battery (just about) lasts a full day in the office, although we felt compelled to carry a charger to be on the safe side. Apple has again grabbed us by the scruff of the neck, dragged us into the future and left us to fend for ourselves while it waits for everyone else to catch up. As a result the new Pro feels like a step into a future we know is right, but which we aren't quite ready for.

PC-Tablet Videos Tech Apps Telecom Science Business Social Auto Reviews How-To’s Featured Simple trick to extend battery life of your iPhone and Android smartphone By Anand Narayanaswamy - 08/11/2016 The tech enthusiasts used to eagerly wait for the kind of battery technology which Apple announces during the iPhone launch event every year. The main feature which every Apple lover expects is the enhanced battery life. The elimination of the headphone jack in iPhone is not a major concern among consumers. They only require more power juice so that they can remain connected. If iPhone gets discharged immediately, then it’s of no use even though there are other features like fingerprint sensor and integration of Taptic feedback. Here, the consumers require enough resources to catch all Pokemons. The American Chemical Society has released a video, which provides few tips to extend the life of the battery with Chemistry factors. The video begins by providing a short introduction regarding the basic working of lithium-ion batteries. Smartphones contain lithium-ion batteries If you are already using smartphones, you will know that the handsets like iPhones make use of lithium-ion batteries. They are super light and will be able to hold power longer than other types of batteries. Naturally, the batteries will start to degrade over the period of time. Battery will degrade over the period of time Even if you buy a costly handset like iPhone, the battery will tend to get worse over time and will eventually lose its total shelf life. If your smartphone comes with integrated battery, then you have no choice other than to throw away the handset. This is because, by the time the battery degrades, the handset variant will be out-dated. The main advantage of lithium-ion batteries is that they will remind you when it reaches the zero mark. This will enable you to charge the batteries again to reach its full potential. As explained in the video, you are better if you keep of your battery right around a 50 percent sweet spot. According to Eric Limer, a lithium-ion battery’s charge capacity is determined by how many lithium ions it can nestle into its two electrode points. The video reveals that as you continue to charge on a daily basis, the components degrade and will carry fewer ions. However, battery university recommends partial discharges since it will be difficult to charge the battery if it starts from zero. If you are draining the battery for a long period of time, then it will lose its overall capacity more quickly. Avoid heat near smartphone The video continues the journey by stating that the heat is the real lithium-ion killer. It says that heat speeds up all chemical reactions and the one inside the battery are prone to extreme heats. The video suggests that the heat of your body is adequate enough to help kill a battery quickly. Hence, you are advised to keep the phone away from your pockets. Battery can explode if there is no charge The best idea is to charge the phone to around 50 percent before you turn it off. If the battery has no charge, it can become unstable or even explode. Hence, if you have a smartphone or a laptop, you will need to charge it a half way mark. It’s better to suffer a severe pain in the neck rather than witnessing the explosion of handsets. The recent issue associated with Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is due to minor battery fault. Hence, the company is issuing a software update to keep the charge to 60 percent. This is ridiculous since customers are not getting the full potential of their valuable phone.

It appears that the new notebooks have been selling well because according to a new report, Apple is “aggressive” in ordering new units from its suppliers as it expects strong sales of the new MacBook Pro to continue well into next year. It does seem possible since the company has made us all wait for a very long time for the new MacBook Pro lineup. DigiTimes reports, citing sources in the supply chain, that Apple has aggressively been placing orders for the MacBook Pro. It says that Apple is “optimistic” about sales in the holiday quarter and that it expects the new MacBook Pro lineup to perform well next year as well. This is contrary to initial reports which claimed that the new MacBook Pros were not selling as well as the company would have hoped. It was even reported at one point that Apple had actually delayed orders for the MacBook Pro because of low yield rates of some components. The keyboard, battery, and hinges were identified as the parts with low yield rates. Apparently, things are looking up for the holiday season as millions of people set out to buy new stuff for themselves as well as for their family and friends. The report suggests that MacBook Pro shipments for 2016 will reach 15 million units and that Apple is likely to maintain the same pace in 2017. Filed in Apple. Read more about Macbook Pro.

Recent Comments Apple's Two-Step Verification versus Two-Factor Authentication, or, When Marketing's lingo makes it impossible to communicate with plain speech Oct 25, 2016 • general In the latest episode of This Week in Tech (TWIT episode 585), the hosts talk about how confusing Apple's two-factor authentication is compared to Apple's two-step verification. The hosts, who are all tech gurus, had trouble sorting out the difference, and their experience with the service was even more problematic. This naming fail points to a core challenge in tech comm that happens when Marketing's choice of terms makes it difficult or impossible for tech writers to communicate plainly. If you want to read a good explanation of the difference between two-step verification and two-factor authentication, see Oleg’s Apple Two-Factor Authentication vs. Two-Step Verification. But to get a real sense of the Apple tech writer’s pain, you must read these two documentation topics: Frequently asked questions about two-step verification for Apple ID Two-factor authentication for Apple ID I feel sorry for the technical writer who had to write this. Although there are slight differences between the two services, essentially both send you a text message with a special code to complete the second-factor verification/authentication. The newer version uses some security measures only available in later devices and doesn’t have the variety of options surrounding the second-factor authentication as with the two-step verification method. But that’s not my point here. I could care less about two-factor whatever. I’d simply like to highlight that Marketing groups often put tech writers into difficult positions when they come out with new services like this, where one service is highly similar to the previous service but with some vague differences. According to the technical writer, two-factor authentication differs from two-step verification because “It uses different methods to trust devices and deliver verification codes, and offers a more streamlined user experience” (Two-factor authentication for Apple ID). I can imagine the tech writer saying in product meetings, “Wait a minute, tell me again … so how is this different from the previous two-step verification thing?” This example points to a larger pattern. Marketing frequently renames older features with newer terms to communicate the new features and differentiate them from the old. I doubt there are significant semantic differences between “two-step verification” and “two-factor authentication.” The terms could probably be reversed. But why invent a totally new name for essentially the same feature? Perhaps they could have called “Two-factor authentication” something like “Two-step verification for iOS 9 and El Capitan or later devices.” It’s confusing to have two distinct names for essentially the same feature. Over the years I have had my share of experiences where I’ve had to use product names that I thought were less than clear. Recently when Amazon released the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote, I asked why the product name differed from name of the previous Fire TV Stick, which was called Fire TV Stick with Voice Remote. Does the old stick not use Alexa as the voice remote service? Yes, it does. However, the first Fire TV Stick was released before Alexa became a household name through the Echo. I like the inclusion of “Alexa” in the product name because it lets people know that they’re getting the same Alexa voice service in their Fire TV Stick as exists in the Echo. But in the third-party developer documentation (not end-user documentation) I didn’t call the Fire TV stick either of its official retail names because the developer community consistently refers to them as “Fire TV Stick (Generation 1)” or “Fire TV Stick (Generation 2)”. (You can see the differentiation here.) Ultimately, tech writers don’t often have leverage to change product names set by Marketing or Product Management. Products and features can be incredibly difficult to name, and names are decided not only by Marketing groups, but through negotiations with Legal and Business teams. Sometimes you can’t use a specific word in your product name (such as “Java” or “Android”) even though it would clarify the feature for users. Writing with clarity and precision in the documentation gets tricky when you’re hamstrung by confusing product terminology. And yet if you shed Marketing’s terms and go with simple, plain, understandable terms that you think make sense, users also get confused because the terms in your documentation no longer match the terms in the product. You’ve now got an inconsistent user experience. This is a case of damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t. It’s why so many tech writers experience friction with Marketing. The same scenario frequently exists with user interface text. As a technical writer, you find yourself using button and tab names that make little sense (not to mention error messages), and you wish you could have renamed them much earlier in the product’s evolution. But alas, it’s two weeks before the release, and no one is changing anything. So you’re stuck trying to articulate some highly technical concept using terms that few people will understand. In a recent discussion on Write the Docs Slack, someone expressed frustration when their company adopted and slightly modified a third-party product. The interface text used in the third-party product was extremely poor, so as this writer created documentation for his users, he had to decide whether to use the existing UI names in the third-party product, add apologetic notes in his documentation that translated the text into simpler terms, or invent new names altogether. In the end, he noted that it’s better to get involved earlier in the cycle but that he has limited bandwidth and must compromise in this situation for now. What’s the solution to situations like this, where you’re forced into doc scenarios where you have to explain complex concepts and workflows using the wrong terminology? I’m not entirely sure. Ideally, tech writers should try to suggest clear, easy-to-understand names for products and features well ahead of the release date, before the name gets cemented by Legal and promoted in Marketing campaigns. That kind of approach requires you to step outside your normal role as a technical writer and play a larger part in shaping the product. The problem is that few of us have the luxury or clout to be involved so early in product design with this influence. As a result, we often have to make do with the existing terminology. Likely the only practical solution is to provide more glossary-like sections in documentation that frequently remind users what we mean, with occasional parenthetical insertions that help clarify along the way. If you want to listen to the TWIT episode, I recommend that you download Stitcher and listen to it through the Stitcher app. Tweet Share I'd Rather Be Writing Newsletter Get new posts delivered straight to your inbox.

Recent Comments Should you ever apologize for something product-related in your documentation? Looking at Apple's dongle documentation Nov 6, 2016 • general Apple's recent dongle fiasco raises an interesting tech comm question: Is there ever a time when you, as a technical writer, should apologize for something product-related in your documentation? I looked at Apple's end-user docs about their ports but didn't see any acknowledgement that they were inconveniencing their users in an extreme way. Instead, the tone was merely straightforward and factual about which adapters you would need. When an issue is controversial or obviously of deep concern to users, documentation should address the issue head-on. You don't need to try to communicate about the issue in an emotional way (though that tone might be welcome to users), you just need to include the information, mostly following Reddish's documentation-as-conversation model. Background on the Dongle/Port Fiasco In case you haven’t heard about the new ports in the new Macbook Pro laptops, the laptops removed all (standard) USB, SD Card, and Thunderbolt ports – essentially replacing them with USB-C ports, which is an emerging standard but is by no means common. Further, despite dismissing the headphone jack on the iPhones as old tech, they do include a headphone jack on the Macbook Pro. Finally, you can’t plug your new iPhone into your Macbook Pro. For some more background on the issue, see Apple is now officially a dongle company that happens to make smartphones and computers, which has more than 13,000 shares and seems to represent the prevalent view. The author explains: The absurdity of the situation is neatly captured by the following fact: None of Apple’s newest laptops can connect to its own flagship smartphones without using a dongle or purchasing a separate cable that doesn’t otherwise ship with any of Apple’ s hardware. Here’s a similar thread on Twitter: Apple's fastest growing product category. pic.twitter.com/d1sel4N5Yc— Drew Breunig (@dbreunig) October 28, 2016 For fun, see this video of an “Apple engineer” speaking about his work on the latest Mac notebooks: The issue of Apple’s missing ports and plethora of required dongles has occupied considerable attention on tech podcasts and the tech media. Apple’s Dongle Docs I decided to check out Apple’s documentation pages about the ports and required adapters. Here are a few relevant pages I found where required adapters are listed: Take a Tour Accessories Use an External Display Common Questions There’s nothing in the documentation that hints at the inconvenience and cumbersomeness of these dongles/adapters. (Apple’s docs use the term “adapter” instead of “dongle.”) If you’re trying to relate to your users, wouldn’t you anticipate some of their questions and address these issues? In Ginny Reddish’s book Letting Go of the Words, she explains that documentation should be written as if you’re having a conversation with your users. Reddish explains: If you think of the web as conversation, you’ll realize that much of your content is meant to answer the questions that people come with. you do not want an entire site to be in a section called frequently asked questions. You do want to think about what people come wanting to know and then about how to give them that information as concisely and clearly as possible. (Letting Go of the Words) If the Apple’s tech writers were imagining what questions users might ask, surely they would have included some sections with the following titles: Why do I need so many adapters? Why is Apple insisting on USB-C for every port even when this technology is still emerging in the market? Why can’t I plug my new iPhone into my new Macbook Pro? Why did Apple remove the SD Card slot? Why is the “antiquated” headphone jack now included in the new Macbook Pro? You get the point: Include the questions your users have. By avoiding this issue, Apple’s docs kind of seem like a more technical version of their marketing material. Best practices I think that as a best practice, tech writers should follow Reddish’s advice to imagine a conversation with users. If users have specific questions, we should make these questions and issues explicit. Implementing this advice can be difficult because tech writers are usually overruled/bullied by product managers who don’t want to say anything negative or controversial about their product … ever. However, since documentation isn’t in the same space as marketing content, we tend to have more flexibility to sneak things in (especially if SMEs are slow to review the content). We can be more transparent and honest, because hey, who reads the docs anyway? :) My own experience It’s easy to criticize Apple, but what would I do in a similar situations? What have I done in the past? I don’t have any experience where my products caused such widespread controversy and uproar. But there are times when I sort of apologize here and there. In some image asset guidelines I recently wrote for an upcoming Fire TV UI refresh, I had trouble getting legal approval to use image assets from popular Amazon apps (because they’re 3rd-party image assets). As a result, we had to use images from video shows produced by Amazon, even though most apps wouldn’t be video shows. As a result, I added this note in my docs: (Note that Bosche, a video series rather than an app, is used here because we are restricted to showing Amazon-produced assets only, and Amazon’s main assets are video rather than individual apps. To see an actual example of an app video, check out the video from Crossy Road.) (Image Asset Guidelines for Appstore Submission - “Trailer” tab) I felt I needed to at least acknowledge why some of the image assets weren’t app-focused. I also wanted to include a deadline for asset submission in the docs (a question users would no doubt wonder), but I had to keep it general to “later this year.” Additionally, a lot of users probably wanted to know exactly what the new Fire TV UI will look like. But alas, this information is not something I could share in the documentation prior to release, especially because it still might be changing. (That’s more understandable, though, because almost no company shares detailed info prior to release.) In another section of my docs, one of the configuration steps for an app was really confusing. I decided to stick this note before the long explanation of how to write the query syntax: Although the query syntax in this section might seem a little complex, remember that Fire App Builder lets you use any feed structure you want, without limiting you to a specific order or specification (such as Media RSS). With this flexibility, it’s unavoidable that you’ll need to use more advanced query syntax to target the elements in your feed. (Set Up the Contents Recipe) At other companies, I’ve had situations where I disagreed with the way a task was implemented, but it wasn’t so bad that I felt compelled to apologize for it in the docs. If this were the case, though, you could always call out that this is an early version of the product and that it will keep iterating/improving with each new release. Opportunities to be real As a tech writer, sometimes there are issues that are controversial or sensitive, and product managers and other execs may not want you to acknowledge or address the issues in the documentation. Only when issues become so controversial that the company’s non-response becomes an issue in itself does the company finally speak up. In the case of the dongles, Apple finally had to release a statement: “We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple’s USB-C adapters and cables.” (Apple is now officially a dongle company that happens to make smartphones and computers) It would be good to include a version of this note in Apple’s docs. Emotional tones versus straightforward information Apple’s docs missed a point to show their humanity with this issue, but you don’t have to apologize in an emotional way in documentation. For example, you don’t have to say, I’m sorry we took away all the ports and made you spend more than $100 in dongles that make your new lightweight, super thin Macbook Pro look somewhat laughable. But try to look at it from a future-facing perspective. You’ll likely have your Macbook for a few years, and soon USB-C will be everywhere. We made the optical drive extinct, and see how that turned out? I’m not saying you need an approach like that, because this sort of tone definitely breaks what is the usual professional voice that companies adopt. What I’m saying is that Reddish’s approach of phrasing anticipated objections as questions and then providing answers is the way to go. You can do that without falling into jokey humor or a light-hearted tone. I also think that technical writers can and should play stronger roles about what should or should not be communicated in documentation. In writing this, I realize that I’ve been too much of a “yes man” in IT groups. In more scenarios, I should push back against product managers who say “don’t mention this” or “we don’t want to say that.” Although the product manager might have ultimate authority about what gets communicated about a product, we can certainly make our case more vehemently, or simply make it without consulting the product manager in the first place (following the age-old principle that it’s better to ask for forgiveness than to ask permission). All too often I assume the product manager has the final say about everything. I’m not really sure that’s the case. The product manager wouldn’t normally override an engineer’s decision about code. In the same way, we should probably have more spine about the communication in the documentation domain. Tweet Share I'd Rather Be Writing Newsletter Get new posts delivered straight to your inbox.

This chip company generated more than half of its revenue from Apple last quarter. Here's why that could be a problem. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 8, 2016 at 10:00AM Motion sensor specialist InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) told investors on its Nov. 3 earnings call that during its most recent quarter, 58% of its revenue came from its largest customer. That customer is believed to be none other than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). InvenSense is highly dependent on Apple's iPhone. Image source: Apple.  Although InvenSense certainly benefits from having Apple as a major customer, there are significant risks associated with being so dependent on a single customer. Let's go over a big one.  Partial or total Apple share loss Although InvenSense has won motion sensor spots inside multiple generations of iPhones, investors shouldn't dismiss the possibility that one of the two following scenarios could coming to pass: Apple decides to second-source the accelerometer and gyroscope chips in a future iPhone, dramatically reducing its potential revenue from iPhone sales. Apple completely designs InvenSense out of a future iPhone, putting InvenSense's Apple-related revenue trajectory on the path to $0. Both scenarios would be catastrophic to InvenSense's business, with the latter potentially putting the company on the path to insolvency. Let's take a closer look at each of these scenarios individually. What a partial Apple share loss would mean for InvenSense Last quarter, InvenSense reported $79.8 million in revenue, with roughly $46.3 million of that figure from Apple. It also tallied gross profit of $33.53 million and operating expenses of $43 million, for an operating loss of $9.48 million. What happens if InvenSense is forced to split that revenue 50/50 with an alternative supplier? Reworking this quarter's results to factor such a share loss, InvenSense's quarterly revenue would have been just $56.65 million. Apple's business probably comes at much lower margins than the rest of InvenSense's business, so if we assume InvenSense's gross profit margin increased to around 46% as a result of share loss at Apple, and if we also assume InvenSense's current operating expense run rates hold, that revenue level would have led InvenSense to post an operating loss of $17 million.  Losses like that aren't sustainable for very long for a company of this size. In that case, the company would have to dramatically scale back its operating cost structure to avoid burning cash too rapidly.  That would curtail InvenSense's ability to invest in new markets, such as the Internet of Things opportunity that the company's management team appears bullish on. What a total Apple share loss would mean for InvenSense Imagine now the scenario in which Apple completely dumps InvenSense. This one is much less likely, assuming InvenSense can continue to execute, but Apple has dumped suppliers wholesale in the past. It did so with Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) and its A-series chip manufacturing, PortalPlayer in the iPod, and Infineon in older iPhones. Investors also shouldn't forget that InvenSense was designed out of the Samsung Galaxy S7, even though it had successfully secured spots in Samsung's flagships in the past.  If InvenSense's Apple-related revenue simply vanished in its most recent quarter, then the motion-processor specialist would have reported just $33.5 million in revenue. Even at a 50% gross profit margin, that level of revenue -- again, assuming constant operating expenses -- would have had InvenSense losing approximately $26 million. In this case, just as in the case of partial share loss, InvenSense would need to open some large, alternative revenue streams quickly or be forced to rapidly slash operating expenses. The cuts in this scenario would probably need to be significantly larger than they'd need to be in the partial-share-loss situation. In either case, though, InvenSense's future would look much bleaker. Should management sell the company now?  The problem with InvenSense is that even with a lot of revenue coming from its win at Apple, it's still not able to consistently generate a healthy operating profit. The company's operating expense structure is quite high, and it's not clear when InvenSense's significant investments in the future will begin to pay off. Management said on its most recent earnings call that it expects a return to "healthy year-over-year growth in fiscal 2018, driven by several market trends and new design wins in progress," but I'm going to be cautious about taking management's optimism at face value. Indeed, Reuters recently reported that InvenSense is "exploring strategic alternatives, including a possible sale." If InvenSense's management and board of directors were so optimistic about the company's future, why would they be looking to sell the company? More importantly, why would they be looking to do it when InvenSense shares trade for less than they did when the company first went public? There may be some upside to InvenSense stock from here if the company is successful in finding a buyer, but that's far from guaranteed. Reuters, for one, says "there is no certainty that the sale process will result in any deal." The business just seems too risky at this point for me to buy the stock.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Nov 8, 2016 at 10:33AM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) experienced a temporary dip in iPhone average selling prices (ASPs) over the summer, largely because of the introduction of the $400 iPhone SE. Heading into the holiday quarter, Apple expects ASPs to jump back, and fulfilling iPhone 7 Plus demand will be the key. In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu, CFA, discuss why the iPhone 7 Plus is so important and why it got a $20 price bump. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 28, 2016. Dylan Lewis: Let's talk a little bit about what they reported in terms of numbers. Maybe we'll get into some of the product discussion a little bit later on -- $46.8 billion in revenue on the top line, more or less in line with expectations, down from $51.5 billion a year ago. But that is to be expected, we knew that was coming, no surprises there. Earnings per share at $1.67, which was actually slightly above what expectations were. The two big numbers that people immediately focus on, it seems like Apple delivered a pretty solid quarter. Evan Niu: Yeah. I think it was right on target. I don't think there were really any big upsides and downside surprises. The way I look at it, this is the most boring quarter of all the seasons, because it's right before the iPhone launched. You get a couple weeks of the new iPhone sales, but generally speaking, Q3 is just not a super exciting time for consumer electronics companies. Lewis: You mentioned the iPhone. We might as well head in straight into the discussion on that product. The company sold 45.5 million iPhones at an average selling price, ASP, of $619. That amounts to about $28 billion in revenue, good for about 60% of Apple's top line. We've seen that trend down a little bit. I think it's stabilized in the high 50s, low 60s. It isn't quite the two-thirds amount it used to be. Niu: Yeah. On a trailing-12-month basis, it's still about 63%. It's still pretty far up there. One thing I did notice that was interesting was Apple did not disclose this whole thing about installed base-related purchases that they've been doing for the past three quarters. As we talked about before, there's this effort -- in my opinion -- to shift attention away from unit sales. But they didn't do that this time, which is weird, like, are they not trying to do that anymore? Lewis: Yeah, any time you introduce a new metric, especially a non-GAAP metric, you're shifting attention somewhere. And for them to go silent on that makes you wonder exactly what's going on there. Niu: Yeah, it's a weird change of tune. I've been keeping track of this number, and I was expecting to plug it into my sheet, and they just didn't have it. Lewis: One number I think a lot of people have to be pretty optimistic about is the general trend with ASP. I said $619, that's up from the previous quarter, and it seems like there's some more upside there. Niu: Right. The main thing to remember is that the reason why it was down over the summer was because of the iPhone SE launch, which starts at $400, which was the lowest price point that Apple has ever sold an iPhone directly, even if you factor in how they bring these older models down by price point every year. The lowest they'd ever gone before was, a three-year-old iPhone would go for $450. Then they came out with the SE, which starts at $400. It was a pretty aggressive play to get smaller phones and first-time adopters, with a lower entry price. That put a meaningful impact on ASPs, which was $595 last quarter, which was the lowest it's been in about two years. They did say on the phone, they expect ASPs to climb back up to where they were last December quarter, which, for reference, was $691. So, I think we should start to see that number start to push $700 again, particularly if they can meet iPhone 7 Plus demand, which they're having a hard time doing, because the iPhone is so expensive, they can increase that price by $20 compared to last year. The 7 Plus will really push ASPs up, I think. Lewis: And part of the justification with that incremental $20 on the price point was the camera. That was the major selling point, and that's how management pointed to that decision. Niu: Yeah. They specifically said it was the camera. They were asked about it, and they were like, "We put a ton of Innovation into the dual-camera system." I do think that is very specifically what's the reason for that $20.

Stock This underappreciated GPS maker could be a great long-term play at current prices. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 8, 2016 at 11:30AM Things looked bleak for Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) just two years ago. Its automotive GPS device business, which generated most of its revenue, was being disrupted by smartphone-based mapping apps. That pressure caused the stock to tumble from the low $60s in July 2014 to the low $30s by Jan. 2016. But since then, Garmin staged a remarkable rebound, rallying 26% year-to-date and outperforming the NASDAQ's flat growth. Yet I believe that Garmin could still have room to run next year, for a few simple reasons. Image source: Garmin. Market share growth in wearables The strongest reason for buying Garmin is its impressive growth in the wearables market, which is more commonly associated with companies like Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). That's because Garmin offers a wide variety of specialized wearable devices for certain activities -- like swimming, golfing, and jogging -- instead of "general use" devices which cover a wider range of activities with fewer features. That approach helped Garmin grow its worldwide wearable shipments 107% to 1.6 million units between the second quarters of 2015 and 2016, according to IDC. That placed the company in fourth place in the overall market after Fitbit, Xiaomi, and Apple (in that order) with a market share of 6.9%. That growth also made Garmin the fastest growing wearables maker in the world. In the smartwatch market, IDC reports that Garmin's shipments surged 324% to 600,000 units between the third quarters of 2015 and 2016. That growth, which again outpaced the growth of all other rivals, made Garmin the second biggest smartwatch maker in the world after Apple with a 20.5% market share. If Garmin's growth continues at its current trajectory, it could become a major threat to Fitbit and Apple over the next few quarters. Garmin's high-end Fenix Chronos. Image source: Garmin. Wearables growth is offsetting its auto weakness Garmin's big wearables push has offset the ongoing weakness of its automotive GPS business. Last quarter, Garmin's automotive revenue fell 21% annually and accounted for 30% of its top line. However, that was a significant reduction from 40% of its sales in the prior year quarter. Meanwhile, fitness revenue surged 32% annually and accounted for 26% of Garmin's top line, thanks to robust demand for its Forerunner and Vivoactive devices. Outdoor revenue, bolstered by strong sales of its rugged Fenix GPS watches, rose 28% and accounted for 20% of Garmin's top line. The marine and aviation GPS businesses, which are less prone to disruption from smartphone-based GPS apps, both reported double-digit sales growth. All those positive tailwinds boosted Garmin's total revenue by 6% annually to $722 million. Analysts believe that Garmin's revenue and earnings will respectively improve 5% and 8% for the full year. Low valuations, high dividends, and buybacks That single-digit growth might not impress growth-oriented investors, but its trailing P/E of 18 is much lower the industry average of 31 for scientific and technical instrument companies. It's also comparable to Fitbit's P/E of 18. Garmin also pays a hefty forward dividend yield of 4.2%, which is substantially higher than the S&P 500's average yield of 2.2%. Fitbit has never paid a dividend, while Apple (which is only an indirect play on wearables) pays a 2% yield. Garmin has raised that dividend annually for four straight years. Garmin also regularly buys back stock to tighten up its earnings. Over the past 12 months, it spent 13% of its FCF on buybacks and 67% on dividends -- indicating that it still has room to raise both to boost shareholder value. The bottom line Garmin's growth and recovery over the past year demonstrates how valuable diversification is for hardware makers. If Garmin hadn't leveraged its strength in GPS devices to expand into wearables at the right time, its dying auto GPS business could have wrecked its top line growth. Instead, its wearables business is now replacing the automotive one as its most important unit, and its top and bottom line growth are getting back on track. Combine that recovery with its low valuation, solid dividend, and long record of buybacks, and I believe that Garmin could be a compelling long-term buy at current levels.   Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple has high expectations for its new MacBook Pro computers, introduced just a couple of weeks ago. The computers were met by critics who believe a MacBook Pro should have more port options and an SD card slot, however. Apple even admitted there was some controversy around the launch, which suggested that the MacBook Pro might not be a hot-ticket item after all. According to DigiTimes, Apple was “not initially very aggressive about placing new MacBook Pro orders,” suggesting that perhaps the company didn’t feel like there was going to be a ton of demand. That may have changed, however, because the same news outlet says Apple has pushed its partners to increase output of the new computers. “The sources are seeing an increased shipment proportion of Apple’s new MacBook Pro and they expect Apple and the related revenues and profits to all enjoy growth in 2017,” DigiTimes said, noting Apple feels “‘optimistic”  about sales during the holiday fourth quarter. I’m still skeptical of the new MacBook Pro I’m still skeptical, though. The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar costs $1,799. The entry-level model will set consumers back at least $1,499 and doesn’t even sport the new Touch Bar technology. Those seem like high prices in a market where low-priced Windows 10 and Chrome OS competitors have flourished over recent years. Perhaps Apple and its suppliers have struck a chord with consumers who want more.

According to a TechCrunch report, at least 16 employees from Omnifone began working for Apple starting in August, with most new hires on LinkedIn listed as software engineers and engineering managers working on iTunes and other apps.  Apple confirmed with Billboard that "some" former Omnifone employees are now working for the company, but did not go into head count. Apple also did not comment on reports that it purchased tech assets from Omnifone, a subject of speculation since July, when it was reported that the London-based company had found a buyer for some of its parts. Founded in 2003, Omnifone provided licensing and backend services for a variety of cloud-based digital music services, including Neil Young's Pono, before entering administration in May 2016 after determining it could not meet its debt liabilities. At the time of administration, Omnifone’s parent company said it had £1,418 in cash at bank, and was owed over £21.6 million in intercompany debts by its subsidiaries.  FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

Oh sure, you can argue that the top model’s 8GB of storage is too small, but with 6 months to go that spec (and others) can and probably will change; Apple isn’t even taking pre-orders on the device, yet. So things can change. One thing’s for sure, Apple has frozen a nice chunk of the smartphone market, not to mention some of the iPod market, too. Back to the naming issue: Apple’s “iPhone” isn’t really a phone at all. It’s really a small touchscreen Mac OS X computer, a Mac nano tablet, if you will. Here’s how misnamed the iPhone is: Some people are complaining that Jobs didn’t spend enough time on the Mac in his keynote! Folks, iPhone is not only a Mac, it’s the most radical new Mac in years! What’s to stop Apple from making a 12-inch model (and larger, and smaller) one of these days (use the headset for the phone, please) and calling it a Mac tablet? It has an iPod built in, yes, so it can be used solely as a “true video widescreen iPod,” if that’s what you want. And even using it just like that, the price is about right. It also has a smartphone built in, too; except this smartphone’s UI actually makes sense and is usable. Even if you just use it as a smartphone, the price is right, too. But, the main thing about the “iPhone” is that it’s really a pocket Mac. It has email, SMS, full-featured Web browsing, and much more. But, beyond that, it is a platform that’s just sitting there waiting for Apple to sell software for it. Just imagine games with the large multi-touch display and the built-in accelerometer! Imagine all of the other software possibilities, too. Given Apple’s history with the iPod (closed to third-party developers), today I’d have to guess that they’ll keep the iPhone under tight control, too. Maybe that will change in the future, maybe not. Still, Apple could do a lot with the platform all by themselves. What about ringtones sold via Apple’s iTunes Store? With Wi-Fi onboard these things could beam data between each other like crazy. The possibilities are endless. No matter how you look at it, for all that it can do even now, the device is very well priced and should fly off the shelves regardless of its name. Maybe Apple named it iPhone because of all of the free publicity and buzz that name has already garnered. Maybe they want this trojan horse to slip into the market first under the guise of being the best smartphone available and they’ll exploit its capabilities as a full-fledged platform later. Perhaps it’s easier to explain and sell as a phone first. It probably would have been even easier to just have called it iPod (6G) and listed “iPhone” as a new iPod feature – that’s how they sold video, right? I also have to wonder what will happen to Safari’s market share after the iPhone starts shipping. All of those iPhones hitting sites with their Safari browsers are going to have an impact if they’re counted properly. What about Mac OS X market share? Each iPhone is technically a Mac, right? If so, Apple will at least double their Mac shipments in the first year alone. Let’s hope IDC and Gartner count them all! So, yeah, it can be a phone, even the very best smartphone, but it’s so much more and holds so much promise that the name “iPhone” hardly does it justice.

Think about having in 3 or 4 years from now a 24″ screen with keyboard and mouse, Wacom tablet (and any other peripheral you use with your iMac or iBook) connected to a small dock. Same setup at your parents house. You use it at home where your docked iPhone is running the show, with its 500GB flash disk and Core8Quattro processor. You go to parent’s house, playing a game or movie on the iPhone while your spouse drives (or the car drives itself). You use parent’s dock to use your ‘computer’ there. Same for your wife carrying her iPhone between home and work. No more home, office desktops, laptop for travel. You have one computer for everywhere, and it goes with you in your pocket. And it has Apple logo on its back. Open your mind to that possibility folks! Have you bought your Apple stock yesterday? MW: further typhoon Wednesday, January 10, 2007 - 1:08 pm · Reply dogfriend and others are right – it’s a mac that will get people hooked. My father complained about getting an iPod for Christmas because he was too old, but shows off his crappy motorola phone like it’s the bomb. This is a bigger trojan horse than the iPod. I think this form factor will replace laptops. Apple will make versions with a larger screen, but over time. Eventually, the MacBook and iPhone will have a merged device. And, suddenly, everybody’s using a Mac, whether they know it or not! This is the coup de gras for Apple. The platform wars are over, and Microsoft just lost. MDN Magic Word: “french” As in, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer probably haven’t felt like french kissing in over a day! ndelc Wednesday, January 10, 2007 - 2:41 pm · Reply I agree with several posters here, putting Mac in the name wouldn’t help it with the PC users out there. iPhone more closely associates it with the iPod, which has much better market reputation. Sad but true. Also, I’m not sure it should technically be considered a Mac, at least with what we know now. It does have some type of OS X on it, but you can’t just install any Mac software on it that you want. That separates it in my book. KingMel Wednesday, January 10, 2007 - 2:44 pm · Reply I’d call it the MacMobile. All the goodness of a Mac in a small, portable form factor. TJ Wednesday, January 10, 2007 - 3:38 pm · Reply Dreaming of the possibilities… as LCDs get thinner (or are replaced by some other possibly flexible technology) think about having an iPhone/Mac that has a fold out screen on it…. so with the screen closed, you would be looking at a 4″x6″ screen, but “unfold” it (2 flaps – one opens to the right, one to the left) and you all of the sudden have a 12″ x 6″ screen in your lap that is 1280×1024 yubba dubba Wednesday, January 10, 2007 - 4:12 pm · Reply the iTV name has been changed to Apple tv. If Cisco gives Apple any grief the name will change – Cisco looses. KenC Wednesday, January 10, 2007 - 6:32 pm · Reply I liked the name SteveJack gave his mythical device in his original article, THE DEVICE. There’s no doubt, this is the one and only THE DEVICE I want it. Brau Thursday, January 11, 2007 - 5:53 am · Reply Anything with the term “mobile” has bad connotations because of MicroSoft Windows Mobile and Motorola’s Mobile. The only other name I could envision would be ‘iC” as an acronym for Internet Communicator, which is what it really is.

Phil Schiller addressed some of the MacBook Pro concerns in an interview last week, and said that the cheaper model is already a success. That’s in spite of criticism, or of the fact that it lacks the exciting Touch Bar found on the more expensive models supposed to launch in the coming weeks. Further reinforcing Schiller’s remarks is a report from Asia that says Apple is increasing component orders for the entire Christmas quarter. According to Digitimes, Apple is optimistic about sales in the fourth quarter, and strong shipments are expected to last through the end of the year. DON’T MISS: What happens if today’s Presidential election ends in a tie? Sources from the supply chain also noted that MacBook shipments in 2017 should remain at the same level as in 2016. Apple should sell more than 15 million MacBooks in total this year, according to unnamed market watchers. Apparently, Apple wasn’t aggressive with initial MacBook Pro orders. Furthermore, Apple apparently delayed the MacBook Pro’s launch by a quarter after encountering poor yield rates for certain components, including hinges, battery, and keyboard. Apple became more aggressive after the MacBook Pro’s launch in October, the report notes. A second story from Digitimes further reveals that Apple had some Touch Bar manufacturing issues. The company turned to Wistron to place additional Touch Bar orders, as the original Singapore-based supplier had problems producing the keyboard.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 8, 2016 at 9:23AM According to Japanese blog Mac Otakara, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) next-generation iPad Pro series of tablets -- which will apparently come in three sizes -- is set to arrive in the spring of 2017. Mac Otakara listed some features expected to be included in the upcoming tablets, such as True Tone wide-color displays and 12-megapixel iSight cameras. Image source: Apple.  Separately, according to Bloomberg, the next-generation iPad models will also include support for a "faster display technology." It's clear that all the secrets of Apple's next-generation iPad models have yet to be revealed. Today, I'd like to go over one feature I'd like to see on Apple's next-generation tablets. Giving the new iPads a sense of depth With the iPhone 6s series of smartphones launched in late 2015, Apple introduced a technology known as 3D Touch. In Apple's own words, 3D Touch "senses how deeply users press the display, letting them do more than ever with [developers'] apps and games." The company touted it as a pretty big deal, making its omission from the current iPad lineup a bit awkward. Back in late 2015, AppleInsider said -- citing "a source familiar with the matter" -- that Apple apparently found that it couldn't take the 3D Touch technology used in the iPhone 6s series devices and bring it to larger-format displays. AppleInsider's source also claimed that Apple, at the time, was "working on a comparable technology for integration in both iPhones and iPads." Apple has had a while to work on building 3D Touch technology aimed at iPad-sized devices, so it'd be be nice to see the company's 2017 iPad lineup offer 3D Touch capability. Why must Apple bring 3D Touch to the iPad Pro line? There's little doubt that 3D Touch will add bill-of-materials cost if it's included in a future iPad -- that's on top of the technical hurdles the iDevice maker apparently must grapple with to even get 3D Touch added to larger-screen devices. However, I think it's important that Apple bring this technology to the iPad as quickly as possible. Remember that virtually every new iPhone sold today, aside from the low-cost iPhone SE, includes 3D Touch support. The installed base of 3D Touch-capable iOS devices is now very large and growing, and it won't be long before the bulk of iOS device owners come to expect that 3D Touch is simply part of the iOS platform -- and not just the iPhone. Indeed, Apple made significant changes to iOS10, its latest version of iOS, to make 3D Touch a more integral part of the iOS experience. It's going to be tough to explain to customers why the expensive new iPad that Apple is trying to sell doesn't include a feature that they've become accustomed to having on the device. Additionally, with such a large portion of the iOS device installed base now using 3D Touch-enabled devices, developers are likely to increasingly find value in integrating 3D Touch into their applications. It would be a shame if developers couldn't bring those same 3D Touch features to the iPad-focused versions of their applications. Finally, 3D Touch on the iPad would simply be a nice, innovative selling point. It wouldn't be enough to carry the next-generation iPad models to sales success, but combined with other interesting features, the new devices could bring enough to the table to get owners of older iPad models to finally upgrade.    Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

/PRNewswire/ -- http://www.Financialbuzz.com - As technology becomes more advanced and costs of production falling, wearable devices become more mainstream. While the fitness trackers and wearable cameras were the most popular wearable devices, a stronger emphasis on health and a bigger demand for home care are expected drive up demand for medical wearables. According to a recent research by Global Market Insights, a market research and management consulting company, the wearable devices market size is anticipated to exceed USD 12 billion by 2023, which represents growth of about 24% CAGR from 2016 to 2023. Biotricity Inc. (OTC: BTCY), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Fitbit Inc. (NYSE: FIT), GoPro Inc. (NASDAQ: GPRO), Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ: GRMN). A rising demand for sophisticated devices, combined with innovative features is what expected to drive demand. Also according to the research electronic wearable medical devices that offer monitoring solutions on numerous health parameters such as glucose, blood sugar, chronic diseases, namely diabetes and heart diseases are expected to be a sector with major developments. Biotricity Inc. (OTCQB: BTCY) is a medical technology company committed to improving healthcare by developing solutions that aid chronic disease prevention and management. The company's flagship wearable medical device, Bioflux, is an ECG monitoring system that will be prescribed by physicians to diagnose and remotely monitor cardiac patients.  Biotricity Inc. recently announced that Bioflux received the necessary 501k clearance from the Food & Drug Administration (FDA). Soon after the company announced that it has appointed Dr. Rony Shimony to its Board of Advisors (BOA). Shimony is an internationally recognized clinical cardiologist who brings to the company over twenty-five years of experience in cardiac patient care and related technology. President and CEO of Biotricity Inc. Waqaas Al-Siddiq, "We look forward to leveraging Dr. Shimony's clinical and diagnostic expertise to help drive the adoption of our next-generation medical-grade wearables in mainstream healthcare practices… As heart disease remains the #1 killer globally, representing 31 percent of all deaths worldwide, we are thrilled to have Dr. Shimony bring his expertise to our advisory board where he will collaborate with other talented and accomplished members to help drive our strategic vision of evolving the healthcare industry." Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has given hints that the company will soon enter into a rewarding business such as healthcare by next year. Tim Cook is looking for life further than the iWatch. In Taiwan's Economic Daily News, it said that Apple will celebrate its tenth year anniversary of the iPhone with a wearable device that will "accurately collect users' personal daily life including heart rate, pulse, blood sugar changes and other information." A report from Market Data Forecast suggests the medical devices market value will reach $11.2 billion by 2020. Apple isn't the only company keeping an eye on the healthcare industry. Sales of more traditional wearable devices ranging from fitness trackers to wearable camera, for example Fitbit Inc. (NYSE: FIT) along with GoPro Inc. (NASDAQ: GPRO) are declining. Currently, Fitbit has closely affiliated themselves with researchers carrying out clinical trials. Alongside with research platform Fitabase, they have been shifting the way medical research is being conducted with well-known Universities such as Johns Hopkins and the Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center among those who have chosen to tap into data from Fitbit users around the world. "Historically, measuring participants' activity, sleep, and heart rate data over significant periods of time has been logistically difficult to collect and costly to measure," said Aaron Coleman, CEO of Fitabase. There's no shortage of fitness trackers in our current market. Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ: GRMN) launched Vivosmart HR+ with substantial upgrades on the original. The fitness wearable device includes a heart rate sensor with built-in GPS, meaning it's a runner's best friend. Like any normal GPS watch, the HR+ tracks pace, distance, calories and time. It could only display one metric at a time. Other notable features consist of smart notifications and daily activity tracking. Subscribe Now!

November 8 AAPL: 111.06 0.65 Review: Fitbit Alta is a minimalist $130 alternative to the Apple Watch, with multi-day battery life Ben Lovejoy - 6 days ago @benlovejoy Apple Watch Fitbit View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit As regular readers will know, I’ve become a complete convert to the Apple Watch. But the Watch isn’t for everyone: it’s relatively expensive, fairly chunky and for most users has one-day battery-life. I’ve been trying the Fitbit Alta for the past week, and while I’ll personally be sticking to my Apple Watch, I do think it could be a decent option for those with more limited needs and/or budgets … Fitbit made its name with fairly simple fitness bands, which measured activity levels and then used those to do some sums to calculate things like calories burned, total exercise time and so on. The Alta, however, is effectively a cut-down smartwatch. You don’t get apps or Apple Pay, but it supplements the fitness stuff with notifications of calls, text messages and calendar appointments from your iPhone. Finally, multi-day battery-life means that you can also use it for sleep-tracking. Look & feel While the Alta is roughly the same thickness as an Apple Watch, it’s very much sleeker in appearance. The device itself measures a little under 4cm across by just over 1cm wide, and the narrow band is the same width. All-in-all, it has a very discreet appearance. I would say it’s more female-oriented. When the display is off, the black model I tested looks something like a bangle, but it doesn’t actually look out-of-place on a male wrist. With a keen fashion focus, there are almost as many band options as there are for the Apple Watch – except Fitbit gives you a huge choice of watch colors too. Again, like the Watch, bands are easily swappable if you want to change your look. The display is a crisp, mono OLED one. The very narrow screen means there isn’t room to display much information at a time – of which more in a moment – but it’s easy to read and does the job. However, it doesn’t deliver Apple Watch-style at-a-glance summaries, so the app is a better place to go to review data. The band is comfortable to wear, and the device is light – I quickly forgot I was wearing it. In use The display is not touch-sensitive. Like the Apple Watch, it switches on when you turn your wrist toward you, and it is roughly as sensitive to this gesture as the Watch. You can also double-tap it to wake it: as I say, it doesn’t detect your touch, but instead uses an accelerometer to detect the taps. One small niggle is that these have to be pretty firm taps to be registered. One UI drawback that is forced on the device by its very discreet form-factor is that the display is – with your wrist turned to face you – very thin and tall. Most information is sensibly displayed vertically, so that you can easily read it, but it does make for quite inefficient use of the screen space. The initial display is the time. You can set it to display the time vertically or horizontally; I opted for vertically, where it displays the two-digit hour above the two-digit minutes (you can customize this with date, seconds and graphics). This is shown here in one of Fitbit’s … less subtle color combos. Tap it firmly once to advance to the next screen. There are five screens, displaying in turn time of day, steps walked, distance walked, calories burned and minutes of exercise. For longer messages – like calendar appointments and text messages – they display horizontally, using a ticker-tape format, scrolling past you. That’s obviously a lot less convenient than on an Apple Watch, where multiple lines of text can be displayed on one screen, but it’s the trade-off of the form-factor – and it does work better than I expected. Just like the Apple Watch, you get taps on the wrist for alerts, and these feel very similar on both devices. One thing the Apple Watch can do with third-party apps, but I’ve never used, is sleep-tracking. The main reason I’ve never done this is battery-life: the Watch can’t make it through a day, a night and a second day. The Fitbit Alta, however, can. Fitbit says the battery-life is up to five days. In my usage, it actually delivered the claimed maximum – though that may well be because when I got simultaneous alerts on both devices, I mostly checked my Watch rather than the Fitbit. Sleep-tracking is interesting to see. It’s not super-accurate, in that it can’t reliably tell whether you are asleep or just resting in bed, but if you treat both ‘restless’ and ‘awake/restless’ as interchangeable, it does give a reasonable steer to your sleep quality. Again, like the Watch, you can set a silent vibrating alarm to wake you without disturbing your partner. The one time I tested it, it did wake me, which surprised me as I normally set alarms to ‘wake the dead’ volumes to be sure they’ll do the trick. Pricing and conclusions Fitbit Alta starts at $129.95 for the standard color combinations. There are some more expensive special edition color combos at $149.95. If you want to get fancier, you can buy leather bands for $59.95 and metal ones for $129.95 – with some others even pricier – so it would be possible to spend more on an Alta than on an Apple Watch. But the $130 one does the job perfectly well. I wasn’t actually intending to review the product – Fitbit sent me one so I could see whether I thought it was worth including in a holiday gift guide. But I was sufficiently impressed by what it did for the price that I felt it merited a review. As I said at the outset, I won’t be swapping my Apple Watch for a Fitbit, but if you want to dip a toe into the smartwatch waters for an affordable price, or would gladly swap functionality for multi-day battery-life with sleep-tracking, the Alta is well worth a look. The Fitbit Alta is available from Amazon, where you can also find third-party bands.

News Reviews Tech Tips Galleries Buying Guides Videos Talking Points SEARCH HOT GADGETS Samsung Galaxy Note 7 iPhone 7 Google Pixel Moto G4 Play Redmi 3S Prime Mi Max LeEco Le 2 HTC 10 gets big price cut, now available for Rs 47,990 Sony announces A6500 and RX100 V with upgraded AF system Google will provide Android updates to Pixel phones for 2 years Oculus launches Touch controllers, Rift will now work on cheaper PCs Home > Technology > Google Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus: A choice between smart and dependable Javed Anwer   |   @brijwaasi Last Updated: NOV 08, 2016 New Delhi Email Author For anyone looking to get a high-end phone, this must be the key question: between the Apple iPhone 7 Plus and the Google Pixel XL, which one is a better purchase? The price of the two phones is similar. The Google Pixel XL costs Rs 67,000 while the iPhone 7 Plus sells at Rs 72,000. This is for the 32GB models of the two phones. If you opt for the version with more internal storage, that will costs more. So, the price difference between the two phones is Rs 5,000. But frankly it is not that much in the ultra-premium segment. Rs 5,000 is less than 10 per cent of the price of the Pixel XL as well as the iPhone 7 Plus. Anyone willing to spend Rs 67,000 can also easily spend another Rs 5,000 if it makes sense. And it does make sense. In many cases. And yet, it doesn't. Here is how I can break it down, to keep it all simple. And this is based on my experience with these two phones for over two weeks. Reasons to buy the iPhone 7 Plus 1- This is the best iPhone ever, although the iPhone 7 has a better and more compact design. But the iPhone 7 Plus is built like a tank and its finishing is absolutely premium. In terms of build quality, it is definitely better than the Google Pixel XL. Although, the Pixel XL fits in hands better and is comparatively easier to use with one hand. Did I say that the iPhone 7 Plus is the best iPhone ever? So if you are an iPhone fan - if you use an iPhone and are satisfied with it -- go for it instead of the Google Pixel XL. Also Read: 5 reasons why Google Pixel XL can be the best phone for you 2- The performance of the iPhone 7 Plus is more reliable. Although, it has animations that seem to drag on, even if they are slick. But once you get used to those animations and understand that unlike Android where stuff happens in a snap even if there is some lag here and there, the iPhone animations are look slower. But the performance itself is good and reliable. Games not only look great but also run smoothly. Similarly, scrolling through web pages and switching between open apps is all very smooth. There is no jerkiness. More significantly, this is the kind of performance, you can expect from the iPhone 7 Plus even after one year of use. At least that has been the track record of Apple with other iPhones and I don't see any reason for a change with the iPhone 7 Plus. 3- The Portrait Mode on the iPhone 7 Plus is absolutely fantastic, even if technically the Pixel XL camera is superior to the iPhone 7 Plus main camera. With this mode you get the closer to the subject and you get really nice blurred background. Also, the iPhone 7 Plus camera seems more sure of a scene when it clicks photo. This means accurate exposure almost all the time and accurate white balance compared to what Pixel manages. It gives great results with minimum fuss. Also Read: Google Pixel could have beaten iPhone 7 but 3 reasons why it can't 4- The video shooting on the iPhone 7 Plus is class leading and better than what Pixel XL can manage. 5- Apple has a tendency to support the iPhones for four years with software updates. This kind of makes the iPhone 7 Plus Mr Dependable. You buy it ones, Apple then takes care of it for years. 6- Apple iPhone 7 Plus has a screen that shows more accurate colours. And it has a wider colour gamut, which not all will appreciate but those who have finer -- and more subtle -- taste in colours will find very pleasing. 7- The iPhone 7 Plus has better speakers, partly because it has stereo speakers. But stereo or no stereo, the iPhone 7 Plus sounds fairly sweet for a phone. 9- The iPhone 7 Plus is water and dust-proof. Kind of big deal, and particularly so if you are often clumsy with your phone. But again, this is one factor where it all depends on how much weightage you give to this feature. 10- The iPhone 7 Plus has a better selfie camera Reasons to buy Google Pixel 1- Compared to the iPhone 7 Plus, the Pixel XL is just more smart. The Android Nougat aka Android 7.1, in terms of functionality and features, is a better operating system than the iOS. It is easier and quicker to do things with the Android, whether we are talking about the web browsing or just editing a photo in an app like Snapseed before sharing it on Facebook. Also, Android is more flexible and that makes it feel more versatile. You can set what apps open which content. You can access content at a file level. You can copy-paste stuff across apps. You can share stuff between apps with an ease that is not there on the iOS. The notification system is better and the notifications you get don't crowd your phone's lockscreen the way they do on the iPhone. The list goes onâ€¦ Android is definitely better. 2- Google apps and services are great on Pixel XL. The whole Gmail, Maps, and Google Now experience is better on the Pixel XL. This is particularly true for India, where Apple Maps is not good and where the Google Assistant is more useful than Siri because it understands the Indian accents so well. If you use Google services a lot, the Pixel XL is a better phone for you. 3- If you are into absolute image quality and often edit your photos, even the photos shot with the phone, get the Pixel XL. Also, the Pixel XL is a superior camera compared to the iPhone 7 Plus in low light. It captures amazing HD photos with dynamic light. 4- If you like your phone's screen full of contrast and punchy colours, you will like the Pixel screen. 5- If you already use a Nexus phone and like it, you will definitely love the Pixel XL. And chances are you won't like the iPhone 7 Plus. So go for Google's phone. 6- If you want a phone that is easier to use with single hand, go for the Pixel XL. Although both the iPhone 7 Plus and the Pixel XL are phones with 5.5-inch screen. 7- If have a set of earphones that you use interchangeably - different in office, different at home, different in gym - go for the Pixel XL. On the iPhone 7 Plus, you will have to carry an adapter. A few other things to note -- Although Google may not offer the 4 years of software updates to Pixel XL - or maybe it will, who knows  -- it is promising two years of official software update. For many users that may be enough. Also Read: Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus vs DSLR cam: You can't tell the difference -- The battery life of both the phones is similar. It is around 14 to 16 hours with fairly heavy use, where you are on the phone and internet almost all the time. In terms of charging speed, the Pixel XL is slightly faster but none are as fast as the OnePlus 3 with its Dash charger. Also Read: Google Pixel XL vs OnePlus 3: It's closer than it should be -- Neither the iPhone 7 Plus, nor the Pixel XL offer support for microSD card or dual SIM. Although Pixel XL comes with unlimited (full-resolution) photo backup. So you can always move your photos to Google servers and free up space on the phone. -- Apple has a proven record of good aftersales service. Google is yet to prove itself on this matter. The Pixel XL and the Pixel are the company's first phones. -- Whether you hope to buy the Pixel XL or the iPhone 7 Plus, finding one in stock may prove a bit cumbersome. These phones are on low stock right now. -- Finally, if I am buying I will get the Pixel XL because I like the way Android does things and I don't mind editing the images that the Pixel XL clicks. It's just that I am so much faster when I am using good Android software. The keyboard. The notifications. The way web pages scroll. The way information can be moved between apps. All of this helps me work faster. But at the same time, if one of my less tech-savvy friend is asking for a phone, I will recommend the iPhone 7 Plus. It's just more reliable. Lastly, let me add that both the Pixel XL and the iPhone 7 Plus are good phones. But whether they are great or not depends on what you are seeking in your next phone. The reasons to pick the iPhone 7 Plus or the Pixel XL are listed here. Now choose wisely. Also Read: iPhone 7 Plus camera can surpass a DSLR camera.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) featured Apple double downs on running with Nike-edition smartwatch By ANICK JESDANUN AP Technology Writer Nov 8, 2016 0 Mark Lennihan This Thursday, Oct. 27, 2016, photo shows the Apple Watch Nike Plus on display, in New York. Apple isn't the first to add GPS functionality to a smartwatch, but it's the first to make something that feels like a running watch. And the company is doubling down on that with a Nike edition out Friday, Oct. 28. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) NEW YORK — Apple isn't the first to add GPS functionality to a smartwatch, but it's the first to make something that feels like a running watch. And the company is doubling down on that with a Nike edition out Friday, while Nike is bringing features from its phone app directly to all models of Apple Watch. I've found devices without GPS typically awful at measuring how fast and how far I'm running. And those with GPS typically do little more than measure how fast and how far I'm running. The basics are great for casual runners, but anyone who becomes a serious runner needs much more. I've logged more than 400 miles over the past six weeks with the GPS edition of Apple Watch, known as Series 2. I've also run 34 miles with the Nike Plus version over the past few days; it's essentially a Series 2 watch with a custom wristband and watch face. With both, Apple addressed many of the shortcomings in the original watch, GPS being just one of them. I'm not ready to ditch my Garmin running watch yet, but the Apple Watch comes close to meeting all my needs. ___ THE IMPORTANCE OF GPS The original watch does a fine job of latching onto your phone's GPS if you're running with the phone, but with built-in GPS, you can leave the phone behind. Accuracy is on par with other good GPS watches, which is to say, measurements are sometimes off, especially when tall buildings block GPS signals. The watch automatically calibrates to my running style, so it's better than non-GPS devices even when there's no GPS. Though GPS drains the battery more quickly, the watch still had about an hour of non-GPS use left after a marathon run of about four hours, 40 minutes. For normal use, Apple says you should get up to 90 minutes a day of GPS workouts; I've often gone longer without the watch dying before bedtime. It helps that I've disabled the heart-rate sensor during workouts. While Series 2 is meant for stand-alone running, many people carry phones anyway. With it, I get slightly better accuracy and battery life. ___ IMPROVEMENTS FOR ALL Series 2 watches start at $369, though it's $30 more for a larger screen — the optimal size for larger wrists. Non-GPS models, now called Series 1, are $100 less. All models get software updates that address two gripes with the original: — Apple's Workout app now records your route, something other GPS fitness devices and apps have long done. The Apple app didn't use to, even with access to the phone's GPS. — You can double tap the screen to record splits, or manual snapshots of how long it takes to run a stretch. Before, that was limited to mile or kilometer intervals, which didn't help when you were running laps or loops that weren't precisely that length. ___ NIKE EXTRAS Nike's app offers a lot to like, including big yellow numerals for easy reading during runs and voice updates every mile and halfway toward your goal. Nike keeps things simple for beginners by displaying just distance and time; turn on advanced mode for current pace and heart rate. My gripes: no manual splits, and average pace appears only when pausing or through the voice updates. Nike excels in trying to motivate you even when you're not running. It will keep asking "Are we running today?" by reminding you the weather is nice or that a friend (with a watch or just the phone app) is just ahead of you for the month's total. A scheduling feature shows you weather forecasts in half-hour increments. After making a selection, you get a notification when it's time to run. Though the app is available for all models, the Nike watch also has a colorful wristband sporting holes to help sweat dry. It offers custom watch faces with one-touch access to the app, plus a reminder of your next scheduled run. Most people will be fine with just the free app, but running enthusiasts can get the Nike version for the same price. ___ BEYOND RUNNING Cyclists get similar speed and distance information, though the watch doesn't measure how fast you're pedaling, something hard-core cyclists might want. You can swim with Series 2, even with chlorinated or salt water, something most water-resistant gadgets don't allow. The watch measures distance indoors by counting laps, though you need a pool large enough for at least five strokes per lap. ___ WHAT'S STILL MISSING Recording splits during runs is great, but I also want to know my average pace and time since the last split, rather than the beginning of the run. I find it useful when I want to go faster in the middle of a run before a gentle cooldown. And while Apple Watch syncs workout data with the phone's Activity app, many long-time runners already have their favorite online repository, whether that's Nike, Strava or Garmin. The ability to move data around is limited. While Nike offers an Apple Watch app, it'll take time for others to catch up. Strava's still requires running with a phone, while Garmin doesn't have one at all. For these reasons, I'm sticking with my Garmin Forerunner 220. And while it's a minor annoyance, both Apple's and Nike's app do a three-second countdown before workouts. I just want to run when I hit "start." (At least with Nike's, you can disable the countdown deep in the phone settings.) ___ DO YOU NEED APPLE WATCH? Because this review is focused on runners' needs, I haven't gotten into all the other features, such as maps, weather and shopping. Running watches and general-purpose fitness trackers such as Fitbit don't offer as much. The ability to reply to messages by voice came in handy when coordinating with friends waiting at the finish line, for instance. But if you don't need the "smarts," a decent GPS fitness device is more than $100 cheaper. × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

The Federal Reserve is all talk and no action in regards to higher interest rates, and the 10-year Treasury note continues to yield around a paltry 1.8%. And while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.01%   is still in the green year-to-date, for all the ups and downs, it is basically flat with where it was back in February 2015. One safe haven amid all this mess has been the reliable growth and durability of the tech sector. But lately, even some of the big names in technology have seen trouble — including a few rather shaky earnings reports in the past week or two. So are once-mighty tech names about to roll over and disappoint like the rest of the market? Or should investors see the comparatively modest pullback in these picks as a buying opportunity? As with so many things in this market, the answer isn’t black or white. The truth is that while there are a lot of opportunities in tech, investors need to be discerning and take a more tactical approach to the sector right now than simply buying every megacap corporation with a Silicon Valley footprint. Will machines take over package deliveries?(2:09) Technology has already automated much of the sorting of packages, but delivery is still done by humans. Could machines take over the deliveries industry? Here’s a look at five of the biggest names in tech, ranked from worst to best: In last place: Amazon Look, the “worst” tech stock is still pretty good — and honestly, I expect big things from Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -2.70%   long term. But it’s undeniable that this stock got a bit ahead of itself this year during the frenzy over Amazon Web Services’ performance, and now it may underperform for some time. At the end of October, Amazon missed profit expectations by a big margin — a huge letdown after reports in March and June showed a glimmer of what a consistently profitable Amazon could look like. I don’t knock Jeff Bezos & Co. for keeping an eye on the long term instead of managing quarter to quarter, but tactical investors should take notice of this, particularly after shares raced up from a low of under $300 in 2015 to a recent high of over $850 about a month ago. This is a company with high hopes that is priced for perfection. And while AWS continues to grow impressively on the top line, it’s undeniable that Wall Street is looking for a higher level of profitability after Amazon showed the promise of this cloud arm. It’s always hard to make the valuation argument against Amazon. However, I think the script has been changed thanks to AWS, and profitability will remain a focus of investors — but not necessarily Jeff Bezos. That may create a lot of volatility and headwinds as we enter 2017. The also-ran: Alphabet Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -2.38% GOOGL, -2.40%   may not be in danger of a decline the same way Amazon is, but it’s hard to argue that this one-time king of the internet holds as much promise as it did in years past. It has been stuck in a rut since the end of 2015, and will likely stay there for some time. Sure, Alphabet earnings for the third quarter were actually pretty darn good. Earnings hit $9.06 a share and adjusted revenue was $18.27 billion, both topping expectations. But investors weren’t thrilled with the results, and shares have steadily declined since briefly touching a 52-week high just before the report dropped. What can artificial intelligence do for retail?(2:34) Customers return about 23% of their purchases both in-store and online, costing retailers $643 billion per year. Can artificial intelligence eliminate returns through virtual 3D try-on? That’s because internet advertising stinks, quite frankly. And while the tech giant did manage to report higher revenue and narrower losses in its “other bets” segment, the Google segment continues to drive the train, with $22.25 billion of the $22.45 billion in total revenue reported. The Google segment is hardly dead, with 20% revenue growth year-over-year and 17% operating income growth. However, what’s discouraging to investors is the fact that related costs of revenue are rising, too. Like Amazon, big things surely will come from Alphabet long term. But in the here and now, there simply isn’t a lot of growth — and as we’ve seen in prior years, that could mean underperformance from this tech giant as it struggles to change a lackluster narrative in the short term. Winner of the participation prize: Apple Apple Inc. AAPL, -2.51%   has been mighty choppy in 2016, as have many tech names, and there’s reason to expect that to continue. However, on balance, I think Apple should pretty much follow the market in the next several months, making it a ho-hum pick. In some ways, this is because Apple very much is the market given its $590 billion or so in market value, it’s the largest pick on this list and thus an outsize share of cap-weighted indexes like the S&P 500 SPY, +0.08%    and Nasdaq-100 NDX, -1.05%  . But it’s also because the company is hard to pin down. Some bullish investors focus on Apple’s dividend that yields better than T-notes, its bargain forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11 or so and a massive war chest of around $240 billion in cash and investments. Some bearish investors focus on an overreliance on the iPhone as a share of revenue, and the fact that growth in this segment is seriously challenged both now and in the future. Is Apple supposed to be a growth stock or a value stock? Is it a tech disrupter of more of a 21st-century consumer staples company? Is that $240 billion ever going to be repatriated or put to real use? There are so many competing arguments with Apple that it’s impossible to know where it’s headed. That makes me think it’s doomed to middle along with the rest of the market in 2017 until the narrative changes in some substantive way. The runner-up: Netflix If it wasn’t for the nosebleed forward P/E ratio of over 100, Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.22%   would be my top pick in tech. But after squeezing out the shorts in a big way after its third-quarter numbers, investors can still have confidence that this streaming-video giant will move higher in the months ahead. Keep in mind, for starters, that the surge in Netflix stock lately has brought it back in line with previous highs touched in both mid-2015 and late 2015. And since then, the company has been adding subscribers and programming like mad. In the most recent quarter, Netflix added 370,000 subscribers in the U.S., topping estimates despite increasing its subscription price for longtime customers from $7.99 to $9.99 earlier this year. That stickiness in the face of higher prices is a great sign. Furthermore, the growth story here continues to be overseas growth as 40% of streaming revenue now comes from international customers. Can robo advisers manage your money and emotions?(2:41) In investing, giving in to your emotions can cut your return by about 1.56 percentage points a year. Should you leave the job to an emotionless robo adviser instead? Netflix continues to prove the naysayers wrong with loyal users, award-winning programming and an aggressive growth plan that continues to grow its share even in the face of significant competition. The bears got a wake-up call after earnings, and I think the shift in sentiment will continue as Wall Street once again falls in love with the company’s growth story in the coming months. Best in Show: Facebook Facebook Inc. FB, -3.31%  was dinged after its third-quarter earnings report just a few days ago. But investors should see this dip as a rare opportunity to buy in, because longer-term, FB stock seems to do nothing but go up. Remember, even accounting for the modest recent decline, the stock is up over 230% since its 2012 initial public offering — almost four times the return of the S&P 500 in the same period. And in the past 12 months, Facebook has climbed 25% while the S&P has pretty much gone nowhere. Many investors think the stock is too pricey or too hyped, but that’s how momentum stocks work — particularly in tech, and particularly when you’re a company like Facebook that is wildly profitable and full of future potential. But the forward P/E of the market in general is about 18 right now for the S&P 500 as a group and the forward P/E of Facebook is now just 23. That hardly seems outrageous considering the scale and consistent growth of this tech giant compared with your average consumer staples stock or retailer! Besides, that growth premium is called for. In its third-quarter report, Facebook earned $1.09 per share on revenues of $7.01 billion, up 56% year-over-year. Both figures topped Street consensus views for 97 cents per share and revenues of $6.92 billion. The company beat its monthly average user forecasts to boot, boasting an amazing 1.79 million monthly users. Sure, the outlook could have been better. But no stock goes up in a straight line forever, even Facebook, and this brief pullback should be seen as a buying opportunity before the rally resumes in earnest.

This year the companies have two phones that are competing in the market for dominance. The Google has the Pixel (and Pixel XL) while Apple has the iPhone 7 (and the iPhone 7 Plus). The iPhone 7 was launched before the Pixel, and it is an evolution of Apple's iPhone 6S. It is also the stepping stone to Apple's iPhone 8, which is expected to be "revolutionary" and not evolutionary. The Pixel, meanwhile, is Google's "first" phone and one of the biggest aims that Google has with it is to beat the iPhone. Well, Google almost succeeds. The Google Pixel is a good phone. Nay, it's a great phone and in many core areas is better than the iPhone 7. And yet there are three reasons that hold it back from beating the mighty iPhone. Maybe next year the Pixel will raise the bar and get its act together to beat the iPhone. But then the iPhone 8 too will be in a different league. But this year in 2017, it falls somewhat short, all because of three reasons. Also read: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus review: The best iPhones Apple has made No waterproof body: This is kind of a big deal in a premium phone nowadays. And although people may think that a waterproof body is not something of a must have feature, take a look at it this way: It's like seatbelts in the cars. You don't know you need them until one day they save your life. The same is true for a waterproof phone. You don't realise you need it until one day accidentally you drop your phone in a bucket full of water. Also, a waterproof phone provides such incredible peace of mind. You can use it with wet hands and be a little careless about it in ways that truly make using the phone relaxing. No stereo speakers: This again is a big missing feature in Google Pixel. In fact, its speakers aren't all that good for a premium phone. The iPhone 7 on the other hand has fairly sweet sounding (for a phone) stereo speakers. Even otherwise the audio performance on the iPhone 7 is better, even if you are using an earphone or headphone. And this is despite the hassle that the iPhone 7 poses because of its lack of the 3.5mm jack. Exemplary Apple support: This is the biggest reason nowadays to buy an iPhone. If you are getting the latest iPhone, in this case that is the iPhone 7 Plus, you end up with a phone that you can, if you are little careful in the way you use the phone, end up using for 3 to 4 years despite any hassles. The phone won't slow down. You will continue getting the latest iOS updates. And if something goes wrong with your phone, you will most probably get an aftersales service that is better than the rest. We have seen it again and again that Apple supports an iPhone for 4 years. The Pixel, meanwhile, will be supported for 2 years and while Google is promising top aftersales support for the Pixel phones, we will need to see the company walk the talk on this aspect before we can see whether it matches the Apple support or not. Now, this is not to say that the Pixel is a phone that you should not buy. Far from it. In fact, we have argued that for a lot of consumers the Pixel and the Pixel XL are the best phones in the market. These two phones have the best camera every seen in a phone  and in many core areas, including the software, they edge out the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 7. But like everything else out there, these two phones are also not perfect.  Also read: Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus vs DSLR cam: You can't tell the difference For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @IndiaTodayTech and on Facebook at facebook.com/indiatodaytech For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in.ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.   Most Read Slow Jio 4G speed: Here's a method to increase Jio speed but why bother WhatsApp now rolls out video calling feature, for now in beta Jio 4G may remain free until March 2017: Report 32 lakh ATM cards hacked: Is your debit card safe and should you change PIN?

Apple didn't officially acquire the company, notes TechCrunch. The founder of Omnifone will be starting a new music venture called Electric Jukebox. For more on this see the full TechCrunch report here.   What's interesting about this news is that it fills in some of the blanks regarding Neil Young's return to Apple Music last week. It was noted in Iast week's report titled "Neil Young is Eating Crow as his Music Catalog Returns to Apple Music," that Omnifone was Neil Young's music business partner.   With Young returning to Apple Music, Young's Pono Music Store may not be returning from being "Under Construction." If Electric Jukebox was to work with Young, then Young wouldn't have likely returned to Apple Music. We'll see how this plays out for Young in the coming weeks ahead.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

In a disguised interview with The Action News 5 Investigators, a former Apple Genius technician said the iPhone 6 Plus started exhibiting screen malfunctions last summer. "They were coming in where their displays were flickering," the technician said under condition of anonymity. "The touch screen stopped responding," said Cordova's Sharon Masterson, as she demonstrated with her iPhone 6 Plus. She'd touch the screen, swipe the screen...nothing. "It's so aggravating." The whistle-blowing technician said the non-responsiveness and flickering are happening in multiple iPhone 6 Plus models. "It is not the display that's causing it," the technician said. "It's the actual main logic board that the display attaches to. Somewhere in there is actually causing that display to flicker." Computer repair trade blog Motherboard has coined the iPhone 6 Plus problem as the "touch disease." Motherboard explained -- and the Apple technician confirmed -- that the "touch IC" chips inside the phone, chips that convert finger touches and swipes into machine-readable phone functions, are losing their solder. They said the chips are detaching, losing their ability to detect touches on the display screens. "It is a manufacturing defect," said Thomas Bledsoe, owner and chief technician of iRepear in Bartlett, Tennessee. Bledsoe said his shop receives three to four complaints a day about the iPhone 6 Plus "touch disease."  "It has been an issue for a lot of customers," Bledsoe said. "I think the iPhone 6 Plus should be recalled under a certain criteria if it's functioning like that, not having the touch functionality." When Masterson took her iPhone 6 Plus to Apple Saddle Creek, 2031 West Street in Germantown, Tennessee, she said the technicians acknowledged the problem. But since her phone was beyond its warranty and since she did not carry the Apple Care extended warranty, she said they would only offer to replace her display screen at the standard repair rate. "About $300 plus tax," she said. "Again, it's not the display that's causing it," said the Apple whistle-blower. The technician also said Apple's standing order is to just replace the screen on a customer's iPhone 6 Plus if the customer has neither an active warranty nor Apple Care. "We would be replacing the displays, as per Apple, and we would have these customers coming back and back and back," the technician said. "It is an inherent defect. This has been happening since at least last summer." Apple's media staff ignored three emails and one voicemail message left on its media hotline. "It's not what they call a recall program at the moment," the technician said. "Other people were having this problem," Masterson said. "They did know what was wrong with (the iPhone 6 Plus), and they were just not telling the consumers." Bledsoe recommended until Apple corporately acknowledges the problem and either recalls or extends the warranty on the iPhone 6 Plus, consumers should: * CHECK YOUR WARRANTY. According to Apple's terms and conditions, the iPhone typically carries a one-year limited manufacturer's warranty. * CHECK YOUR APPLE CARE. That's Apple's extended warranty plan. If you have it, you may be entitled to a full replacement of your iPhone 6 Plus. * CHECK WITH YOUR PHONE SERVICE CARRIER. Your carrier may offer a replacement option.

Ben Lovejoy - 2 weeks ago @benlovejoy Feature MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit We’ve run three opinion pieces recently addressing Apple’s decision to remove all but USB-C ports from the new MacBook Pro – and each has attracted literally hundreds of comments. I started the ball rolling by arguing that while I do fully appreciate the pain involved in the transition, it’s a trade-off. Buying a few new cables or adapters today versus ending up with too few USB-C ports when the new standard has taken over a year or so down the line. That one generated more than 700 comments, many of them arguing that I was wrong and that Apple should have offered a mix of USB-A and -C ports, as well as retaining the SD slot … Jeff addressed the SD card issue in more detail, suggesting that we should be demanding that camera manufacturers add high-speed data transfer via USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt, and that Apple’s move will encourage this. Finally, Zac argued that while there are reasons to complain, USB-C is the future, and it’s not difficult to adapt to it by replacing a few cables. We’re currently at 1400 comments and counting across the three threads. The main counter-argument raised is that, while USB-C may be the future, it isn’t the present. Apple is adding to the cost of an already expensive new machine by forcing us to buy cables and adapters, which are also a pain to carry around. And SD cards may not be used in pro cameras, but it’s not uncommon for professionals to use prosumer cameras that do use SD cards. It’s clear from the heated debates that many have very strong feelings about this. What’s harder to judge is whether these feelings are held by an extremely vocal minority, or whether they in fact represent the majority view. So we’re running this poll to find out. We’re asking two questions. First, which of the ports in the older MacBook Pro do you currently use on a regular basis? Please also use the comments to let us know what kind of devices you currently attach to your MacBook Pro, and what you use them for. That will provide a broader appreciation of the issue. Second, do you view Apple’s decision as positive or negative, and how strongly do you feel about it? Is Apple right, that we’ll all be using USB-C ports within a year and it’s better to use all the available slots for the emerging standard? Is it a good thing, the decision helping push manufacturers toward faster adoption of a superior standard? Or is the company wrong, and we’ll still be using those older ports years from now? A bad thing because Apple is making its customers pay for a poor decision? I’d also note again that Disqus can sometimes struggle with very high comment volumes, so if you post something and can’t immediately see your comment, please check back later in the day.

November 3 AAPL: 109.83 -1.19 Apple’s R&D office in Cambridge, England, working on Siri – with VocalIQ employees Ben Lovejoy - 2 weeks ago @benlovejoy Siri View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit We learned two years ago that Apple was setting up an R&D center in Cambridge, England, to tap academic research expertise. Business Insider thinks it knows the focus of the work the team there is performing. Those working inside are aiming to make Siri talk more naturally, according to a source that knows a number of Apple’s Cambridge employees […] Apple’s Cambridge office is home to less than 30 people, including many of the employees from VocalIQ — a voice recognition startup that was spun out from the university and acquired by Apple in 2015. VocalIQ is a tool specifically geared to allowing truly conversational queries … With a British team, perhaps Siri will be honing its skills in speaking the Queen’s English, where we walk on the pavement and wear our pants inside our trousers … The team may be a relatively small one, but BI’s source says that there is plenty of room for expansion within the center. Apple has a number of satellite R&D centers around the world, including another one focused on Siri across the Atlantic in Boston. That, too, was likely aimed at attracting academic expertise, from MIT. There’s of course intense competition in the field of intelligent assistants. Google upped the ante considerably with the launch of Google Assistant on the Pixel, though Siri does seem to hold its own in head-to-head tests. Much of the original team responsible for the development of Siri have left Apple to work on their own next-generation IA, Viv. Its creators recently gave an impressive demonstration of Viv’s capabilities, since acquired by Samsung – which adds to the pressure on Apple to improve Siri.

Might Be Preparing Jet White iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Finishes The iPhone might get a fresh new coat of paint very soon. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 7, 2016 at 6:27PM Per a report from Japanese publication Mac Otakara (via MacRumors), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is planning to offer customers another color option for potential iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus buyers: jet white. Presumably, this would be a white phone with the same glossy finish as the jet black iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models (along with a white face, similar to those found on the silver, gold, and rose gold models). Image source: Apple.  Mac Otakara doesn't seem that confident in this report, though, as it cautioned that "this information may be unreliable." Let's take a closer look at whether or not this rumor makes sense. Apple's onto something with glossy iPhone finishes There is a reason that smartphone makers care about building attractive-looking devices: People are likely much more willing -- whether they're aware of it or not -- to buy a device that looks sleek and appealing than they are to buy a device that looks ho-hum. Given how popular the iPhone models in jet black seem to be (KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo said that 30% to 35% of iPhone pre-orders worldwide, and almost 50% of iPhone pre-orders in China, were for jet black models), it's clear that customers are attracted to that finish. If customers like the jet black finish, then it's reasonable to assume that there might be customers who would like glossy iPhone models in other colors -- like white. Such a device could certainly be attractive to customers who would have otherwise gone with, say, an iPhone in silver. Mid-cycle jet white iPhone release makes sense Per Kuo, manufacturing yields on the glossy finish used on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models in Jet Black initially weren't great, coming in between 60% and 70%. That relatively low yield rate may have been one reason Apple didn't apply the glossy finish to additional iPhone models. However, as Apple and its manufacturing partners have gotten better at building phones with this finish, yield rates have likely improved. If manufacturing yields have improved on Apple's process to produce the glossy finish, and since demand for iPhone models in jet black appears to be strong, then a mid-cycle jet white iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus release would make sense. Here are a few reasons why. First, Apple is likely to limit the jet white finish to more expensive 128 gigabyte and 256 gigabyte configurations just as it does with the jet black models in order to encourage up-selling. For example, a potential customer who might have otherwise gone with a 32 gigabyte iPhone 7 Plus in silver might instead opt to go with an iPhone 7 Plus in a 128 gigabyte configuration in order to get the new jet white finish. This could help to further bolster Apple's iPhone average selling prices (and thus revenue and profits). Second, an attractive new finish may simply help to boost demand. There might be users of older-generation iPhone models who are on the fence about upgrading to new models. An attractive jet white model could be what pushes some of those customers over the edge. The potential impact from a mid-cycle jet white iPhone release likely wouldn't be a game changer for Apple, but it could be a low-risk/high-reward way for the company to try to both juice iPhone average selling prices and boost demand for iPhones during the current fiscal year.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Limited tables left for eSports Industry Awards ... Apple might be slowing down, but the Smartwatch market is booming by Jonathan Easton Friday, November 4th 2016 at 10:01AM Print this page Email Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Google Share on LinkedIn Smartwatch shipments have risen 60 per cent year-on-year, new research has revealed. Analyst firm Canalys has found that shipments of smartwatch devices rose reached 6.1 million shipments between the third quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2016. The Apple Watch is the top seller with 46 per cent of shipments. Samsung (18 per cent), Fitbit (17 per cent), Garmin (three per cent) and Pebble (two per cent) make up the other companies in the top five.  The biggest area of curiosity here is the stark contrast between this report and that of rival analyst IDC that was released last month. IDC claimed that shipments plummeted by 50 per cent over this same period, falling year-on-year from 5.6 million to 2.7 million. IDC agreed that Apple dominated the market – with a 41 per cent share as opposed to Canalys' 46. Interestingly, IDC has Garmin as being in second place with a 21 per cent market share while Canalys believes the company only has a three per cent share. Advertisement The conclusions drawn by the two analysts are also contrasting as well.  IDC used its data to state that smartwatches "are not for everyone", but Canalys say it's too early to tell and will hold off on making a judgement until the next quarter. This is because it believes that the holiday season and the impact of the second-generation Apple Watch will be two indicators as to the current health and immediate future of the market. Canalys analyst Daniel Matte said: "Fourth quarter performance will be key to better assessing the long-term prospects of the improved Watch models." “The iPhone’s slowing momentum has affected consumer interest in Apple’s smart watch and the company needs to improve Watch sales in major markets outside of the US, especially China," said Canalys' Jason Low. The analyst also pointed out that China's market grew 42 per cent year-on-year, in spite of delays to Google's Android Wear 2.0 platform and Samsung's Gear S3. Lower cost options such as those from Xiaomi parthner Huami, are seen as important in growing the Chinese market. The same report states that basic fitness band shipments grew 17 per cent quarter-on-quarter, hitting 11.5 million.  “Together with smart watches, total wearable band shipments reached 17.6 million, signifying healthy year-on-year growth of 31 percent for the overall wearables market," the firm said.  Tags: Apple, Lenovo, Samsung, idc, canalys, garmin, fitbit, smartwatch, Pebble, Smartwatches, Apple Watch Follow us on Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Might Be Preparing Jet White iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Finishes The iPhone might get a fresh new coat of paint very soon. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 7, 2016 at 6:27PM Per a report from Japanese publication Mac Otakara (via MacRumors), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is planning to offer customers another color option for potential iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus buyers: jet white. Presumably, this would be a white phone with the same glossy finish as the jet black iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models (along with a white face, similar to those found on the silver, gold, and rose gold models). Image source: Apple.  Mac Otakara doesn't seem that confident in this report, though, as it cautioned that "this information may be unreliable." Let's take a closer look at whether or not this rumor makes sense. Apple's onto something with glossy iPhone finishes There is a reason that smartphone makers care about building attractive-looking devices: People are likely much more willing -- whether they're aware of it or not -- to buy a device that looks sleek and appealing than they are to buy a device that looks ho-hum. Given how popular the iPhone models in jet black seem to be (KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo said that 30% to 35% of iPhone pre-orders worldwide, and almost 50% of iPhone pre-orders in China, were for jet black models), it's clear that customers are attracted to that finish. If customers like the jet black finish, then it's reasonable to assume that there might be customers who would like glossy iPhone models in other colors -- like white. Such a device could certainly be attractive to customers who would have otherwise gone with, say, an iPhone in silver. Mid-cycle jet white iPhone release makes sense Per Kuo, manufacturing yields on the glossy finish used on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models in Jet Black initially weren't great, coming in between 60% and 70%. That relatively low yield rate may have been one reason Apple didn't apply the glossy finish to additional iPhone models. However, as Apple and its manufacturing partners have gotten better at building phones with this finish, yield rates have likely improved. If manufacturing yields have improved on Apple's process to produce the glossy finish, and since demand for iPhone models in jet black appears to be strong, then a mid-cycle jet white iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus release would make sense. Here are a few reasons why. First, Apple is likely to limit the jet white finish to more expensive 128 gigabyte and 256 gigabyte configurations just as it does with the jet black models in order to encourage up-selling. For example, a potential customer who might have otherwise gone with a 32 gigabyte iPhone 7 Plus in silver might instead opt to go with an iPhone 7 Plus in a 128 gigabyte configuration in order to get the new jet white finish. This could help to further bolster Apple's iPhone average selling prices (and thus revenue and profits). Second, an attractive new finish may simply help to boost demand. There might be users of older-generation iPhone models who are on the fence about upgrading to new models. An attractive jet white model could be what pushes some of those customers over the edge.

November 7 AAPL: 110.41 1.57 AT&T reportedly planning to offer DirecTV Now subscribers a free Apple TV Chance Miller - 1 week ago @ChanceHMiller Apple TV View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit In an effort to push its new DirecTV Now service, AT&T is preparing to offer customers a free Apple TV (or Fire TV stick) when they sign up, according to a new report form Variety. The report cites leaked customer support documents from AT&T, which were inadvertently published online today. According to today’s report, AT&T plans to offer customers a free Apple TV when they agree to subscribe to three months of paid service. Customers who pay for one month will receive a free Fire TV stick. Coming in at a base price of $35 per month, three months of service is cheaper for the user than buying an Apple TV as a standalone purchase, while one month is cheaper than purchasing a Fire TV stick. For those unfamiliar, DirecTV Now is AT&T’s new internet TV streaming service that will launch later this year, starting at $35 per month. All in all, the service sounds largely similar to the service that Apple has reportedly been attempting to launch for over a year now, but without success. DirecTV Now includes channels such as AT&T, CBS, ESPN, HBO, NBC, and over 100 others. Though, channel availability will vary depending on what price tier the user subscribe to. DirecTV Now will offer a 7-day free trial to test out the service, after which they will be downgraded to DirecTV Freeiew if they choose not to subscribe. Freeview is a free tier that’s ad supported and has limited channel availability. In order to qualify for the free Apple TV, customers must commit to three months of the paid service, though. In pushing the Apple TV and Fire TV stick, AT&T is ensuring that customers will have access to the DirecTV Now service via a set-top box, in addition to computers and smartphones. It’s a smart move to grow the streaming platform, though AT&T isn’t necessarily the first company to do so. It’s almost more interesting here that AT&T and DirecTV are launching a web TV streaming service at a reasonable price before Apple was able to successfully launch its own rumored service. Though, Apple would like you to think that this is the beauty of the tvOS App Store.   Guides Apple TV Apple TV is Apple's set-top box offering that allows users to stream content from services like Netflix, Hulu, and many more via the tvOS App Store.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Measure A campaign in Apple Valley potentially violated Fair Political Practices Commission regulations Monday Nov 7, 2016 at 3:51 PM Nov 7, 2016 at 4:11 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — The pro-campaign behind a tax designed to bolster fire services in the town may have violated election law by not filing financial disclosure documents after raising more than $15,000, the Daily Press has learned. Citizens Supporting Apple Valley Emergency Services - Support Measure A received $15,425 in campaign contributions and made expenditures totaling $15,415.20, according to unofficial documents provided by Jennifer Starbuck, the committee’s treasurer. Starbuck initially told the Daily Press last week she believed she did not have to file after reviewing a letter from Secretary of State Alex Padilla she received upon filing CSAVES’ Statement of Organization. “... Included (in the letter),” Starbuck said via email, “is the following statement (from Padilla), ‘Based on your Statement of Organization, your filing jurisdiction is at the city or county level. Since the Secretary of State is a state level filing officer, you will not ordinarily be required to file campaign disclosure statements with this office.’” Financial disclosures are required of all committees that receive contributions of $2,000 or more, according to the Fair Political Practices Commission. “I think my lack of experience with this position is the primary reason I'm confused,” Starbuck said Monday. “I tend to be an instruction reader, and the paragraph from the Secretary of State's letter ... was misleading to me.” FPPC spokesman Jay Wierenga told the Daily Press the FPPC cannot comment on specific situations with regard to whether a violation occurred. “What I can say,” Wierenga added, “if a violation occurs, if an investigation determines a violation occurred, it may sound simple but a violation is a violation.” Any violation can result in a penalty or fine of up to $5,000 per violation, according to Wiernga. If passed, Measure A would continue and increase a sunsetting tax in Apple Valley that proponents say will work to reopen closed AVFPD fire stations and increase emergency response times. The current tax — sunsetting next year — accounts for about 30 percent of the district’s revenue. The Daily Press initially requested CSAVES’ campaign-finance disclosures on Oct. 24 and received from the San Bernardino County Elections Office the committee's Statement of Organization, which does not contain contributions or expenditures. A second request made on Nov. 1 returned the same form, as well as a statement from Elections Office spokeswoman Melissa Eickman indicating that “CSAVES is not a qualified committee yet,” meaning the committee had not yet raised or spent $2,000. The unofficial documents provided by Starbuck, however, show a Sept. 22 deposit of $8,175 into the committee’s Desert Community Bank account, an amount that, by itself, triggered the filing requirements. Deposits and expenses were then listed for more than a month, the documents show. In an email sent Saturday — one day after the Daily Press received the unofficial documents — she wrote that “neither the committee or I have any intent to be deceptive or disingenuous.” On Monday, former Apple Valley Fire Protection Chief and CSAVES Principal Officer Doug Qualls contacted the FPPC, according to Starbuck. Qualls was told CSAVES should have filed a Campaign Disclosure Statement — Form 460 — on Sept. 29 “to report any activity from the time (the committee) qualified through Sept. 24.” A second 460 filing was required on Oct. 27 for all activity between Sept. 25 and Oct. 22. In addition, according to Starbuck, the FPPC informed Qualls that a Contribution Report — Form 497 — was required any time a single contribution of $1,000 or more was received. CSAVES received two $1,000 contributions, according to the unofficial documents, including one from the “Apple Valley Professional Firefighters PAC.” More than $3,300 in “Anonymous cash contributions” were also received; however, it is unclear whether any single cash contribution contained in that line item equaled $1,000. As of noon Monday, Starbuck was in the process of determining where the disclosures need to be filed. She said she would file by the end of day. “Generally speaking,” Wierenga said, “when anyone or any group takes steps to correct and mitigate issues, when anyone or any group cooperates and takes steps to be in compliance, that is strongly encouraged, strongly appreciated, and taken into consideration when deciding any potential penalty or action involving a group or individual.” Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

The Touch Bar, as you'll all recall, is Apple's new secondary touchscreen located at the top of the keyboard where the function key row is normally situated. The contents of the new OLED display change dynamically to provide app-specific controls, giving users yet another option for input. Is Apple's new Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro any better than reaching another inch and using a menu bar that could have been placed at the bottom of a normal touchscreen? Only time will tell. In the meantime, you don't need to spend between $1,800 and $4,300 to check out Apple's new Touch Bar. In fact, you can try it out right now with any Mac desktop or MacBook computer thanks to a nifty free app. DON'T MISS: 10 hidden iPhone gestures you probably don’t know about "But there are no touchscreen Macs," you said to yourself, "so how can I possibly test Apple's new Touch Bar on my MacBook?" Luckily, Apple has been known to make a device with a touchscreen now and then, and you'll be able to use one of those alongside your Mac computer to test out the Touch Bar. Developers Andreas Verhoeven and Robbert Klarenbeek have created a free app called Touch Bar Demo that let you use Apple's MacBook Pro Touch Bar on any Mac laptop. The software Touch Bar itself gets installed on an iPad that needs to be connected via USB to your MacBook or Mac desktop. It displays all of the Touch Bar's features alongside each app that has been updated with Touch Bar support, and it works just like the actual Touch Bar does on Apple's new 2016 MacBook Pro models. Here's a video of Touch Bar Demo in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZLx03OPpUU Installing the macOS portion of Touch Bar Demo is relatively straightforward as long as you're running macOS Sierra 10.12.1 build 16B2657, but the iPad portion of the solution isn't as simple as installing an app from the App Store. You'll need to use some developer tools to essentially assemble the app yourself and then install it on your iPad. You'll find all of the files and instructions you need on the Touch Bar Demo GitHub page.

November 7th, the first day of APPLE FEST. All we wanted to do was eat some "apple inspired dishes" (Question: do these dishes contain apples, or just take inspiration from them?) in the charmingly unwelcoming atmosphere of 1920 Commons. Even that was too much to ask. Only four hours after announcing APPLE FEST on its Facebook page, marking the first time Commons has been called "the apple of our eye", Penn Dining declared everyone's favorite dining hall closed due to a water main break. The break is likely responsible for the flooding on Spruce Street, but we don't know enough about civil engineering to be sure. Campus continues to fall apart in the days leading up to the election. If something has to go, we suppose Commons isn't such a bad thing to sacrifice. Let's just hope that whoever is elected will allow us to enjoy the rest of APPLE FEST in peace.

The obnoxious wealthy heirs and heiresses who love to flash their cash on Rich Kids app that costs £890 a month to 'flush out the fakes from real millionaires' - but has now been BANNED by Apple Meet some of the rich kids living it up around the world including UK visits Many are part of exclusive picture sharing app that costs £890 a month Apple has just banned the app on its devices but their posts continue  By Sarah Rainey For Daily Mail Published: 18:22 EST, 7 November 2016 | Updated: 05:24 EST, 8 November 2016 e-mail 242 shares 422 View comments You've heard of the Rich Kids of Instagram: those spoiled twenty somethings who love nothing more than flaunting their wealth online. Then there is the Rich Kids app, an exclusive club where some of the 25,000 members pay £890 a month to post their self-obsessed pictures, in a bid to weed out fake heirs. It’s just been banned by Apple for violating its terms — to its narcissistic stars’ frustration. So just who are these obnoxious rich kids? Sarah Rainey holds her nose and takes a look.   Property tycoon who's rarely in the office  Emir Bahadir lases on an inflatable animal in a pool Turkish-born Emir Bahadir’s name translates literally to ‘Prince’ — and the 25-year-old certainly lives like one. Whether lounging in a pool in St Tropez (inset) or grinning on board his mahogany-panelled private jet (main picture), his 319,000 followers are regularly treated to glimpses of his gilded existence. Emir, who attended the £60,000-a-year American School in Switzerland, and studied business at New York University before moving to London, is heir to a generations-old Turkish property empire and owns a £2.8 million apartment in Manhattan. He is also co-founder of a property brokerage whose offerings include a £77 million premises on New York’s Fifth Avenue. A visit to his Instagram site, however, shows Emir is rarely in the office. He’s more likely to be found in a helicopter over Cannes, attending a gala in Miami or relaxing on a yacht surrounded by a gaggle of bikini-clad beauties.    Ferrari princess with 100 handbags Billionaire's daughter Julia Stakhiva, 24, drives a £200,000 Ferrari 488 Billionaire's daughter Julia Stakhiva, 24, was given her first Louis Vuitton handbag aged nine. Today, she has 100 designer bags as well as a £300,000 fur collection and clothes worth £1.6 million in her Mayfair home. Her lifestyle is funded by her Ukrainian parents, who made millions from their food empire. ‘Since the age of 16, I’ve been spending at least £17,000 a month on clothes,’ she says. ‘I don’t mix and match with designers: I will wear Balmain from top to toe.’ Her 66,000 Instagram followers can ogle photos of Julia clutching a £1,800 bottle of Armand de Brignac Brut Gold Julia, who has spent £180,000 on facial fillers, lip injections and teeth whitening, has a personal trainer and nutritionist. She flies to Moscow to have her hair cut — ‘I book the whole salon so it can be free when I arrive’ — and has five staff to promote her image. Since graduating from a £15,950-a-year business course at Regent’s University, Julia has become a reality TV star. She drives a £200,000 Ferrari 488 and her 66,000 Instagram followers can ogle photos of Julia clutching a £1,800 bottle of Armand de Brignac Brut Gold.    Splashing £15K a month on clothes Lana Scolaro, 21, loves the limelight and was educated at Mill Hill School in North London Whether draped across the bonnet of a gold Bentley or cavorting on a rooftop in a black bra, Lana Scolaro, 21, clearly loves the limelight. Born to an English mother and Italian father, Lana was educated at Mill Hill School in North London. She was offered a place at a design school in New York, but socialising proved to be more fun. Her upbringing was anything but ordinary: her father, who made millions as a mining entrepreneur, gave Lana and her sisters Stephy, 23, and Lydia, 15, everything they wanted. She travels by private jet, owns a £25,000 Hermes Birkin handbag and admits to spending £15,000 a month on clothes. She travels by private jet, owns a £25,000 Hermes Birkin handbag and admits to spending £15,000 a month on clothes Lana uploads pictures to her Instagram account several times a day, giving her 63,000 followers glimpses of her over-the- top party lifestyle. Recent images show her carrying her pet dog, Fifi, onto a private jet, posing in a racy pink bikini and sitting in the front row at a Dolce & Gabbana fashion show. She’s also uploaded an image of a blonde woman in just her underwear lying in a bath of dollar bills with the caption: ‘Where do you see yourself in a few years?’ When she’s not pouting up a storm, Lana has a fledgling jewellery line — LS Diamonds — which includes a black diamond bracelet decorated with a tiny silver gun, costing £795. She has also pictured herself draped across the bonnet of a gold Bentley RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Apple bans device owners from operating the Rich Kids app...

Daria, 23, employed four people for two months to apply the million crystals by hand. The car, a birthday present from her parents, cost £50,000 plus £35,000 to customise it. ‘I have a lot of jewellery — diamonds are a girl’s best friend,’ she said at the time. ‘I have them everywhere. I’d like to encrust everything in crystal.’ She has since turned her obsession into a career, customising fur and leather products for wealthy clients. She made headlines in 2014 after her Swarovski crystal-studded Mercedes C-class with the licence plate ‘BA11 BYY’ was spotted outside Harrods Daria, who lives in Knightsbridge, has hundreds of pairs of shoes. ‘But only Louboutin and Louis Vuitton,’ she says. ‘All my handbags are Louis Vuitton, too.’ Her 45,600 Instagram followers are treated to regular updates from Daria’s indulgent lifestyle: dinner at Claridge’s, bottles of Dom Perignon champagne and shopping trips to Chanel.    A fistfull of dollars and a party at The Ritz With her tumbling brunette locks and voluptuous curves, Alexandra Dmitrieva looks more like a glamorous model than a struggling student With her tumbling brunette locks and voluptuous curves, Alexandra Dmitrieva looks more like a glamorous model than a struggling student, but she’s only recently graduated from a business course at Regent’s University London. Alexandra, whose parents made pots of money from the Russian oil industry, works for a chemical company, as well as helping out in the family business. Her Instagram account — which boasts 14,400 followers — shows her pampered lifestyle: clutching several hundred $20 bills at a Las Vegas casino, tucking into oysters in a Knightsbridge restaurant and laden with designer shopping bags after one of her regular sprees.

Roxie, who has 11,700 followers on Instagram, posts photos from exotic locations around the world If she’s not posing on the back of a yacht or boarding a private jet, the Louboutin-loving socialite can be found on a ski slope or swigging champagne in a pool.

He reportedly owns an apartment next to his father’s boutique in Sloane Square in London’s upmarket SW1 area, where the average property costs £2.1 million. But with so much cash to splash, he’s never home for long: recent sojourns show a chalet in St Moritz, a yacht off the coast of Monaco —and, of course, the sprawling family home in Florence, which boasts outlandish interiors of purple velvet sofas, animal print armchairs and marble statues.

Not only are you hammered with hyperbole from all directions, with each company insisting its product is Elvis, Jesus and Chuck Norris rolled into one, but there are almost as many different software/platform combos as there are phones. Let New Atlas help, as we line up our picks for the 10 best high-end smartphones of 2016 – to compare their features, specs and harder-to-define intangibles. For this late 2016 edition of our Smartphone Comparison Guide, we're looking at 10 handsets: Google Pixel XL Google Pixel Apple iPhone 7 Plus Apple iPhone 7 LG V20 Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Samsung Galaxy S7 HTC 10 OnePlus 3 Motorola Moto Z (aka Moto Z Droid) We left out some quality mid-ranged handsets, like the iPhone SE, Moto G4 and Moto Z Play; if you're looking to save a few bucks, they're all solid options. We also skipped some major flagships like the LG G5 (its modular design fell short, and was eclipsed by its more-recent successor, the V20) and the Moto Z's sibling, the Moto Z Force (thicker, heavier and more expensive than the capable standard model). Size The LG V20 is the biggest phone in this bunch, but the iPhone 7 Plus (which has a smaller screen) isn't far behind. The iPhone 7 is smallest, but the Galaxy S7 is only a slightly bigger phone with a significantly bigger screen. At some point razor-thin phones went out of style, as phone-makers tried to find a better balance of thickness, battery life and screen resolution. The only handset in this bunch pushing that boundary is the super-svelte Moto Z, though you may prefer to use it with one of its modular add-ons, which will make it beefier. Weight The Moto Z is also ludicrously light, tipping the scales lighter than the much smaller iPhone 7. Build Aluminum makes an appearance on all 10 phones, though Samsung only uses its metal frames to bind glass fronts and backs. Colors Each phone gives you some degree of choice in colors. The asterisk next to the jet black iPhone 7 and 7 Plus? That's because Apple snuck in an upsale technique (a trick growing more common under Tim Cook's Apple), only offering that none-more-black option in the more expensive 128 GB and 256 GB models. Display size The iPhone 7 is the only handset in this bunch that drops below the 5-inch display threshold. You could say that makes it a little better for folks who don't want a huge handset, but keep in mind the Galaxy S7 gives you an 18 percent bigger screen in only a slightly bigger phone. The 5.7-inch LG V20 has the largest screen in this rogue's gallery, giving you 7 percent more area than the five 5.5-inch phones. Display resolution The iPhone 7 is also the only phone in this bunch to fall short of 400 pixels-per-inch, but Apple paid enough attention to details that won't show up on spec sheets – color range, brightness, contrast, richness – to keep its screen looking close to top-notch. Display type The AMOLED vs. IPS breakdown comes out 6-4 in favor of AMOLED. Pressure-sensitive display Apple is still the only major smartphone-maker bothering with pressure-sensitive displays, with its 3D Touch tech. It's essentially the mobile right-click, bringing up various shortcuts and previews by pressing harder on the screen. Second Screen LG is one of those delightful Android-phone-makers that's always throwing wacky new stuff against the wall. Following last year's V10, the updated V20 has a small strip of screen sitting above the main display that shows various shortcuts and alerts without trespassing on your main screen's turf. Curved display After the fiery Note 7 was recalled and discontinued, that left the Galaxy S7 edge as Samsung's only current-gen phone with a curved-edge display. It's mostly a cosmetic addition, though it can also do many of the same things as LG's Second Screen, only vertically (with the major difference that, in Samsung's case, that strip steals space from the main display). Camera megapixels Megapixel counts, once past a certain threshold (which all of these are) don't mean much. But we can say anecdotally that our tests showed the Google Pixel and Pixel XL providing the best photography of the year. The LG V20, iPhones and Galaxies all came somewhat close. Camera aperture (rear) The logic goes that wider aperture means better low-lit photography – and if you're looking only at physical sensors, then that's probably going to hold true. But Google's HDR software algorithms give the Pixel phones the best low-lit smartphone shots we've ever seen, despite having a mere ƒ/2.0 aperture. Dual-lens camera (rear) The iPhone 7 Plus and LG V20 both have dual rear cameras, but they each serve different purposes. The iPhone's second lens is a telephoto/zoom one, letting you jump between standard and 2x shots with the push of a button. The two cameras also combine to enable a new Portrait Mode that simulates (with hit-or-miss quality) the bokeh/blurred-background effect of a DSLR or mirrorless camera. LG's second sensor shoots wider landscapes instead, and lacks any kind of faux-bokeh effect. OIS The Pixel phones stand as evidence that great camera software can transcend camera spec sheets. Not only do they have the smallest apertures in this bunch, they also lack Optical Image Stabilization. Yet they have not only the best low-lit photography, but also the most stable and least-blurred shots of moving subjects that we've seen in a phone. Battery (capacity) The Galaxy S7 edge has the biggest (highest-capacity) battery in this bunch, but many other factors play into real-world battery life (keep reading). Battery benchmark (lower is better) In our own battery benchmark, where we stream video over Wi-Fi with screen brightness measured at a consistent luminance, the Samsung phones and OnePlus 3 had the best scores – dropping just 9 percent per hour. While the larger Google Pixel XL fared pretty well, the smaller Pixel lost a disappointing 14 percent per hour. Fast charging Over two years after fast-charging tech started popping up in Android flagships (and has improved incrementally since), Apple has yet to offer its own version of this handy feature. Removable battery The LG V20 harkens back to older Android flagships, with its removable battery. If you pick up a spare, you can skip the bulky battery cases or clunky portable chargers, and simply swap that out during an unusually long day. Wireless charging Only Samsung built wireless charging into its phones, but you can buy a battery mod (read on) for the Moto Z that adds the same functionality. Some models of the LG V20 can add wireless charging, if you buy a replacement backing that supports it. Processor You're getting a fast phone no matter which you pick, but in our experience, we found the iPhones and Pixels to provide the smoothest, most real-time feeling in day-to-day performance. RAM RAM isn't always a perfect predictor of real-life multitasking performance (the iPhone 7, for example, still fares very well there), but for those keeping score, the OnePlus 3 has the most. Storage For internal storage, most phones give you several different pricing tiers to choose from. LG and OnePlus are the most generous in their base tiers, with a spacious 64 GB. Expandable storage Only half the phones, though, let you expand/augment that internal storage by popping in a microSD card. These relatively cheap solutions can add up to 2 TB. The V20 has the best all-around storage setup, with 64 GB internal as standard and microSD support. Water resistance Samsung and Apple both added water resistance to their 2016 flagships, but the Galaxies have the higher rating (their IP68 means they can be immersed continuously, while the iPhones' IP67 allows for 1 m/3.3 ft of water for up to 30 minutes). The asterisked phones have some light water resistance (usually just splash protection), but not enough to warrant a full "yes." Hi-Fi audio If you're an audiophile, or at least have a high-quality pair of headphones (think more Sennheiser, Sony or Bose's latest, less Beats), then the LG V20 and HTC 10 can give you outstanding audio without needing to buy any extra DAC accessories. The V20 gets the edge here, though, with its "Quad DAC" for headphone use (the HTC 10 has a standard built-in DAC too) and AptX HD support for wireless listening (the HTC 10 supports last-gen AptX, not the newer HD variant). With Hi-Fi audio files (or Hi-Fi streaming from Tidal) and the right pair of cans, both phones will produce much better sound than anything else in this group. Apple likes to brand itself as a company that "loves music," but it's less concerned than LG or HTC with making that music sound as good as possible. Headphone jack Apple made headlines when it killed the headphone jack in the 2016 iPhones, but Lenovo beat Tim Cook and Co. to the punch by a couple of months with the Moto Z. VR For nearly two years (if you count the Innovator Edition dev kits), Samsung phones were the only place to get high-quality virtual reality on your phone. That's set to change with the coming arrival of Google Daydream, which, at launch, will only work with one headset (Daydream View) and two handsets (the Pixels). Samsung's and Oculus' Gear VR, though, still has the best selection of mobile VR content by a wide margin. Daydream's library will likely take some time to catch up. Daydream View has one potential advantage in the inclusion of a single motion controller: a far cry from motion controls on higher-end VR setups, but still something the Gear VR doesn't yet have or support. Virtual assistant The Pixel phones mark the debut of Google Assistant, a more evolved version of the old Google Now, which runs on all the other Android phones. The tech giant wants Assistant to serve as a more worthy foe to Apple's Siri, and our testing shows that it more than holds its own. Fingerprint sensor In 2016, the question is no longer whether a flagship phone has a fingerprint sensor, but whether it's on the phone's frontside (in the home button slot below the screen) or backside (just below the camera). Modular build Lenovo swung for the fence with the modular Moto Z, which snaps various "Mods" into place using built-in magnets. Most of them are gimmicky (things like a speaker or projector), but the battery mod is the most elegant solution we've seen to adding battery life to a phone. Well, except, perhaps, for the LG V20's removable battery. Stylus With the Note 7 disappearing in a cloud of smoke (in some cases, literally), we're left without any major flagships with integrated stylus support. Software Every phone here that isn't an iPhone runs some version of Android, but not all are created equal. The Google Pixel's OS is the best of the Android bunch, with a pure version of the new Android Nougat that's intertwined with the hardware to a degree that you don't typically see on Android. OnePlus and Motorola come close to using stock Android, with no egregious UI changes, but their flagships are currently stuck on Google's 2015 OS release, Marshmallow. Samsung, LG and (to a lesser degree) HTC add their own UI customizations and marketing-focused features to the Android base. For more on iOS 10, running on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, you can check out our full review. Release The oldest phones in this group are the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, which means they're likely to be replaced by successors the soonest, with HTC not far behind. Starting price (full retail) You may have noticed that the OnePlus 3, while holding its own throughout this comparison, didn't have any standout categories. Well, here it is: You can order the phone for a mere US$399 full retail, nearly half of what you'd pay for its best rivals. The rest of the phones have more traditional (you could say "iPhone-like") premium pricing. The V20 gets an asterisk, though, since its full-retail price varies wildly, from $672 (Verizon) all the way up to $830 (AT&T).

Email | 07 Nov 2016 | Print  ExtraBITS for 7 November 2016 by TidBITS Staff In ExtraBITS this week, developer Marco Arment argues for the Mac Pro’s continued existence, while Apple’s Phil Schiller and Jony Ive give rare interviews to discuss the new MacBook Pro. Marco Arment Argues for the Mac Pro -- Is the Mac Pro dead? It has been three years since Apple last updated its top-of-the-line Mac, giving the impression that the company has abandoned it. Developer Marco Arment argues that dropping the Mac Pro would be a mistake. He provides a wide variety of reasons why the Mac Pro is still necessary, such as having more than four cores, more graphics processing power, the capability to install far more RAM than Apple’s other Macs, and greater reliability. Either way, Apple should issue a statement about its plans for the Mac Pro so professional users who rely on the Mac Pro’s unique capabilities can react accordingly. Read/post comments Apple’s Phil Schiller Discusses the New MacBook Pros -- Phil Schiller, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, spoke with the Independent about the just-released MacBook Pro models. Schiller admitted to being surprised by the backlash engendered by the new laptop, but he said that Apple’s online store has taken more orders for the new models than any previous professional laptop. He also explained why the new laptops have headphone jacks, why they lack SD card slots, and why we can’t activate Siri on the Mac via “Hey Siri” without an Accessibility hack. Read/post comments Apple’s Jony Ive on the Touch Bar and Thinking Different -- Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive sat down with CNET to discuss his design process and the Touch Bar in the new MacBook Pro. Ive reveals that his team spent years working on the concepts that eventually became the Touch Bar. That process wasn’t easy — they often had to prototype what was essentially a full product before they could even test it properly. That begs the question: what ideas did Apple develop, test, and dismiss before moving ahead with the Touch Bar?

To stress on its exclusivity Apple made the glossy black color available only on the 128 and 256GB models. Today, a new report is suggesting another exclusive color is coming to the iPhones, sooner rather than later. Jet White is rumored to join the existing color options later in the lifespan of this iPhone generation. Jet White surely would look awesome on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus and will reboot the interest towards Apple's latest smartphones post the holiday season, when the sales are usually slowing down. On the other hand, Apple is not known of doing such releases mid-cycle. A new color option makes more sense for the next iPhone generation unless something else has been cooking at Apple's lab and will need the whole attention at the next event. Apple would probably unveil a new iPad generation in the spring and maybe we'll see the Jet White option in there. If not, it's probably kept under wraps for the anniversary iPhones next fall.

Apple Seeds Second Beta of iOS 10.2, watchOS 3.1.1 & tvOS 10.1, Adds New TV App GO The new TV app is now available for iOS users Nov 7, 2016 22:10 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Today, November 7, 2016, Apple seeded the second Beta development milestone of its upcoming iOS 10.2, watchOS 3.1.1, and tvOS 10.1 operating systems to developers enrolled in the Apple Developer program. Tagged as build 14C5069c for iOS 10.2 Beta 2, build 14S5869b for watchOS 3.1.1, and build 14U5574b for tvOS 10.1, the new development milestones are now available on your developer account and you can install them on your registered iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch, or Apple TV devices following the instructions provided there. Of course, if you're currently using the first Beta of iOS 10.2, watchOS 3.1.1 or tvOS 10.1 on your registered devices, you can update to today's Beta 2 release via the OTA (Over-the-Air) update system. Please note that macOS 10.12.2 Beta 2 and Xcode 8.2 Beta 2 aren't available at the moment of writing this article. Public Beta 2 of iOS 10.2 coming soon with new TV app As usual, Apple addresses many of the bugs reported by public testers and developers during the Beta 1 testing phase, which means that the new Beta should be more stable and reliable. Talking about public beta testing, Apple has not yet seeded the Public Beta 2 build of iOS 10.2, but it should arrive in the coming hours via OTA updates. Make sure you update to iOS 10.2 Public Beta 2 when it hits the streets, as Apple pushed its new TV app unveiled during the "Hello Again" event that took place last month so you can track your favorite TV shows and movies. We can't wait to install it too so we can publish here our first impressions of the new TV app. Lastly, if you're installing tvOS 10.1 Beta 2, please try to keep in mind that it's designed only for the 4th generation Apple TV. For supported devices for iOS 10.2 Beta 2 and watchOS 3.1.1 Beta 2, make sure you check out the release notes on your Apple Developer account. #iOS 10.2 Beta 2#tvOS 10.1 Beta 2#watchOS 3.1.1 Beta 2#Apple#TV app subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Jet White iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Could Be in the Works Apple Wants to Sell iPhones in India by Any Means No iPhone SE Refresh in 2017, Analyst Claims India to Buy Technology to Hack Password-Protected iPhones OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac darktable 2.2 to Be a Major Release with RAW Overexposure Indication, New Tools Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE Salix Xfce 14.2 Live Edition Released, It's Based on Xfce 4.12 & Slackware 14.2    iOS 10.2 Beta 2 released new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Weiss  |  Posted 2016-11-07 Print               Many Apple customers complained online when Apple removed legacy connectors in the devices in favor of USB-C and pricey adapters. Apple is sharply reducing the prices of its USB-C adapters for its new MacBook Pro laptops after hearing loud complaints from many users about the cost and need for the dongles that will let them use their new machines with legacy peripherals and equipment they already own. In an emailed statement sent to eWEEK on Nov. 7, Apple said it announced the USB-C adapter price cuts, which will be good through the end of 2016, to address the concerns of the company's customers. "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today, and they face a transition" because of changes in the new MacBook Pros that removed several legacy ports in favor of USB-C ports and accessory dongles, the statement said. "We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables." Under the new pricing plan, all Apple-branded USB-C to USB adapters will be $9 instead of $19; while Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapters will sell for $29, instead of $49. USB-C to Lightning cables will be $19 instead of $25 for the 1-meter version, while the 2-meter version will be $29 instead of $35. In addition, the Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport adapter will be $49 instead of $69. The lower prices on the Apple accessories through the end of the year will not include Apple USB-C power adaptors or the 2-meter USB-C Charge Cable, according to Apple. Related third-party MacBook Pro accessories sold through Apple stores and through Apple.com will also be included in the price mark-downs, Apple stated. The SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II Card USB-C reader will cost $29, instead of $49, while all other third-party USB-C peripherals offered by Apple will be 25 percent off. Apple unveiled its latest MacBook Pro models on Oct. 27. "We are extremely excited about the new MacBook Pro, which is the best pro notebook we've ever made," Apple said in the statement. "It has the fastest CPU, graphics, memory, storage and I/O, best display, the innovative Touch Bar and more. MacBook Pro uses the most advanced industry-standard connector, USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, to provide maximum performance, expandability and compatibility." The latest MacBooks arrive in three versions—a 15-inch model (pictured) with a sixth-generation Intel Core i7 quad-core 2.6 GHz processor, 16GB of 2,133MHz memory and up to 2TB of solid-state drive (SSD) storage; a 13-inch model with a choice of sixth-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 dual-core processors, and 8GB of 2,133MHz memory; and a second lower-priced 13-inch model that comes with a standard row of function keys instead of a new Touch Bar that's found in the other two laptops. The all-new Touch Bar replaces the top row of clickable function keys with a touch-screen keyboard strip that enables deep customization options with a variety of applications. A sampling of IT analysts told eWEEK that the innovations they had hoped to see in the latest MacBook Pro devices were not part of the company's splashy presentation. Missing were innovations such as wireless displays that connect using WiGig, which could allow users to walk into a room, set down their MacBooks and have them connect to a compatible monitor instantly without having to plug anything in, while removing legacy ports makes things more complicated for users, they said. The 15-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2,399, and the MacBook Pro 13-inch model starts at $1,799 with the Touch Bar or at $1,499 for the standard model without the Touch Bar. The basic MacBook Pro 13 is available immediately, while the other two models will ship in two to three weeks, according to Apple. An analysis of the new MacBook Pro 13 models with the standard function key bar was recently given a score of 2 out of 10 for ease-of-repair by computer tear-down specialist iFixit. The problem, according to iFixit, is that the new thinner, lighter and denser MacBook Pro 13 model has been designed and assembled in a way that doesn't allow easy disassembly. The two new 13-inch and 15-inch Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro models won't ship for another few weeks, so iFixit has not yet taken them apart for analysis.             LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Google Rebuts EU Complaint About Android Bundling Charges GoPro Recalls All 2,500 of the New Karma Drones Sold to Customers Google Gives Gmail for iOS Major Overhaul NXP Unveils New Technologies for Autonomous Vehicles Google Moves to Mobile-First Indexing for Search                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Like clockwork, apps that spoof big brands manage to make their way into the App Store ahead of a pre-holiday surge and this year’s no different. As The New York Times reports, rogue app factories in China have been busy churning out counterfeit shopping apps by the hundreds, with one particular developer being responsible for an avalanche of fake apps for brands like Puma, Nike, Canada Goose, Celine and others. Beware these apps as they’re scams designed to fool you into providing your passwords and credit card data. Thankfully, Apple is clamping down on the latest round of fake apps as the Great App Store Purge continues unabated. A good example is the shoe retailer Foot Locker Inc. which has three iPhone apps on the App Store. The legitimate company now has to contend with a Chinese development firm that goes by the name Footlocke Sports Co., Ltd. and is behind more than two dozen shoe and clothing apps that look like the real thing, except they’re not. All these rogue apps want is suck your credit card numbers into the cloud. The counterfeiters have masqueraded as retail chains like Dollar Tree and Foot Locker, big department stores like Dillard’s and Nordstrom, online product bazaars like Zappos.com and Polyvore and luxury-goods makers like Jimmy Choo, Christian Dior and Salvatore Ferragamo. But clamping down on these fakes is easier said than done because their creators aren’t stupid and seem to always find a way to fool Apple’s reviewers. The article explains: Despite Apple’s efforts, new fake apps appear every day. In some cases, developers change the content of an app after it has been approved by Apple’s monitors. In other instances, the counterfeiters change their names and credentials, and resubmit similar apps after one round of fakes is discovered. In spite of Apple’s detailed screening processes, some of the counterfeit apps evidently slip through the App Store’s oversight processes. The company is aware of a barrage of counterfeit apps that have popped up in the App Store in recent weeks and last Thursday removed hundreds of fakes. More were removed after a New York Post article last week drew attention to some of the counterfeits. Apple’s review process focuses heavily on blocking malicious apps. Members of the App Store review teams simply don’t have the time to examine each and every of the thousands of apps submitted every day just to check if they are legitimately associated with the brand names listed on them. I ca sympathize with Apple here, but still think it should do more to prevent fakes in the App Store. Counterfeit apps that spoof real brands hurt Apple, loyal consumers, legitimate app makers trying to make a living and ultimately said brands, too On the other hand, Apple does move swiftly once a brand or an actual end-user reports fakes. Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr told the paper: We strive to offer customers the best experience possible, and we take their security very seriously. We’ve set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure. We’ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk. In September 2016, the iPhone maker began removing App Store apps that don’t work as advertised, are outdated or haven’t received compatibility updates nor feature additions in years. With more than two million iPhone, iPad and iPod touch apps available in the App Store, it’s impossible to pinpoint when Apple might finish clearing out the App Store of abandoned or rarely updated apps and those that don’t follow the current review guidelines, but the sooner the better. According to the paper, Apple has confirmed that a significant number of apps have been removed and that the review is continuing. If you rely on retail apps for your holiday shopping needs, be sure to use official apps from trusted developers and—please—don’t let apps with names resembling known brands/developers deceive you just because they have carefully designed icons, screenshots and interfaces that mimic established brands.

A new report this morning from Recode revealed that the iPhone maker is leaving the creation, selling and management of ads on its Apple News service to the ad sales teams over at NBCUniversal. “Apple is going to hand over ad sales for the app to Comcast’s NBCUniversal in an exclusive deal that starts in January,” reports the outlet. Any ad inventory on Apple News sold by NBCUniversal is going to be subjected to the same 70:30 revenue sharing scheme which Apple originally pitched to publishers back when it’d been selling ads on News itself. In other words, NBCUniversal gets to keep thirty percent of proceeds from any ads they sell on Apple News. An internal memo by NBCUniversal sales boss Linda Yaccarino confirmed that the company would create a dedicated sales group for Apple News. Publishers can also choose to bypass the middlemen and sell their ads directly on Apple News, in which case they’re entitled to keep 100 percent of ad revenue to themselves. At the iPhone 7 unveiling last month, Tim Cook said Apple News had passed 70 million unique users, but the milestone isn’t that much surprising given the app has a major advantage of being shipped preinstalled on iPhones and iPads. Apple News is currently available in the United States, but you can make the app appear on your device by changing your regional settings.

Here's a Better Stock to Buy This company is set to benefit from Apple's new wave of tech. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Nov 7, 2016 at 4:32PM Image source: Flickr. A Motley Fool Investigative Report - November 07, 2016 If you own Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, know someone who does, or have even thought about buying it... there's something you need to know. You see, there's a king's ransom up for grabs as Apple's next game-changer makes its way outside of the company's secretive design labs in Silicon Valley. But, one stock that's poised to benefit the most from Apple's next game-changer IS NOT Apple. While millions of tech-hungry consumers line up to get their hands on Apple's global sensations, a group of in-the-know investors will be licking their chops to capitalize on a backdoor way to potentially profit as Apple's products fly off the shelves. Here's how. Apple is set to sell millions of new Apple Watches, PLUS millions of iPhones, PLUS millions of iPads. But you already knew that. What most people don't know is there's an invaluable, tiny component inside all of these devices that Apple doesn't manufacture in-house! They don't make it because they don't have the technology OR the patents to do so. That's because another company (1/30th of Apple's size) owns the rights to those patents -- so Apple has to pay that company to include its technology in their gadgets. Translation: This tiny company essentially gets paid every time Apple sells a new device. You don't have to be a numbers-whiz to understand what that kind of growth can do to a company's stock price. the_motley_fool has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Smartphone sales are flatlining - and even the mighty Apple out of Cupertino, CA can't escape this wrath. Analysts expect the company to ship 40 million to 50 million iPhones in the first calendar quarter of 2017, down from 51.2 million in the year-ago period. And if Apple doesn't introduce a new iPhone SE in the spring of 2017, total iPhone sales could slow even further to shipments of 35 million to 40 million units next summer. To boost sales, Macotakara has claimed Apple may soon introduce at a "Jet White" option to its iPhone 7 lineup. The new colour might debut before the holiday shopping season, but Macotakara, which has a decent track record when it comes to leaking Apple news, said its own source for this rumour is "unreliable". So don't get your hopes up. If you still like to dream, feast your eyes on these white iPhone 6 concepts. The iPhone 4S was Apple's last iPhone model to offer an all-white finish. The current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models are only available in the following five colours: Gold, Rose Gold, Black, Silver, and Jet Black. We can't also help thinking that a Jet White iPhone 7 would go nicely with the newly announced white ceramic Apple Watch Edition announced in September too.  Sections Apple Phones Source: Macotakara Via: BGR That Lumee light-up case Kim K uses has been updated to Lumee Two Best Black Friday UK phone deals: Apple, Samsung, Android phone deals galore New evidence to suggest iPhone 8 will come with curved bezel-less screen The Huawei P10 could be one incredibly powerful smartphone if leaked specs are...

Jet White iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Could Be in the Works GO The information comes from Apple's supply chain Nov 7, 2016 21:12 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  The Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus is clearly the hardest to come by Apple smartphone these days, as shipping estimates can go to more than a month. But a few weeks ago you couldn't even get a Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus without having to wait around 6 weeks for your device. In the meantime, Apple managed to ramp up production of the phone and customers can now expect to get their Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus as early as 3 weeks after they ordered it. On the other hand, the smaller Jet Black iPhone 7 now ships in 3-5 business days, so it looks like people are more akin to bigger screens. Even though Apple can't yet handle demand for the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus, it looks like the company is readying another version of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. It will be called Jet White and, obviously, it will be white. Other than that, it will probably use the same materials as the Jet Black model, so expect it to be very easy to scratch. According to Japanese website Mac Otakara, the information comes directly from Apple's supply chain. Even so, the website warns readers that, for whatever reason, the information might not be as reliable as the source claims. Scratches might be more visible on the Jet White iPhone 7 However, if Apple decides to go ahead with the launch of a Jet White iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, customers will definitely look for some protective cases. Thanks to its darker color, the Jet Black version might hide some of the scratches, but that won't be the case with the Jet White version where even the thinnest scratch could be visible. The idea seems fine and dandy, but let's see the execution. A Jet White iPhone 7 Plus will probably sell like hot cakes, but will Apple be able to cope with the high-demand for another of its new smartphones? #iPhone 7#Jet Black iPhone#iPhone 7 Plus#Apple iPhone#Jet White iPhone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus Ships in November, but Only If You Order Now It’s a Feature, Not a Bug: Jet Black iPhone 7 Label Peeling Off iPhone 7 Undergoes Camera Scratch Resistance Test As Apple Says It Used Sapphire iPhone 7 Pre-Orders Four Times Bigger than Those of iPhone 6, T-Mobile CEO Says OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac darktable 2.2 to Be a Major Release with RAW Overexposure Indication, New Tools Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE Salix Xfce 14.2 Live Edition Released, It's Based on Xfce 4.12 & Slackware 14.2    Jet White iPhone 7 new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments More Evidence Shows iPhone 8 Could Feature Revolutionary Wireless Charging more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

She said she threw the phone away when she realized it had ‘swollen up’ and smoke was coming out,” AP reports. “‘I panicked when I saw the smoke and I had the reflex to throw it away,’ said Bouyirdane, a mother of three in the southwestern French city of Pau.” “The phone then caught fire and the back blew off,” AP reports. “Her partner quickly extinguished it.” Read more in the full article here.

November 7 AAPL: 110.41 1.57 After new Pro launch, Apple immediately sells out of refurbished 15” last-gen MacBook Pros… Jordan Kahn - 1 week ago @JordanKahn MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple has sold out of refurbished last-generation 15-inch MacBook Pros from its online store as the company introduces new models expected to ship to customers in the coming weeks. As noted by customers on Reddit, Apple previously had several models of refurbished last-generation MacBook Pro models available at discounted prices, but that supply is now dwindling as customers pick up remaining stock. There are still places to pick up the refurbished last-generation 15-inch MacBook Pro, however. Best Buy, for example, has two models available including the 2.2GHz quad-core configuration that Apple continues to sell. From Best Buy you’ll pay $1509, which will save you $490 off Apple’s $1999 price tag. It also has the 2.5GHz quad-core model with 512GB flash storage for $2094, $405 off the old $2499 retail price. If you don’t want the refurbished model, eBay currently has the 2.2GHz quad-core configuration brand-new for $1599, $400 off Apple’s current $1999. While Apple introduced all-new MacBook Pro models at its October 27 event last month, the company continues to sell one configuration of the last-generation 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models from its online store, presumably while supplies last. Apple started accepting orders for the new Macbook Pro with Touch Bar with a 2-3 week estimated shipping date following its event. The first of those models will arrive around November 17 to customers, while an entry-level 13-inch model with traditional function keys is already available. Shipping estimates have since increased with all models of the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar currently listed with a shipping estimate of 4-5 weeks from Apple. Apple appears to be preparing to ship the first of the new MacBook Pros as it today began charging credit cards of pre-order customers.  Guides MacBook Pro View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

A Week In The Newsroom Publications Newsroom Sign Up For Updates iPhone 7 creates a fanboy Home » Blogs » iPhone 7 creates a fanboy Posted By Brandin Walker on September 19, 2016 Apple unveiled their newest addition to the iPhone family last week, the iPhone 7, and the innovations are ground-breaking. With Apple releasing a new generation of its flagship device every year, consumers have grown accustomed to CEO Tim Cook claiming each new model is better than the last. Others in the industry have noticed small to no advancements within the line. After doing my research I am now a believer in the hype surrounding Apple’s latest release. The biggest controversy and game changer in the phone industry was the complete removal of the analog headphone jack in this remodel. However, consumers who still cling to their ear-pods can be rest assured that they’ve been made compatible with the charger port, or what the company calls the lightning port. Eliminating the headphone jack could be a marketing strategy to increase sales of their latest technological innovation called “AirPods,” wireless headphones that can be setup with the phone. At $159, this pricey feature is on trend with similar counterparts such as Sennheiser and JayBird but becomes unparalleled with its features such as Siri connectivity and its estimated 24 hour battery life. The phone’s most recent operating system update, iOS 10, is the largest and fastest to be engineered, ever. They’ve added a new processor, its A10 Fusion Chip, that makes the phone faster and smarter. Apple proclaims this new chip will make the iPhone 7 120 times faster than the original iPhone from 2007. The camera has been refined to give users professional quality pictures that can be taken with the snap of your phone. Advancements with the camera include a larger six-element lens for clearer photos, optical image stabilization that eliminates blurred images when photographing in-motion, quad-LED flash that allows 50 percent more light to be processed, and a high speed mega-pixel sensor that allows photos to be captured more rapidly. Apple always does a great job of paying attention to small details that make a big difference when putting them to practical everyday use. They’ve created a way to awaken the phone when it’s lifted from a surface, Siri can now access and perform functions in apps upon voice recognition and its navigation app has become compatible with other apps such as Uber and Yelp. The new addition called HomeKit, which connects your phone to various home devices and integrates home automation for users to setup and manage through the phone, was spoken highly by Cook. Lastly, with every new phone at Apple comes with it a new design. Iphone 7 is now the thinnest and lightest IPhone on the market. It will also be water and dust resistant competing with other smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy and Sony Xperia. New designs include a jet black color with a glossy finish, a stainless-steel Apple logo and enhanced stereo-quality with the addition of speakers placed on the top and bottom of the smart phone to produce two-times more volume than its predecessor. While the official release for Apples latest generation iPhone is well before this story publishes, release is on Sept. 16, the iPhone 7 appears to be an extremely intriguing new product on the market. After doing all my research, falling in love with the product, and having a timely upgrade available with my service provider, Apple can be certain that I will be one of the many consumers waiting outside before release to get my hands on this hot new design.

According to the Plugable, the new USB Type-C ports on the Apple’s newly launched MacBook Pro aren’t compatible for some of the early adopters of the technology on Thunderbolt 3 DisplayPorts and HDMI one. It claims that new MacBook running MacOS Sierra won’t work with peripherals with 1st generation Texas Instruments chips, and mandatory requires the 2nd generation TPS65983 TI chips for to be compatible instead. There is a chance that Apple might roll out an update to add support for older Thunderbolt 3 accessories, but as of now the only official statement from the company to AppleInsider notes that it doesn’t want to comment on Plugable’s findings and all the products using the newest Thunderbolt chipsets with up-to-date drivers are compatible with all MacBook Pro 2016 models. Here’s Apple statement: “While we have no comment on Plugable’s specific complaint, products using the newest Thunderbolt chipsets, with up-to-date drivers, will have no difficulty connecting to any 2016 MacBook Pro.” Source | Via Author: Hitesh Arora From making Gadget and Auto videos for TV and online media, this guy landed up in Tech Writing.

 NBCUniversal in deal to sell ads for Apple News Reuters Nov. 7, 2016, 3:37 PM 179 facebook linkedin twitter email print An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City Thomson Reuters By Tim Baysinger (Reuters) - Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal will begin selling ads for Apple Inc’s News app next year in an exclusive deal, the companies announced on Monday. Apple will outsource the selling to NBCUniversal, which already has relationships with many major U.S. advertisers. The deal is reminiscent of one that Snapchat struck with Viacom earlier this year, under which Viacom sells advertising on Snapchat's behalf. Unlike Apple, however, Snapchat has been filling its sales roster as it prepares for next year’s initial public offering. Apple does not have its own sales team after it shut down its iAd app ad network in June, which was used to fill unsold inventory for Apple News. Apple launched its News app last year and currently has over 70 million active monthly users. Publishers on the app, which include The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, will still be able to sell their own ads and keep all of the revenue, but now NBCUniversal, rather than Apple, will sell the extra inventory. For NBCUniversal, this provides another platform to offer advertisers. Like most legacy U.S. media companies, NBCUniversal parent company Comcast has invested heavily in digital-native companies like BuzzFeed and Vox, partly in an effort to better service existing advertisers. For example, NBCUniversal and Vox partnered on an ad product, Concert, that packages inventory from NBCUniversal and Vox’s digital properties and offers it to advertisers. NBCUniversal would not say how the revenue would be split for the ads it sells against other publishers' content; in the past, publishers would get 70 percent of the revenue with the other 30 percent going to Apple. Publishers also have the ability to opt out of having NBCUniversal sell ads against their content. NBCUniversal said it will also work with Apple on new ad products for the app. NBCUniversal will form a new sales unit dedicated to the News app, which will be lead by senior vice president James Kreckler.

She said she threw the phone away when she realized it had ‘swollen up’ and smoke was coming out,” AP reports. “‘I panicked when I saw the smoke and I had the reflex to throw it away,’ said Bouyirdane, a mother of three in the southwestern French city of Pau.” “The phone then caught fire and the back blew off,” AP reports. “Her partner quickly extinguished it.” Read more in the full article here.

Home Industry Tech Android’s Dominant Alliance shows signs of Balkanization: Gadfly Android’s Dominant Alliance shows signs of Balkanization: Gadfly The Android operating system for smartphones is one of the most successful technologies ever created. Apple Inc. sparked the smartphone revolution, but Android spread it to the masses. By: Bloomberg | Published: November 8, 2016 2:16 AM The Android operating system for smartphones is one of the most successful technologies ever created. Apple Inc. sparked the smartphone revolution, but Android spread it to the masses. (Reuters) The Android operating system for smartphones is one of the most successful technologies ever created. Apple Inc. sparked the smartphone revolution, but Android spread it to the masses. The software backed by Google parent company Alphabet Inc. powers more than 85 percent of the roughly 1.5 billion new smartphones sold each year. Yet for all its success, Android looks increasingly in danger of falling apart. That’s because the companies that teamed up to make Android a hit — principally Google and Samsung Electronics Co. — are increasingly working at cross purposes. Google has just started to sell its first smartphone that competes with its ostensible partner Samsung, and for now it has kept for itself crucial voice-assistant technology that makes the Google phones more appealing than those of other Android manufacturers. Now Samsung plans to use its own digital assistant for smartphones in competition with Google. Other makers of Android smartphone handsets, principally Chinese firms such as Xiaomi Corp., have also extricated themselves from parts of the Android system. Once successful Google hardware partners, including HTC Corp. and Lenovo Group Ltd., are struggling with their smartphone businesses and are no longer useful Android allies. Coalitions only hold together if all the partners are successful and share common interests. That’s no longer a given with Android. Market Share of Android Smartphones 87.6 per cent Google started backing Android in the first place because it was worried Apple (and Microsoft, and the phone companies) could find ways to disadvantage or block Google’s web search on smartphones. Android was Google’s effort to build its own smartphone playground and ensure Google stayed relevant as more computing activities moved from PC web browsers to mobile gadgets. That strategy panned out. But controlling the operating system no longer gives Google a guarantee to siphon and harness all the world’s digital information. The more time people spend using Facebook, Snapchat or Siri on their phones — even on Android phones — the more data is being generating out of Google’s reach. Wresting back some of that power and consumer information is a significant motivation behind Google’s efforts to create smartphones that it designs and controls from the chips to the apps. For their part, Samsung and other handset makers know they can no longer rely on Google for their mobile existence. Samsung agreed in October to buy Viv Labs, a startup working on a Siri-like voice technology. In China and India, local companies sell Android smartphones with local versions of app stores in place of Google Play. In some cases, it’s possible to use Android smartphones without interacting much with Google. All these moves are signs of the fraying Android coalition. The coalition of the willing isn’t willing anymore. It isn’t unusual for cracks to emerge in tech alliances. Partners Microsoft, Intel and personal computer manufacturers haven’t always been on the same page about the Windows operating system — a business that mirrors Android in many ways. At times, PC hardware makers felt as if Microsoft was getting the better end of the deal. While Microsoft got rich on Windows software, PC hardware makers were left to fight over single-digit percentage profit margins at best from making and selling Windows computers. In the Android alliance, Google makes the lion’s share of the profits, too. In short, it’s hard to stay friends for long in the technology industry, as Google is finding out. The Windows coalition has held through the turmoil, though Windows never branched far beyond personal computers and computer servers to other devices. The PC is now a fringe of computing, and Windows isn’t even the heart of Microsoft anymore. It’s not clear how this all shakes out for Android and Google. In contrast to Windows, Android is moving far beyond the smartphone into powering thermostats, web streaming gadgets hooked up to televisions and virtual reality headsets. But if the coalition can’t stay together, the big risk is Android turns out to be a crucial technology, but not an enduring one — the laser disc player of computing.

Apple will be sending you free money Chris Mills BGR NewsNovember 7, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share On Friday, Apple announced a limited-time sale on some of the rather expensive dongles for its new MacBook Pro. The news was well-received by people who didn't really want to spend $19 for the privilege of having a USB port, but it looks like Apple is extending the deal to everyone who has already bought any USB-C adapters. 9to5Mac reports that readers who bought USB-C adapters for their new MacBooks in the last week have seen automatic credits applied to their accounts for the difference between the sale price and what people paid for the non-discounted adapters. DON'T MISS: OnePlus is officially releasing an even faster smartphone A reader says that an email from Apple confirmed the automatic credit: “Thank you for your recent Apple Online Store purchase. Apple recently lowered the price of the USB-C to Lightning Cable (1m) you ordered. We are pleased to inform you that we will provide you with a credit for the difference between the price you paid and the new, lower price. Apple” It's a classy, if predictable, move from Apple. Given the Apple Store's return policy, customers could have gone into the store to return the dongles and then re-buy them on sale anyway, so Apple's really just making that process automatic. Still, given the laziness of people, it will amount to Apple giving away some of its hard-earned dongle profit. The dongle sale, and now this credit, are the latest conciliatory moves by Apple over the MacBook Pro's port situation. When the company announced a new laptop with four USB-C ports and nothing else, it probably wasn't expecting the level of backlash that it saw. Taking people's headphone jacks is one thing, but it seems like the MagSafe connector and SD card reader are truly sacred ground. It's unclear exactly how far back the credits for the adapter sale will go, but if you've bought a USB-C adapter for any MacBook from the Apple Store in the last 30 days, I'd strongly suggest contacting Apple support and trying to get a refund for the difference.

November 7 AAPL: 110.41 1.57 Apple automatically crediting some customers who bought MacBook Pro USB-C accessories prior to price drop Jordan Kahn - 1 week ago @JordanKahn Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Last week Apple announced a decision to decrease USB-C accessory prices to help out new MacBook Pro users who might need adapters temporarily. Apple has now started automatically crediting customers who purchased the reduced products just prior to the announcement. Customers who purchased the accessories that now have reduced limited time pricing before the price drops are receiving automatic credits for the difference, as evidenced by the screenshot below from a 9to5Mac reader who was credited for a USB-C to Lightning cable purchase. “Thank you for your recent Apple Online Store purchase. Apple recently lowered the price of the USB-C to Lightning Cable (1m) you ordered. We are pleased to inform you that we will provide you with a credit for the difference between the price you paid and the new, lower price. Apple” Apple appears to be sending out credits to those who purchased the USB-C accessories on or after the day of its MacBook Pro event on October 27th before the price drop kicked in on Friday, November 4th last week. The limited time pricing on Apple’s USB-C accessories and those it sells from third-parties will last through the end of the year, and Apple notes that the deals are effective “October 27 – December 31, 2016”. It’s also offering discounted pricing on the new LG 4K and 5K displays that it announced alongside the new MacBook Pro models, the latter of which isn’t even available until sometime next month. Earlier today Apple started charging credit cards for MacBook Pro with Touch Bar preorders, signalling that it will soon start shipping the device to customers. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Since Apple’s event, there has been lots of talk about the new MacBook Pros, especially among the Apple commentariat. It’s fair to say that the backlash against these new devices is stronger than for any MacBook announcement I can remember, and it’s mostly coming from two particular sets of people: Those who use heavy-duty creative applications such as Photoshop, and those who develop for Apple platforms. This is easily Apple’s most vocal audience, so such a response must be at least a little disheartening. But it’s also worth remembering that Apple — and even the Mac in isolation — has long since gone mainstream, and is bigger than these groups. Apple’s challenge now isn’t serving this hardcore base but pleasing the much larger mainstream Mac user base without alienating the power users. Apple’s increasingly diverse base I wrote a post a while back about the counterintuitive liability Apple has in its growing customer base. On the one hand, this customer base is a huge asset, especially given the upgrade cycles for devices like the iPhone and the ability to sell services to a captive group of users. But on the other hand, the increasing diversity of this base can also be a liability, because Apple now has to please many groups in a much less homogeneous base than in the past. The problem is the public image of Apple among many in the media and beyond continues to be of a company that serves mostly creative professionals. This perception has led to a lot of misguided commentary over the past week, both about the damage Microsoft’s Surface Studio could do to Apple’s Mac base, and about the perceived shortcomings of the new MacBook Pro line. Apple’s Mac base today The reality is that Apple’s installed base of Macs today is likely around 90 million. That’s up enormously over the last 15 years or so — it was around 25 million in the early 2000s. As that base has grown, it has diversified considerably. Just visit any college campus to see row on row of MacBooks in lecture rooms and study halls. These aren’t creative professionals, and they’re not even using their MacBooks for particularly resource-intensive tasks. But, of course, there are still creative professionals and Apple developers who use Macs for work. So it’s worth thinking about what percentage of the overall base these users might represent. Here are some data points: In 2013, Adobe estimated it had an installed base of around 12.8 million users of its Creative Suite software, with another 250,000 on Creative Cloud. Around 40 percent of this revenue came from what Adobe described as creative professionals, with another 25 percent coming from other creative people in businesses, 10 percent from creative people using it at home and 25 percent from education. Adobe currently has around eight million Creative Cloud subscribers (this is how Adobe now sells its creative suite, including Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, and so on). At WWDC this year, Tim Cook announced that Apple had 13 million registered developers. If we put these numbers together, we get a picture of eight million to 13 million users of Adobe’s creative products and another 13 million or so Apple developers. Of course, of those Adobe users, a good chunk will be using Windows versions rather than Mac versions. At the absolute outside, though, it gives, at most, around 25 million total users in the two buckets that have been most vocal about the MacBook Pro changes, out of a total base of around 90 million, or around 28 percent. Realistically, that number is probably quite a bit smaller, perhaps around 15 percent to 20 percent of the total. Of these, not all will share the concerns of those who have been so outspoken in the past week. To look at it another way, Apple sold 18.5 million Macs in the past year, which might end up being roughly the same as the combined number of creative professionals and developers in the base. Apple’s installed base of Macs today is likely around 90 million. That’s up enormously over the last 15 years or so — and as that base has grown, it has diversified considerably. In the end, the picture that emerges is of a base of Macs with the kinds of users that have been expressing concerns or frustration with the changes in the minority. The vast majority of the user base is in other categories, principally general-purpose consumer and business users. How does the rest of the base feel about the new MacBooks? Well, of course, that base is much less vocal and less visible — the general-purpose Mac user tends not to blog or host podcasts about Apple. They’re much more likely to quietly keep using the products they have and occasionally upgrade to something new. The best place to look for their feedback is sales numbers for the Mac. Those have been down a little lately, as the existing Macs have been getting a little long in the tooth, and those in the know have been waiting for upgraded machines. However, Phil Schiller said last week that online orders for the new MacBooks were higher than they’ve ever been for a new product before, suggesting that some of this pent-up demand is being released now. Mainstream users — and likely quite a few from among the professional class of MacBook users, too — are buying this new product despite the misgivings some power users have. We won’t know the actual numbers on how these MacBook Pros are selling until at least three months from now — and probably longer. But my guess is that those sales numbers will suggest that the mainstream base cares a lot less about some of the subjects of the criticism from the past week and a lot more about a decent bunch of spec upgrades, thinner and lighter hardware, and some interesting new features. Keeping the pro base happy Of course, Apple can’t simply ignore the professional base — though these users may be a minority among the overall set of Mac customers, they are an important segment and, as we’ve already seen, a vocal one. Pleasing them is important in its own right, but also as a way to influence broader perceptions of the Mac and Apple as a company. Apple likely needs to do more here to mollify this base. For starters, it needs to update the desktop Macs, especially the Mac Pro, quickly. The current version of the Mac Pro suffers from being less upgradeable than its predecessor. With that being the case, it requires hardware refreshes more — not less — frequently. It might also be a reasonable concession to the complaints from this base to make it more upgradeable. I suspect Apple will have to think hard about how to please those who want a portable yet ultrapowerful machine, which is really the even narrower segment that has been criticizing the new MacBooks. The portability/power tradeoff it has made in the new machines seems to be fine for the mainstream, but that’s the one thing that seems to be creating the most problems for the hardcore base, and it’s worth addressing.

Now, unlike a lot of our readers, I’m OK with Apple ditching the headphone jack, but Uncourage might be helpful to many of us. It’s essentially a key ring with a dummy 1/4″ jack. It’s designed for you to attach your Headphone-to-Lightning Apple adapter when you’re not using it so you don’t lose it. That’s clever, and it’s just US$6. The company said it will ship in mid-November. Check It Out: Uncourage: a Keyring with a Dummy 14-inch Jack to Hold Your Lightning Adapter Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit 6 Comments Add a comment iVoid November 7, 2016 Wouldn’t people just leave the lighting adapter attached to their headphones when it isn’t plugged into the iPhone? November 7, 2016 at 12:59 EST PM geoduck November 7, 2016 True, but at $6 and with that name it would be worth it. You know how some people have religious symbols on their keychains? Maybe hanging a symbolic phone jack on your keyring could be the next bit of geek culture. Pull out your keys and those of us that are part of the IT tribe will recognize a kindred spirit. I may order one just for that reason alone. November 7, 2016 at 6:17 EST PM Bryan Chaffin November 7, 2016 Love it, geoduck. 😀 November 7, 2016 at 6:40 EST PM Hagen November 7, 2016 What would be the electrical consequences of plugging this into a real headphone jack? You’d be shorting every contact in the jack together — bad news if that jack has any power going to it. November 7, 2016 at 7:25 EST PM Lee Dronick November 7, 2016 “Wouldn’t people just leave the lighting adapter attached to their headphones when it isn’t plugged into the iPhone?” And you wouldn’t risk losing the dongle. I keep my earbuds coiled in a change purse. Of course this damn dongle won’t be problem for me until I get a new iPhone. Then I can move my 3.5 earbuds to my new MacBook Pro becauae the new iPhone 7 earbuds won’t plug directly into that, it would require a dongle.

Back in 2012, the 3rd gen Apple TV with 1080p support was a decent little set-top box. Since then, the TV industry has raced forward. Content providers have developed new delivery modes and strategies, and the broadcast and display technologies have advanced as well. Apple, however, seems to have frittered its time away and failed to advance its vision and its hardware. In fact, Yoni Heisler at BGR makes the case that Apple has no idea what it’s doing. The discussion is on page 3 of Particle Debris. Check It Out: Apple’s Hit and Miss Affair with TV Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit One Comment Add a comment MarcusNewton November 7, 2016 “Compounding the problem is that its backwards industrial design all but makes it impossible, upon picking it up, to immediately discern which part of the remote is the top and which is the bottom simply by picking it up.” (from the BGR article) — I cannot count how many times I have picked up the Apple TV remote to move it and accidentally clicked the touch area and turned on the Apple TV. Even to pick the remote up I have to slide it over to a table’s edge because it is so thin and flat. Also, I am still surprised that Apple hasn’t changed that awful A through Z straight line keyboard. I have a 65″ TV, with all this screen real-estate, and the keyboard is this thin line near the top of the screen. I thought Apple made all of its employees go through that class where they show that old Google TV remote as a lesson in bad design. I think the Apple TV people called in sick that day. While I am on the subject of the Apple TV on-screen keyboard, it drives me nuts that there are two buttons below the A to Z line of characters, one for uppercase and another button for lowercase. If I can only display either uppercase or lowercase sets one-at-a-time, why are there two buttons? It should be one button that changes to whatever the opposite of the case currently on the screen is. Actually, there is more then enough room to display both upper and lowercase characters at the same time. I would love to watch someone on the Apple TV team try to enter in a strong password like }’rbSq}Fx]ZHOfG)Nxnh/cS* with the on-screen keyboard. Yes, I have tried using Siri, and it is completely useless for understanding random generated passwords. November 7, 2016 at 10:38 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

A host of fake retail apps have appeared in Apple’s App Store recently, an indicator of Apple’s inability to closely monitor software in the way it once did. Both the New York Times and the New York Post have reported that hundreds of fake shopping apps have been published in the App Store recently. While many of them simply serve up irritating ads to make a quick buck, others purport to be genuine retail apps, luring users into providing credit card details. Brands ranging from Foot Locker to Christian Dior have been used as the fronts for such rackets in recent weeks. Apple once made much of its approval process for apps, using it as a means of differentiating itself from Android, which used to allow developers to immediately upload software to its Play Store. (Google began vetting apps more closely in 2015.) Apple still claims to “review all apps submitted to the App Store in an effort to determine whether they are reliable, perform as expected, and are free of offensive material.” But clearly some are slipping through the net. A statement provided to the New York Times by Apple hints that its vetting process may not be quite as rigorous as it once was: “We strive to offer customers the best experience possible, and we take their security very seriously. We’ve set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure. We’ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk.” Indeed, the newspaper claims that Apple “does not routinely examine” every app before it’s added to the store. In other cases, the software may be updated after approval to include nefarious content. The main problem is volume: there are a mind-boggling two million apps available in the app store, so vetting new arrivals and updates in detail is incredibly difficult. This is perhaps what happens when a company that once sought to make perfect devices for a small audience becomes one of the world’s largest hardware suppliers with a software marketplace to match: quality slips. Apple also appears to be losing its ability to update product lines often enough to keep consumers interested in the latest models. The latest iPhone launch was wildly underwhelming, for instance, and its computer refreshes come too infrequently for the demanding, need-it-now millennial crowd. The company’s most recent product announcement is also an excellent case in point, revealing a company with time to make small tweaks to existing products, but lacking the vision to break with convention. Perhaps more pressing for Apple right now is the need to clean up the illicit apps, which so far it has done based on reports from the two news outlets.

By Bill Roberson — November 7, 2016 11:26 AM Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Suddenly, those scissors look better than ever If you’re a cable TV cord-cutter, it looks like there’s an interesting option on the horizon. According to Variety, AT&T is going to give streamers free Apple TVs and Amazon Fire TV Sticks with its new $35-per-month streaming TV service, which it will call DirecTV Now. Customers who sign up for a three-month run of the service will get an Apple TV streaming kit, and month-to-month users will get an Amazon Fire TV stick. Variety says AT&T is lining up content channels for the service and so far, HBO, ESPN, Disney, AMC, Viacom and some other heavy hitters are on board. But what about Netflix and Amazon? Well, since it’s a streaming service, we’ll just assume your regular accounts will be accessible through either device as usual. And this doesn’t seem like some trial run, either. Bloomberg is saying that streaming – not cable or satellite – will be AT&Ts primary TV platform by 2020. Samsung, please make sure the A.I. does not explode Couple of A.I. stories for you now: Following the disaster that is the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, the South Korean electronics giant is focusing on the upcoming Galaxy S8 flagship phone, and it could get a new dedicated A.I. built in, in order to compete against Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Amazon’s Alexa, and so on. Samsung has copyrighted the name “Bixby” and just last month, the electronics giant bought up Viv, the A.I. designed by the same team that created Siri. The new S8 is expected to debut at Mobile World Congress in February, and will likely come in 5.1 and 5.5-inch variations. Other rumors include a dual-camera system but one more oriented towards low-light performance rather than making pretty portrait pictures, and a 4K screen on the big version of the phone. Sounds great, just make sure to get those batteries squared away, Samsung. We’re not so sure this was the smartest idea And hey, if you want to smarten up an A.I., what do you think would be the best approach? A sit down with Stephen Hawking? Watching Cosmos with Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Reading all of Marilyn vos Savant’s columns? Seems reasonable, but Google has other ideas: They’re having their A.I. “DeepMind” play StarCraft II, because nothing apparently works better at creating a touchy-feely A.I. than battling alien hordes with insanely powerful energy weapons. But Google says the gameplay will teach their apparently teenage A.I. that never leaves the  basement how to better deal with the intricacies – or what Google calls the “messiness” – of everyday life by having to make rapid-fire decisions and coordinate simultaneous tasks. So, DeepMind will either emerge victorious from its marathon gaming sessions, or be mad as hell at being taken out by a tween in Saskatchewan. Apparently teaching it to play the Sims was just too obvious.

KingMel Monday, November 7, 2016 - 5:19 pm · Reply This feedback to RonB applies to all types of labels – conservative, liberal, Republican, Democrat, etc. – that are used as a shortcut to define people and even entire platforms of beliefs and attitudes. You should consider just what that label means to you. What are you saying about yourself when you affiliate with that label? You should consider your attitudes and beliefs that you lump under that label. Are you saddling yourself with viewpoints and biases defined by people/organizations who are seeking to promote their agendas for personal gain – power, fame, and money? Are you such a simple, two-dimensional person that a one or two word label can even come close to being accurate? What beliefs/attitudes do you actual share with others who apply the same label to themselves? To what degree do you actually support all of the aspects of the platform of your chosen political party? Labels are being used to divide America. They are being used as a tool to oversimplify a situation so that it can be more easily be attacked – label and disparage. Labels are being used to incite distrust and hatred among the populace. Ask yourself, “Who benefits from this chaos and gridlock within our government?” “Who is driving this division towards the extremes?” The American people are being played, and the various people/organizations involved are all attempting to blame the others while claiming that virtue is on their side. Be part of the solution, not part of the problem. Rather than emphasizing the differences between you and others, seek to identify the similarities, the shared interests and goals. Promote compassion over disdain, cooperation over division, understanding over callousness disregard, reason over emotion, knowledge over ignorance, inclusion over exclusion Do not allow yourself to be manipulated by the tools of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Be willing to open yourself up to seriously contemplate different ways of thinking and different beliefs. They may have some merit. Exercise your humanity.

 Apple and Samsung’s combined smartphone market share is the lowest it’s been in five years Jeff Dunn Nov. 7, 2016, 2:13 PM 2,572 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   If you were to stop a random person on the street at any point in the past half-decade and ask them to name two smartphones, there’s a good chance they’d say (1) the iPhone and (2) the Samsung Galaxy. That'd make sense. Apple and Samsung have been the two dominant forces in the mobile market, they’ve spent a ton on marketing, and, especially in recent years, each of their flagship devices have been well-received. As a result, the two have consistently held a big chunk of smartphone market share. They still do today. But, slowly but surely, that grip has slipped. As this chart from Statista shows, while Samsung and Apple lead the pack, that’s only good for about a third of the market. More specifically, according to recent data from analyst firm IDC, the two make up 32.5% of the market. (With Samsung at 20%, and Apple at 12.5%.) If you dig through the archives, that’s the lowest combined number for the pair since Q1 2011, when IDC had them at 29.6% of the smartphone market. To give you some perspective: Back then, Nokia was not only not dead, it was number one. BlackBerry was not only still making phones, it was called Research in Motion, and it had only just been passed by the iPhone. Fast forward to today, and the smartphone boom is over. iPhone growth has stalled (and may not be done dropping), and the Samsung phones that don’t explode have dipped recently, too. Rising behind them is a set of up-and-coming Chinese vendors — Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo — which have blown up in their home country, and are making gains elsewhere due to largely affordable hardware. While it’s unlikely that those companies will gain the US audience they’d need to overtake an Apple — and while market share itself isn’t really an indicator of profitability — the gap has shrunk.

Ask yourself, “Who benefits from this chaos and gridlock within our government?” “Who is driving this division towards the extremes?” The American people are being played, and the various people/organizations involved are all attempting to blame the others while claiming that virtue is on their side. Be part of the solution, not part of the problem. Rather than emphasizing the differences between you and others, seek to identify the similarities, the shared interests and goals. Promote compassion over disdain, cooperation over division, understanding over callousness disregard, reason over emotion, knowledge over ignorance, inclusion over exclusion Do not allow yourself to be manipulated by the tools of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Be willing to open yourself up to seriously contemplate different ways of thinking and different beliefs. They may have some merit. Exercise your humanity.

The new beta adds support for the limited Single Sign-On feature. We also expect Apple to unlock the new TV app in this beta as well, but that’s not confirmed as of now. It’s highly not recommended to run this beta as it may cause problems with your Apple TV down the road. However, to proceed: head to Apple’s Developer portal and download the necessary profile to your Mac or PC. Plug the device in via the USB-C port on the back of your Apple TV and fire up iTunes. From there, tap Option (Mac) / Shift (Windows) + Update and select the profile. Once completed, head over to your Apple TV’s settings > system > Software Update. If it does not appear, reboot your Apple TV and it should prompt you to update. If you spot anything interesting, be sure to leave us a comment below!

To install the update, the Apple Watch must have 50 percent battery, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the iPhone. watchOS 3.1 requires an iPhone running iOS 10 to install. As a minor 3.1.x update, watchOS 3.1.1 appears to focus on under-the-hood bug fixes and performance improvements, with no outward-facing changes discovered in the first watchOS 3.1.1 beta. We'll update this post should any new features be discovered in the second watchOS 3.1.1 beta. watchOS 3 completely overhauls the interface on the Apple Watch, introducing a dedicated app dock, instant launch apps, new watch faces, and new complication options. There are new Activity sharing features, a "Breathe" app guides users through deep breathing sessions to cut down on stress, and an SOS feature can automatically call emergency service. For more details on what's new in watchOS 3, make sure to check out our watchOS 3 roundup.

Designed for the fourth-generation Apple TV, the tvOS 10.1 beta can be obtained by connecting the Apple TV to a computer with a USB-C to USB-A cable, downloading and installing the software from a registered developer account via iTunes or Apple Configurator. Once a beta profile has been installed on the device through iTunes, new beta updates will be available over the air. Many Apple TV owners are eagerly awaiting a promised Single Sign-On feature that will allow Apple TV users to sign in once with their cable credentials to access all available live cable content, and the feature has been introduced in the tvOS 10.1 beta. Not included is the new "TV" app that was announced at Apple's October 27 event. "TV" is meant to be a TV guide-style app that provides users with recommendations on what to watch and an easy way to discover new television content. tvOS 10, for those unfamiliar with the operating system, brings features like improved search, expanded Siri capabilities, a dark mode, a Continuity option for using the iPhone for text input, automatic app downloads, quicker access to live TV, and more.

Nov 07, 2016 Share Tweet 0 Image via Publicist Drake's Views has now racked up more than three billion streams on Spotify. As Billboard pointed out, Music Ally tallied up the total number of the album's streams and found that the album has been streamed 3,043,000,000 times as of Monday. This is an even more impressive feat considering the rapper originally released his latest studio album as an Apple Music exclusive back in April. The album didn't hit Spotify and other streaming services until May 13. By comparison, Views has been streamed more than a billion times on Apple Music, becoming the first album to do so on Apple's streaming service. Related Drake's 'VIEWS' Album Has Generated Over 1 Billion Streams Drake's 'Views' Is the First Album to Earn Over a Billion Streams on Apple Music Drake's "One Dance" Is Now the Most Streamed Song in Spotify History This isn't the only milestone Drake has reached on Spotify. In October, his No. 1 hit "One Dance" surpassed Major Lazer's "Lean On" to become the most-streamed song in Spotify's history with 924.5 million streams.  Still, the rapper has a significant history with Spotify's competition, Apple. The company premiered his "Hotline Bling" video as an exclusive. It has since gone on to spurn thousands of memes and join an elite group of videos with more than a billion views on YouTube. Drake also appeared on stage at the 2015 launch of Apple Music and signed a deal with the company worth a reported $19 million that included the launch of his own OVO Sound Radio show on its Beats 1 radio station. Drake recently announced his new project, More Life, which is set to drop in December. He debuted three of the songs from the album—"Sneakin," "Fake Love," and "Two Birds, One Stone"—on his Beats 1 show on his 30th birthday. In other news, Drake also fueled speculation about his joint project with Kanye West by posting a cryptic Instagram post on Monday morning.

Folks enrolled in Apple’s developer program can install the update via the over-the-air mechanism in the Settings app, or from the dev center. Beta 2 comes one week after the first beta was released, which revealed a number of user-facing changes and improvements like new wallpaper and emoji. Today’s beta adds onto that with Apple’s new TV app. Apple has also pushed out the second betas for watchOS 3.1.1 and tvOS 10.1. They seem to be more of maintenance updates, but we have noticed that Apple has quietly activated its Single Sign-On feature for beta users. Single Sign-On allows you to login with your [compatible] cable credentials once and gain access to all available content in installed apps. And of the course the TV app is the TV guide-like application introduced last month. See a notable change or improvement we’ve missed in the above betas? Let us know in the comments below! Update: here are some of the changes we’ve found so far in beta 2: Thanks Dox!

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search AT&T to lure DirecTV Now subs with free Apple TV or Fire TV Stick Chris Davies - Nov 7, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit AT&T plans to use a free Apple TV or Amazon Fire TV Stick to turn consumers weary of sky-high cable bills into DirecTV Now subscribers, documents inadvertently leaked by the company have confirmed. The service, which AT&T confirmed back in October will be priced at just $35 per month, is expected to offer both live and on-demand streaming. With it, the company hopes to get a bite of the growing cord-cutter market. That group of users – who now blanch at the idea of spending upwards of a hundred dollars per month on potentially thousands of cable TV channels they never get around to watching – are increasingly on the radar for companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Apple. Unlike many of those players, however. AT&T isn’t planning on making its own streaming hardware. Instead, the leak spotted by Variety suggests, it will offer sign-ups a choice of two well-known third-party devices to turn their existing TV into a smart set. DirecTV Now subscribers who commit to three months of service will get a free Apple TV in return. That seems a pretty good deal for users, given the streaming TV amounts to $105. A brand-new Apple TV is currently priced at $149 for the cheapest, 32 GB model. Those unwilling to give AT&T even three months commitment, however, will get one of Amazon’s Fire TV Sticks. That’s priced at $39.99, currently, complete with Amazon’s latest Alexa Voice Remote. It’s unclear at this stage whether AT&T plans to modify either of the devices before shipping them to subscribers, such as preloading the DirecTV Now app or even limiting access to other services each streamer normally has access to. Meanwhile indications of what sort of content users can expect from DirecTV Now are also now available. AT&T previously suggested upward of 100 channels would be offered, though exactly what will be included will depend on local markets. Still, there are some top-level names AT&T presumably hopes to use as a lure. That includes the Food Network, MTV, Nickelodeon, CBS, Bravo, NBC, and Cartoon Network. Further content will be offered in return for more monthly subscriptions. “With DirecTV Now,” the document claims, “you can stream live TV and On Demand programming with several packages to choose from. Premium channels like HBO and Cinemax can be added at any time.” For on-demand content, there’ll apparently be a 14,000 title strong catalog to sift through. On top of that, many of the networks will supposedly offer catch-up streaming. That will allow shows to be watched within the 72 hours following their original broadcast. A 7-day trial will be offered, and a free tier. Dubbed DirecTV Freeview, the latter will be supported by advertising and offer only a partial selection of its subscription-based counterparts. NOW READ: Apple TV 4th-gen Review Exactly when DirecTV Now will launch remains to be confirmed, and AT&T could well change the terms of its streamer promotion and its channel line-up in the intervening period. Still, if you’re in the market for a new set-top box and models from either Apple or Amazon have caught your eye, it might be worth holding off to give DirecTV Now a try.

Registered developers can download the second iOS 10.2 beta from the Apple Developer Center or over-the-air with the proper configuration profile installed. iOS 10.2 doesn't have a single main feature like Portrait mode in iOS 10.1, but it does offer several smaller feature tweaks. New emoji have been added in the update, including clown face, drooling face, selfie, face palm, fox face, owl, shark, butterfly, avocado, pancakes, croissant, and more. There are more than a hundred new emoji, including several profession emoji available in both male and female genders, such as firefighter, mechanic, lawyer, doctor, scientist, and more. Apple has also redesigned many existing emoji, adding more detail and making them look much more realistic. Along with new emoji, iOS 10.2 includes new wallpaper, new Music sorting options, a new "Celebrate" Screen Effect," an option for preserving camera settings, a Videos widget, Single-Sign On support for watching live TV via apps, and more. Apple has called iOS 10 its "biggest release ever" for iOS users, with a revamped lock screen, a Siri SDK for developers, an overhauled Messages app, a dedicated "Home" app for HomeKit users, new facial and object recognition capabilities in Photos, and redesigned Maps and Apple Music apps. What's new in iOS 10.2 beta 2: TV app - iOS 10.2 includes the "TV" app that was shown off at Apple's October 27 event. The app is designed to serve as a TV guide to help users discover new content and decide what to watch. SOS - There's a new SOS feature that will call emergency services when the power button on the iPhone is pressed five times. According to Apple's release notes, SOS works in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, UK, and US. Settings for SOS are available in the Settings app under the General section. Music - There are more prominent Shuffle and Repeat buttons available in the Music app when playing a song.

The TV app is meant to work across multiple devices, including iOS devices and the Apple TV, and as of today the TV app is available in the iOS 10.2 beta. Apple's new TV app works hand-in-hand with features like Siri Live Tune-In and Single Sign-On, simplifying the television-watching experience. In addition to a Library section that displays all the iTunes content a user has purchased, the TV app also features a "Watch Now" section that houses a collection of TV shows and movies from iTunes and other television apps a user has installed on an Apple TV or iOS device. An Up Next feature keeps track of TV shows and movies across devices so you can pick up where you were watching, whether in the middle of a movie or the next episode of a TV show, and there are lists of curated and trending TV shows and movies. A dedicated store lets users purchase content from iTunes or from other sources like HBO Go. The Store section also lets users sign in with their TV provider to find content available through an authenticated cable subscription. Apple's release notes state that the TV app isn't yet fully functional, and it does not appear to be available in the tvOS 10.1 beta just yet. Apple has said the TV app will see an official release in December.

Apple does what is important to Apple these days: generating sales. Forget the users, the users are dumb. Thanks, we've come a long way to realize that.

Publishers who put content on the app can still sell their own ads and will keep 100 percent of the revenue from any ads they sell. The new deal means that NBCUniversal, instead of Apple, will sell any remaining ad inventory. As before, publishers will keep 70 percent of those sales. In a note to her staff, NBCUniversal sales boss Linda Yaccarino said her organization would create a dedicated sales group for the app. Apple News underwhelmed publishers and advertisers when it launched in 2015, and it certainly hasn’t gotten the focus that similar efforts, like Facebook’s Instant Articles or Google’s AMP program, have received. But anecdotal reports indicate that the app, which comes pre-installed on Apple’s mobile devices, is getting more use now that Apple features it more prominently in its newest iOS 10 software. Apple won’t comment on detailed usage numbers, but says the app now has 70 million unique users. The sales deal is also a reminder that Apple, unlike most of its tech rivals, really doesn’t love the business of selling ads itself. Apple had previously used its iAd app ad network to backfill unsold inventory for Apple News. But earlier this year Apple shut down iAd, which had never taken off. And in general, after a brief flirtation with the ad business, Apple has basically conceded that it makes sense for other people to do, but not for Apple. CEO Tim Cook has even used Apple’s lack of an ad business as a tool to criticize ad-based competitors like Google. But Apple still isn’t ad-free. This fall it started selling search-based app advertising in its App Store. And if it gets more serious about breaking into the TV business, it will certainly have to grapple with ads there, since they fuel that industry. * NBCUniversal is a minority investor in Vox Media, which owns this site. recode_divider More From Recode Here’s how to watch our live interview with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff tonight Why wait for a new smart car when you can update your existing one?

In keeping with the trend, Apple on Monday released iOS 10.2 beta 2 for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. The new beta includes a number of refinements and enhancements, but let's be honest — the only thing people really care about are all the new emoji that will come along with Unicode 9.0 support. Shrug emoji? Check. Face palm emoji? Check. Clown emoji? Check. And there are plenty more where that came from... 72 in all, in fact. There are also a few new wallpapers in there, and a number of other additions like the arrival of Apple's new "TV" app, which was unveiled last month during the company's MacBook Pro event. DON'T MISS: Hey Apple, why are you trolling us? iOS 10.2 beta 2 is available immediately as an over the air (OTA) update, and it can also be downloaded from Apple's developer website and installed using iTunes. For the time being, it's only available to people who are registered for Apple's paid developer program (or users who follow the simple instructions to get around Apple's restrictions and gain access to developer betas), but iOS 10 public beta 2 should follow closely behind.

Here though, we have just two rivals going head-to-head: the 2016 Honda Civic RS and 2017 Hyundai Elantra SR Turbo. And, based on their most recent individual reviews – the Civic RS scoring 8/10 from Mike Costello, the Elantra SR Turbo scoring the same from Matt Campbell – this has the potential to be a rather close-fought little battle. The cars Intended to be the sportiest 10th-generation Honda Civic sedan model currently available, the 2016 Honda Civic RS is sharply styled and sharply packaged. In a notable departure for the Japanese brand, it also teams a familiar front-wheel-drive layout with a brand-new turbocharged engine. Fresh for the upcoming model year, the 2017 Hyundai Elantra SR Turbo too – as its name suggests – incorporates a turbocharged engine. Also front-wheel drive, the SR Turbo sits atop the all-new sixth-generation Elantra range, with the South Korean car maker claiming the more aggressive-looking variant genuinely sports some ‘hot’ potential. We shall see… The Plan Despite both cars wearing ‘sporty’ badges – RS for the Honda and SR for the Hyundai – neither is a hard-core circuit weapon. Hence, while our 200km-plus road loop comprises plenty of curves and challenging bends (as well as urban and highway stretches), this test will be confined to public roads rather than a race track. We’re also not going it alone. For this particular twin test, we’ve called in Australian racing driver, and friend of CarAdvice, Emily Duggan. Previously competing in the Kumho Tyre Australian V8 Touring Car series, Emily spends most of her time racing her own 1998 Hyundai Excel – named Katie – in the Excel Cup. She’s also helped us out before, taking part in our Abarth 595C v Volkswagen Polo GTI comparison. Price and features As we said at the start, this is one comparison that could go down to the wire. And starting with price and features, it’s easy to see why. Priced from $31,790 (before on-road costs), the 2016 Honda Civic RS is exclusively available with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), paired to steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters. It rolls on 17-inch alloy wheels, and standard equipment includes keyless entry and push-button start, automatic LED headlights and daytime running lights, LED fog lights, rain-sensing wipers, heated front seats with an eight-way power adjustable driver’s seat and black leather-appointed upholstery, dual-zone climate control, a three-mode rear-view camera, a ‘LaneWatch’ blind-spot monitoring camera, and front and rear parking sensors. Additional goodies consist of an electric sunroof, electric parking brake with automatic brake hold, hill-start assist, rear privacy glass, a 10-speaker premium stereo, and a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Bluetooth connectivity and audio streaming, DAB+ digital radio, as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Cruise control with speed limiter is standard, although, radar-controlled adaptive cruise, an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, and satellite navigation, as well as automatic emergency braking (AEB), a road-departure mitigation system, forward collision warning, lane-departure warning, and lane-keep assist, are reserved for the $33,590 flagship VTi-LX model. Safety is addressed, however, with six airbags, two ISOFIX child-seat anchor points, and tyre pressure monitoring. Available with a choice of two transmissions, the 2017 Hyundai Elantra SR Turbo starts at $28,990 (before on-road costs) for the six-speed manual, and $31,290 (before on-road costs) for the seven-speed dual-clutch (DCT) automatic transmission, with paddle shifters, tested here. It too comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, as well as keyless entry and push-button start, automatic HID bi-xenon headlights and LED daytime running lights, rain-sensing wipers, heated front sports bucket seats with a 10-way power adjustable driver’s seat and black leather-appointed upholstery, dual-zone climate control, a rear-view camera with rear cross-traffic alert, and front and rear parking sensors. Additionally, the Hyundai comes with an electric sunroof, hill-start assist, cruise control, a six-speaker stereo, and a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Bluetooth connectivity and audio streaming, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. And while the Elantra SR Turbo trades the Civic RS’s electric parking brake for an ‘old fashioned’ manual hand brake, the Hyundai pips the Honda with its standard auto-dimming rear-view mirror, blind-spot monitoring, lane-change assist, height-adjustable front passenger seat, heated power wing mirrors, rear air vents, and ‘Smart Boot’ hands-free boot-opening feature. Although the Elantra doesn’t offer the Civic’s tyre pressure monitoring system, the former matches the latter with six airbags and two ISOFIX child-seat anchor points. Plus, the Hyundai is the only one of the pair to boast a five-star ANCAP safety rating (the Civic RS is yet to be tested). Cabins and practicality Regardless of which car gets your vote – or your cash – your daily commute will see you immersed in a largely dark cabin. Crack open the Civic’s heavier, ‘stickier’ doors and you’re welcomed by a wider array of more premium-feeling materials than in the Elantra, with scattered silver highlights breaking up the predominantly black interior. High quality touch points, such as the leather-wrapped gear lever and multifunction steering wheel, are joined by subtle grey stitching seen throughout the cabin, while the driver’s instruments feature a digital speedometer housed within a digital representation of an analogue tachometer. Up front, the Civic’s softly padded seats are vastly comfortable at first sit, and can be lowered well into the floor. They are short on bolstering, though, as well as lumbar support – the latter particularly a killer for long drives. Although some might view the Civic RS’s interior as more ‘refined’, the Elantra SR Turbo’s feels the sportier of the two, thanks largely to its leather-wrapped, flat-bottom multifunction sports steering wheel, red stitching highlights, alloy sports pedals and kick plates, and black headliner. The Hyundai is home to harder, scratchier, plastics and trims, and its floor-mounted boot and fuel flap releases do it no favours. However, its firmer, ‘Sport’-stamped seats are better bolstered, and more bucketed and supportive. Annoyingly though, the seats can’t be lowered enough – particularly frustrating for taller folk. Drivers are provided clear and simple instruments, comprising an analogue speedometer and tachometer, as well as a central digital speed readout. Storage is a funny one in the Honda, as, while the physical space for ‘stuff’ exists, the layout is more than a little ergonomically ‘clunky’. Oddly-shaped door pockets will accommodate larger drink bottles, but can prove somewhat limiting. A shallow, semi-enclosed centre console bin has a slidable armrest that tops two independent cup holders (one removable) and a USB input. There’s also a flat, rubber-lined shelf, forward of the gear lever, with a cut out designed to allow cables to run down to another storage shelf below, housing one USB and one HDMI input, as well as a 12-volt outlet. Frustratingly, in a bid to keep the Civic’s centre stack relatively uncluttered, key climate controls can only be accessed via a sub-menu on the central touchscreen – itself fiddly and unintuitive – and although the Honda’s indicator and wiper stalks are better damped than the Hyundai’s, the RS’s steering wheel controls are far ‘clickier’ than those in the SR Turbo. Relying on a simpler combination of two rotary dials, 10 buttons, and its own stand-alone digital display, the Hyundai’s climate controls are easier to use and quicker to become familiar with, while its central touchscreen is ahead of the Honda’s in terms of general usability. Storage in the Elantra too is more ‘conventional’. There are two rubber-lined cup holders between driver and front passenger, a lidded cubby at the base of the centre stack – housing one AUX and one USB input, a cigarette lighter, and a 12-volt outlet – a slideable lid atop an amply-sized centre console bin containing a second USB input, and a roof-mounted sunglasses holder. Pleasingly, both cars feature adjustable seat belt heights, rake- and reach-adjustable steering wheels, and 60:40 split-fold rear seats. Sadly, while the Civic scores automatic up/down power windows for all four doors, only the Elantra’s driver’s window can offer the same. Moving to the back seats and, again, things are closely fought. With wider rear door apertures slightly aiding ingress and egress into and out of the Elantra, the Civic wins back ground with its basic but comfortable rear bench providing more physical seat base (outboard) to passengers than the Hyundai’s more firmly padded rear seats. Although both cars offer impressive rear legroom for small sedans, it’s the Honda that wins for outright space behind the front seats. The Japanese car further pips its South Korean rival – even if just by a nose – in the toe-room stakes too. Head-room is fairly evenly matched, with both cars offering reasonable clearance for those six-foot and below. Any taller, though, and you may struggle in the back of either car. That said, only the Elantra, with its flat floor, makes three across the second row easily achievable – the Civic’s notable rear floor hump limiting middle-seat practicality. Rear seat occupants in the Hyundai are bestowed adequate rear door pockets, one netted map pocket, a fold-down centre armrest with two cup holders, and those previously mentioned rear air vents. Those in the back of the Honda also receive compact rear door pockets, one map pocket, and a fold-down centre armrest with two cup holders. However, in the Civic, the armrest flaccidly rests on the middle seat – rather than holding a more useful and comfortable square position such as that in the Elantra. The Civic’s lack of rear air vents could also be a plausible deal breaker for some buyers. Continuing back, and it’s the Honda Civic RS that wins the boot war against the Hyundai Elantra SR Turbo – 517 litres with the rear seats up, versus 458L. Access to the Honda’s vast rear end does require negotiating a slightly taller load lip, but it is more spacious than the Hyundai’s – despite actually measuring fractionally smaller at its narrowest point. Oddly, neither boot is home to any ‘handy for shopping’ luggage hooks, and, although both conceal under-floor, space-saver spare wheels, both also still employ outdated, and less-than-ideal, gooseneck hinges. Dropping the rear seats in either car requires an identical two-step process – pulling boot-mounted releases first, then manually dropping seats forward from inside the cabin. However, a clever addition of carpet in the Honda reduces the introduced seat-base lip. Handy. On the road Sat side-by-side, particularly in these two hues – Cosmic Blue for the Civic, Blazing Yellow for the Elantra (a $495 mica paint option) – it’s obvious which brand is going for the sportier image. With its body kit, silver and red ‘SR’ badging, ‘Turbo’ front grille badge, silver grille and front bumper accents, black front lip and rear diffuser, integrated boot-lip spoiler, and twin chrome-tipped exhaust, the 4570mm long, 1800mm wide Hyundai is doing its best to catch eyes. Measuring in 74mm longer and 1mm narrower than the Elantra SR Turbo, the Civic RS is more understated – despite its sharper and more angular lines, and that plastered on rear wing. Unique to its siblings, though, the Civic RS does feature a piano-black grille, piano-black B- and C-pillar garnishes, dark-chrome door handles, and, of course, a silver and red ‘RS’ tailgate badge. As we said at the start, both these ‘sporting sedans’ – as opposed to genuine sports sedans – are powered by turbocharged engines. Under the bonnet of the Honda lies a turbocharged 1.5-litre direct-injection four-cylinder engine, with 127kW of power at 5500rpm and 220Nm of torque between 1700-5500rpm. Without the aid of any engine stop/start technology, Honda claims the powerplant will drink 6.0 litres of 91-octane unleaded fuel every 100km (on the combined cycle). Bringing more poke to the fight, the Hyundai is spurred on by a turbocharged 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine, with 150kW of power at 6000rpm and 265Nm of torque between 1500-4500rpm. Also sans any engine stop/start technology, Hyundai claims the turbocharged Elantra will use 7.2L of 91-octane unleaded fuel every 100km (on the combined cycle). Underneath, both cars feature MacPherson struts up front, and multi-link independent rear suspension (IRS) out back. The Honda rides on 215mm-wide, 50-aspect Bridgestone Turanza tyres, with 282mm ventilated discs up front, and 260mm solid discs out back. The Hyundai’s standard Hankook Ventus tyres are 225mm wide and 45-aspect, and encircle 305mm ventilated front discs and 262mm solid rears. Based on official tare weight figures, at 1385kg, the Elantra SR Turbo is up 54kg on the 1331kg Civic RS. And, while both models share an identical 1563mm rear track, the Hyundai has a fractionally wider front track. Making our way out of town and onto the highway, again, it quickly becomes evident which car has been set up, from the outset, to be sportier in nature. Around town, the Honda impresses with its quiet cabin, supple and compliant ride, and easy manoeuvrability. The CVT is mostly unobtrusive, and Honda’s ‘Motion Adaptive’ electric power steering, while light in terms of weight as well as feedback, is quick, if a little lacking in engagement. Over the same terrain, the Hyundai can’t quite match the Honda for cabin hush, though, its locally-tuned suspension – albeit firmer – is impeccably well resolved, while being almost as pliant as the Civic’s over potholes, speed humps, and the like. The Elantra’s seven-speed dual-clutch transmission is a vastly improved unit to the one initially launched in the 2015 Series II Hyundai Veloster SR Turbo – the same model the Elantra SR Turbo’s revised engine is sourced from. And, while weightier than the Honda’s, the Hyundai’s motor-driven power steering is just as responsive, yet far more communicative. On completion of our highway run, the Civic averages 5.1L/100km to the Elantra’s 5.2L/100km. Still nothing in it. Off the highway and into the hills, this is the chance for us, and Emily, to drive the cars back-to-back through a variety of corners, and over a range of sealed surfaces. Jumping out after her first back-to-back, Emily says, “I started in the Hyundai, but as soon as I drove the Honda, you can completely tell the difference.” “The Honda just glides through corners, where the Hyundai you more have to ‘manoeuvre’. And, even though I like having to work for it on the race track, for everyday driving, some people don’t want that.” With its combination of light, consistent, and accurate steering, a softer yet generally well composed ride, and overall comfort, the Honda Civic RS feels amply accomplished out on a twisty backroad… provided you keep enthusiasm in check, that is. Teaming weightier steering with a firmer ride and more cabin noise, the Hyundai Elantra SR Turbo might fall fractionally short of the Civic RS when driving sedately, but up the pace, and it quickly becomes apparent that the Honda can’t quite keep up with the more exuberant Hyundai. “Racing my Excel, I already had a love for Hyundais, so I was hoping the Elantra SR Turbo was going to be good,” Emily says. “You have to work for it a bit, you’ve got to push it, you’ve got to drive it a bit more, but even though it feels firmer on the road, it’s stuck there. You’ve got stability and manoeuvrability. “In the Hyundai, when you’re going through a corner, you have to work for the rewards. So, if you go through a corner at say 60km/h, you’re not really working for it. But if you want to go through it at say 100km/h, you’ve got to work for it, but it’ll do it. “The Honda is really nice, but the Hyundai is so much more entertaining.” Although the Civic certainly has reasonable levels of dynamism, its light steering is short on feedback, making for a disconnected, less involving, driving experience. Its softer set up means the car rides really well the majority of the time, however, it also equates to more roll and lean. And along with having a rear end that doesn’t mind coming out when pushing hard through corners, the Civic isn’t the biggest fan of mid-corner ruts and corrugations – the only road imperfections to notably upset the ride. Response from either alloy sports pedal is short of immediate, but while the brake delivers progressive and measured retardation when depressed, the throttle isn’t helped by being attached to an engine that feels far smaller than the 93cc that actually separates the Honda’s turbocharged engine from the Hyundai’s. Working in partnership with a now overly excitable CVT unit, the combination means even moderate speed increases result in revs jumping from just below 1500rpm, to up around 2500-3000rpm. And once the engine is delivering some decent surge from 3000rpm and beyond, the sound is not a pleasant one. By contrast, the more firmly sprung Elantra SR Turbo is more secure, planted, and stable, more capable and agile, far more confidence inspiring when pushing on through corners, and simply, more fun. Its heavier steering also brings with it more involvement, engagement, and communication. Over the same mid-corner ruts and corrugations the Civic didn’t enjoy, the Elantra is unfazed – even if you still very much feel them from inside the cabin – maintaining better compliance and composure through these types of harsher imperfections. The Hyundai also has grippier tyres, and firmer and more responsive pedals than the Honda. With the Elantra’s turbocharged engine offering 45Nm more torque than the Civic’s, and from 200rpm lower in the rev range, the Hyundai’s seven-speed DCT gearbox has less work to do than the Honda’s CVT. The gutsier and 23kW more powerful 1.6-litre engine is happy coasting along at close to 1800rpm, and when you do need to up the speed, there’s enough low-rpm urge between 1800-2500rpm to all but negate the need for any drastic gear changes. Even compared with the regular Veloster SR Turbo, the Elantra SR Turbo’s retuned engine works better, feels stronger and more responsive, and has greater flexibility and elasticity in its power delivery. And, measured against the Civic’s high-revving 1.5-litre, it also sounds better at higher rpm. The Hyundai Elantra SR Turbo may not quite be ‘hot’ in terms of outright performance, but, compared with the Honda Civic RS, it’s definitely on the warmer side than the more ‘tepid’ Honda. With our hills run in the books, the fuel consumption fight wraps up neck-and-neck – the Civic averaging 7.4L/100km, the Elantra 7.6L/100km. Warranty and servicing With both cars recommended for scheduled services every 10,000km or 12 months (whichever comes first), it’s the Honda that works out to be $333.00 dearer than the Hyundai to service over the first three years of ownership – totals coming to $1110.00 and $777.00, respectively. The highly competitive South Korean brand also takes the cake for aftersales, with the Elantra SR Turbo covered by a five-year/unlimited kilometre warranty with one-year roadside assist, versus the Civic RS’s standard three-year/100,000km warranty with no road-side assist attached. (An available ‘Honda Warranty Plus’ upgrade does boost coverage to five-years/140,000km and adds five years road-side assist, however, that option comes at a cost of $998.) Emily’s pick Using the metaphor of the Honda as someone dancing a waltz and the Hyundai as a hip-hop dancer, Emily reveals her final choice. “I’m going to pick the Hyundai for three reasons,” Emily says. “First, the interior. In the Honda, it’s like I’m in my own separate cabin. It’s got a beautiful seating position, but the layout really excludes the front passenger, where the Hyundai feels more open. “Secondly, I’m a driver who likes to work, so I’m going to go for the car that rewards you when you work for it. “And thirdly, I do not like the sound of the Honda’s engine and transmission. It just doesn’t sound good.” Not completely besotted by the Elantra, Emily adds, “However, one downside of the Hyundai, for me, is its slightly thicker A-pillar, which is more noticeable and occasionally annoying than the Honda’s. “Realistically, it’s not something that’s going to affect me, but it is a minus.” Verdict We knew from the start, this was going to be close. And it is indeed that. But, when you have two highly capable and competitively specced and priced cars, it’s important to look at their intended role and purpose. So, it all really depends on what you want out of your car, and what you want your car to be. If you’re after a largely comfortable (bar the shortfall in lumbar support), adequately powerful, easy to drive small sedan with a huge boot, some sporty details, and a more mature overall persona, the 2016 Honda Civic RS is a high-quality proposition worth considering. In this test, however, we’re talking about sporty, warm-to-hot sedans. And, if legitimate performance, stacks of ability, and an entertaining, engaging small sedan is what you’re looking for, the 2017 Hyundai Elantra SR Turbo is hard to beat. Apart from being the sort of car that can put a smile on your face by the time you get home from work, the Hyundai is also more affordable to purchase and service than the Honda, and offers key highlights above its rival – namely a five-star ANCAP safety rating, rear air vents, blind-spot monitoring and lane-change assist, and a better warranty. Moreover, if you’re keen on a cheeky ‘sleeper’ that could more than upset a few established sports car names, save even more coin and opt for the manual. You’ll have a blast.

When it comes to selling advertising, however, its skills don’t often get similar applause. In a sign that an outside party might be able to better maximize ad inventory related to Apple’s popular iPhones, the technology giant and NBCUniversal have struck a deal under which the Comcast media conglomerate will be the exclusive U.S. seller of commercial space in the Apple News app, which is pre-installed in all of the company’s operating systems and has more than 70 million active users. NBCU said it will also work to develop new advertising products around the app. The partnership was reported previously by tech-news site recode. Publishers who allow their content to be used in Apple News typically sell their own ad inventory and keep the revenue from those efforts. Apple has sold whatever space may remain, and is turning that function over to NBCU. Publishers typically split revenue from those efforts with Apple, and are expected to continue to work with similar terms with NBCUniversal. The deal shows NBCU digging deeper into digital opportunities. In recent months, thanks to the company’s investments in digital outlets like Buzzfeed and Vox, NBCU has offered to sell packages designed to win higher-quality audiences online. Many of the nation’s big media companies have tried to extend into digital inventory as their audiences move from TV to streaming video and mobile devices. And it could give NBCU entrance to new opportunities. Apple continues to develop a broadband-TV service that could over time feature advertising. NBCU named James Kreckler, a senior vice president, to oversee a new sales group that will focus specifically on developing products related to the sale of ad inventory around Apple News. ” Under James’ leadership the group will work closely with advertisers and publishers to develop unique and engaging campaigns across the News app’s premium content,” the company said in a prepared statement.

The discounts get you 25% off the displays for the new MacBook and MacBook Pro notebooks that support USB-C. As of right now, the LG UltraFine 5K display is listed for $974 on Apple’s website, down from the original $1299 pricing. Unfortunately, the display isn’t available to order yet and isn’t expected to until December. The 4K version is now $524, down from the original $699 with a 5-6 week shipping estimate. This is kind of Apple considering that the new MacBook Pros went up in pricing following the refresh.

Based on the name, Jet White will presumably be a glossy white finish. Right now, the iPhone 7 series comes in five colors: Black, Jet Black, Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold. However, don’t get your hopes up too much. The source lacks any real details and would be out of Apple’s traditional product release cycle. Traditionally, Apple adds a new color option with its next-generation redesigns. For example, they added the Gold color with the iPhone 5s, Rose Gold with the iPhone 6s, and Black and Jet Black with the iPhone 7. The only exception would be the white iPhone 4, which released months after the black model in June of 2010. However, the white model was announced alongside the original iPhone 4 with the intention of shipping at the same time, but was delayed due to manufacturing issues. While Macotakara has a decent track record regarding Apple products, it seems to not be confident in this report with it saying “this information may be unreliable.” Tags: iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Jet White About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology. He conceits himself by religiously rocking the Apple brand. You can find him on Twitter @iPeterCao.

This is in addition to the discounts being made on the LG UltraFine 4K and 5K displays. Starting today, Apple’s USB-C accessories will have lower pricing up until December 31, with a few exceptions. USB-C to USB Adapter ($19 → $9) Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter ($49 → $29) USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter ($69 → $49) USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter ($69 → $49) USB-C to Lightning (1 m) ($25 → $19) USB-C Charge Cable (2 m) ($19) USB-C to Lightning (2 m) ($35 → $29) 29W USB-C Power Adapter ($49) 61W USB-C Power Adapter ($69) 87W USB-C Power Adapter ($79) While Apple is offering no discounts on its power adapters, the company is discounting third-party USB-C accessories sold through its retail locations as well, which includes SanDisk’s USB-C SD card reader which went from $49 to $29. Here’s Apple’s official statement: “We are extremely excited about the new MacBook Pro, which is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made. It has the fastest CPU, graphics, memory, storage and I/O, best display, the innovative Touch Bar and more. MacBook Pro uses the most advanced industry-standard connector, USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, to provide maximum performance, expandability and compatibility. “We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple’s USB-C adapters and cables.” Tags: MacBook, MacBook Pro, Thunderbolt 3, USB-C About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

November 7 AAPL: 110.41 1.57 Apple News hits 70 million users as NBCUniversal inks exclusive deal to sell in-app ads Zac Hall - 1 week ago @apollozac apple news View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple announced at the start of this year that its iAd network was going away over the summer, which affected advertising in its story aggregating News app in iOS 9 and later. Today Recode is reporting that Apple has inked an exclusive deal with NBCUniversal that lets them run ad sales for Apple News. Publishers who put content on the app can still sell their own ads and will keep 100 percent of the revenue from any ads they sell. The new deal means that NBCUniversal, instead of Apple, will sell any remaining ad inventory. As before, publishers will keep 70 percent of those sales. In a note to her staff, NBCUniversal sales boss Linda Yaccarino said her organization would create a dedicated sales group for the app. The report notes that Apple will still allow publishers to sell their own ads, but NBCUniversal is picking up the ad sales business that Apple decided it didn’t want a part of earlier this year. The dedicated group within NBCUniversal that will be in charge of this effort suggests it will be a significant shift from Apple’s current advertising efforts within the News app. The change is set to take effect in January according to the report. Recode also reports that Apple says its News app is now up to 70 million unique users; Apple News is pre-installed on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch with iOS 9 and later, but the service is only available in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Apple News had around 40 million users this time last year. Nieman Lab has also published a piece that goes deeper into the numbers behind Apple News. The article dives into growth in Apple News readership that CNN and Bloomberg have seen since iOS 10: CNN, for example, says its Apple News content got 36.5 million unique readers in September, a major increase from August’s 5 million. Its pageviews also increased significantly to 274 million, up from 43 million a month before. The increase seems to be in part due to notifications from Apple News that started working after the iOS 10 redesign. CNN’s first alert through Apple News reached 188,000 users when iOS 10 launched in mid-September. That number increased to 3.7 million users by October 30. Bloomberg, too, has benefited from the update. Unique visitors to its Apple News content spiked 500 percent in October, thanks to a combination of regular inclusion in the Apple News “Top Stories” section and interest in its breaking news notifications. Monetization and seeing a similar effect across other publications like Slate, for instance, remains an opportunity as the piece details. The Apple News deal with NBCUniversal will likely tackle the first half of that equation. You can find 9to5Mac, 9to5Toys, 9to5Google, and Electrek on Apple News.
