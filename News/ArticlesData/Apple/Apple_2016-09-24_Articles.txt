Cupertino-based tech giant Apple has reportedly come to the city of Seoul in South Korea to look for a new place for a retail store. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple has been considering putting up a retail store in Seoul, and has checked various spots - one along the city's Garosu-gil shopping area and another one near Samsung 's flagship store in Gangnam. Like Us on Facebook The sources note that it might take a year before Apple may finally open a retail store in South Korea. Tech Crunch noted that, based on history, Apple scouts various places for possible retail locations, but some of these locations never become a reality, so it is better to take the news with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, the idea of Apple planting a retail store in rival Samsung's (and contender LG's) home turf is a pretty bold move. Apple currently relies on third-party sellers to penetrate the South Korean market, steadily and hopefully inching its way into the public's pockets. Market reports show that Apple was able to get a 25 percent share of the market in 2014 with the release of the iPhone 6, but saw a decrease to 10 percent during the second quarter of 2016. Having an official physical retail store in Seoul could help boost Apple's sales in an otherwise Galaxy-dominated market.  According to Apple Insider, analyst Lee Seung-Woo said that with Samsung's current predicament with the Galaxy Note 7, Apple just might get a significant boost in sales.

The new Allo app promises to be "smart," sort of. Its Google Assistant will butt in with restaurant recommendations when someone types, "Want to get sushi?" It can also send daily updates on weather and sports and will also suggest replies to your friends' messages. The idea is to keep the conversation flowing, so you don't have to constantly leave Allo to look up something else. Google is released the free chat app Wednesday, just a week after Apple updated its own Messages app with the iOS 10 software update. Messages works on iPhones and iPads, while Allo will work for iPhones and Android phones, but not tablets. Do you really need another chat app? Here's more on Allo to help you decide. Smart replies Allo can help cut down on typing on small screens by suggesting replies based on context. If a friend asks how you're doing, you can tap "Good tnx." Allo preserves chatting shortcuts such as "u'' for "you." Apple offers something similar on its smartwatch, but not phones or tablets. Allo will also analyze photos to suggest replies such as "beautiful smile" or "the skyline looks great!" — at least for photos with smiles or skylines. Remember that this is software, so its suggestions won't always make sense. Of course, you're free to type your own response. Sending a computer-generated reply to a friend can feel, well, deceptive. Worse, it might make your friend wonder if your response is genuine. And having the suggestions appear in oval bubbles in the chat can make it seem as though a stranger has joined the chat (though you can shut out Google by enabling incognito mode). Personal assistant When you're chatting with someone, you're often making plans. Google Assistant can retrieve information on nearby restaurants, movie times and even the weather. Everyone in the chat will see the Assistant's replies and can weigh in on the choices. In some cases, Google Assistant will even anticipate your needs, such as when someone's asking about getting sushi. An oval bubble appears with an offer to retrieve nearby sushi restaurants. After choosing one, you can tap for opening hours, directions or the menu. Reservations aren't available yet, though Google is considering third-party integrations such as OpenTable for dinner and Airbnb for accommodations. Apple's Messages doesn't invoke the Siri virtual assistant the same way, but it already offers integration with third-party apps so that you can make plans (and reservations) while chatting. Beyond planning, Google Assistant can give you the latest news and sports scores, translate phrases or do math calculations. Asking for directions will bring up Google Maps. Limited smarts The app's intelligence still feels, well, limited. Though Google Assistant is an evolution of the Google Now feature that has long been on phones, it doesn't do as much as Google Now in terms of identifying patterns or checking other Google services. For instance, if a friend asks you when your flight leaves, Allo won't try to suggest a reply, even though Google has your calendar. Likewise, Google Assistant won't automatically offer traffic conditions or transit schedules for your regular commute the way Google Now does.

You can request daily updates on the weather, news and sports. But you can't get automatic updates whenever the score changes or a game ends. Google calls its Assistant a preview. Following its debut on Allo, it will arrive on a smart speaker called Google Home this fall. Expressions Plain text is boring, so Allo features a slider that can make your messages and emojis larger or smaller. You can send one of hundreds of virtual stickers specifically designed for Allo. Apple's Messages app has a variation on this. You can make a message "loud," such that the chat bubble briefly gets larger. Or make it "gentle" and appear in small text. Sticker packs are also available through a new app store within Messages. One problem with both of these apps is that your friends need to be using the same app to see the desired effect. Google will send text messages to non-Allo friends, but without the special effects. Apple Messages will add notations such as "sent with Loud Effect" to those on Android or older versions of Messages. Too many apps? Beyond making its Assistant smarter, Google will need to persuade people they need yet another chat app, something that could be tough given that Google already offers four of them. Google's Hangouts text and video calling service will be targeted at business users. Allo is the consumer offering, but won't offer video calling. That's where the Duo app comes in. And while Allo accounts are based on your phone number, not your Google ID, you can't use Allo to receive regular texts. On Android, Google has Messenger for that.

Sep 26 2016 at 1:48 PM Updated Sep 26 2016 at 1:48 PM Save article Print Apple 'target' McLaren is a tech company disguised as a carmaker Share Share via Email Share on Google Plus Post on facebook wall Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit An early model McLaren supercar of which Roger Moore would be proud. Supplied by Christopher Jasper On the face of it, U.K. supercar maker McLaren would seem an odd partner for Apple as the consumer electronics and software giant seeks to crack the global auto industry. With its racetrack heritage and gas-guzzling models priced from 126,000 pounds ($165,000), Woking, England-based McLaren is a world away from the mainstream auto market, which Apple appears to be targeting and where it would face brands with a global profile to match its own. Yet McLaren's rich history in Formula One, the most elite level of auto racing, means the company has as much in common with Apple as it does with more-conventional carmakers such as Ford and General Motors. Formula One is a technology-led circuit in which engines and chassis are highly regulated and minute electronic enhancements can make the difference between winning and finishing last. McLaren has also achieved the transition from developer of industry-leading technology to a full-scale producer of street-legal cars in just six years, presenting a blueprint for making a splash in the auto market in short order. Apple is exploring a strategic investment with the carmaker, people familiar with the matter said, though both parties denied that talks are under way. "Getting into McLaren would give Apple engineering and carmaking competency at the pointy end," said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen. "This is about gaining research and development knowledge, not about about buying a carmaker with mass-production capabilities." Related Quotes 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

View full quote Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements Technical Advances McLaren was established by New Zealand-born race driver and car designer Bruce McLaren in 1963 and first competed in the Formula One world championship three years later. It ranks second only to Ferrari in the number of drivers' titles won. While the first decades of F1 were notable for buccaneering drivers such as Juan Manuel Fangio and Stirling Moss, the sport gradually came to be dominated by technical advances as its organisers introduced a host of performance and engineering limitations to help level the field. The curbs pushed teams to innovate to eke out incremental improvements and develop systems not yet limited by the governing body. McLaren was first to use carbon-fiber composites in its cars, developed an air-flow system that exploited a loophole in the rules to deliver a 6 mile-per-hour speed advantage and in 2009 won the first race using hybrid technology that stores up energy from braking to deliver a sudden burst of power. Lab Coats The two companies also share a design ethos, with architects Foster + Partners Ltd. creating Apple's "spaceship" headquarters in Cupertino, California and the McLaren Technology Centre in Woking. The heart of the auto company's operations features a glass-fronted building that combines with an artificial lake to form a yin-yang shape. Next door stands the McLaren Automotive production centre, where staff members wear white coats and clutter is banned. The 50 million-pound factory opened in 2011, two years after McLaren Chairman Ron Dennis announced that the race team planned to start manufacturing cars for the public. It had dipped a toe in the water in the 1990s with the McLaren F1 model, of which only about 100 were built. Sales of the company's 200-mile-per-hour autos increased for a fifth straight year in 2015, prompting it to expand the engineering workforce by 40 percent and to target production of 4,000 cars annually as early as 2017. Italian sports-car maker Ferrari plans to build about 8,000 vehicles next year. Project Titan Apple already has hundreds of car engineers in a special projects group called Project Titan. The auto team includes three main groups: one focused on software, another on self-driving sensors and a third on mechanical hardware. The approach gives it the option of marketing any platform technology it creates to carmakers or selling its own automobiles. Closely held McLaren is more than 55 percent owned by Bahrain Mumtalakat Holding, the investment arm of the kingdom of Bahrain. The next two biggest shareholders are TAG Group, a Luxembourg-based holding company, with 11 percent, and Dennis, who owns 10 percent and is still regarded as a key figure, having run the race team in its heyday. McLaren is valued at 750 million to 1 billion pounds, according to Richard Hilgert, a Chicago-based analyst with Morningstar. Analysts at Evercore ISI said Thursday in a note that Apple may just be targeting the McLaren Technology racing arm -- led by Dennis -- which would be attractive for its experience in predictive data analytics, simulation, advanced manufacturing and electronic components. Dennis, as "the driver behind McLaren," is likely to be part of the attraction, Dudenhoeffer said. "He's always had the drive and passion to pursue goals that are difficult to get to, so from that perspective it would be a good fit with Apple too."

Tags : Apple-Apple+ Apple opened its very first physical Apple Store in Mexico yesterday.  A tweet from Apple CEO Tim Cook said, "¡Gracias México por recibirnos!" Translated, Cook's missive read, "Thanks for welcoming us, Mexico!" While the store opened on Saturday, people were already waiting on line at 7pm on Friday night. The name of the location is Apple Vía Santa Fe and the tech titan is planning on building two more stores in Mexico City, with one being considered a global flagship. Apple is hoping to use the new stores in Mexico as a gateway to other countries like Argentina, Chile and Peru. The new Apple Store in Mexico features a custom 37-inch television screen, a Genius Bar, custom wooden cabinets and tables, and room for in-store classes. Nearly 200 employees work at the store. Apple started an email campaign last week in an attempt to drum up visitors to visit the store. The promotion actually worked as thousands ended up visiting the brick and mortar location over the weekend.

I searched for a few of the stores you talked about and I can see that I was wrong. Thank you for the respectful correction. posted on 25 Sep 2016, 23:18 0 Reply 32.

It was noted that lines were much shorter this year and it was explained by the media that it was possible more people were buying iPhones online... The need for a physical Apple store is not really relevant, in my opinion. posted on 26 Sep 2016, 01:59 0 in response to #33 in response to #33 Hide Reply 36.

LuisF (Posts: 4; Member since: 15 Oct 2016) A lot of people in Mexico (probably most) are just too afraid to buy online because of the high rates of credit card fraud and prefer physical stores. Therefore, all this years they've been buying from premium resellers such as ishop or macstore who do have physical stores all over the country but have a more limited stock of products and accessories, instead of buying directly from Apple via the website. Not to mention that the in-store tech service and genius bar were unavailable to customers in Mexico until now (resellers do not offer a genius bar and for service and repairs they usually have to send the devices to the US, though presumably they will now send them to Mexico City). posted on 15 Oct 2016, 21:27 0 Reply 41.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     10th Anniversary Apple IPhone 8 Rumors In One Place Posted: Oct 29 2016, 8:27am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple   All Images Source: Steel Drake   Apple has recently announced iPhone 7, but next year will be really special. Its iPhone's 10th Anniversary and we might see iPhone 8 with an all new design and some really nice improvements. Here are all the rumors regarding iPhone 8. Apple just recently launched iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but rumors regarding iPhone 8 have already begun. iPhone 7 gave way to rather a small amount of upgrades meaning that Apple might be holding back the real deal for iPhone 8. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals It will be Apple's 10th anniversary next year and the new handset is thought to be released then. Just to mark the special occasion. The name of the next iPhone is still debatable.  Normally, according to Apple’s trends the new iPhone should be named as iPhone 7S, but in light of the fact that 2017 will be Apple’s 10th anniversary, it seems likely that a major change will take place. It seems rather unlikely that the new iPhone will get ‘’S’’ to its name. People are betting on Apple just skipping directly to the next full number and naming the new iPhone, iPhone 8.This marks the phone out as a big jump rather than a minor fresh. Release Date rumors: When is Apple launching its next big thing? iPhone 7 was just recently launched so some might consider it rather early to depict the release date of iPhone 8. Though 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the firm. Hence it probably will be launched around September 2017 keeping in accordance to iPhone traditions. What will the new Apple smartphone will be called? iPhone 8 or iPhone 7S. There is rather a hindrance in the speculation of the Apples new smartphone as 2017 marks its anniversary and Apple might mix it up a bit. The Wall Street Journal says: "Apple plans bigger design changes for 2017, the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone. Those changes could include an edge-to-edge organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen and eliminating the home button by building the fingerprint sensor into the display, according to people familiar with the matter." At a meeting with an Apple executive, one of the company’s China-based engineers asked why this year’s model [the iPhone 7] lacked a major design change in keeping with Apple’s usual two-year cycle. The answer, one person at the meeting recalled, was that the new technology in the pipeline will take time to implement. People familiar with the matter said some features that Apple hopes to integrate into iPhones, such as curved screens, weren’t ready for this year’s models," it added. In light of Apples history the iPhone 7 should be followed by the iPhone 7S but due to its 10th anniversary all of this might not happen. Apple may want to celebrate its anniversary with something completely new and different. Apple might not follow its naming trend as as iPhone SE is already a thing so maybe Apple will take chance on iPhone Pro, iPhone Anniversary Edition or even just iPhone. A former report from Nikkei had suggested that in 2017 there would be three new iPhone models. That depicted the usual 4.7- and 5.5in models, in addition a third new “Pro”model sporting a 5.5in or above curved screen. Though this wasn’t seen with the iPhone 7 maybe it will happen with the iPhone 8. iPone 8 new features and specs. Many of the fans are depending on the 10th anniversary of Apple to be the day they launch their best smartphone yet. With minute upgrades in iPhone 7. iPhone 8 seems to be the next big thing.Will there be massive queues? Only time will tell. iPhone 8 Manufacturing In Israel Herzliya, Apple is producing its new hardware for the next year’s iPhone and it is being referred to as the “iPhone 8”, in line to the statement made by an employee who spoke anonymously to the Business Insider. The employee is involved in the soldering components for Apple and gave rather lucid statements to how different the new iPhone will be from its former companion. This also gives weight to the rumors about iPhone 8’s massive redesign.  Tim Cook went to the Herzliya offices last year with rumored emphasis on storage space, processors, and communications chips being worked on by around 800 employees.   iPhone 8 Screen According to the Apple supplier Catcher Technology at least one iPhone in 2017 will support a glass body. This in addition to iPhone 8 having edge to edge OLED screen will make things rather interesting. iPhone 8 could see the display undergo its biggest change yet, with respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claiming that the iPhone 8 will have a curved AMOLED display. Back in March 2015 a patent file stated "The man-machine interface device comprises an electronic display apparatus that is capable of presenting graphic text, images, icons, and other data typically shown on a screen, while further including a transparent finger touch sensor region that is seated above the display apparatus."   Apple blogger John Gruber stated "the entire face will be the display. And the Touch ID sensor will be somehow embedded in the display. The front-facing camera will somehow be embedded in the display. The speaker, everything. All the sensors will somehow be behind the display." Rumors are that OLED display technologies will be used which will enable the iPhone to be thinner and consume less power. Reports depict that Samsung display is at the moment working on a flexible OLED for the firm and will invest billions to keep up with Apples massive order of up to 45000 panels a month.Economic Daily News also reported that Apples new handset may have a 3D display which does not require the use of 3D glasses. Further rumors state that the next iPhone might have a sidewall display although this was not seen in the iPhone 7. Update1:  Recently we heard that Sharp is now planning to spend more than a Half a billion dollars on OLED screen technology. One wonders why it is so keen in this investment well our recent sources tell us that Apple is gearing up Sharp to be its key supplier for OLED screens to be used in its iPhone 8. If this really happens to be true and Sharp does prove to be a potential supplier of these OLED screens which are going to be incorporated in to the iPhone for the first time then Sharp has a lot to maintain this deal. Sharp will have to sustain the ability of meeting Apple’s strict quality control system as well as keep up with demand for the volume of such OLED screens.  The keenness expressed by Sharp to spend a tremendous amount on this OLED screen technology is a clear sign that the company sees a big Apple contract dangling in front of it eyes. Update 2: The iPhone 7 has left every one mesmerized and it is certainly the best smart phone you can get with your money. However many are in wait for the iPhone 8 which is rumored to have a bezel less screen. It will not have a space right at the top and at the bottom we currently see in the iPhone. But instead will have the home screen button right under the display screen. Also the inclusion of OLED screens manufactured by Sharp are also expected. We just can’t wait to see what iPhone 8 has in store for us. Update 3: Since the release of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus more rumors are surfacing. The latest rumor is that the iPhone 8 will come in three sizes instead of the typical two. The company is also rumored to give up its aluminum rear for a glass back. The iPhone 8 will be redesigned completely and fans just can’t wait for its release already. iPhone 8 Design The last three iPhones showed that Apple is stuck with the same design.however a change might be seen in iPhone 8.Although Apple has done some fine tuning to Phone 7 design but still it really feels outdated now. Rumors depict iPhone 8 will support a ceramic back as well as a curved screen. The Wall street journal stated that John Ive wants the iPhone 'to appear like a single sheet of glass'. That rumor has since been given more weight, with the CEO of the company behind the iPhone's metal casing claiming that one model of the phone "will adopt glass casing next year."It was heard for the iPhone 7 that its camera will not protrude like its predecessors but flush against the back. These design changes we not present in iPhone 7 perhaps they may appear in iPhone 8. The massive redesign in the iPhone 8 is said to carry an all glass-body, edge to edge display with the cameras and Touch ID present in it. There might be no traditional Home Button, and potentially wireless charging. iPhone Processor The next iPhone is speculated to include an Apple A11 built on a 10nm process. With the iPhone 7 Apple has already surpassed all the benchmark results and with the next Anniversary iPhone we can expect Apple to continue showing crazy improvements when it comes to performance of its chips. Update 1: Apple’s alleged supply chain has given us a rather wild speculation today. Rumor has it that TSMC is well ahead of schedule for its performance nodes. Thus quite surprisingly the iPhone 8 will jump not only one but two step ahead in term of performance nodes i.e. 7nm from its predecessor such as the iPhone and iPhone 7 plus. Although this news is pretty exciting but at the same time it is quite hard to believe. Such a jump would really need some copious black magic to occur in reality. iPhone 8 Wireless Charging The new iPhone in 2017 will feature wireless charging for the first time.The reason that iPhone has not previously made use of this technology is because it had never worked through aluminum. However QUALCOMM has enabled the use of wireless through any metal, so at least it’s a possibility for Apple. This new technology does not require a wireless charging mat or dock rather the signal travels up to at least 15ft and can charge up to 12 devices at once. iPhone 8 Home button   It is reported that the iPhone will not have a home button,at least not a physical one . It will be present within. There are farfetched rumors circling around which state that the new iPhone Touch ID finger print sensor, could be built in on the entire display, which makes the elimination of the home button easier and making space for a larger display without increasing the overall size of the smartphone. iPhone 8 Retina Scanner Features such as facial recognition or iris scanner maybe seen in the new handset. If Apple removes the home button then the Touch ID will be replaced by the iris scanner. Apple iPhone 8 security: The iPhone 8 may tighten up security, as an apple patent details a system that could get a thief's fingerprints and photo, as well as recording audio, videos and their location. iPhone 8 Built–in e-SIM Rumors have it that the new handset might support e-Sim which will end the days for the traditional SIM card. Samsung and Apple both are discussing with the GSMA to use e-SIM in the future handsets, The benefits of a e-SIM is that you can switch between operators without having to insert a specific SIM card. iPhone 8 Reversible USB charger   It is also predicted that the new iPhone will have a new iPhone charger, with a Lightning connector on one end and a reversible USB connector at the other end. If these rumors are to be believed, we might see iPhone 8 once again rule the smartphone industry. Apple from the past few years are reluctant to experiment with some crazy ideas. I really feel Apple has stopped innovating and is refining things rather than making bold decisions and no I don't consider removing a 3.5mm jack a bold one. Stay tuned as we update this post with all the latest rumors regarding iPhone 8. Dual Sim Rumors have it that the iPhone 8 may include a Dual sim since the US Patent and trademarks office has published an application from Apple. This application indicates the iPhone 8 may include a Dual Sim and also describes how the ‘Dual standby’ would operate. Patently Apple states that you will be able to maintain two active radio calls at the same time. Apple has also stated that is patent filing may also apply to other devices such as Apple watch, MacBook and other wearables too.

By Jason Hiner | September 25, 2016 -- 22:00 GMT (15:00 PDT) | Topic: Innovation On Monday, Google is launching an interactive 4K promo on the largest electronic billboard in Times Square. Image: Google The iPhone 7 was billed as a massive letdown long before Apple officially unveiled it on September 7. But, a curious thing happened when the new smartphone was actually released. It turned into a surprise hit--with generally strong reviews and brisk sales. SEE: 8 reasons why professionals should get the iPhone 7 (TechRepublic) Some of this was due to Apple's solid execution on the right things: improved camera features, longer battery life, and twice as much storage. Yet, much of it was also due to a master stroke in the expectations game. Throughout 2016, Apple did little to counter the negative press and speculation leading up to the iPhone 7 announcement. In fact, it wouldn't have been unlike Apple to have leaked the information earlier in the year that the iPhone 7 wasn't going to get a major redesign the way most new iPhones do every other year. All of the rumors, reports, and leaked images from Apple partners pointed to the iPhone 7 being more of an incremental update like the "S" models that Apple releases every two years, followed by a tent pole redesign in 2017 on the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone. When you add that to the fixation around Apple getting rid of the 3.5mm headphone jack--which, of course, it did--the expectations for the iPhone 7 were at historic lows heading into September. That made it easy for Apple to soar over the low bar that had been set. A camera upgrade, a stair-step improvement in battery life, and a storage kick-up that was long overdue wouldn't have normally gotten people very excited. But, all three were bigger improvements than expected. And while the iPhone 7 didn't get a full-on redesign, the new Jet Black and Matte Black models looked different enough--and slick enough--to be new and shiny. They were also better than what the tech press and Apple customers had been anticipating. So again, the expectations game played a big part of what's shaping the iPhone 7 into an Apple win. SEE: iPhone 7 sales may reach 100m in 2016 due to Note 7 recall: Analysts As much as Apple is (rightfully) accused of sometimes overstating the value and originality of its products at launch events, the company also has a long history of skillfully managing the expectations game. The company is especially known for this in its Wall Street forecasts. It habitually under-forecasts its financial future and is very conservative in talking about growth. It almost always under-promises and over-delivers. Let's contrast that to how Google typically announces products. The search giant has a long history of being overly optimistic in its launches. And while it's hard not to love the company's enthusiasm for how tech can change the future, the result is that we're regularly disappointed by the results. There are countless examples, but let's zoom in on two: Google Wave and Google Glass. Announced at Google I/O 2009, Google Wave was hailed as "the e-mail of the future" that would blend formal written emails, instant messaging, photo sharing, and corporate collaboration. Instead, it turned out to be a confusing, overly chatty IM client and Google axed it the next summer. (Incidentally, yours truly named it one of the five worst tech products of 2009.) Teased out in the spring of 2012, Google Glass got its big splash at Google I/O that year when Sergey Brin jumped on stage and invited the audience to watch a team of skydivers leap from a plane above the Moscone Center and livestream their dive all the way down. The demo itself was a hit, but the product turned out to be slow, clunky, and disappointing. Two and a half years later, after failing to get a full-scale consumer launch off the ground, Google shuttered Glass in January 2015 and announced that it would be turned into an enterprise product. Google has said little to nothing about Glass since then. In both cases, Google had a product ahead of its time--Wave was a precursor to Slack and Glass had a jump on the onslaught of virtual reality and augmented reality headsets--but both products were doomed by the weight of their own expectations. Let's see if Google has learned any lessons from these missteps. The company is amping up to launch its first Google-branded smartphone on October 4. It's used Twitter, YouTube, and the new madeby.google.com site to help generate interest. The company has also kicked up the heat with a series of high profile billboards in New York City. And on Monday, Google is launching an interactive 4K promo on New York's largest electronic billboard in Times Square. SEE: Google teases October 4 for new rumored Pixel phones Of course, all this buzz means that the new Google Pixel phone better be good. Google hasn't yet shown that it's as skillful at managing the expectations game as Apple. It's a fine line to walk, where you generate interest and excitement for a new product and tell stories that create value around its strengths, while being careful not to overpromise its capabilities to the point that it can't live up to those expectations and creates disappointment. There's an important lesson there that we can all apply to business and life--whether it's communicating market share growth or taking your kids to see the latest Star Wars movie; opening a new international market or giving marriage advice to a newlywed friend. Mastering the expectations game is one of the secrets to business success, and general happiness. ZDNet Monday Morning Opener The Monday Morning Opener is our opening salvo for the week in tech.

Dan Levine San Francisco — The Globe and Mail Published Friday, Oct. 07, 2011 8:31AM EDT Last updated Friday, Oct. 07, 2011 11:00AM EDT Comments AA Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and his wife placed at least three properties into trusts in 2009, which legal experts say is a sign the secretive Apple chief may have been ensuring that his assets aren’t disclosed upon his death. The ownership transfers occurred while Mr. Jobs was on a medical leave from Apple, public records show. AP Video Apple Video: Wozniak remembers friend Steve Jobs Mr. Jobs died Wednesday at age 56 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. He had stepped down as Apple chief executive in August. It is unclear whether Mr. Jobs put his stock and other non-real estate assets into similar trusts, but if he did, it may be difficult to determine how they will be divided. Placing stock and real estate into trusts can both minimize estate taxes upon a person’s death, and keep assets from being publicly disclosed in probate court, said John O’Grady, a trusts and estates attorney in San Francisco. “The details may never emerge if [Mr. Jobs]did it right,” Mr. O’Grady said. “The details emerge when they mess it up.” In addition to his Apple stock holdings, Mr. Jobs amassed a fortune through his sale of Pixar to Disney, receiving roughly 138 million Disney shares in 2006, according to securities filings. Forbes Magazine pegged Mr. Jobs’ total wealth at $7-billion as of September 2011. Real estate transfers in California are recorded in county records. Land records indicate that Mr. Jobs took estate planning steps with some properties in Silicon Valley. The Northern California accounting firm, Howson & Simon, is listed on all of the transfer records. Jeffrey Howson, a CPA at the firm, declined to comment Thursday. For several years, Mr. Jobs and his wife Laurene co-owned their home with a front lawn dotted with apple trees in Palo Alto, California. They also owned two neighboring properties in nearby Woodside, public records show. In March 2009 – two months after Mr. Jobs took his second medical leave of absence from Apple – Mr. Jobs and his wife transferred ownership in all three properties to two different trusts, land records show. Mr. Jobs returned to Apple that June after undergoing a liver transplant. Besides estate planning, the only other reason that an individual might place assets into a trust is to shield them from potential creditors, Mr. O’Grady said. However, that is an unlikely scenario given Mr. Jobs’s vast wealth, he said. California law directs wills to be filed in court within 30 days of a person’s death, though estate attorneys say those deadlines are rarely enforced. And, the document itself may not contain much information if Mr. Jobs put his assets into trusts before he passed away, said Janet Brewer, a trusts and estates attorney in Silicon Valley. In that case, Mr. Jobs’ will would merely say that everything is left to the trustee, she said. The assets would be then administered according to the trust rules, which are almost always private.

As a mom of two kids – one who is already interested in technology and how it works – a program designed specifically to teach the fundamentals of Apple’s new coding language (Swift was unveiled in 2014, set to replace Apple’s more complicated Objective-C language) to the next generation of coders sounded like an excellent idea. Once my iPad was updated to iOS 10, I set out to download Swift Playgrounds… but not for my kids. As somebody who has zero experience with Swift, I was actually more interested in how the program would work for adults who had no idea what they were doing. Although I don’t have any experience using Swift, I once was very interested and involved in coding other languages, namely HTML and CSS. At the tender age of 12, I discovered a website called Neopets. Neopets was an expansive website whose main allure was to take care of your own virtual pets. However, Neopets also had opportunities for users to set up and maintain shops, play games, chat with others users on forums, personalize user pages, and create “Guilds” based on personal interests, which other users may join. With Neopets, you had the option of personalizing user pages and guild pages using HTML or CSS, which I quickly realized was key if you wanted things to look really good. There was an entire host of websites dedicated to “pre-made” layouts, complete with images and code, for free use to anybody who wanted them. While these worked for me for a little while, I eventually decided I wanted something less cookie-cutter and more unique. I would spend hours out of the day deconstructing the pre-made codes, figuring out what parts of the code did what, and applying them to new layouts that I created. I eventually became quite adept at coding (on Neopets, anyway) and I also learned a lot of valuable Photoshop skills. On a darker, unrelated note, my Neopets were almost always starving because I just didn’t care much for that aspect of Neopets. Thanks to Neopets, I learned the importance of coding and how complicated it could be. My path in life didn’t really elaborate on coding past Neopets, so when I quit the website sometime just before I entered high school, I completely dropped the hobby. With the arrival of Swift Playgrounds, however, I find that I had renewed interest in coding again, even if it is in a different language. I’ve been tinkering with the app for a couple of hours, and I have to say that I find it to be extremely easy to follow. With an app that’s made for kids, I guess it's what I should have expected all along. With that being said, I'm constantly amazed at how quickly kids catch on to user interfaces of all types; then again, it probably comes naturally if they're exposed to it early enough. Still, Apple really seems to have put a lot of thought into this program that makes it both easy to understand and interesting to use no matter what your age is. You start with simple coding commands. One of the things I like most about Swift is that it appears to use commands that directly reflect what you’re doing, using terms such as “turnLeft”, “moveForward”, “toggleSwitch”, and “collectGem”. These are easy to understand, and definitely help when going through your codes to find “bugs”, or issues within the code that break mechanics.   I’ve been using the app for about 2 hours total, and so far I’ve learned a few basic commands, how to create functions (combining multiple commands to create a new command that couldn’t have been done before), and how to create something called “for loops”, which is a type of code that regulates repetitive steps needed to complete a task. If I were to read this without ever having used Playgrounds, I would be extremely confused. But the fact that I’ve been able to spend 2 hours (which hasn’t felt like 2 hours at all – I swear, this is almost like playing a puzzle game) on this app and have learned this much really impresses me. While I’ve been aware of free coding websites and programs online before this, the fact that I can do this with my 3-year-old iPad Air is a convenience worth mentioning. I may not actually have any use for Swift coding at any point in the near future, but there’s also the very real possibility that someday I might; after all, coding is, and will continue to be, a desirable life skill. While Swift Playgrounds only gives you a taste of what Swift can do, it appears to be an excellent starting point for anybody interested in coding, whether you’re a kid or an adult.

A Texas lawsuit is raising the issue of whether mobile phone makers and wireless providers have a responsibility to prevent devices from being used by drivers in illegal and dangerous ways. Illustration: The New York Times Apple said to have a patent for tech that prevents texting while driving, but has not used it mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:00 AM, September 26, 2016 Updated: 8:38 AM, September 26, 2016 NEW YORK — The court filings paint a grisly picture: As Ashley Kubiak sped down a Texas highway in her Dodge Ram truck, she checked her iPhone for messages. Distracted, she crashed into a sport utility vehicle, killing its driver and a passenger, and leaving a child paralysed. With driving fatalities rising at levels not seen in 50 years, the growing incidence of distracted driving is getting part of the blame. Now a lawsuit related to that 2013 Texas crash is raising a question: Does Apple — or any mobile phone maker or wireless company — have a responsibility to prevent devices from being used by drivers in illegal and dangerous ways? The product liability lawsuit, filed against Apple by families of the victims, contends that Apple knew its phones would be used for texting and did not prevent Kubiak from texting dangerously. The suit is unlikely to succeed, said legal experts, and a Texas magistrate in August preliminarily recommended the case’s dismissal on grounds that it was unlikely that lawyers could prove that the use of the iPhone caused the accident. Kubiak was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to five years on probation. The product liability case has brought to light a piece of evidence that legal and safety experts say puts Apple in a quandary — one it shares with other wireless companies. In Apple’s case, the evidence shows, the company has a patent for technology designed to prevent texting while driving, but it has not deployed it. Apple, Verizon, AT&T and other companies caution about the risks of distracted driving — and they acknowledge that laws and public education aimed at curbing the behaviour are not working. It suggests to legal experts that they can foresee that their product can be used for illegal, dangerous and sometimes deadly activity. AT&T even suggests that the behaviour has addictive qualities, meaning drivers cannot help themselves. But the companies — although they offer manual ways to shut down texting on the road — do not deploy technology that takes the decision out of drivers’ hands altogether. “The technology exists; we just don’t have the stomach to implement it,” said Ms Deborah Hersman, the president of the National Safety Council and the former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. Generally, companies have taken the position that text-blocking technology is embryonic and unreliable. They argue that they cannot shut down a driver’s service without the potential of mistakenly shutting off a passenger’s phone or that of someone riding on a train or bus. Instead, companies have taken the approach of simultaneously warning and enabling, a mixed message that underscores a complex swirl of economic, technological and social factors. Perhaps the most pointed question is this: Even if the technology worked to perfection, would people accept having their service blocked? After all, the idea of mobile phone service is to let people communicate on the go. Mr David Teater, formerly of the National Safety Council and now a private consultant on road safety, who lost his own son to a distracted driver, said companies clearly feared the consequences of cutting off service for their paying customers. It is an industry, he said, in which one of the most frightening words is “churn” — meaning the loss of a customer to a competitor. “If you’re at Apple or you’re at Samsung, do you want to be the first to block texting and driving?” he said. “A customer might say, ‘If Apple does it, then my next phone is a Samsung’.” But to Mr Teater, that is just an excuse. “If Apple had deployed this technology 10 years ago, there would be more people alive today,” he said. “Think about it from a parent’s perspective: How would you feel knowing Apple had the ability to prevent your teen from ever texting and driving, and they chose not to?”   APPLE’S LOCKOUT PATENT   In the Apple case in Texas, lawyers who brought the suit had unearthed a fascinating document: A patent filing that Apple made in 2008, which the lawyers said was granted in 2014, for technology that would “lock out” a driver’s phone by using sensors to determine if the phone was moving and in use by a driver. If so, it would prevent certain functions, such as texting. In the patent, Apple says such technology is necessary because: “Texting while driving has become so widespread that it is doubtful that law enforcement will have any significant effect on stopping the practice,” and, “Teens understand that texting while driving is dangerous, but this is often not enough motivation to end the practice.” It is unclear whether Apple has developed the lockout technology. While texting is on the rise, people are increasingly driving and using Snapchat and Instagram, or taking selfies, or playing Pokemon GO. The phone is at the centre of all the activity. Apple says it has taken other steps to address distracted driving. Its CarPlay integrates with some cars so drivers can use voice commands to control some functions of the car and the phone, including letting them orally compose text messages and listen to incoming ones. The technology, Apple says: “Allows you to stay focused on the road”. “We discourage anyone from allowing their iPhone to distract them by typing, reading or interacting with the display while driving,” said Apple in response to questions. The company did not directly address whether it could or should shut down phone functions. Rather, it indicated that the responsibility was with the driver. “For those customers who do not wish to turn off their iPhones or switch into Aeroplane Mode while driving to avoid distractions, we recommend the easy-to-use Do Not Disturb and Silent Mode features,” said the statement. These approaches put the onus on drivers to make decisions each time they enter a car or receive a message. In addition, voice-activated systems raise other concerns, said Dr David Strayer, an expert on driver attention at the University of Utah, who said he had studied CarPlay and the feature allowed drivers to perform some functions that could take their attention off the road. “It does not eliminate driver distraction — not even close,” he said. Technology is on the market that can block a driver from having to make a decision. One company, Cellcontrol, sells a device that mounts on the dash and uses high-frequency sound waves to identify a phone’s location. If the phone’s user is in the driver’s seat, the device can lock out prohibited services. The US$129 (S$175) device, which looks like a small turtle shell, “is very accurate”, said Cellcontrol’s chief technology officer Joe Breaux. The hiccup is that the technology can sometimes turn off the phone of a passenger behind the driver. Apple, in its patent, said it was developing “a process in which hand-held computing devices can provide a lockout mechanism without requiring any modifications or additions to the vehicle”. It would use motion and scenery sensors to determine if the phone was moving, and its location. By not putting the technology in place, Apple has “failed in their social responsibility”, said Mr Christopher Kutz, a professor at the University of California, School of Law, who specialises in the moral and legal principles of liability. “They should’ve done it, and even done it at a market risk.” Apple, as one of the great cultural influencers, might have the power to make it fashionable to choose safety over the rush of an incoming text, said Mr Kutz. “They’ve made themselves a norm maker,” he said. “With great power comes great responsibility.” The New York Times mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Tech READ COMMENTED ‘Smart’ solar palm trees power Wi-Fi, phones in Dubai ‘Sextortion’, a new cyber crime, is common: Study ‘PCs will not go away in the next five or 10 years’ ‘PCs not dead yet’ ‘MyShake’ app, a personal tsunami warning system Zuckerberg sure fake news on Facebook did not sway election Zuckerberg among Facebook users mistakenly declared ‘dead’ Three top smartphone cameras in real-world tests: Which is the best?

D. Heyes Tags: Apple, healthcare, big brother (NaturalNews) For those who monitor the tech world, it's not a surprise that gadget giant Apple would like to branch out into the medical industry. For that matter, Apple boss Tim Cook, the company's CEO, has even said he's got "massive interest" in health. But the idea begs some questions, like, how does Apple shift its focus and a portion of its very large operation away from making gadgets to dealing with hospitals, doctors, FDA regulations and, of course, Obamacare? And why would Apple want to jump into this pit of snakes? Maybe it's just about the moneyDr. Mike Evans, a physician based in Toronto who was hired recently by the tech giant, noted that there is a digital health opportunity the company should pursue. In a comment to Canadian broadcaster CBC, Evans laid out the company's likely strategy. "What happens now," he said, "is I see you. Let's say you have high blood pressure. I prescribe you a pill for that. I see you two or three times a year. "In future," he continued, "I'll prescribe you an app. One of our whiteboards will drop in and explain what high blood pressure is. The phone will be Bluetoothed to the cap of your pills. I'll nudge you towards a low salt diet. All of these things will all happen in your phone. I see you two or three days a year. The phone sees you everyday." As further reported by CBC, Evans said he believes that, without question, the future of medicine will involve a combination of patients interacting with doctors and with technology. "I think the way we engage people will totally change," he said, adding that the interactions involving humans and tech in healthcare will be solved as they progress. Granted, Apple has yet to officially announce it is moving into healthcare or, as Evans explained, the electronic healthcare field. But is Apple really interested in better health, or is the company just angling for a share of the trillions spent each year on healthcare? A couple of things stand out regarding Apple's potential move into the market. First, while an app is "trendy" and "cool," the thought of it being continually "Bluetoothed" – as in connected to the Internet – is troubling right off the bat. Patients will be continuously monitored by Apple and, perhaps, the government, 24/7, recording activities and living habits. And, thanks to Obamacare's rules, more and more health records are being sent to the cloud, putting them online for all the world's hackers to steal. What makes online records a bad ideaAnd steal them, they have: Two years ago Reuters reported that your health record is more valuable than your credit cards, making them a bigger target for cyber thieves – 10 times as much, in fact, on the black market. Because so much is spent on healthcare ($3 trillion annually, in 2014 figures), health information is extremely valuable. "As attackers discover new methods to make money, the healthcare industry is becoming a much riper target because of the ability to sell large batches of personal data for profit," said Dave Kennedy, an expert on healthcare security and CEO of TrustedSEC LLC. In February 2015, The Verge reported that hackers had stolen millions of customer records from Anthem, the nation's second-largest health insurer. That hack followed the theft of records from the Obamacare website, Healthcare.gov. A year later, NBC News reported that health record hacking had climbed an astounding 11,000 percent from the previous year. One in three Americans have had their health data compromised in some form or another, but most are completely unaware. And it's not just medical records at risk. As Cyber War has reported, hackers also have the potential to break into and control medical devices that are connected to the Internet. In addition, hackers using "ransomware" to lock up hospital equipment that is needed to keep patients alive so as to extract payment for them is also becoming more common. With so much risk involved in putting sensitive equipment and healthcare information online, it makes little sense to compound the problem, as Apple seems intent on doing. Then again, there is that huge pile of money spent on healthcare every year.

SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTERS Sponsored By FacebookTwitterTuneIn Home Blogs Kannon & Sybil Leigh Ann Tanner Playlist Contests Photos Events Video iPhone 7 Users Destroy New Phone After YouTube Video Tells Them To Drill Into New Device September 25, 2016 3:33 PM Filed Under: Apple, Destroy, drill, Headphone Jack, iPhone 7, Prank, Youtube (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) The new iPhone 7 has been met with mixed reviews, but the removal of the headphone jack has been met with an almost universal critical disdain.  Apple is trying to force its users to start integrating more wireless technology, and the removal of the headphone jack was, according to them, necessary to free up more internal hardware space.  Fans of wired headphones could buy an additional adapter so their headphone don’t become completely obsolete, but this is only seen as another insignificance perpetrated by Apple. A YouTube video, however, showed a DIY solution to the headphone jack removal.  It claimed, that by drilling into the new iPhone with a  3.5mm drill, you can create your own jack and continue to use headphones as normal. Here is the video below: Obviously fake and a parody, right?  Well there were hundreds of folks that were convinced this was a bona fide method to create a new jack, and have destroyed their brand new iPhones in the process.  YouTube commenter James Ceja wrote, “I tried this and ended up with display destruction and it not working… I really committed the biggest mistake of my life by watching the his video.”  User Sean Solomon posted, “I don’t know what I was thinking. I actually drilled about half way and realised that this is retarded and you were f****** we me.  Now what to I do?”  User Toekneechair wrote, “Ok I am sure it’s in the comments somewhere but my friend told me to ask what size drill bit am I supposed to use?  Also I don’t have that clamp thingy, can I or my friend hold it while we drill.  I don’t want to ruin my phone. Thanks for all the help guys…” Of course, those who were not completely duped by the video offered some of their own fake tips to remodeling the new phone.  Mark Johnson wrote, “Since some people are still having issues, a bit of advice.  The guy seems to have missed the part about cleaning the phone after drilling.  In order to clean out the 3.5mm socket of debris from the drill you need to soak the phone in soapy water for around 15 minutes so all the drill shavings are loosened.  Then give the phone a shake once you’re done.  Hope this helps someone. ;-)”  And user ninjapleaz wrote, “If you want me to tell you how to fix it, just reply to this comment with your credit card number, expiration date, and three digit code on the back… and I’ll tell you how to fix it.” Via Daily Mail Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

However, it is a fact that Apple already has a track record of pushing its tech vision of the future, by retiring standards. Of course this time around, we are referring to the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Pro  an industry standard since, well, forever in tech terms. Last week, we asked you how you felt on the matter and how you intend to cope with the latest Cupertino-induced trend that might just spread to other manufacturers as well. Well, the votes are in and it is clear that removing the 3.5mm jack has brought about quite a bit of backlash. Frankly, this was evident right from the get-go as initial responses started coming in after the launch. But it was quite interesting to see that a whopping 46% of you are annoyed by Apple's decision. It seems most are willing to go wireless all the way. However, that doesnt necessarily mean riding Apple's own "truly wireless" marketing wave and option for AirPods. In fact, since Cupertino's wired solutions through the Lightning port seem least appealing in the poll, it might just be that most users are rather leaning towards the universal Bluetooth standards. We would love to hear any additional thought you may have in the comments. For instance, tell us how you would pack your iPhone 7, along with other gadgets and pair them with headphones for a trip.

CLOSE Home News Opinion Pulse Arts & Entertainment Sports Friday, November 18, 2016 About Advertising Business Directory Archive Support Us Home News Opinion Pulse Arts & Entertainment Sports Home A&E Apple releases iOS 10 update and shows off early iPhone 7 details Apple releases iOS 10 update and shows off early iPhone 7 details By Nabeeha Virani - September 25, 2016 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter On September 4, Apple provided the iOS 10 update and revealed the long-anticipated iPhone 7 three days later. Last year, the iOS 9 update included emojis with different skin tones, generating a positive reaction from iPhone users. iOS 10 brought out new emojis as well. There are now female athletes, police officers and detectives, men with turbans, single parent families and the rainbow flag. Not all emojis have gotten positive reactions. Apple made the decision to replace its pistol emoji with a plastic water gun, making a bold statement against gun usage in everyday lives. Apple has a history of standing up to powerful organizations. Last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook refused to help the FBI hack into San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook’s phone, and this year Apple is standing up to the NRA and gun lobbyists. The idea to get rid of the pistol emoji came from New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, who started a campaign to get rid of the pistol emoji, called #DisarmTheiPhone. They wrote an open letter to Apple, asking them to “stand with the American people and remove the gun emoji from all your products as a symbolic gesture to limit gun accessibility.” iOS 10 is a complete reformation of what the iPhone can do. Other new features include revolutionary additions to text messaging. You can now send handwritten and invisible messages, pictures and symbols.  It’s also possible to replace certain words with emojis by a simple tap of the finger, as well as turn on read receipts for specific people. Furthermore, there are several special effects in which you can send messages with emphasis.  Options include “loud” messages sent with a bang, “gentle” messages sent in a small font that eventually gets larger and messages that include a “slam” effect. There are also different screens in which you can send texts with balloons, lasers, fireworks and other wacky effects. Other than emojis and texting, major changes are a bolder font, a new way to unlock the iPhone, the ability to delete preinstalled apps (such as Stocks, Watch, etc.) and the layout of the Music app. To unlock the iPhone, you now have to press the home button in addition to scanning your fingerprint. There’s also no more “slide to unlock,” which provided an easy way to enter in passcodes without as much hassle. Overall, iOS 10 has gotten a mixed reaction, but many are wary of the iPhone 7 due to some controversial changes to the phone. The new iPhone 7 doesn’t have a headphone jack, so FaceTiming in your dorm room and even listening to music will be a hassle. There is an alternative, though. Apple announced its wireless headphones, called AirPods. Their battery lasts up to five hours on one full charge, recognize your voice and include sensors and motions that know when you take them out and put them back in your ears. Airpods do come with the phone, if you should choose to buy it. Apple has been called out for its failures to provide users what they really want, while many of its advanced characteristics have gone unnoticed. The iPhone 7 is water-resistant and has a better camera quality and resolution, presenting results as “more representative of what you see with your own eyes,” said CNN writer Heather Kelly. In his review of the new iPhone for The Verge, Nilay Patel calls it “the future in disguise.” Whether or not you like the updates, it’s clear that both iOS 10 and the iPhone 7 are changing the way we communicate and see the world. Even their minute details, such as certain emojis and camera resolution, hold such large influences on our lives. Being able to enjoy and criticize technological advancements shows just how much we care about these products and how we’ll still use them in the years to come.   SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleFootball’s concussion conundrum Next articleGlass Animals releases new album full of grooves and genuine character studies Nabeeha Virani RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR A&E YouTube Heroes bring crowd-sourced censorship, controversial solution to objectionable content A&E Are podcasts killing the radio star?

The court filings paint a grisly picture: As Ashley Kubiak sped down a Texas highway in her Dodge Ram truck, she checked her iPhone for messages. Distracted, she crashed into a sport utility vehicle, killing its driver and a passenger and leaving a child paralysed. With driving fatalities rising at levels not seen in 50 years, the growing incidence of distracted driving is getting part of the blame. Now a lawsuit related to that 2013 Texas crash is raising a question: Does Apple - or any cellphone maker or wireless company - have a responsibility to prevent devices from being used by drivers in illegal and dangerous ways? The product liability lawsuit, filed against Apple by families of the victims, contends that Apple knew its phones would be used for texting and did not prevent Kubiak from texting dangerously. The suit is unlikely to succeed, legal experts said, and a Texas magistrate in August preliminarily recommended the case's dismissal on grounds that it was unlikely that lawyers could prove that the use of the iPhone caused the fatal accident. Kubiak was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to five years on probation. Her lawyer, Jason Cassel, said she now keeps her phone in the back seat. "The mere fact she's putting her phone in her back seat in her purse shows she realises how tempting it is to look down when we get a beep, chime, vibration," Cassel said. "She never wants to be near the possibility" of being tempted to answer it. The product liability case has brought to light a piece of evidence that legal and safety experts say puts Apple in a quandary - one it shares with other wireless companies. In Apple's case, the evidence shows, the company has a patent for technology designed to prevent texting while driving, but it has not deployed it. Apple, Verizon, AT&T and other companies caution about the risks of distracted driving - and they acknowledge that laws and public education aimed at curbing the behaviour are not working. It suggests to legal experts that they can foresee that their product can be used for illegal, dangerous and sometimes deadly activity. AT&T even suggests that the behaviour has addictive qualities, meaning drivers cannot help themselves. But the companies - though they offer manual ways to shut down texting on the road - do not deploy technology that takes the decision out of drivers' hands altogether. "The technology exists - we just don't have the stomach to implement it," said Deborah Hersman, the president of the National Safety Council and the former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. In 2012, the safety board sent a letter to the wireless industry association urging the companies to prevent drivers from using their phones while driving. "Technology got us into this situation. Technology will get us out," she said. However, she added, "We're so afraid to tell people what they should do that you can kind of get away with murder under these conditions." Generally, companies have taken the position that text-blocking technology is embryonic and unreliable. They argue that they cannot shut down a driver's service without the potential of mistakenly shutting off a passenger's phone or that of someone riding on a train or bus. Instead, companies have taken the approach of simultaneously warning and enabling, a mixed message that underscores a complex swirl of economic, technological and social factors. Perhaps the most pointed question is this: Even if the technology worked to perfection, would people accept having their service blocked? After all, the idea of mobile phone service is to let people communicate on the go. David Teater, formerly of the National Safety Council and now a private consultant on road safety, who lost his own son to a distracted driver, said companies clearly feared the consequences of cutting off service for their paying customers. It's an industry, he said, in which one of the most frightening words is "churn" - meaning the loss of a customer to a competitor. "If you're at Apple or you're at Samsung, do you want to be the first to block texting and driving?" he said. "A customer might say, 'If Apple does it, then my next phone is a Samsung.'" But to Teater, that's just an excuse. "If Apple had deployed this technology 10 years ago, there would be more people alive today," he said. "Think about it from a parent's perspective: How would you feel knowing Apple had the ability to prevent your teen from ever texting and driving, and they chose not to?" In the Apple case in Texas, lawyers who brought the suit had unearthed a fascinating document: a patent filing that Apple made in 2008, which the lawyers said was granted in 2014, for technology that would "lock out" a driver's phone by using sensors to determine if the phone was moving and in use by a driver. If so, it would prevent certain functions, like texting. In the patent, Apple says such technology is necessary because: "Texting while driving has become so widespread that it is doubtful that law enforcement will have any significant effect on stopping the practice," and "Teens understand that texting while driving is dangerous, but this is often not enough motivation to end the practice." It is unclear whether Apple has developed the lockout technology. While texting is on the rise, people are increasingly driving and using Snapchat and Instagram, or taking selfies, or playing Pokemon Go. The phone is at the centre of all the activity. Apple says it has taken other steps to address distracted driving. Its CarPlay integrates with some cars so drivers can use voice commands to control some functions of the car and the phone, including letting them orally compose text messages and listen to incoming ones. The technology, Apple says, "allows you to stay focused on the road." "For those customers who do not wish to turn off their iPhones or switch into Airplane Mode while driving to avoid distractions, we recommend the easy-to-use Do Not Disturb and Silent Mode features," the statement said. These approaches put the onus on drivers to make decisions each time they enter a car or receive a message. In addition, voice-activated systems raise other concerns, said David Strayer, an expert on driver attention at the University of Utah, who said he had studied CarPlay and the feature allowed drivers to perform some functions that could take their attention off the road. "It does not eliminate driver distraction - not even close," Dr. Strayer said. Technology is already on the market that can block a driver from having to make a decision. One company, Cellcontrol, sells a device that mounts on the dash and that uses high-frequency sound waves to identify a phone's location. If the phone's user is in the driver's seat, the device can lock out prohibited services. The $129 device, which looks like a small turtle shell, "is very accurate," said Cellcontrol's chief technology officer, Joe Breaux. The hiccup is that the technology can sometimes turn off the phone of a passenger sitting behind the driver. Apple, in its patent, said it was developing "a process in which hand-held computing devices can provide a lockout mechanism without requiring any modifications or additions to the vehicle." It would use motion and scenery sensors to determine if the phone was moving, and its location. By not putting the technology in place, Apple has "failed in their social responsibility," said Christopher Kutz, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, who specialises in the moral and legal principles of liability. "They should've done it, and even done it at a market risk." He likened the situation to that of gunmakers who could stop selling high-capacity magazines but choose not to. At the same time, Kutz said, there was little precedent for companies to shut off communications services for safety reasons. In other industries, he said, companies have taken such precautions - for instance, some manufacturers have technology that will shut down a machine if a worker does not keep two hands on it. In the case of distracted driving, Apple is not the only tech giant recognising the dangerous behaviour and not preventing it. Verizon, like Apple, suggests that current laws are insufficient. "While text messaging is banned for drivers in 46 states and the District of Columbia, many people continue to do it, despite knowing the dangers," Verizon says on a site that promotes free apps and other services available for iPhone and Android that can detect if a phone is being used by a driver and prevent texting. The Verizon messaging app has a driving mode that, when in use, detects if someone is connected to a car's Bluetooth system and delivers an automatic response to the sender that the recipient is driving, said Kelly Crummey, a Verizon spokeswoman. However, the message still arrives on the recipient's phone, allowing the opportunity to check it, Crummey said. That technology suggests it is possible to identify a driver and apply the technology more broadly - to, say, social media - but Crummey said Verizon didn't have the same kind of control over Facebook, Twitter or other functions. Further, she said, it wouldn't make sense to turn off all phone functions, like maps or navigation, that drivers rely on. AT&T encourages the use of a free app, Drivemode, that can stop incoming texts. "Everyone knows texting and driving is dangerous, yet when a text message comes in, it's difficult not to respond," AT&T says in promoting the app. Of course, services like these must be activated by the user and can be bypassed. And AT&T may have identified the reason such solutions don't work: People find themselves so drawn to their devices that elements of addiction are at play. In fact, AT&T commissioned research by an addiction expert who, in an AT&T news release in 2014, said that using a phone sets off releases of a neurochemical called dopamine that makes it hard to resist the ping. "If that desire for a dopamine fix leads us to check our phones while we're driving, a simple text can turn deadly," David Greenfield, who founded the Centre for Internet and Technology Addiction, said in the AT&T news release. But if the behaviour has addictive qualities, can drivers really be expected to police themselves? And should automated blocking be the answer? "Distracted driving is never OK," AT&T said, adding that it had promoted "It Can Wait," a public service campaign to discourage texting and driving. CTIA - the Wireless Association, in its response to questions, said, "Laws, consumer education and technology are pivotal, and we've seen this three-prong approach work to stop people from this dangerous practice." It hasn't worked well enough, some say. Apple, as one of the great cultural influencers, might have the power to change the conversation - to make it fashionable to choose safety over the rush of an incoming text, Kutz said. "They've made themselves a norm maker," he said. "With great power comes great responsibility." ©2016 The New York Times News Service Matt Richtel Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 America is not the greatest country on Earth. it's no. 28 Business Standard Phone makers could cut off drivers: So why don't they?

Distracted, she crashed into a sport utility vehicle, killing its driver and a passenger and leaving a child paralysed. With driving fatalities rising at levels not seen in 50 years, the growing incidence of distracted driving is getting part of the blame. Now a lawsuit related to that 2013 Texas crash is raising a question: Does Apple - or any cellphone maker or wireless company - have a responsibility to prevent devices from being used by drivers in illegal and dangerous ways? The product liability lawsuit, filed against Apple by families of the victims, contends that Apple knew its phones would be used for texting and did not prevent Kubiak from texting dangerously. The suit is unlikely to succeed, legal experts said, and a Texas magistrate in August preliminarily recommended the case's dismissal on grounds that it was unlikely that lawyers could prove that the use of the iPhone caused the fatal accident. Kubiak was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to five years on probation. Her lawyer, Jason Cassel, said she now keeps her phone in the back seat. "The mere fact she's putting her phone in her back seat in her purse shows she realises how tempting it is to look down when we get a beep, chime, vibration," Cassel said. "She never wants to be near the possibility" of being tempted to answer it. The product liability case has brought to light a piece of evidence that legal and safety experts say puts Apple in a quandary - one it shares with other wireless companies. In Apple's case, the evidence shows, the company has a patent for technology designed to prevent texting while driving, but it has not deployed it. Apple, Verizon, AT&T and other companies caution about the risks of distracted driving - and they acknowledge that laws and public education aimed at curbing the behaviour are not working. It suggests to legal experts that they can foresee that their product can be used for illegal, dangerous and sometimes deadly activity. AT&T even suggests that the behaviour has addictive qualities, meaning drivers cannot help themselves. But the companies - though they offer manual ways to shut down texting on the road - do not deploy technology that takes the decision out of drivers' hands altogether. "The technology exists - we just don't have the stomach to implement it," said Deborah Hersman, the president of the National Safety Council and the former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. In 2012, the safety board sent a letter to the wireless industry association urging the companies to prevent drivers from using their phones while driving. "Technology got us into this situation. Technology will get us out," she said. However, she added, "We're so afraid to tell people what they should do that you can kind of get away with murder under these conditions." Generally, companies have taken the position that text-blocking technology is embryonic and unreliable. They argue that they cannot shut down a driver's service without the potential of mistakenly shutting off a passenger's phone or that of someone riding on a train or bus. Instead, companies have taken the approach of simultaneously warning and enabling, a mixed message that underscores a complex swirl of economic, technological and social factors. Perhaps the most pointed question is this: Even if the technology worked to perfection, would people accept having their service blocked? After all, the idea of mobile phone service is to let people communicate on the go. David Teater, formerly of the National Safety Council and now a private consultant on road safety, who lost his own son to a distracted driver, said companies clearly feared the consequences of cutting off service for their paying customers. It's an industry, he said, in which one of the most frightening words is "churn" - meaning the loss of a customer to a competitor. "If you're at Apple or you're at Samsung, do you want to be the first to block texting and driving?" he said. "A customer might say, 'If Apple does it, then my next phone is a Samsung.'" But to Teater, that's just an excuse. "If Apple had deployed this technology 10 years ago, there would be more people alive today," he said. "Think about it from a parent's perspective: How would you feel knowing Apple had the ability to prevent your teen from ever texting and driving, and they chose not to?" In the Apple case in Texas, lawyers who brought the suit had unearthed a fascinating document: a patent filing that Apple made in 2008, which the lawyers said was granted in 2014, for technology that would "lock out" a driver's phone by using sensors to determine if the phone was moving and in use by a driver. If so, it would prevent certain functions, like texting. In the patent, Apple says such technology is necessary because: "Texting while driving has become so widespread that it is doubtful that law enforcement will have any significant effect on stopping the practice," and "Teens understand that texting while driving is dangerous, but this is often not enough motivation to end the practice." It is unclear whether Apple has developed the lockout technology. While texting is on the rise, people are increasingly driving and using Snapchat and Instagram, or taking selfies, or playing Pokemon Go. The phone is at the centre of all the activity. Apple says it has taken other steps to address distracted driving. Its CarPlay integrates with some cars so drivers can use voice commands to control some functions of the car and the phone, including letting them orally compose text messages and listen to incoming ones. The technology, Apple says, "allows you to stay focused on the road." "For those customers who do not wish to turn off their iPhones or switch into Airplane Mode while driving to avoid distractions, we recommend the easy-to-use Do Not Disturb and Silent Mode features," the statement said. These approaches put the onus on drivers to make decisions each time they enter a car or receive a message.

Cheryl Swanson (CherylSwanson) Sep 25, 2016 at 2:02PM Image source: Getty Images. Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone just scored its first big drug deal. Okay, I'm kidding, but not really. Through an app called PARADE -- short for "Patient Rheumatoid Arthritis Data from the Real World" -- global healthcare company GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) became the first big drug company using Apple's iPhone and its software platform ResearchKit. It's a moment of truth for Apple's ResearchKit platform, and it could open multiple possibilities for both Apple and big pharma down the road. Assuming Glaxo's efforts succeed, ResearchKit could whet big pharma's appetite for using Apple products, including its iPhone and Apple Watch. Why? For one thing, conducting research through virtual "at home" trials could save a staggering amount of money for big pharma. Drug companies must run costly studies, known as clinical trials, to prove their drugs work and gain FDA approval. In fact,  Phase 3 trials reportedly eat up roughly 40% of the R&D budgets of pharmaceutical companies. To streamline clinical trials, the PARADE study will allow arthritis patients to use their iPhones to send in data without setting foot in a lab. Using an app based on ResearchKit, participants will perform a guided wrist exercise and the iPhone's movement sensors will detect their progress. The need to set up costly trial sites, and hire nurses to make measurements and record data, will be avoided. In addition, since the data is already digitized, researchers will spend much less time sorting through it for analysis. Pfizer's virtual trial with a patchwork of technology failed How much the iPhone and ResearchKit could streamline the drug research process can be seen in how Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) failed in its virtual-drug research trial a few years ago. In 2011, Pfizer started a trial called REMOTE that used a patchwork of awkward and unfamiliar technologies to enroll and evaluate healthcare outcomes for its participants. Glaxo, by contrast, plans to do all enrollment and evaluation on the ubiquitous iPhone. In large part, the Pfizer virtual trial failed because the drugmaker was unable to find and keep participants, which is one of the most difficult steps in any study. Faced with technologies they weren't familiar with and a digital ecosystem they didn't understand, people didn't want to risk the privacy and security of their personal health information. While Apple will need to make extra effort to ensure that medical data is secure, the familiarity of its technology and ecosystem should reduce some of that anxiety, which could be a significant boon to medical research. For instance, when ResearchKit was released last March, five new healthcare-study apps were immediately featured at the top of the the company's App Store. Within seven days, more than 2,500 people readily signed up for asthma research, 5,500 people joined a Parkinson's disease project, and over 22,000 enrolled in a heart-disease study. While the response was heartening, these kinds of informal research apps have yet to prove useful for serious medical research. For one thing, there was no way of telling who actually signed up for these studies, or if they were telling the truth. In person, it's easy to demand an ID, like a driver's license. But the initial ResearchKit-based apps merely asked questions to see who was eligible. As we all know, it's easy to lie on those questions. (Are you over twenty-one? Yes. But... is your teenager actually answering these questions? Maybe. How about your dog? Perhaps. You know how it goes.) Duke screens for autism, IBM studies sleep habits On the other hand, ResearchKit has since been used in much more controlled studies with U.S. medical centers and other big tech companies. My favorite has to be Duke Medicine's "Autism & Beyond" study, which uses iPhone's front-facing camera to detect a child's reaction to videos shown on the device. The goal is to develop an automated method of screening for the developmental disorder. If it works, it could be great news: Autism is difficult to detect, but early diagnosis means a chance to begin treatment as soon as possible, which can greatly improve a child's life. Those who suffer from insomnia, a group that includes 1 in 4 Americans, may find some help from IBM's (NYSE:IBM) first iPhone-dependent sleep study. By using a ResearchKit App on Watson Health Cloud, IBM is studying connections between sleep habits and outcomes such as alertness, productivity and general health. The iPhone and Apple Watch are used to gather data, which researchers will analyze to discover patterns and connections. Despite limitations, ResearchKit could stake out new territory for Apple So do studies like Glaxo's and IBM's start the trend of iPhones and Apple Watches becoming handheld and wearable gatherers of clinical data? Perhaps, but questions remain. For instance, the face-to-face interaction that keeps such things as drug trials from being cold and dehumanizing can be a challenge to replicate with technology. In addition, the FDA could take a dim view of a bias possibly introduced when a trial is strictly limited to those owning iPhones. However that turns out, Apple won't immediately and directly profit, since ResearchKit is free, open-source software. But the iPhone and the Apple Watch, with their built-in sensors, could bring exciting improvements to pharmaceutical research. And if PARADE shows that ResearchKit is at least a feasible platform for drug research and development, Apple will have taken a big step toward staking out new turf in healthcare. Looking down the road, the payoff could be huge. Cheryl Swanson owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

The latest to join the horde is Allo, Google’s highly anticipated messaging app that lets people take advantage of artificial intelligence to chat and make plans. Google began offering the smarter app last Wednesday. Allo is appearing at a time when smartphones are already crowded with chat apps. IMessage from Apple is prominent among iPhone owners. Facebook Messenger is widely used on that social network. Also popular is WhatsApp, the chat service from Facebook that has largely replaced text messaging internationally. Add to the list Slack, a group chat tool that is popular among businesses, and Google Hangouts, which was released in 2013, and you have six. I asked British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who studies the relationship between brain size and social circles, about the overload. His research has found that most people have the mental capacity to sustain 150 meaningful relationships, and among them, only five close ones. “Having more apps than close friends doesn’t help, as something will have to go,” Dunbar said in an email, though he noted that the various messaging apps serve different purposes. Younger people are shying away from chatting on Facebook, for example, to have more private conversations on apps like WhatsApp. With that backdrop in mind, I tested Allo for five days and compared it with the apps that are most similar to it: Google Hangouts, Apple iMessage and Facebook Messenger. After weighing the pros and cons, my advice is that people can hold off on downloading Allo, largely because its artificially intelligent assistant was unhelpful. But if Allo matures, users will probably want to ditch the Hangouts app. The unhelpful assistant First, some context about Allo. Google announced the app in May, aiming to highlight the company’s push into artificial intelligence. Its older chat app, Hangouts, will remain, but Google will emphasise that product’s use as a videoconferencing jand messaging app for businesses. To understand how Allo works, it’s easiest to think of the app’s AI assistant as an office intern who is lurking in the background, eager to chime in. The assistant analyses messages you have typed or dictated and, when appropriate, springs into action with automatically generated phrases you can choose to reply with or suggestions for Google searches that may help accomplish tasks. When you’re having a conversation with another person, for example, the assistant suggests ways it can help. Saying “Want to see a movie tonight?” prompts the assistant to offer a Google search for movie showtimes or to reply with suggestions like “Sure, what time?” or “Not really.” Here is where Allo became frustrating for me. Asking an assistant to search “movie showtimes tonight” should load a list of movies and corresponding showtimes. Instead, Google’s assistant shows a list of movies without showtimes; only after tapping on a film can you ask for times. Sometimes that doesn’t even work. Asking for showtimes for the movie “Snowden” loaded movies playing at a movie theater called UA Snowden Square Stadium 14. Not helpful — unless, of course, you live in Columbia, Maryland. Allo also tries to guess what your written response might be to certain types of phrases, questions or photos. With photos, the app occasionally identifies what’s inside the photo to generate a suggested reaction. So when you receive a photo of a dog, Allo loads responses like “adorable.” This feature ran into several problems. When I sent a picture to a friend of my cat sitting inside my car, Allo suggested this response to the friend: “What a cute car!” (Sorry, Allo, but my Prius is the opposite of cute.) When I sent photos of my dog to the same friend, Allo’s assistant correctly identified the breed, a Pembroke Welsh corgi. It suggested the reaction “Nice pembroke welsh corgi.” Impressive, but if someone said that to me in real life, I would add that person to my list of suspected Cylons. For now, Allo’s artificial assistance feels limited. So if I were a manager seeking an assistant, I probably wouldn’t hire Allo. But I would politely tell the candidate to reapply after getting more experience. Shortcomings in chat Each messaging app has its own purpose, but Allo has the most in common with Facebook Messenger, iMessage and Google Hangouts. That’s because all four are capable of adding some personality with stickers and emojis. So I tested Messenger, iMessage and Hangouts against Allo to determine their pros and cons. The highlights:  iMessage, Hangouts and Messenger work on mobile devices and computers. Allo works only on Android and iOS mobile devices, though Google plans to expand Allo to computers later.  iMessage and Messenger support third-party apps, adding features like sending money to friends within messages. Google has no plans to support outside apps in Allo.  Messenger has more sticker packs than Allo, which has only about 25.  Facebook is experimenting with chat bots that you can talk to for shopping or summoning an Uber car. Allo’s assistant was quicker to respond and more natural to communicate with than Facebook’s chat bots.  iMessage stickers are more fun to use. In iMessage, stickers can be placed on top of messages and photos — add a cartoon mustache to your selfie, for example. On Allo, stickers can be sent only as stand-alone messages.  The Hangouts app is very much like Allo, without the half-baked assistant. Allo has more entertaining stickers, including a muscular yellow bull that appears to be twerking. The big difference between the two is that the Hangouts app relies primarily on your contacts list linked to a Google Mail account, whereas Allo pulls contacts from your device’s phone book. The upshot: iMessage and Messenger have more features than Allo. There are two major features missing from Allo: the ability to chat using a computer and using third-party apps and games to do more within messages. With Allo, Google has the opportunity to stand out by offering superior artificial intelligence. Neither Messenger nor Allo has great AI yet, but Google’s assistant has a better start. Private, but not airtight Finally, there is privacy to consider. It’s tough to say how Allo will fare in terms of security until encryption experts take a close look at the app. Here’s what we know so far: By default, Apple’s iMessage service is end-to-end encrypted, which means a message is encrypted when it is sent from your device and remains encrypted when it passes through Apple’s server and reaches the recipient. Google Hangouts and Facebook Messenger both lack end-to-end encryption, so at some point when messages pass through their servers, they can see your messages. Allo has end-to-end encryption turned off by default because its server needs to see the messages to work its AI magic. However, Allo includes a mode called Incognito with full encryption enabled, which people can use for private conversations, similar to a private mode on a web browser. But, of course, the AI features do not work in Incognito. So Allo is a step ahead of Hangouts and Messenger for privacy. But by default (and by design), it is not as secure as iMessage. Bottom line I recommend waiting for Allo to become available on computers and for its AI to become smarter. At the moment, Allo’s assistant will waste more time than it saves when it comes to helping you make plans, and it will probably make conversations more awkward. Google said it was still improving and refining its algorithms, and Allo’s assistant will get better over time. Once Allo’s assistant matures, the Hangouts app will become redundant and you’ll be able to delete it from your device. The catch, of course, is that Allo’s AI won’t become sophisticated until more people use it and share feedback.For now, if I really need help, I’m going to request a competent intern.

What better time to download some apps to take the new hardware and software for a spin? In one update, Apple’s messaging system, iMessage, got a turbo boost. It now lets people embellish conversations with stickers, interactive drawings and animations. The messaging system even gets its own App Store for downloading third-party stickers and games. My favourite sticker app is Star Wars Stickers from Disney. The $2 (Rs 133) app provides a number of cute, animated, cartoon images of characters from the “Star Wars” franchise, including BB-8, Obi-Wan Kenobi and C-3PO with his classic “Oh, my!” catchphrase. You can send the stickers as stand-alone images or drop them on top of written messages or photos. Add them to selfies you’re sending in iMessage, and suddenly the Death Star is exploding above you. The free Pac-Man sticker pack is another great option for some retro fun. The Grammar Snob sticker app, for $1 (Rs 67), lets you add editorial red ink over a text message to fix a friend’s bad grammar. Sticker Pals, which is free, is a more contemporary option, with hundreds of animated cartoon characters and special effects, as well as a neat feature that lets users send stickers to friends for their use. And the free Aardman Face Bomb sticker pack includes funny cartoon faces in the style of the Aardman animation studio. Apple iMessage also lets you play games within the app. With classic games like Words With Friends, which is free, this feature makes chatting throughout a game easier, so you can express your feelings when someone gets 50 points by dropping a word on a triple-word-score square. In addition, Chess42 is a free chess game that you can play directly inside an iMessage chat. There are also plenty of utility apps that can make iMessage more powerful. The Doodle: Schedule Maker app lets users set up a simple in-message voting system for particular dates — perfect for trying to pin down a time to get together with one or more contacts. Doodle is free. When you need to split the bill, try Circle Pay, a digital money-transfer system that lets people send dollars, euros or Bitcoin through iMessage. The Circle Pay app requires some setup and registration, but it works simply in the iMessage interface, and it, too, is free. The app iTranslate brings dynamic automated language translation to iMessage. You can chat with someone who speaks a different language and translate the conversation in real time, without having to leave the chat interface. It’s free, and it works fast and quite well, though the controls can be confusing and sometimes, as with any machine translation, the result may sound like a Spanish or Portuguese version of Yoda. Another test of the new iPhone’s performance is how it handles games. Monument Valley, which is $4 (Rs ), is a highly regarded 3-D puzzle game with clean, abstract graphics and simple gameplay: You have to guide your character through an architectural labyrinth that’s part M.C. Escher, part artwork all its own. Don’t be surprised if you stop just to admire how pretty it is. The Obscura app, at $5 (Rs 333), lets users take full control of the photographic powers of the iPhone’s camera app. You can adjust the ISO and focus to get really creative; it’s almost like using a digital single-lens reflex camera. Move beyond Apple’s built-in keyboard with Microsoft’s impressive Word Flow, which is free. Get a deeper understanding of how we measure time on Earth with the lovely Cosmic-Watch clock app for $4 (Rs 266). Back up your photos and documents to the cloud with Google Drive, which is free. And finally, turn your iPhone into a capable document scanner for $4 (Rs 266)  with Scanner Pro 7. Go to Top Tweet Videos India's rural millions pay price of cash...

OBJ ends warms ups with dazzling catch It is not immediately clear when and how Apple injured his hamstring, but the first-round pick did make a diving attempt to tackle Redskins return man Jamison Crowder. Apple missed the tackle, and Crowder went on to change direction and break off a 50-yard return. With Apple out, the Giants should use Janoris Jenkins and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie as their outside corners, with Leon Hall in the slot and Trevin Wade as their fourth corner. The Redskins have also lost a cornerback, as Bashaud Breeland was ruled out for the game early in the first quarter with a ankle injury. Veteran safety DeAngelo Hall has also been ruled out for the game with a right knee sprain. Guard Shawn Lauvao is also out with an ankle injury. Center Kory Lichtensteiger is out with a calf injury. Apple played 59-of-62 snaps in last week's win over the Saints. That matched the total number of snaps played by Jenkins. Meanwhile, Rodgers-Cromartie logged just 39 snaps. That ranked DRC fourth among cornerbacks, as Hall played 41 snaps on Sunday. Giants coach Ben McAdoo was characteristically tight-lipped after the game when asked about the distribution of playing time at cornerback. Beckham vs. Norman: LIVE updates "We have three starting corners," McAdoo said. In the season opener, Jenkins played 78 snaps, followed by Rodgers-Cromartie with 77 and Apple with 56.  Inactives: Giants running back Rashad Jennings was a surprising scratch, as all indications earlier in the week were he'd play through his thumb injury. A full inactives list can be found here.

The smartphones should be widely available beginning on Oct. 8.  ( Apple ) Advertisement Some iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models are currently showing a shipping date of November from Apple's online store. A new report claims Apple retail stores will have all models, colors and storage capacities available for walk-in customers by Oct. 8. Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus completely sold out shortly after the company and carriers began accepting preorders for the devices. Sprint and T-Mobile reported record sales, which are due in part to free iPhone 7 deals available from all major U.S. carriers. As expected, the most popular devices are the exclusive Jet Black and Black color options, which currently show a November ship date from Apple's online store. In late August we reported that iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models were said to be in short supply at launch and the sources claimed it was due to "faulty components." Now, a new report claims supply of all iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models, colors and storage capacities are about to drastically improve. AppleInsider has been told by multiple sources that Apple retail stores will begin seeing improvements of stock conditions for the new iPhones very shortly. iPhone 7 availability will clear up first and most models, colors and storage configurations will be available for walk-in customers on Oct. 8. The publication says that it has seen documents that prove a freight company's bankruptcy filing has caused several containers of iPhone and Apple Watch models to keep from being delivered before the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus' Sept. 16 release date. It appears as if supply is already beginning to clear up for some, as T-Mobile customers are reporting the carrier is shipping some iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus orders ahead of schedule. The shipping delay is likely a major reason why Apple announced it would not reveal first weekend sales of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus for the first time since the original went on sale in 2007. While the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus feature a design very similar to that of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, don't expect to see Apple continue that look in 2017. The company is widely expected to launch a completely redesigned iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus next year, with the pair being billed as Apple's 10th anniversary iPhones. We'll keep you posted on any new details regarding shipping improvements on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus orders as they become available.

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Sep 25, 2016 at 1:15PM After sales of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus missed expectations last year, most analysts and pundits didn't have high hopes for the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. But it's starting to seem that the broad consensus was wrong for a second straight year. Some of that has to do with the growth of the iPhone user base, which is as much as 50% larger than it was two years ago. Some of it relates to fortuitous timing -- the new iPhones launched just as stories of exploding Samsung Galaxy Notes started to go viral. However, better promotions from wireless carriers could be the biggest impetus for customers to buy the new iPhones. Preorders surge Soon after Apple began preorders for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, AT&T (NYSE:T) stated that its preorders were up year over year. That's good news, as AT&T has a huge iPhone subscriber base, due to its history as Apple's exclusive U.S. carrier partner until early 2011. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have been in high demand so far. Image source: Apple. Meanwhile, preorders leaped higher at industry disruptors Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). Sprint reported that iPhone preorders were up 375% year over year in the first three days. T-Mobile said that its iPhone 7 series preorders were almost four times higher than for any other iPhone launch. The only company to rain on Apple's parade was No. 1 wireless carrier Verizon (NYSE:VZ). While AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile were trotting out impressive statistics, Verizon stated a few days after preorders began that the iPhone 7 launch was in line with typical numbers for a new iPhone model. However, it now appears that Verizon's iPhone order activity was stronger than management had implied. At a conference on Thursday, Verizon CFO Fran Shammo stated that the carrier had seen "some increase" in iPhone volumes compared to 2015. He attributed the strong sales to unprecedented promotional offers. U.S. carriers roll out the discounts T-Mobile kicked off the most recent carrier price war by offering customers a free 32GB iPhone 7 with the trade-in of a working iPhone 6. Its goal was to use the high-profile launch to poach customers from its rivals while moving existing customers up to more expensive service plans. AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon quickly copied T-Mobile with similar offers. Shammo believes that the "free iPhone" offers are artificially boosting sales. After the promotions end, he expects sales to drop off, ending up comparable to last year's volumes. U.S. carriers have been offering the iPhone 7 for free with an iPhone 6 trade-in. Image source: Apple. Indeed, T-Mobile is ending its free iPhone offer this weekend. All of the other carriers are expected to follow suit soon. However, we could see new carrier iPhone promos in the coming months, particularly as supply improves. Apple posted huge sales numbers in the first six months after the iPhone 6 launch two years ago. That means many iPhone users will reach the end of their two-year contracts or two-year installment plans soon. Thus, it's an ideal time for carriers to try to steal their rivals' customers. It's not just the U.S. Even outside the U.S., carrier promotions could boost sales of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. For example, in China -- Apple's second-biggest market after the U.S. -- China Unicom is subsidizing 49% of the cost of a new iPhone 7. Meanwhile, China Telecom is subsidizing 40% of the cost. As in the U.S., market share battles appear to be driving this discounting behavior. Both carriers are trying to avoid falling too far behind industry giant China Mobile, particularly when it comes to 4G subscribers. Apple remains the world's premiere smartphone brand. Samsung's "exploding phone" scandal has further solidified Apple's supremacy. As a result, iPhone promotions are key tools in wireless carriers' market share battles. This favorable positioning could continue to lift Apple's revenue and profit for the foreseeable future.

Apple released their 3D touch on September 9, 2015. A Month later Synaptics announced their new Android solution to match Apple's latest feature was called ClearForce sensing solution. The company states that "ClearForce enables OEMs to differentiate smartphones by providing customers with new dimensions in user interfaces such as speed scrolling, zoom, gaming, and text or photo editing by applying variable force with a finger or stylus." SamMobile posted a report last year titled "Could Samsung bring something like Apple's 3D Touch to its smartphones?" Well, they may do so sometime in the future but they didn't add it to either their latest 2016 Galaxy S7 or Note 7. If the Synaptics solution was that great, Samsung would have introduced it. It was obviously a poor copy of Apple's 3D Touch. This week Patently Apple discovered a new patent application that surfaced at the U.S. Patent Office regarding a 3D-like technology from Samsung that would apply to both touch and Pen applications on a Galaxy Note. So technically it's only a matter of time until Samsung's copy of Apple's 3D Touch technology comes to market.   In Samsung's patent FIG. 4 noted above we're able to see a flowchart of a method of controlling the electronic device (a Galaxy Noted device that uses a pen) whereby the method of controlling the electronic device is based on which pressure condition a pressure state of a touch input satisfies.   In Samsung's summary they note that their invention "provides an electronic device capable of determining whether to display information relating to a touch input or perform a function corresponding to the touch input according to a pressure state corresponding to the touch input when the touch input is applied to a touch screen.   According to an aspect of the inventive concept, there is provided an electronic device operating based on a touch input, the electronic device including a touch screen for receiving the touch input; and a controller for determining a pressure state corresponding to the touch input, when the pressure state satisfies a first pressure condition, controlling the touch screen to display information relating to the touch input, and, when the pressure state satisfies a second pressure condition, performing a function corresponding to the touch input.   According to another aspect of the inventive concept, there is provided a method of controlling an electronic device based on a touch input, the method including determining a pressure state of a touch input; when it is determined that the pressure state satisfies a first pressure condition, displaying information relating to the touch input; and when it is determined that the pressure state satisfies a second pressure condition, performing a function corresponding to the touch input.     Samsung filed their U.S. patent application back in May 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Mobile also posted a patent report earlier today covering Samsung's work on better waterproofing a future Note smartphone by eliminating one speaker grille on the phone and introducing a new Pen design that doubles as a speaker as shown in part below.     While I'm on the topic of the Galaxy note, I wanted to just look back at our report posted two weeks ago titled "Samsung Dodged a Bullet this week, but for How Long?" for just a moment. I was checking out the iPad Pro yesterday at my local Apple Store and realized that Apple's use of the Pencil was pretty limited to a few apps which wouldn't have been much competition for Samsung if Apple released the iPhone 7 with Apple Pencil. So the delay is better understood.   With the Galaxy Note, you're able to use the pen to mark up an article before sending to a friend or colleague. Apple is about to release this kind of functionality in early 2017 according to a report posted by Mark Gurman of Bloomberg in late August. I read it, but it didn't really sink in till this weekend when talking to the Apple rep about the Pencil limited application on the iPad Pro. I'll wait for that feature before buying one. But it made me think that if Apple's push for wider applications on the iPad Pro is coming to iOS, then it's going to be easier to bring this functionality to a future iPhone model.   Gurman noted that "Upcoming software upgrades for the iPad include wider operating-system support for Apple's stylus accessory, while hardware performance improvements are also in development, according to the people."   More specifically, Gurman further noted that "The planned iPad update will include improvements to the Apple Pencil, a handwriting and drawing stylus aimed at professionals, according to one of the people. Apple has considered allowing users to annotate objects in many applications across the whole operating system, including in Mail, the Safari web browser, and iMessage, similar to what Samsung Electronics Co. offers on its Note smartphones, the person said. Currently, Apple only supports Pencil functionality in specifically developed apps." Bingo.   Apple's iPhone 7 Plus has a larger display and a superior dual lens camera with zoom which is really cool. Apple's third major advantage for their iPhone Plus model next year (hopefully) will be the option of using Apple Pencil (or a different model of Pencil) as we were cheering on for this year based on a statement by Apple's CEO Tim Cook.   But now that it's clear that Apple's engineers are about to bring a serious upgrade to Apple Pencil closer to Samsung's Note, the war drum could be heard in the distance. This year the Note 7 was crushed because of a battery crisis and recall, and 2017 won't be much better if Apple decides to follow through and update their iPhone Plus model to go head-to-head with Samsung's Note 8 with Apple Pencil.   With Samsung aiming to add a 3D touch-like feature to a future smartphone and Apple likely aiming to challenge the Galaxy Note by advancing Apple Pencil, hopefully the two are going to bring some fireworks to the table next year – and I can't wait for it all to begin.   Patently Mobile presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Saturday November 19, 2016 News National Larger / SmallerNight Mode Liaisons and Golden Apple brothel row fixed Eamonn Duff 1 Jun 2014, 3 a.m. Threats and accusations are flying just days after a multimillion-dollar legal dispute over a Sydney brothel empire was settled. Liaisons and Golden Apple brothel row fixed Fight is over: Golden Apple Brothel in Kings Cross, left, and Liasons Brothel in Edgecliff. Photo: Steve Lunam Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Jailed nuerosurgeon Suresh Nair may be deported after release Threats and accusations are flying just days after a multimillion-dollar legal dispute over a Sydney brothel empire was settled. The Sun-Herald can reveal Mark Gray and Hugh Bond finally reached a confidential out-of-court settlement last week in their bitter ownership war over two of Sydney's most expensive commercial sex parlours, Liaisons in Edgecliff and the Golden Apple brothel in Darlinghurst. But Bond has been left all but broke - and seething - after his business adviser distributed almost all of the settlement to pay off a series of debts he had accumulated while he was pursuing a 50-50 slice of the two brothels. While it remains unclear what the final settlement was, The Sun-Herald understands the majority was used to pay off a lump sum of almost $400,000 Bond owed to his former law firm, Gadens. A total of about $500,000 is also understood to have been dispersed among friends and associates who kept him afloat with loans while he was pursuing his claim. When Bond had anticipated settling the outstanding bills is unclear, but in a threatening email delivered on Wednesday, an irate Bond wrote to his adviser: ''pls CALL me urgent. Your not stealing my last money. Because hell will rain down and God will make you suffer really bad.'' According to a source close to the case, Bond not only agreed to waive any entitlement to Gray's brothels, he signed documents giving his adviser ''full permission'' to settle debts, without realising the extent of his liabilities. ''It doesn't look like he's going to see any of the money he fought so hard to broker, and he's bloody ropeable,'' the source said. When Bond and Gray gambled their savings on a Melbourne sex parlour named the Candy Club 20 years ago, nobody could have foreseen the twists and turns which, on paper, reached a conclusion last week. The two men were best friends until 2010, when Bond requested written acknowledgment of a long-standing partnership in case he ever wished to cash in his chips in the business. It is alleged by Bond that when the Candy Club was sold, he took on a silent partner role as Mr Gray took their combined $130,000 to gamble on numerous other establishments, leading to the purchases of the Golden Apple and Liaisons. Gray claims Bond never contributed a $65,000 share for the Candy Club, and alleges a crumpled note carrying their signatures was signed under duress. When Gray brought the police into the dispute over alleged threats in May 2011, Bond fired back with the Supreme Court action, which seemed certain to end in a court case - until last week, when the two sides suddenly brokered a deal. Aside from the email in which he threatened his long-time adviser, Bond is also alleged to have issued threats to his lawyer, Greg Artup of Hilton Lawyers. A bad week for Bond became even worse on Wednesday, when he was convicted of assault in Sydney's Downing Centre after a violent domestic episode involving his former long-term girlfriend Elizabeth Bell, who took out an apprehended violence order against him. The short-term forecast is not looking any brighter for Bond, either - he is due to appear before Liverpool Local Court on Wednesday, when he will face two further charges, one of speeding and another relating to driving under the influence of drugs. eduff@fairfaxmedia.com.au The story Liaisons and Golden Apple brothel row fixed first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

Apple offers the handset in a handful of color and storage configurations so availability issues were bound to come up at launch, it’s normal and something we see every year when new iPhones are launched. According to a new report customers can expect to see proper iPhone 7 retail availability on and after October 8th. AppleInsider claims to have heard from multiple sources in the company’s retail supply chain that gradual improvements are now being seen in iPhone 7 stocks at retail locations and that a big improvement is expected next month as a major shipment is going to land. One of the sources quoted in the report advises customers to reserve the unit they are looking for online first. “Just because we’ll have stock, doesn’t mean that we didn’t get cleaned out for the day an hour before you get here,” the source is quoted as saying. The scribe claims to have seen documents that prove that some retail backlog has also been caused by the bankruptcy of major shipping company Hanjin freight. Apparently some of its ships were carrying few containers that were full of iPhone models but as the company was unable to pay shipping port fees the ships were not allowed to dock and Apple’s cargo could not be unloaded. It’s now claimed that an “unnamed tech company” has paid some of the outstanding shipping port fees so that the Hanjin vessels could dock and the cargo could finally be offloaded.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Three High Desert cities ranked in best places to live survey Sunday Sep 25, 2016 at 12:01 AM Sep 28, 2016 at 8:49 AM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — Another day, another survey. This time, three High Desert cities have been listed in the “2016 Best Place to Raise a Family in California” survey, conducted by WalletHub. Out of the 240 cities ranked, the survey placed Apple Valley in the No. 162 spot, with the Victorville coming in at No. 204 and Hesperia one step below at No. 205. The ranking was announced the day before Apple Valley Mayor Barb Stanton addressed visitors at Wednesday’s State of the Town luncheon, saying “For the last 28 years, Apple Valley has grown and nurtured itself into a premiere community.” Apple Valley’s ranking was one step below Glendale, the city with a large Armenian population, and one step above the City of Los Banos, where Susan Atkins attended High School before joining the Manson family. The top five ranked cities in San Bernardino County were Chino Hills at No. 32, Rancho Cucamonga at No. 66, Redlands at No. 69, Chino at No. 104 and Fontana at No. 136. The top 10 ranked cities in the state are located in Northern California, including Folsom at No. 1, followed by Palo Alto, San Ramon, Pleasanton and Eastvale, respectively. The bottom of the rankings barrel went to Oakland, which was No. 240, Huntington Park No. 239, San Bernardino No. 238, Inglewood No. 237 and Compton No. 236. Survey methodology included an analysis of four key dimensions, including family life and fun; education, health and safety; affordability, and finally socioeconomic environment. Points were given for a variety of categories including the number of playgrounds, attractions, museums, theaters, quality of school system, graduation rate, air quality, medical facilities, health insurance coverage, violent crime, housing affordability, employment numbers and foreclosures. Data used to create the rankings came from several sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau, Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Education, Yelp and TripAdvisor. This isn’t the first time Apple Valley has done well in a survey. Last year’s "100 Best Cities for Young Families" survey, by ApartmentList.com, ranked the home of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. Using the methodology, which includes safety, housing costs, school quality and child friendliness, Apple Valley took the No. 68 spot and Hesperia came in at No. 71. Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and Green Bay, Wisconsin, are the two cities that separated the High Desert locations.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software iOS 10.1 Brings Promised Depth-of-Field Effect to iPhone 7 Plus Users By Uzair Ghani Posted 2 months ago 21Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple seeded iOS 10.1 Beta to developers a few minutes back. But what’s the flagship feature of the update? Depth-of-field effect in the Camera app for iPhone 7 Plus users. iPhone 7 Plus Can Pull off Depth-of-Field Effect Using Its Dual Camera Setup, But Not Without iOS 10.1 When Apple showcased the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus at its September 6th media event, the company proudly showed off the camera capabilities of both smartphones. The larger handset, the iPhone 7 Plus, has a few extra tricks compared to its smaller sibling. It can pull off 2x optical zoom thanks to its dual camera lens setup. But the story doesn’t end there – you can even take shallow depth-of-field photos with it. Interestingly enough, the last feature is dependent on software as well if it’s going to be used by users. iOS 10.1 is that software, but it’s currently in beta. This means if you have an iPhone 7 Plus at hand, you cannot use the depth-of-field features of your handset just yet, as the update is available for developers only. But there’s good news for users too – the first iOS 10.1 Public Beta will be available to download this Friday. This in turn means you can try out the depth effects of your shiny new handset for free, that too without signing up for an Apple Developer Program membership. If you did manage to install iOS 10.1 Beta onto your iPhone 7 Plus, then you can utilize the feature straight away from the Camera app. It’s that easy to get around with. And the results? Here’s one example from Apple’s very own website. Advertisement Here’s Apple’s literature on the feature, as per their very own website: Depth of field allows you to keep faces sharp while creating a blurred effect in the background. When you take a shot with iPhone 7 Plus, the dual-camera system uses both cameras and advanced machine learning to make your subject sharp while creating the same out-of-focus blur in the background — known as the bokeh effect — previously reserved for DSLR cameras. So no matter what’s behind your subject, it’s easy to create a great portrait. Wrap Up When will iOS 10.1 final be released to the public? Given that we just saw the first ever beta today, we’d say a few weeks at best. But of course, Apple would want the update to go out into the public domain as soon as possible since it’s the perfect showcase of what the iPhone 7 Plus is capable of doing. While at the same time, Apple would prefer things to be as pristine as possible, which might result in a load of betas being released before final rollout.

Let’s See Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: September 26, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» As the craze for the launch of the iPhone 7 appears to be dimming a bit, the Apple MacBook Pro 2016 is the new centre of attention. It’s a highly expected and anticipated device and speculation suggests that the Cupertino-based tech company may reveal the device this October. Some advocate that Apple will most-likely wait for the Intel Kaby Lake processors, making the MacBook Pro 2016 a must-have. The possible launch of the MacBook Pro 2016 has now boosted previous reports that the much-awaited refresh is coming about this fall. Compile that with some hype from Apple CEO Tim Cook; MacBook Pro fans indeed have a reason to get excited. It has been more than 479 days since the MacBook Pro has had a refresh, so it’s not difficult to understand the eager anticipation as folks hope that the wait is worth it. The preceding months saw various rumours tied up to the MacBook Pro 2016. Among them one such rumour spoke about the popular features that the next Apple notebook will offer. The list includes OLED touch strips, Type-C USB ports, Touch ID, and a fingerprint scanner. The 13-inch MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air, run solely on integrated graphics bundled with Intel’s chips. The 15-inch MacBook Pro is available in two versions, a lower-end arrangement with only integrated graphics and the other, a higher-end configuration that adds an enhanced graphics chip for sophisticated performance. The 15-inch MacBook are furnished with both types of graphics, and can automatically switch between the two, judging whether better performance or better battery life is needed at the moment. Apple has generally used chips like Intel’s GT3 or GT3e for graphics performance, with the “e” suffix on the GT3e signifying embedded DRAM, on the chip,  improving performance. Compared to the GT3 tier, the GT3e delivers finer performance. If we consider Intel’s history, for chips outside Skylake, the 15-inch MacBook Pro faces a major problem. This is due to the fact that Intel has no plans for any quad-core chips with integrated graphics higher than the GT2 level. This essentially has about half the raw power of the GT3 tier, which will be a part of the next-generation Kaby Lake family of processors. As a result, the Skylake H-series chips, which is being currently offered on the 15-inch MacBook Pro – that we are also expecting to be updated next month – may remain as Intel’s lead offering for these types of high-performance mobile chips. Unless the new Coffee Lake chips are introduced in the second quarter of 2018! Even then the original Coffee Lake chips will comprise of only GT2-level graphics that may not be powerful enough for Apple’s requirements. Mobile & Apps, recently reported that Apple is planning on making the MacBook Pro 2016 thinner and lighter, plus it will also incorporate the innovative hinge design. There is also a possibility of more colour options. Apple seems very stern about removing the 3.5mm headphone jack from its future devices. Probably, as a way to show that the company has the guts to think ahead. Therefore, the MacBook Pro 2016, much like the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, may also sport the Bluetooth AirPods. According to Apple Insider, MacBook Pro 2016’s physical function keys may be replaced as well by an OLED display touch bar having modifiable software keys, which will adapt to the functions and needs of various apps.

The iPhone maker is cheap and the risk is lower, according to Robert Naess, who oversees 33 billion euros ($37 billion) in stocks at Nordea Bank, Scandinavia’s largest bank. “Apple is boring now,” he said in an interview at Nordea’s offices in Oslo Thursday. “Before there was no stability and growth was too high.” Investors have started questioning Apple’s ability to expand after the company ended 13 straight years of uninterrupted sales growth earlier in 2016. Shares are up 6.8 percent so far this year. For Naess, 52, it’s a buying opportunity. He started buying stock in May and now holds about 2 percent in Apple in his funds. “It’s the first time,” he said. “We’ve had the fund since 2005 and never owned Apple.” Naess and his partner Claus Vorm quantitatively analyze thousands of companies to build a portfolio of about 100 “boring” stocks. They are investing in companies with the most stable earnings and avoiding expensive stocks. Global Stable Equity Fund has returned 19 percent on average in the past five years, beating 98 percent of its peers. “Many think it’s a peak, Apple is done and won’t succeed anymore but we look at the long-term earnings trend,” Naess said. “Our case it that they keep their market share and that things will be OK going forward.” Overall, earnings growth estimates for 2017 are too high, according to Naess. A year from now, global earnings growth will be as low as zero percent, which will cool the market, he said. While Naess operates strictly by the spreadsheet when it comes to investing, on a personal level his passion is cars, especially Teslas. He and his family have bought so many of the top-end electric cars that Elon Musk’s carmaker at one time banned him from ordering more. With sales now down, he said he’s once again allowed to place orders and is about to receive a Tesla Model X in the fall. But one thing he won’t buy is the company’s stock. “Don’t buy Tesla because they lose money all the time,” he said. “Economically, Tesla is a terribly bad company.” There’s a high risk Tesla won’t make any money because it’s difficult to go from producing 50,000 cars to more than 500,000 cars, he said. “I think they won’t make it,” said Naess. “I use Tesla as an example of a stock you shouldn’t invest in, even if they make fun and fine cars that I buy.” While his funds have outperformed in the low rate environment in the years after the financial crisis, Naess sees rising rates as a long-term threat to his funds’ returns. “It’s difficult to hide from that risk,” he said. “But the risk for that is low. It could happen but it could take 30 years before it happens.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Stock Bears HAVE to See This Chart Bad News for Apple Stock Bears As the biggest company in the world, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) deserves to be under the microscope from time to time. But if we don't step back to look at the big picture once in a while, we could lose perspective on what makes Apple stock (AAPL) so great. For instance, a lot of analysts started whining when "iPhone" sales began to fall. They acted like it was the end of AAPL stock. So I took a closer look at the company, expecting to see it in a state of decay. What I found was.

After recently pumping the brakes on its rumored electric car project, Apple may now be ready to hit the gas again. Word has it that Cupertino has been in talks for several months talks to buy British luxury sports car maker McLaren. The Financial Times, citing unnamed people "briefed on the negotiations," reports that Apple is mulling a full takeover or strategic investment. At this point, details of the possible acquisition are scant, but FT's sources claim the automotive group is "likely to be valued at between £1bn and £1.5bn," which would make this Apple's largest acquisition since it shelled out $3 billion for Beats. "Apple's interest in the Woking-based company centers on its technology, engineering prowess, and patent portfolio, according to people briefed on the talks," FT reports. This is not a done deal, however, so we'll have to wait and see whether it actually comes to pass. The report notes that McLaren has been working on a self-driving electric vehicle "for more than two years," so this could really help Apple accelerate its own EV efforts. McLaren last year produced some 1,500 cars, which sell for as high as $1 million a pop. Meanwhile, the news follows recent rumors that Apple's car project had hit a roadblock. The New York Times earlier this month said Cupertino recently "laid off dozens" of people as its car effort, dubbed Project Titan. //Related Articles Musk: Apple Is Obviously Making a Car We've been hearing rumors about Apple's car ambitions for more than a year, but the company has never publicly acknowledged that it's working on a vehicle. CEO Tim Cook, for his part, has remained coy about it. "Do you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve, it was so exciting, you weren't sure what was going to be downstairs? Well, it's going to be Christmas Eve for a while," Cook said at a recent shareholders' meeting. But from securing car-related domain names to hiring car executives from the like of Tesla, it's clear that Apple is at least exploring the idea. In May, it also invested $1 billion in Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing.

Sierra was released Tuesday. (Tony Avela/Associated Press files) By ANICK JESDANUN, Associated Press Published: September 25, 2016, 6:00 AM A   A NEWARK, N.J. — The latest software update for Mac computers, MacOS Sierra, brings iPhone services to Apple laptops and desktops and further breaks down walls between devices. It also borrows an iPad feature for watching video while you work and offers ways to automatically free up storage space. The free update was available Tuesday through the Mac’s app store. If you have any crucial third-party software or accessories, you might want to hold off until you verify that they will work properly with Sierra. Check with the software or accessory maker, or look for any complaints online. Be sure to back up your data before upgrading. Once you have Sierra, here are things to look for: • IPHONE COMES TO THE MAC Sierra brings two features already found on iPhones: the Siri virtual assistant and Apple Pay. Siri can help with directions, web searches, reminders and even Mac-specific commands, such as putting the Mac to sleep. I find it odd, though, to talk to a computer, so I still use the keyboard and trackpad most of the time. Unlike Microsoft’s Cortana assistant on Windows computers, however, Siri won’t take typed requests in public settings such as coffee shops; all you can do is talk to her. Where Siri helps is in letting me pin results to the Mac’s notification center, so I can continually get baseball standings and scores after asking Siri just once. I can also drag and drop Siri results such as weather and maps into email, Word documents and other apps. Apple’s payment service, meanwhile, now works with websites that enable it, although you’ll still need an iPhone or Apple Watch nearby to complete the transaction. Apple Pay saves you the trouble of re-entering credit card and shipping information. The Photos app is getting new search and highlights options to match updates in iOS 10, the iPhone system update released this month. As with iOS 10, Messages on the Mac gets larger emojis and previews of web pages, rather than raw links. It also gets the ability to display, but not create, some of the expression options introduced in iOS 10. • DEVICES WORK AS ONE Apple’s devices now all work together much better, though you’ll only notice if you have an iPhone or Apple Watch in addition to a Mac. When you copy text or an image from one device, you can paste it in another signed in to the same Apple ID. This feature proved crucial on a train when I typed a passage in a Word document but didn’t have Wi-Fi to send it in before a deadline. I copied the passage with the usual Command-C combination. I then pasted it into email on the iPhone with the usual long press on the screen. I sent that in with the phone’s cellular connection. My boss didn’t need to know I wasn’t in the office yet. It works the other way, too. When I see an interesting website on the phone, I can paste a relevant passage into a Mac document without revisiting the site. And if you have an Apple Watch, you can now unlock the Mac simply by waking up the computer with the watch on. No more typing in passwords. Setting that up took time because the Mac required that I tighten my Apple ID security settings first, but now the Mac unlocks instantly. • SAVING SPACE Sierra brings several space-saving features, including the automatic deletion of files from the trash can after 30 days. Normally, you need to manually empty the trash can every now and then. As space runs low, the Mac will also remove files you can get again online — namely, iTunes video and email attachments. If you choose to sync your desktop and document folder through iCloud, the Mac will also delete older files and keep them online only. You’ll still see the file on the Mac, but when you open it, the Mac will retrieve it from iCloud, presuming you’re online. • VIDEO ON THE MAC A picture-in-picture feature, already in iPads for a year, lets you watch video in a window that stays on top, even as you move windows around. It works with iTunes and some Safari video. In fact, as I wrap up this story, I’m watching the movie “Inside Out” in a corner. No spoilers, please.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube When Apple launched the first-generation Apple Watch, it’s safe to say that while some loved it, it was never quite the revolutionary device that we had all heard about. However with the launch of the Apple Watch Series 2, many reviews are calling it the device that Apple should have initially gone with. The smartwatch is both faster, brighter, and most importantly, water-resistant, meaning that its usefulness has been extended. In fact one of the ways Apple boasted about its water-resistant feature was how the watch would actually be able to “reject” water out through its speakers by literally pushing water out, and now thanks to a slow-mo video captured by Nathan Smart, you can actually see it in action. In the video above, you can see the Apple Watch Series 2 spitting out a fair amount of water from its speaker grills. While the rest of the watch has been designed to be protected against water, its speakers still offer up a way for water to get in, so what Apple did was come up with a way to expel the water, which is admittedly rather clever. Now we’re not sure if this completely clears the watch of all drops of water, but from what we can tell it seems to be quite a lot. In any case you can check it out for yourself in the video above if you’re curious. Filed in Apple >Gadgets. Read more about Apple Watch, Smartwatch and Wearable Tech.

We all know that Apple has toyed with the idea of making their own cars for a while. Usually, the best way to get into such a big game is to buy one of the players. It thus made sense that these rumours could have had some validity to them. A MacLaren in our future? A day or so into the furious reports, the people from Woking, Surrey in the UK put an end to the rumours. It is clear though that Apple is interested in McLaren for its technology and outright brilliance, but a complete takeover is not in anyone’s plans. We also all know that Apple has stockpiles of cash all over the place (roughly $232 billion USD) so purchasing Mount Everest is not entirely out of the question. McLaren is evaluated at between 1 billion and 1.5 billion pounds ($1.3 billion and $1.95 billion), pocket change in other words. Some analysts figured that an Apple purchase of Tesla would be a good fit. However, it would seem that the creator of the Macintosh will take a longer road to making mobile vehicles. They are currently in talks with Lit Motors, a company that makes an electric self-balancing motorcycle. Like what you're reading? Make us your homepage today! See a typo/mistake?

 If Apple built a car, here are the companies it would probably work with Kif Leswing Sep. 25, 2016, 8:00 AM 13,723 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP Earlier this week, it came out that Apple was kicking the tires on buying an existing stake in McLaren, a British automotive company best known for making million-dollar supercars.  A ton of Apple observers and stakeholders are taking this news as evidence that Apple knows it doesn't have the expertise to manufacture a car and is looking for an automotive partner to help it build factories and a supply chain.  Here are two reasons why that's wrong. Apple doesn't actually do much manufacturing today. It contracts with firms like Foxconn and Pegatron to build its iPhones and Macs — and people don't think Foxconn is an Apple M&A target. McLaren builds its cars by hand. Apple products are built at scale. A former Apple engineer currently in the automotive industry told Business Insider recently that Apple wouldn't be interested in a production process with lots of individual hands-on work.  What's most likely if Apple does decide to build a car is that it will need a key manufacturing partner — several, actually. Apple will need the automotive equivalent of Samsung or Foxconn to build its car. It will need suppliers to provide things like electric motors, electronic components, and assembly services. And it will need those parts in high volume.  Apple could dip into some of its over $200 billion in cash to start the process. In the past, Apple has spent generously to build facilities to lease back to its key suppliers, which might not have had the capital to build the factories on their own. It's also reportedly financed facilities for companies that make key components for the iPhone.  So who might Apple work with? Morgan Stanley recently distributed a list of 30 companies that it thinks is best positioned to take advantage of the coming electric- and driverless-car waves — the same waves it looks like Apple is looking to ride. Here are a few companies that Apple might need to work with to build a car:  Magna Markus Leodolter/AP Images Magna is the name that comes up most often when discussing Apple's car project, and for good reason. Magna is the world's largest contract manufacturer of vehicles, using its plants to make cars to specifications for brands like BMW and Mini.  Magna is reportedly already working with Apple, according to a new feature in Bloomberg about the Canadian-headquartered company. About a dozen Magna engineers are working with Apple in its secretive Sunnyvale, California, car facilities.  "We believe Magna-Steyr is in a singular position to help new entrants who may want to 'make' their own cars by playing a similar role to what Foxconn does today for Apple in the smartphone industry," Morgan Stanley advises.  Magna could easily be Apple's "Tier-1" partner.  Mobileye Mobileye Mobileye has been in the headlines recently because the company is publicly feuding with its former customer, Tesla, and its famous CEO, Elon Musk. But the spat underlines the fact that Mobileye is a key player in the hardware and software powering autonomous driving features on the road today.  Morgan Stanley describes it as a "primarily software-driven business model specializing in proprietary algorithms for vision systems for cars." It's a "Tier-2 supplier," which means it would supply parts to the OEM that would assemble the final product, and Morgan Stanley says it has "few, if any, direct peers." Mobileye says it has 80% of the auto-vision market. Apple might make its own computer-vision software, but there's a chance it decides what Mobileye is offering off-the-shelf is just as good and perhaps better.  Delphi Automotive Delphi is a British company that makes automotive parts. Lots of automotive parts. It's a massive company that has 161,000 employees. Delphi If cars to go an OEM-driven business model where much of the value is captured by software and design firms like Apple or Google, Delphi could be a big winner. "Delphi is one of the few global suppliers that can leverage secular technological shifts in the auto industry to become a 'mega supplier,'" writes Morgan Stanley.  The company "stands to benefit significantly from the emergence of fully outsourced business models of OEMs, driven by ... importance of software in vehicles," the note continues.  Someone's going to need to build brakes and suspensions for Apple's car, and Delphi is certainly a possibility.  NXP Semiconductors and Nvidia NVIDIA Someone's going to have to design and make the car computers that collect data from all the sensors a self-driving car is equipped with — the cameras, the radar, and the LIDAR.  NXP Semiconductors is one of the leaders in this field, along with Nvidia, a company best known for making graphics cards for gamers. NXP says "four of the world's top five automakers" are using its chips.  However, there's a good chance that Apple will want to design its own car computer. After all, designing silicon is one of Apple's deepest strengths. But to get there, there's always the possibility that Apple will buy a chip company to kick-start its division, like it did with P.A. Semi in 2008.  Tesla Motors Kif Leswing/Business Insider It just makes sense! Tesla makes an Apple-inspired electric car, but is short on money. Apple wants to make an Apple-style electric car, and has piles of money. Apple probably wouldn't invest in Tesla. But it could buying it. The purchase would mean that Apple would buy Tesla's factories, which is something it might be reluctant to do. But Apple could find a use for the Tesla factory in Fremont, California.  Bosch Unless there's a patent that Apple hasn't revealed, it's not building its own electric motors. German electronics giant Bosch makes electric motors, and Apple has poached Bosch automotive engineers in the past.  Especially with the rumors that Apple is doing a lot of its car operations in a base in Germany, it makes sense that Apple would look to an electric-motor supplier based in Germany. Autocar fingers Bosch and ZF as possibilities.  Bonus: Samsung!  The logo of Samsung Electronics is seen at its headquarters in Seoul Thomson Reuters Samsung is one of Apple's key suppliers for the iPhone and iPad — it fabricates Apple's chips, makes some of Apple's displays, and may make even more of Apple's displays next year.  Although Morgan Stanley doesn't say Samsung is one of its target companies for electric cars, it's been making moves so that it can be a major supplier for auto parts. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Samsung was in talks to buy Fiat's auto-parts unit, Magneti Marelli, which makes lighting, in-car entertainment, and telematics systems.  The deal hasn't been confirmed yet, but Samsung has made no secret about its desire to become an auto-parts giant. It has a team that's working on components and autonomous driving, and last year it bought a big stake in a Chinese electric-car company. The road to the Apple Car might end up going straight through Samsung.  SEE ALSO: McLaren denies any Apple takeover or investment in the works NOW WATCH: Scientists have discovered why American honey bees are turning into zombies Loading video...

News Photos Ticket Sports Obits E-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Google injects virtual assistant into messaging Sunday Sep 25, 2016 at 2:01 AM By Anick JesdanunAP Technology Writer NEW YORK — Google wants to add a middleman to your mobile chats — a personal virtual assistant who's not shy about interjecting itself into the conversation. The new Allo app promises to be "smart," sort of. Its Google Assistant will butt in with restaurant recommendations when someone types, "Want to get sushi?" It can also send daily updates on weather and sports and will also suggest replies to your friends' messages. The idea is to keep the conversation flowing by keeping you from not having to constantly leave Allo to look up something else. Google is released the free chat app Wednesday, just a week after Apple updated its own Messages app with the iOS 10 software update. Messages works with iPhones and iPads, while Allo will work with iPhones and Android phones, but not tablets. Do you really need another chat app? Here's more on Allo to help you decide. Smart replies Allo can help cut down on typing on small screens by suggesting replies based on context. If a friend asks how you're doing, you can tap "Good tnx." Allo preserves chatting shortcuts such as "u'' for "you." Apple offers something similar on its smartwatch, but not phones or tablets. Allo will also analyze photos to suggest replies such as "beautiful smile" or "the skyline looks great!" — at least for photos with smiles or skylines. Remember that this is software, so its suggestions won't always make sense. Of course, you're free to type your own response. Sending a computer-generated reply to a friend can feel, well, deceptive. Worse, it might make your friend wonder if your response is genuine. And having the suggestions appear in oval bubbles in the chat can make it seem as though a stranger has joined the chat (though you can shut out Google by enabling incognito mode). Personal assistant When you're chatting with someone, you're often making plans. Google Assistant can retrieve information on nearby restaurants, movie times and even the weather. Everyone in the chat will see the Assistant's replies and can weigh in on the choices. In some cases, Google Assistant will even anticipate your needs, such as when someone's asking about getting sushi. An oval bubble appears with an offer to retrieve nearby sushi restaurants. After choosing one, you can tap for opening hours, directions or the menu. Reservations aren't available yet, though Google is considering third-party integrations such as OpenTable for dinner and Airbnb for accommodations. Apple's Messages doesn't invoke the Siri virtual assistant the same way, but it already offers integration with third-party apps so you can make plans (and reservations) while chatting. Beyond planning, Google Assistant can give you the latest news and sports scores, translate phrases or do math calculations. Asking for directions will bring up Google Maps. Not Google Now The app's intelligence still feels, well, limited. Though Google Assistant is an evolution of the Google Now feature that has long been on phones, it doesn't do as much as Google Now in terms of identifying patterns or checking other Google services. For instance, if a friend asks you when your flight leaves, Allo won't try to suggest a reply, even though Google has your calendar. Likewise, Google Assistant won't automatically offer traffic conditions or transit schedules for your regular commute the way Google Now does. You can request daily updates on the weather, news and sports. But you can't get automatic updates whenever the score changes or a game ends. Google calls its Assistant a preview. Following its debut on Allo, it will arrive on a smart speaker called Google Home this fall. Expressions Plain text is boring, so Allo features a slider that can make your messages and emojis larger or smaller. You can send one of hundreds of virtual stickers specifically designed for Allo. Apple's Messages app has a variation on this. You can make a message "loud" with a chat bubble that briefly gets larger. Or make it "gentle" and appear in small text. Sticker packs are also available through a new app store within Messages. One problem with both of these apps is that your friends need to be using the same app to see the desired effect. Google will send text messages to non-Allo friends, but without the special effects. Apple Messages will add notations such as "sent with Loud Effect" to those on Android or older versions of Messages. Too many apps? Beyond making its Assistant smarter, Google will need to persuade people they need yet another chat app, something that could be tough given that Google already offers four of them. Google's Hangouts text and video calling service will be targeted at business users. Allo is the consumer offering, but won't offer video calling. That's where the Duo app comes in. And while Allo accounts are based on your phone number, not your Google ID, you can't use Allo to receive regular texts. On Android, Google has Messenger for that.

The iPhone maker is cheap and the risk is lower, according to Robert Naess, who oversees €33 billion (US$37 billion; RM152.5 billion) in stocks at Nordea Bank, Scandinavia’s largest bank. “Apple is boring now,” he said in an interview at Nordea’s offices in Oslo Thursday. “Before there was no stability and growth was too high.” Investors have started questioning Apple’s ability to expand after the company ended 13 straight years of uninterrupted sales growth earlier in 2016. Shares are up 6.8 per cent so far this year. For Naess, 52, it’s a buying opportunity. He started buying stock in May and now holds about 2 per cent in Apple in his funds. “It’s the first time,” he said. “We’ve had the fund since 2005 and never owned Apple.” Naess and his partner Claus Vorm quantitatively analyse thousands of companies to build a portfolio of about 100 “boring” stocks. They are investing in companies with the most stable earnings and avoiding expensive stocks. Global Stable Equity Fund has returned 19 per cent on average in the past five years, beating 98 per cent of its peers. “Many think it’s a peak, Apple is done and won’t succeed anymore but we look at the long-term earnings trend,” Naess said. “Our case it that they keep their market share and that things will be OK going forward.” Overall, earnings growth estimates for 2017 are too high, according to Naess. A year from now, global earnings growth will be as low as zero per cent, which will cool the market, he said. While Naess operates strictly by the spreadsheet when it comes to investing, on a personal level his passion is cars, especially Teslas. He and his family have bought so many of the top-end electric cars that Elon Musk’s carmaker at one time banned him from ordering more. With sales now down, he said he’s once again allowed to place orders and is about to receive a Tesla Model X in the autumn. But one thing he won’t buy is the company’s stock. “Don’t buy Tesla because they lose money all the time,” he said. “Economically, Tesla is a terribly bad company.” There’s a high risk Tesla won’t make any money because it’s difficult to go from producing 50,000 cars to more than 500,000 cars, he said. “I think they won’t make it,” said Naess. “I use Tesla as an example of a stock you shouldn’t invest in, even if they make fun and fine cars that I buy.” While his funds have outperformed in the low rate environment in the years after the financial crisis, Naess sees rising rates as a long-term threat to his funds’ returns. “It’s difficult to hide from that risk,” he said. “But the risk for that is low. It could happen but it could take 30 years before it happens.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Fintech association anticipates regional investments Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership European stocks falter, euro hits 12-month dollar low Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf in trailer for ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ Bloomberg Video: Resurrecting Jaguar’s legendary XKSS supercar ‘Fantastic Beasts’ of the TSA with James Corden, Eddie Redmayne Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles iPhone optimism blasts Apple stock to 2016 high Apple’s Tim Cook to give away wealth, says ‘Fortune’ Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

A separate report from the New York Times also indicates Apple is in talks to acquire Lit Motors, a startup working on a self-balancing motorcycle. The Financial Times is reporting that Apple is in talks to acquire McLaren, a supercar manufacturer to aids its own automobile efforts for the long-rumored Apple Car. The report says Apple is considering a full takeover acquisition of McLaren with talks spanning several months. In McLaren, Apple may be interested in expertise and talent relating to car materials and “on-board computer systems”. The FT says an acquisition would be valued around a $1.5 billion dollars; McLaren currently records yearly losses. Apple’s car is rumored to be 100% electric. Of note, McLaren has already announced that it wants to build an electric car of its own, for the McLaren P1 or P1 GTR. McLaren has an interest in materials like carbon fiber and aluminium, which overlaps Apple’s current materials of choice for its technology products. The failure of the gold Apple Watch Edition highlighted that Apple is still best suited at being a mainstream product company, not luxury. McLaren currently sells luxury supercars. Although Apple is very unlikely to be building a supercar, the intersection of knowledge would be very valuable. An approximate billion dollar acquisition is pretty cheap, given Apple’s existing >$200 billion cash pile. However, a full acquisition would mean Apple would then be responsible for the company’s ongoing losses. This could be written off as R&D costs, of course. If it did execute a full acquisition, it’s unclear what would happen to the F1 arm of McLaren. It seems unlikely Apple would want to maintain a stake in an F1 team. The report notes that Apple is in talks about a full takeover as well as a smaller-scale strategic investment. On a similar vein, Apple invested $1 billion into ride-sharing startup Didi Chuxing in China. Previous rumors have pinpointed a vague 2020 launch timeframe for Apple Car. However, the group running Project Titan (the codename for Apple’s electric car group) has gone through several shakeups in leadership and it seems the project is already seeing delays. Most recently, the Wall Street Journal said that ex-retired Apple exec Bob Mansfield is now heading the project, after the departure of Steve Zadesky.  An acquisition of McLaren should speed up proceedings considerably.

We pitted them against one another, so you know which one is the best for your needs.  ( Google | iTunes ) Advertisement Google recently rolled out Allo, a chat messenger app that can tap into machine learning and AI to offer mobile users a slew of interesting options. We pitted the messaging app against big names in the market, such as Snapchat, Facebook Messenger and iMessage so you know which brings the best advantages to its user. Let's take a closer peek at what each of the messaging apps can do. Regardless if we're looking at Google Allo, Apple iMessage, Facebook Messenger or Snapchat, all allow multimedia messages. Where voice calls are involved, FB Messenger gives its users this possibility, while Google Allo, Snapchat and iMessage are keeping their focus on texting. However, Snapchat and FB Messenger allow video calls. Meanwhile, Google Allo and iMessage do not provide this feature. You can send audio messages in Google Allo, FB Messenger and Apple iMessage, but are unable to do so in Snapchat. While Snapchat and FB Messenger do not require your phone number, Google Allo and iMessage ask users to input theirs. Security buffs should know that Snapchat offers no end-to-end encryption, while Google Allo allows users to tap into an incognito mode for sensitive conversations, making end-to-end encryption optional. FB Messenger and iMessage, on the other hand, feature end-to-end encryption throughout. Speaking of confidentiality, FB Messenger does not feature any form of expiring/incognito messages, but Snapchat and Google Allo do. iMessage had an attempt to emulate the discretion feature, but it's safe to say that are other apps better suited for this purpose. Group chatting is available in all four messaging apps, and so are stickers. When looking at special features, Google Allo's artificial intelligence and Google Assistant clearly stand out. Snapchat can tap into augmented reality and iMessege just got a slew of new features in iOS 10. The iMessge now packs app integration, which allows users to open up apps such as Yelp, Venmo and Fandango, while remaining in the same texting window. Of the four apps, Google Allo, iMessage and Snapchat lack web support, leaving FB Messenger as the only one that can act identically from a mobile device or from a desktop computer. Location tracking is a must for Google Allo, presumably to help Google Assistant in its suggestions to the end user. Neither FB Messenger, Snapchat nor iMessage asks for the user's location. Conclusion The apps are rather similar when looking at basic features, such as messaging and media sharing. It is worth mentioning that Allo delegated the voice and video calling to the Google Duo app. Google also relies on the Hangout app to cater to productivity. Keep in mind that Allo has a slight edge over its rivals thanks to its AI, because users can keep the conversation going and still plan a route through Google Maps or review the restaurants in their area. To summarize, Google made Allo so you have a search engine inside a chat window, something that resembles the app integration in iMessage.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Beta 1 of macOS 10.12.1, watchOS 3.1, tvOS 10.0.1 Released By Uzair Ghani Posted 2 months ago 15Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has released beta 1 of macOS 10.12.1 Sierra, watchOS 3.1 and tvOS 10.0.1 to enrolled developers. macOS 10.12.1, watchOS 3.1, tvOS 10.0.1 Beta 1 Seeded to Developers Apple released iOS 10, watchOS 3 and tvOS 10 just over a week ago. Today, the company is taking things up a notch by releasing upcoming firmware for its various platforms. But all of the software which Apple has released today is available for registered developers only. If you do not have an Apple Developer Program membership at hand, then you have to wait things out. macOS 10.12.1 Sierra Beta 1 It’s quite apparent from the name that macOS 10.12.1 is no more than a bug fixing and performance enhancing release. If you developer Mac apps, then we highly recommend downloading the new beta onto your computer. A ‘spare’ computer to be more precise. watchOS 3.1 Beta 1 Since watchOS updates aren’t available as downloadable firmware files therefore you need to download the new beta over the air. First of all install the configuration profile (from the Apple Developer Program website) onto your Apple Watch and then check Watch > General > Software Update on your iPhone. Keep in mind you can’t downgrade back to watchOS 3 once you’ve updated to watchOS 3.1. tvOS 10.0.1 Beta 1 Everyone gets a .1 update except tvOS. But nonetheless it’s great to see Apple is working on improving it in every manner possible. You can either download tvOS 10.0.1 over the air, or grab the entire firmware file to restore using iTunes. We would suggest going for the former route. Advertisement Warning for Users & Developers Whether you’re a developer or an everyday user, we will not recommend installing beta software on devices that serve the purpose of a daily driver with you. Installing said software on spare devices is the way to go. But if you’re feeling way too adventurous and want to stay ahead of everyone else, then be our guest in installing everything there is. Wrap Up It’s great to see Apple not sleeping in the background after releasing a plethora of software in the past few days. Today’s release is a clear sign that the Cupertino company is working round the clock to improve its software across the board. Apart from the above mentioned software, Apple pushed out iOS 10.1 Beta to registered developers as well. You can find all the details right here: Download: iOS 10.1 Beta For iPhone, iPad Released. We will report back on what is new in a short while, so make sure you’re tuned in to our coverage. Also let us know in the comments section below if you’re going to install the pre-release software onto your devices.

Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Published:September 25, 2016 12:34 pm Apple Watch OS 3 became available for users along with iOS 10, though most of the focus ended up being on the mobile OS. Apple Watch OS 3 became available for users along with iOS 10, though most of the focus ended up being on the mobile OS. However, the Watch OS 3 too brings in a lot of improvements, many based on user feedback over the past year. Apple is clearly positioning its Watch in the luxury watch space and not as a fitness band. It will continue to be premium. Having used Watch OS 3 for well over a week, I look at three new features that you should be happy about: 1. Easier, faster: One of the hassles of using the earlier Watch OS 2 was that you needed to tap a bit to get to the information you wanted. Now you have watchfaces that give you more information than before and they turn on as you look at the watch. For me my steps and calorie burn have been the most crucial parameter and I have had to swipe at least a few times to get there, now I just keep a watch face that gives me the time as well as my fitness indicators. Also, all the watch faces are actionable now. So if I click on the steps it takes me to the fitness app, or whatever else is relevant.

This is important, because the Apple Watch does suffer from a bit of a problem: the problem of plenty. In fact, every app on your iPhone can potentially be in the Watch too. Now, when you click the power button it takes you to the apps that you have added to the dock. So no time wasted shuffling through screens. Also, it won’t take you long to realise that apps launch really fast now. 2. Siri: Now you have watchfaces that give you more information than before and they turn on as you look at the watch. Since Siri is now much better than before on iOS 10, it also becomes more intelligent on the Watch. So, you can reply to a message you have read on the watch using Siri. For those who use the Watch to take calls on the move, this will be a great way to respond to messages too. And if you are the creative type, then there is even the possibility of tweeting while on the walk. 3. Watch Faces and UI: All the watch faces are actionable now. So if I click on the steps it takes me to the fitness app, or whatever else is relevant. At the end of the day, the Apple Watch is watch. The most used app will be the timepiece. So the new watchfaces will come in handy. There is everything from the minimalist to the loud here, though I am partial to the latter. Again, the fact that watch faces can now have actionable complications is a big plus. Also, the control centre is now much easy to use and reduces the need for avoidable swipes. What needs improvement? Well, I still think the apps screen is a too complex to be of any use. I just void going there. There has to be a better way of doing it and we can only hope Apple is thinking of this at the end of the day. Also, I would like to see more inside the apps. For instance, I would like at least a week of historical data in the fitness app. I don’t want to go back to the iPhone all the time. While Apple Watch Series 2 is still not available in India, it is clearly going to be better and faster than the earlier version thanks to the more powerful processor inside and the new WatchOS 3. WatchOS 3 is certainly the most intelligent of all smartwear operating systems, but it is still climbing a learning curve. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaDemonetisation: Misuse of bank account for black money deposit to invite govt action IndiaLong queues outside banks a ‘serious issue’, says SC on demonetisation BusinessUse indelible ink in banks keeping in mind upcoming bypolls: EC writes to Finance Ministry IndiaNavy rubbishes Pak Navy claim that it stopped Indian submarine from entering waters BusinessDemonetisation live updates: This is a required surgery done for a better India, says Venkaiah Naidu EntertainmentForce 2 movie review: John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha film is Bond-Bourne rehash EntertainmentChris Martin parties with Shah Rukh Khan, Sussanne Khan and Sridevi's daughters, see inside pics EntertainmentIt's November 18, Salman Khan's wedding day, see pics EntertainmentIulia Vantur reveals what she had to sacrifice to live in India.

Book Synopsis Kat grew up sheltered in the midwest, opting to bury her face in books while her friends explored other avenues of entertainment. As the desire continued to grow and her body began to change, the pleasures that Kat had been denying herself all those years eventually boiled over. After graduation Kat moved to the west coast in an attempt to find her true self. A small town girl from the midwest, now overwhelmed in the big city, she soon realized how much she'd missed as a teenager. A broke freshman in college, completely out of her depths, she finds herself scrolling through the darker side of the internet where she happens upon Jazz, a more than willing mentor for Kat's coming of age. Their growing friendship turns romantic, stirring feelings in Kat that had long since been forgotten. It isn't long before Jazz takes Kat under her wing and unlocks the forbidden door to deviance. Where will Jazz lead Kat and how far is she willing to go to find the limits of her desire? Read SATISFYING BABYGIRL to find out! About the Author Kat Kylie is an award winning author of literary erotica, comedic author and human resources director. She's not the Kat that resides within the Babygirl Series. She's the Kat that lives vicariously through the Kat that resides within the Babygirl Series. In reality, she's your average, run-of-the-mill, boring, everyday, mostly single, professional woman. In 2012, she began reading erotic women's fiction when the craze hit. She admits it was fun at first, but ultimately unsatisfying. "I enjoyed the storyline that allowed me to feel as though I wasn't just thumbing through porn, but the sexual aspect was often too mundane to take me to the places I wanted to go. There seemed to be a vast divide between acceptable and taboo. It was either vanilla... or involved lactating step-mothers and/or tentacled creatures from the planet GnipGnop." That's when Kat decided to develop the 'Her Babygirl' series.

However, an iOS 10 security flaw can compromise it. Elcomsoft, a Russian forensics research firm, has discovered a dangerous loophole in iOS 10 which can allow hackers to crack the otherwise password-protected iPhone backups 40 times faster than before. These backups contain your passwords and other authentication data related to your phone as well as the apps. Apple spokeswoman confirmed to Forbes that the iPhone maker acknowledges the issue and is working on a fix. “We’re aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC. We are addressing the issue in an upcoming security update.” The iOS 10’s security flaw might raise concern among iPhone users, considering the history of iCloud hacks which lead to theft of their photos and other private data. Apple acknowledges iOS 10 security flaw that makes it easier to access protected iTunes backups https://t.co/2l8XQV8GVj pic.twitter.com/xn40ofen10 — 9to5Mac  (@9to5mac) September 25, 2016 Security researcher Oleg Afonin elucidated on Elcomsoft’s blog that the attack is specific to password-protected local backups (on the Mac or PC) produced by iOS 10 devices. Apple spokeswoman clarified that the loophole doesn’t affect iCloud. “This does not affect iCloud backups.” The security flaw affects the local backups created using the iOS 10 running iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, and iPhone 5s. These iPhone models are safe as Apple has integrated a special security hardware system called Secure Enclave. Implemented since the iOS 9 on iPhones, the Secure Enclave safeguards the sensitive code that deals with hash keys for encrypting phone data and controls Apple Pay as well as Touch ID. This module is responsible for delaying every incorrect password guessing attempt. That’s why the time increases every time someone feeds an incorrect passcode on an iPhone. The module wipes out all data from the iPhone after 10 failed attempts to guess the password. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLGFriOKz6U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Unfortunately, there is no similar mechanism employed with the iPhone backups created using iTunes on the Mac or PC. Graham Cluley, a veteran security analyst, noted on Graham Cluley Security News that a hacker will have to target the computer to exploit the security flaw on which the iPhone backup was taken, instead of trying to gain control of the iPhone. Usually, the Mac or PCs protect the local iTunes backups by saving the passwords as hash keys in an encrypted file. In iOS 9, Apple added several security checks which need to be cleared to gain access to the local backup on the Mac or PC. But with the iOS 10, Apple has implemented a weaker algorithm for creating hash keys for storing the passwords. That allows hackers or law enforcers to use a sophisticated software for guessing the best match for the password stored in the hash. Afonin explains that this new password verification method in the iOS 10 appears to be 2,500 times weaker than the one in iOS 9. To prove that, he used an Intel Core i5 processor-based system to conduct a brute-force attack of guessing 6 million passwords per second for the iOS 10 backups. The same tool could guess 2,400 passwords per second for the iOS 9 backups. One way to deal with Apple’s iOS security flaw: jump right ahead to iOS 10 https://t.co/9AbJ80wBVI pic.twitter.com/WeSKA6z7oD — Forbes Tech News (@ForbesTech) August 28, 2016 Such alarming rate of guessing passwords by software can turn out to be a nightmare for Apple. Elcomsoft’s CEO Vladimir Katalov told Motherboard that Apple’s security team reached out to his company seeking more details about the security flaw in iOS 10. “Apple is definitely aware they have implemented [the flaw] themselves :)” The iPhone users are recommended to set strong passwords for their Mac or PC to prevent easy unauthorized access. That should be an ideal practice but in this case, it is necessary. In addition to that, the Mac users can utilize the FileVault feature to encrypt and secure all data on your disk, as suggested on Apple Support pages. You are required to enter your login password, and the FileVault will randomly generate a recovery key which is necessary to access the encrypted file. So make sure you save both details carefully, or else you will be locked out from accessing the encrypted data. Katalov believes that a security update for iOS 10 may not be an easy solution to this security flaw. According to him, a holistic approach is required from Apple to overcome this issue. He told Motherboard in an email, “So I guess that not just iOS update is needed, but also iTunes update as well, and probably some changes to the backup format.” So expect Apple to address iOS 10’s security flaw by releasing updates for several software including iOS, iTunes, and its Mac operating systems.

Ian Tucker Sunday 25 September 2016 02.00 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Earlier this month, the internet got in a froth about Apple’s decision to drop the 3.5mm analogue audio jack from the new iPhone. Users took to Twitter to vent their outrage, while tech analysts, such as Paul Erickson at IHS Technology, suggested that the removal was money-driven: “It should be noted that wireless models are the highest revenue-generating products within the headphone market,” he told the Financial Times. Further disapproval was directed at Apple’s replacement for wired earphones, the AirPod, essentially a wireless earphone and microphone – “like a tampon without a string” according to the Guardian – while the writers of US late-night talkshow Conan created a satirical Apple ad featuring the devices plopping from users’ ears to floor and being eaten by their pet dogs. Yet, as Chris Saad, head of product at Uber, has pointed out in a post on Medium, Apple did more than launch some earbuds: “They launched a wireless microphone as well.” By which he means the day when we converse all day long with a virtual assistant similar to the one voiced by Scarlett Johansson in Her is drawing closer. “The next great mainstream interface is not going to be augmented reality or virtual reality. It’s going to be voice. It’s voice agents,” claims Saad. You won’t be surprised to find out that, although the AirPods grabbed some headlines, Apple isn’t the first to enter what is becoming known as the “hearables” sector. In fact, in classic Apple style, it has built on or borrowed from products that have already been announced or are already on the market from tech giants such as Samsung and Sony and smaller start-ups such as Bragi and Doppler Labs. So why all this sudden interest in our ears? “Until recently, the ears have been ignored by the tech industry,” says Darko Dragicevic of Bragi, the German creators of the Dash, “the world’s first hearable”. “The basic advantage over a smartphone or a watch is that your eyes and hands are free to act naturally.” Here One will allow users to adjust sound much as you might adjust the contrast and apply filters to a digital image Bragi has recently announced a partnership with IBM where it hopes to deliver the massive processing power and cognitive capacity of the Watson AI system via its devices. At the moment, it is exploring how these capabilities could be employed in the workplace. For example, maintenance workers could describe an issue, Watson recognises the problem and talks them through the solution – without their having to refer to manuals or computers, keeping their hands free for the repair. Similarly, doctors could get help with recognising rare conditions and their conversation with a patient would be recorded and saved to the cloud for their records. If this sounds a little pedestrian compared to the all-knowing and all-feeling Samantha, that’s because it is. Creating a general purpose AI that could respond and interact seamlessly and faultlessly with complex humans and all their foibles is, as anyone who has dealt with personal assistants such as Siri or Cortana could tell you, a number of years down the line. However, creating applications with narrower scope is something that Bragi and other companies are working on. Another early entrant into this area is Doppler Labs whose latest device the Here One – “Everything else is just a headphone” – is available to pre-order now prior to its November launch. Aside from the usual functions of earphones and the ability to interact with Siri and Google Now, the Here One will allow users to adjust sound much as you might adjust the contrast or balance and apply filters to a digital image. Doppler CEO Noah Kraft calls this “computational hearing. We’re focused on creating a system that uses machine learning to hear better than your ears”. For example, Kraft claims Here One will enable users to amplify speech and reduce unwanted noise such as that from a jet engine. “We have created a system that’s listening to your worlds for you, that’s curating in real time based on your preferences.” Kraft hopes this will encourage users to wear their in-ear devices for longer. He’s not a fan of the term “hearables”, preferring “in-ear computer” – “because a computer is something that becomes indispensable and part of your life and that is what we are trying to build”. Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan aim to 'cure, prevent and manage' all disease Read more One potential game-changer in this field would be real-time translation services – both Doppler and Bragi are working to add babel fish-like capabilities to their devices. Latency is the stumbling block; as Kraft points out, you don’t want your exchange to “resemble a badly dubbed foreign movie”. Closer to home, Kraft sketches out a near-future scenario where the device would recognise that a user was entering a pub for a date from GPS and calender data and automatically apply filters to amplify the human voice and discreetly send football results straight to your ear. These types of capabilities will alarm some because of concerns about data privacy but Kraft is eager to point out that “the last thing we will allow ourselves to be is an NSA system – listening to everyone”. This a point Dragicevic is keen to make too: “We don’t collect or store data – we don’t even know who you are.” Only time will tell whether these devices become as ubiquitous as their creators hope. “Humanity has put up with computing being this external thing,” says Kraft. “We’ll look back and see an image of someone with their head in a piece of glass typing with two thumbs and wonder why we walked around our planet like that, so disengaged. We are saying the next great computing platform will happen in your ears.” More features Topics Computing Headphones iPhone 7 Smartphones Apple Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

The iMessage App Store was launched with around 402 apps only. With the launch of iOS 10, Apple allowed third-party iMessage apps to be integrated via its dedicated App Store. It is now possible for users to play games, send stickers among other things to other users. According to the Sensor Tower report, the most popular type of app are ‘sticker packs’, of which the store includes 1,251 different versions. Out of these 944 are paid downloads, while only 307 are free. Some popular sticker packs available include cartoons and animations of famous people like Justib Beiber and Kim Kardashian. “Apple pitched iMessage apps as its means for transforming the ubiquitous messenger into a nexus for communication, whether it be chatting with friends, booking flights, or planning a night out,” said Sensor Tower, Head of mobile insights Randy Nelson, in a blog post. Apple wishes to bring users back to its native messaging app by introducing add-ons to enhance user experience, and bring them back from using other popular apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. It is also now possible for users to send handwritten notes, give quick responses using tapbacks, have emoji suggestions, and more. Gaming is the second most-popular app type on the iMessage App Store, with at least 91 apps available to download. Entertainment, Utilities and Productivity apps follow.

Expands Latin America Presence, Opens First Mexico Retail Store By Avaneesh Pandey @avaneeshp88 On 09/25/16 AT 2:02 AM Close Apple on Saturday opened its first retail store in Mexico. The launch in Mexico City comes just two years after the iPhone maker launched its first Latin American store in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This is only the third Apple outlet in Latin America. Two retail stores are currently operational in Brazil, the second in Sao Paulo. "Mexico City is one of the world’s top cultural and economic cities and we could not be more excited to bring the very best of Apple to our customers there,” Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of retail and online stores, said in a statement. “Mexico's artistic and entrepreneurial spirit makes it a natural fit for Apple." Apple CEO Tim Cook also celebrated the opening of the retail store, and thanked the people of Mexico in a tweet Saturday. ¡Gracias México por recibirnos! __https://t.co/EHZyAl9MU1 Related Stories Apple Plans To Expand In Latin America Apple Fights iPhone Ban In China — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) September 25, 2016 "Mexico City's 20 million residents have bought from many Apple partners and directly from Apple online since 2007, and Saturday marks the first time they'll be able to experience all the best of Apple, all in one place," the company said in the statement. Including the Mexico City store, Apple now has over 480 retail stores across 19 countries. According to unnamed sources cited by AppleInsider, the company's brick-and-mortar retail expansion in Latin America is, to a certain extent, being fueled by the need to drive revenue hurt by its lackluster performance in China. In the latest quarter, Apple's revenue from Greater China — Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China — dropped 33 percent year-on-year, even as iPhone sales stagnated in the U.S. The company is also planning to expand its presence in Latin America to Peru, Chile and Argentina, AppleInsider reported. However, it is not yet clear if and when retail stores would be opened in these countries. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

The recent controversy over taxing the iPhone maker surely epitomizes the situation best. European authorities' decision in late August to force the American giant Apple to pay $14.5 billion in taxes to Ireland infuriated officials in Washington and is still ruffling feathers. US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has repeatedly expressed his astonishment and openly accused the Europeans of "disproportionately" focusing on US corporations. European authorities' decision to force Apple to pay $14.5bn in taxes to Ireland infuriated officials in Washington and is still ruffling feathers ©Don Emmert (AFP/File) On the other hand, the US Justice Department's $14 billion proposed settlement with Deutsche Bank over trading in mortgage-backed securities derivatives has rattled nerves in Europe, where some accuse Washington of coming down particularly hard on foreign banks. Add to this the US victory at the World Trade Organization this week in the battle over Europe's purportedly illegal public subsidies to Airbus. The matter is not yet concluded but the United States could in theory claim billions of dollars in compensation from Europe. And to top it off, negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which are to resume in a week in New York, are also foundering -- not only because of divergent positions but also because of the calendar. The Americans still insist the agreement could be signed before the end of the year while President Barack Obama is still in office. The Europeans now say this is "not realistic." - Friction - There has always been friction among the two allied sides, but this time things are worsened by the uncertainty from the coming presidential elections, set for November 8 in the US and for April in France. General elections are due to be held in Germany before the end of 2017. "In normal times, both sides would easily reach a compromise on these issues but the problem is that it is coming in this incredibly uncertain environment," said Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York think tank. The rise of protectionist views in the United States with the candidacy of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and in Europe, with the British vote to secede from the EU, has electrified talks and complicated reactions from current governments. "The danger is that what should be routine disputes become harder and harder to deal with in this environment," said Alden, adding that both Europe and the United States are now "disoriented" by the rejection of trade liberalization. Assailing trade partners then becomes tempting. And so France took the gloves off recently, decrying the purported stubbornness of the United States in trade talks. "The Americans offer nothing or crumbs.... This isn't how allies should negotiate," French Foreign Trade Minister Matthias Fekl said last month. He then drove home the point, saying it would be "inconceivable" to continue talks so long as the Americans persisted in applying their laws in supposedly extraterritorial manner on European companies. The French bank BNP Paribas was a case in point, settling with the Americans for $8.9 billion in 2014 over alleged sanctions violations. But some experts express doubts about such head-butting. "I don't think you can really score points in the coming elections in the United States or Europe by attacking trade partners," said Sebastian Dullien of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, adding nevertheless that "some populists may think so." Others point out that past transatlantic troubles have been overcome without too much difficulty. At the time, the penalties imposed on BNP Paribas by the United States did cause pronounced tension. But in the light of day, things look a little different, said Jacob Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. "Who today could argue that the US-EU economic relationship was really badly damaged by this case?" he asked.

Enable iCloud Two-Factor Authentication Jeff Gamet @jgamet · +Jeff Gamet Sep 24th, 2016 9:04 PM EST | How-To If you upgraded to iOS 10 on your iPhone or iPad, and tvOS 10 on your fourth generation Apple TV and now can’t remotely access your HomeKit devices, there’s probably an easy fix for that. Odds are you haven’t enabled iCloud Two-Factor authentication, which HomeKit in iOS 10 and tvOS 10 requires. Read on to learn how to get set up. If you can’t remotely control your HomeKit devices, iCloud Two-Factor authentication may be the culprit You can enable iCloud Two-Factor authentication from your Mac or iOS device. Here’s how: macOS Sierra Click the Apple menu Select System Preferences Click Account Details Click the Security tab Choose Set Up Two-Factor Authentication iOS 10 Tap Settings Tap iCloud Tap your Apple ID Choose Password & Security (If you set up security questions you’ll have to answer those, too) Turn on Two-Factor Authentication Regardless of which device you use to set up Two-Factor Authentication, you’ll walk through a few steps where you verify which devices will receive the special six-digit codes you’ll need to login to your iCloud account on new devices. You may need to reboot your Apple TV before remote access starts working properly, too. Once your Apple TV realizes Two-Factor authentication has been enabled, however, remote HomeKit access should start working properly. Some Apple IDs can’t enable iCloud Two-Factor authentication Unfortunately, there’s a catch: Not everyone can enable iCloud Two-Factor authentication and instead sees an error warning stating, “Two-factor authentication is not available for your Apple ID at this time.” If the warning pops up for you, that means you’re pretty much dead in the water—at least for now. Apple’s support team says they’re aware of the problem and engineers are working on a fix. That’s not much help right now, but at least we know Apple is working to fix the issue. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: HomeKit, iCloud, security, two-factor 2 Comments Add a comment alexa October 5, 2016 Well, this is a great article Jeff, on a very important topic. Setting up authentication and SSO is a basic necessity now-a-days to safeguard our passwords and other credentials and to start with the homekit is a great idea. On an organization level, this is a basic need and with people working remotely, this becomes the first thing required for every organization. We use AuthAnvil in our organization – https://authanvil.com/ October 5, 2016 at 1:57 EST PM Mark Withers October 31, 2016 You missed a step in setting up two factor authentication for macOS Sierra. After clicking on “System Preferences”, click on “iCloud”. The rest is fine! Thanks for sharing! 😀 Mark October 31, 2016 at 12:56 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

PHOTO: AFP Sep 25, 2016 12:29 PM [WASHINGTON] With spats over Apple and Deutsche Bank and squabbles about Airbus and Boeing, approaching elections on both sides of the Atlantic are exacerbating strains in US-European economic relations. The recent controversy over taxing the iPhone maker surely epitomizes the situation best. European authorities' decision in late August to force the American giant Apple to pay US$14.5 billion in taxes to Ireland infuriated officials in Washington and is still ruffling feathers. US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has repeatedly expressed his astonishment and openly accused the Europeans of "disproportionately" focusing on US corporations. On the other hand, the US Justice Department's US$14 billion proposed settlement with Deutsche Bank over trading in mortgage-backed securities derivatives has rattled nerves in Europe, where some accuse Washington of coming down particularly hard on foreign banks. Add to this the US victory at the World Trade Organization this week in the battle over Europe's purportedly illegal public subsidies to Airbus. The matter is not yet concluded but the United States could in theory claim billions of dollars in compensation from Europe. And to top it off, negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which are to resume in a week in New York, are also foundering - not only because of divergent positions but also because of the calendar. The Americans still insist the agreement could be signed before the end of the year while President Barack Obama is still in office. The Europeans now say this is "not realistic." There has always been friction among the two allied sides, but this time things are worsened by the uncertainty from the coming presidential elections, set for November 8 in the US and for April in France. General elections are due to be held in Germany before the end of 2017. "In normal times, both sides would easily reach a compromise on these issues but the problem is that it is coming in this incredibly uncertain environment," said Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York think tank. The rise of protectionist views in the United States with the candidacy of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and in Europe, with the British vote to secede from the EU, has electrified talks and complicated reactions from current governments. "The danger is that what should be routine disputes become harder and harder to deal with in this environment," said Alden, adding that both Europe and the United States are now "disoriented" by the rejection of trade liberalization. Assailing trade partners then becomes tempting. And so France took the gloves off recently, decrying the purported stubbornness of the United States in trade talks. "The Americans offer nothing or crumbs.... This isn't how allies should negotiate," French Foreign Trade Minister Matthias Fekl said last month. He then drove home the point, saying it would be "inconceivable" to continue talks so long as the Americans persisted in applying their laws in supposedly extraterritorial manner on European companies. The French bank BNP Paribas was a case in point, settling with the Americans for US$8.9 billion in 2014 over alleged sanctions violations. But some experts express doubts about such head-butting. "I don't think you can really score points in the coming elections in the United States or Europe by attacking trade partners," said Sebastian Dullien of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, adding nevertheless that "some populists may think so." Others point out that past transatlantic troubles have been overcome without too much difficulty. At the time, the penalties imposed on BNP Paribas by the United States did cause pronounced tension. But in the light of day, things look a little different, said Jacob Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.

Reuters/Kim Hong-Ji Apart from Apple iPhone 7 Plus, the LG V20 and HTC 10 have also caught the attention of smartphone enthusiasts. Moreover, while iPhone 7 Plus offers some amazing specs for an overall top performance, the other fulfil specific needs. Shutterbugs and photography lovers would admire the LG V20 for its excellent camera performance whereas music lovers would tilt towards HTC 10. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus remains in the spotlight for well-rounded performance, except its memory capacity and battery life, write Mobile & Apps. Thus, before a buyer takes a decision, it’s a great idea to run through the specs offered by the three premium handsets, Apple iPhone 7 Plus, HTC 10 and LG V20. The LG V20 is the only one among the three that has a detachable battery. Non-detachable batteries are a turn-off for many and thus, they may go for the LG one. Moreover, it has a better battery capacity (3,200 mAh) than the HTC 10 (3,000 mAh) and iPhone 7 Plus (2,900 mAh). Rapid charging facility is still not available on the iPhone 7 Plus while the other two do offer fast charging. The LG V20 does not have an ambient light sensor while the iPhone 7 Plus and HTC 10 both have one. The iPhone 7 Plus is the only one among the two to have a barometer. However, both iPhone 7 Plus and HTC 10 does not have the Infrared connectivity but LG V20 has, reports Gadgets 360. The Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have both generate a massive buzz surrounding the new AirPods by dropping the 3.5mm jack. If a buyer is comfortable with this feature, he/she will have to shell out few bucks extra for purchasing the Apple AirPods. The HTC 10 comes with a 12 Ultra-pixel rear camera and 5MP front camera. The iPhone 7 Plus sports a 12MP rear and 7MP selfie camera. The LG V20 comes equipped with a 16MP rear and 5MP front camera. Although iPhone 7 Plus has a rapid fast A10 Fusion processor that is better than LG V20 and HTC 10’s Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipsets, the Iphone 7 Plus has a 3GB RAM whereas the other two has 4GB RAM each. If screen size matters, HTC 10 is at the bottom with a 5.2-inch screen, iPhone 7 with a 5.5-inch screen and LG V20 with a 5.7-inch screen.

Specs, Design and Most Likely Features By Neal A. Lasta Sep 24, 2016 | 9:57 AM According to the latest reports, Apple has now shifted its focus entirely on its Mac line of products, now that their latest iPhones have already been introduced. If this is true, then fans should anticipate the early release of the much-awaited MacBook Pro 2016, which, according to numerous sources, will be announced by October 2016. Specs and Design So what are the rumored specs and design of the latest MacBook Pro? According to tech websites, the MacBook Pro 2016 will be lighter, sleeker and thinner. It will also come in a wider variety of colors, and will have a state-of-the-art hinge design. Fans are expecting major revamps on the design aspect of the MacBook Pro, since Apple hasn't made any significant changes in that aspect over the years. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Above the keyboard, a secondary OLED screen will be placed. This screen will serve as a place to readily access shortcuts to apps, function keys, the Touch ID sensor, etc. MacBook Pro 2016 might use Kaby Lake processors of AMD Zen chips. It will also have a 5K Apple Display, or 5120 x 2880 pixels. Siri will also, for the first time outside Apple's mobile devices, be available for the MacBook. No Headphone Jack Some features that have been included (or excluded) in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus may carry over to the design of the MacBook Pro 2016. They are, after all, manufactured by the same company. In particular, the MacBook Pro 2016 might botch the 3.5 mm headphone jack, which the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus did. By removing the jack, expect all succeeding Apple devices to do the same; using other alternatives like the Bluetooth powered Lightning earpods. According to Phil Schiller, Apple marketing chief, "maintaining an ancient (more than 5 decades old), single-purpose, analogue, big connector doesn't make sense because that space is at a premium." Indeed, the space left by the headphone jack could be used for other purposes, like a second speaker. Most Likely Features According to Nate Swanner of The Next Web, rumors are not facts and some of the above-mentioned features, like OLED Touch Screen and Touch ID aren't likely to happen. He adds, though, that the MacBook Pro 2016 will probably have "a slimmer design with Apple's new butterfly keyboard mechanism, four USB C ports and a Force Touch track pad." The device will also come in various colors and have 13" and 15" screen sizes. Release Date As mentioned above, the expected release date is October, but this could be pushed forward to the final quarter of 2016, or even the first quarter of 2017, especially if Apple decides to use Kaby Lake processors for the MacBook Pro 2016. For now, there is no direct confirmation from the company itself that the latest version of the MacBook Pro will soon push through.

Hands on with the iPhone 7 Plus’ crazy new Portrait mode Posted Sep 21, 2016 by Matthew Panzarino (@panzer) 0 SHARES Next Story Orangemonkie makes your Etsy and eBay photos less crap Advertisement One of the most talked about features of the iPhone 7 at launch was the new Portrait mode. It’s a software feature that uses the two lenses of the iPhone 7 Plus to create the look and feel of an image shot with portrait settings on a camera with a telephoto lens. Simply put: a pleasing blur that separates the foreground (person) from the background (other junk). I’m going to get a bit wonky in this piece because I feel the context will be sorely lacking once this feature hits widely — and there are some that are interested. If you’ve ever had a portrait taken in a park or seen a wedding picture and wondered why they looked so much better than the images from your phone, the answer is really a three-parter: A relatively wide aperture is being used, which causes (among other effects) the “field of focus,” or the bit of the picture that is sharp, to be very narrow. This means face in focus, background not in focus. It was likely, but not always, shot with a telephoto lens. This enhances that ‘separation’ between subject and background because tele elements in a lens cause telephoto compression, thinning out the apparent field of focus and putting faces into proper proportion. This is why a nose looks the right size in a proper portrait and looks too big with a wide angle lens. But mostly, the photographer took the time to learn how to use her equipment, positioned the subject appropriately and used her artistic judgment to provide a proper composition. Apple can’t yet do anything about the last one for you. That’s your job. But it could tackle the first two, and that’s what it’s done with Portrait mode. Before we get into how it works, let’s break down how it does what it does. How does it work? I’ll just refer back to my iPhone review to set the scene for how Apple is making Portrait mode work: The depth mapping that this feature uses is a byproduct of there being two cameras on the device. It uses technology from LiNx, a company Apple acquired, to create data the image processor can use to craft a 3D terrain map of its surroundings. This does not include the full capabilities of the Primesense chip Apple purchased back in 2013 (we have yet to see this stuff fully implemented), but it’s coming. For now, we’re getting a whole host of other benefits from the two cameras, including “Fusion,” Apple’s method of taking image data from both the wide angle and telephoto lenses and mixing them together to get the best possible image. We’re also getting Portrait mode, which launches today in developer beta and later this week in public beta. The Portrait mode, which prominently displays a beta notification on first launch, resides to the right of the standard photo mode in your camera app. There is no zooming, digital or otherwise, in Portrait mode. Instead, the Portrait mode exclusively uses the 56mm lens to shoot the image and the wide angle lens to gather the depth data that allows it to generate a 9-layer map. If you want to get a feel for how this works, hold your hand up in front of your face and close one eye. Then open that one and close the other. Do you see how you can see “around” your hand? That’s how Apple’s camera system is working. The wide angle and telephoto “see” slightly different angles on the image, allowing it to separate and ‘slice’ the image into 9 different layers of distance away from the camera’s lens. Once it has these nine slices, it can then pick and choose which layers are sharp and which get a gaussian blur blur effect applied to them. Update: On additional inquiry, Apple clarified for me that it is in fact not gaussian effect but instead a custom disc blur. This is a blur with a more defined, circular shape than gaussian blur. So if you’re one of the few that was hankering to know exactly what kind of blur was applied here, now you know. The preview blur effect is coming right from Apple’s Core Image API. Once the telephoto lens detects the subject, using autofocus and other stuff we’ll talk about in a second, the image processor inside the iPhone 7 will then apply blur in greater and greater amounts to the layers that are further away from that subject. So, for instance, if the camera analyzes the scene and pins your subject at 8 feet away, it will slice the image and apply a blur effect on a progressive gradient scale across the other layers. Things that are very close to your subject may be sharp — included in that variable-width slice of the in-focus area. Once they get further away they get a little blur, then more, then more — until things in the far foreground or far background are blurred to the “maximum” level. Latest Crunch Report Tesla Acquisition of SolarCity Approved | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Again, the effect works to separate from both the foreground and background. You can shoot a subject in “the middle” of a scene and it will recognize that and separate accordingly. There is no precise scale to these distances because they are based on a curve that depends on how close you are to your subject, how much of the frame that subject takes up and how “deep” it is. In my testing, on average, once objects or scenery are out about 6 feet or more from the subject, you’re at maximum blur. Inside that, you’ll see more or less blur applied to those slices. This all happens seamlessly and you see a real-time preview of the effect on your screen, which runs at a fixed framerate under 30FPS. My guess is 24fps or so, but enough to give you an accurate preview. There is very little lag when shooting, around 600-650ms by the claimed numbers. If you see how long a full HDR shot takes to process, then you’re somewhere faster than that and slower than a regular shot. In order to lock on to your portrait subject and to separate it as cleanly from the background as possible, Apple is using face detection to help it find the subject quickly and to tell the ISP what should be clear and what should not. On screen you will see a continuous coaching prompt which tells you whether there is enough light and whether you are too close or too far away for the Depth Effect to kick in. Portrait mode requires a lot of light to work and does not work well in low light or low contrast situations. It also requires that you’re no closer than the 19” minimum focusing distance of the telephoto lens. The mode sends both the standard image and the portraitized image to your camera roll, with a Depth Effect badge. The images it turns out are standard JPEG images that read as if they came off of the telephoto lens if you examine them. On the iPhone, they are tagged with a ‘Depth Effect’ badge. Otherwise they are identical to other images you shoot on iPhone 7. So, why the telephoto? First, this 56mm equivalent lens is called a telephoto in Apple’s marketing, but it it closer to a ‘normal’ lens in photographic terms. Apple calls it telephoto only in comparison to the standard 28mm wide angle lens that sits next to it. So, debate away, but in this case it’s the most tele lens we’ve got to work with. Apple uses this telephoto lens because the wide angle is better at capturing depth data, has a wider field of view and doesn’t have the telephoto compression effect that the 56mm has. The telephoto lens is the base for generating the effect and the wide gathers additional data. If you shoot a picture close to a subject with the telephoto (its minimum focusing distance is 19”) where the background is far away you will see this natural blur occur even without portrait mode. So you’re already starting with a better optical stage. What are the results?  If you’ve skipped here to see how the heck it works, I don’t blame you. The short answer: incredibly, miraculously well in many instances. And pretty rough in others. Apple says this is still in beta and it is. It has trouble with leaves, with chain link fences and patterns and with motion. But it also handles things so well that I never thought possible like fine children’s hair and dog fur, shooting pictures with people facing away and objects that are not people at all. What does it have major trouble with? Fine lines, wires, chain link, glass, leaves. Anything that merges with the edges of your subject a bunch of times could confuse it. The closer to the subject the harder it is for it to distinguish. Motion, too, is a no. If the subject moves a bit, ok. If it moves too much you get ghosting, as you do in HDR mode — because there is compositing involved. Let’s look at some examples and I’ll dissect what works, what doesn’t and how the mode is applying the effect in each image. In each case, I’ll include both the standard and Depth Effect images for comparison. This is a prototypical portrait — a straight up shot with good separation from the background. It’s handled very well. It’s also a prime case for a ‘portrait type’ shot, with a distracting and blasé background that gets made pleasant by the blur effect. Note how the tree is less blurry than the background, but more blurry than the subject. This is the depth effect gradient at work. It’s not just blurry or sharp — there is a scale at work that makes it feel more natural. I’m throwing this one in here to show how little things still trip up the system. Notice the small triangular void in the baby’s arm — it doesn’t get separated. Further software tweaking should help correct things like this that break the system. Data from the beta period will no doubt help. A back shot, showing the Depth Effect without face detection at work. It’s hard to say whether body detection actually fired here but regardless it means that the mode is a lot more flexible than Apple is willing to let on at this point. Extra credit for the chain link being handled well. Fine hair, seen here, is not so bad, though it could be better. This is a pretty straight up portrait as well, but you see the fence background — bars and lines like this can give the Depth Effect fits. It handled this situation well, but especially around the arms you can see it fall down a bit as it tries to make heads or tails of the separation. Grass, too, is an issue. Here’s a shot that shows exactly how the blur effect increases smoothly as you move further away from the lens. YES. It does work on objects that are not humans. Even though Apple is using image recognition mumbo jumbo on faces, and stresses that this is a portrait mode, it does work on things like strawberries and hands. As long as there is solid contrast (note how dark the background is and how bright the hand is here) you should be in the clear. Note: there is no detection of objects or comparison of image databases to detect or reduce noise going on in Apple’s camera app. For now. It also works on dogs. But only cute ones. You’ll have to check me on that — it is anecdotal. Notice here that the two pups are ‘grouped’ close to one another. The brain behind the Portrait process is smart enough to include them both in the focused area, blurring the background but not the ‘subjects’. It works the same way on humans, grouping them together even if they are slightly in front or behind using facial recognition. There is a threshold though, and at a certain constraint that person will pop down into the next layer and get blurred. Another object here, but the effect still applies pleasantly from the point of focus. This may seem simple but is deceptively so and actually quite impressive. This makes me excited for what this mode could be in the future, where we can apply depth or lens effects at will as we would with a “real” set of lenses. The same goes for this one. Object. No humans in sight. Still works. Another classic use case. A 3/4 shot with body and face in the frame (if not fully). These kinds of shots are where you’re going to get the most impact and the most fun out of this mode. Crunchbase iPhone 5 Description The iPhone 5 is a smartphone developed by Apple.

Website http://www.apple.com/iphone-6s/?cid=wwa-us-kwg-iphone Full profile for iPhone 6s And lastly, here’s an example that shouldn’t work at all, but does. There is next to no separation between the subject and background here, but it separates cleanly and blurs pleasantly. Very nicely done here by the ISP. This clearly shows that the ‘distance’ between the slices is a sliding scale and not fixed — they grow and shrink along with the scale of the shot. In the end, it’s clearly an experimental mode. There are glitches and screw-ups here and there. But overall it straight up works — displaying the power of Apple’s fully armed and operational camera and silicon teams. It’s clear that Apple’s camera team is really pushing the silicon in the iPhone 7 to its limits. The effect is stunning when it works, and continued use makes the device run warmer to the touch, especially on the top where Apple’s A10 processor sits. Once the mode ships fully I’d love to see Apple turn its attention to giving photographers more direct access and control over exactly what gets picked and how blurry we’re making the background. Baby steps though — that probably won’t come for a year or more. Given that it’s this good so far, I’m really interested in seeing just how good it gets. 0 SHARES Featured Stories Nom Launches Redesigned App VIDEO | 3:17 | Apps Shareholders approve Tesla acquisition of SolarCity 17 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Airbnb is turning itself into an ‘experience’ machine beyond just booking places to stay 19 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Open source and coopetition are the new normal 20 hours ago | Ron Miller YC tries a new experiment: temporary partners 20 hours ago | Connie Loizos Latest From Mobile Three UK suffers major data breach via compromised employee login 3 hours ago | Natasha Lomas Apple addresses ‘Touch Disease’ with reduced cost repair for iPhone 6 Plus 14 hours ago | Devin Coldewey, Contributor Salesforce looks surprisingly good headed into the end of the year with a strong Q3 17 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Airbnb is turning itself into an ‘experience’ machine beyond just booking places to stay 19 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Advertisement Comment moderation powered by Up Next Orangemonkie makes your Etsy and eBay photos less crap Posted Sep 21, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Director, Software Security @ Practice Fusion at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Developer at CastleBranch (Wilmington, NC, United States) Infrastructure Engineer Tango at The Sourcery (Mountain View, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

 Apple may be shopping for car companies, but Tesla shouldn't be on its list Matthew DeBord Sep. 24, 2016, 8:50 AM 19,347 facebook linkedin twitter email print The right man for Apple? AP Last week, rumors circulated that Apple was investigating an investment in or an acquisition of British supercar maker and Formula 1 powerhouse McLaren.  McLaren said that the reporting was off the mark, but it's obvious to anyone paying attention that something is going on with Apple and its interest in transportation. Earlier this year, the Cupertino colossus invested $1 billion of its $200-billion-plus cash hoard in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service. Then, of course, there's the mysterious "Project Titan," Apple car experiment that is either going to remake mobility as we know it — or is falling apart at the seams. My take is that Apple is gradually turning itself into a sort of stealth holding company; it can't figure out what to do will all that excess moolah, so like a person with a bulging bank account, it's going on a shopping spree and will sort it all out later. Drop $3 billion on Beats in 2014, throw a billion at Didi, pick up McLaren for something in the same pricing ballpark — the synergies will eventually appear. Buy Tesla? The McLaren news also revived an idea that's often been bandied about: Apple should buy Tesla. The notion, daffy as I think it is, makes more sense than getting mixed up with a manufacturer of high-tech sports cars. The tech world is very attracted to an Apple-Tesla tie-up because it would combine two of the most beloved brands that Silicon Valley has yet produced. For many, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the new Steve Jobs. Like Musk, a visionary. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images But that's the problem. Apple has grown so large that it's become a company that's less about innovation and more about managing its achievements, which are considerable. In commenting on the Apple-should-buy-Tesla argument in the past, I've usually asked why Apple isn't yet doing a stand-alone TV, the best opportunity to completely reinvent the user experience for a familiar product. I think it's because they've talked themselves out of it — something that wouldn't have happened when innovation was on the ascent at the company, before Jobs' death. For all its stumbles and growing pains, Tesla is rapidly innovating. Just last week, the automaker released a major software update for its vehicles that contains at least one totally new technology for cars: Cabin Overheat Protection, which enables a Tesla to use its large battery packs to cool itself off when the car isn't on, making the interior safer for small children and pets. Apple, meanwhile, is busy screwing up EarPods and the headphone port on the new iPhone 7, telling customers that should be courageous about these needless tweaks to a product that's getting long in the tooth. Project Titan Not gonna happen. BI Screenshot/Motor Trend Channel There is some logic to Apple buying Tesla. Project Titan appears rudderless — Is it a real car? An in-car interface? A self-driving technology? — so at least by acquiring Tesla, Apple would center the undertaking. But then Apple would need to figure out what to do with Elon Musk. And therein would lie the challenge, as Musk and Apple CEO Tim Cook are the two most dissimilar leaders in modern business: mercurial visionary versus a modest caretaker. Cook inherited a world that Apple had already changed, while Musk is in the thick of trying to change it again. Additionally, even if Apple figured that it could swallow Tesla's $30-billion-ish market cap without developing managerial heartburn, it would be adding the Palo Alto carmaker as Musk and his team are headed into a deeply challenging period. It would be one thing if the only major objective to achieve were Musk's goal of delivering 500,000 vehicles annually by 2018, or launching the Model 3 mass-market vehicle on time in 2017. But there's so much more: Complete an acquisition of struggling solar-panel leaser and installer SolarCity; get the Nevada Gigafactory up and running and cranking out lithium-ion battery cells in huge numbers; establish Tesla Energy as a viable power-storage business; continue to expand the Supercharger network, especially in China; grapple with the blowback from a spate of Autopilot accidents, one of them fatal; hit up Wall Street for another capital raise; and execute the post-Model 3 agenda, which includes developing an electric semi-truck, a compact SUV, and maybe even a pickup. That's a lot of problems to buy for a lot of money, even by Apple's standards. GM debuts the Chevy Bolt. Bill Pugliano/Getty Images The limits of tech Finally, it's worth thinking about whether tech companies, generally speaking, are really equipped to play a role in the transformation of mobility. We have this idea that Apple and Google, simply because they're Apple and Google, can use their brainpower and cash mountains to deliver earth-shattering, insanely great progress. But so far, the only tech company that's had a massive impact on transportation is Uber, and that's because it's always been in the mobility business. Sure, Tesla has made its contribution, but on balance the overall effect has been marginal; the vast majority of cars on the road are still powered by gas engines, and, in any case, Tesla is increasingly becoming a hybrid of a technology company and an old-school automaker. The companies that are starting to move the needle are actually the traditional carmakers. They have the scale to get new products into the market quite rapidly, as GM has done with its Chevy Bolt electric car. Optimistically, GM could sell as many Bolts in the next two years — production starts next month — as Tesla has sold in its entire existence, about 150,000 vehicles. So maybe Apple should forget about the Teslas and McLarens of the world. If it really wants to do something with cars, Detroit could be the place to go for its shopping spree.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 24, 2016 5:50pm   Comments Share: Related AAPL Why Mobileye Bears Are Missing The Big Picture Analog Devices Is One Of Morgan Stanley's Top Overweight Picks Apple reportedly cutting App Store fees for video services (Seeking Alpha) With the seemingly lackluster release of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s iPhone 7 on September 13 and the negative commentary surrounding the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack, many investors were unsure how the tech giant’s latest release and the retail sales following it would impact the stock price. Looking at the analyst commentary between the release and now, it’s clear that the outlook is almost entirely positive. Many analysts are pointing at the promotional activities of mobile carriers, which have subsidized sales. Some are pointing out the popularity of the iPhone 7 Plus compared with the base model. Some are citing hard data, consumer knowledge and Apple’s inventory management as a factor. Most have increased their target price and maintained a positive rating following the release. Here’s what the experts have said about mobile carrier’s promotional activities. BTIG BTIG increased Apple’s target price from $124 to $133, and referenced incentives offered by mobile carriers. “Despite the wireless industry being at peak margins and record low churn, the dominant wireless operators, AT&T and Verizon, joined the challengers in offering free iPhone promotions that effectively include a phone subsidy,” said BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk. Related Link: Apple Selling Off Hard On Negative iPhone Data Report CLSA CLSA raised its price target for Apple Inc. from $120 to $130, also citing the various wireless carrier promotions. “As wireless customers enjoy the most compelling value proposition in years (25 percent lower cost for service/iPhone), it is likely to stimulate the recently depressed upgrade rates for US carriers,” analyst Ari Silver said. Global Equities Analyst Trip Chowdhry pointed out that the iPhone 7 Plus was outselling the base model, and suggested it was due to the importance of photos and videos in our digital lives. Chowdhry also mentioned with premium model selling well, Apple’s profit margins could increase and, if popularity persists, lead to greater sales of the Apple Watch 2. Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley maintains an Outperform rating with a price target of $123. The firm cited preorder data and knowledge of Apple’s product life and customer base. The firm stated that only 25 percent of users would need to upgrade in order to beat estimates. "We think that is quite reasonable, as it implies a four-year iPhone life, and our global consumer survey in June revealed that about half of iPhone users still have 4" versions (5, 5s, 5c, SE). While some will upgrade to the SE, many will pick a larger iPhone in our view," analyst Katy Huberty said. UBS UBS increased its price target from $115 to $127. The firm cited “encouraging evidence lab analysis of search volumes." ”The UBS Asia tech team's latest estimates show iPhone 7 procurement plans for F17 have increased from 80mn to 89mn, mainly due to 7 Plus needs," the analyst said. Citi Citi maintains a Buy rating with target price of $120. The firm implemented store visits into its analysis. “Supply remains the gating factor for iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 Jet Black models which arrived in very limited quantities at stores, and in some cases only to suffice for those who has pre ordered and were picking it up in the Apple store,” analyst Jim Suva stated. Credit Suisse Credit Suisse maintains an Outperform rating and price target of $150. The firm cited customer loyalty as a justification. “Given high retention rates, a superior ecosystem and a multiple-product compute advantage, we believe FCF of about $67 Billion should be sustainable LT,” analyst Kulbinder Garcha said. Cowen Speaking with Bloomberg, Cowen analyst Tim Arcuri outlined that with this release Apple wanted to “maintain some supply constraints” until the demand for the new product became “a little more certain.” Related Link: The Results Are In: Survey Says iPhone 7 Isn't Only Apple Product Getting Attention RBC Capital RBC Capital conducted a survey of more that 6,000 people and used the results to increase its price target from $120 to $125. Nomura Nomura analyst Jeffrey Kvaal maintains a Buy rating and raised the price target from $120 to $135, stating that data points indicated a robust launch and a “supercycle” wasn’t necessary. Wells Fargo Wells Fargo downgraded Apple the week before the iPhone 7 release, and, the week after, commented that the incentive strategies employed by the big four wireless carriers was “reckless.” Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

Why Apple Removed the Headphone Jack from the iPhone 7 Newsweek 9/24/2016 Quora Contributor © Richard Vogel/File Customers check out the new Apple iPhone 7 at the Apple Store at the Grove in Los Angeles on Friday, Sept. 16, 2016. Quora Questions are part of a partnership between Newsweek and Quora, through which we'll be posting relevant and interesting answers from Quora contributors throughout the week. Read more about the partnership here.

Perhaps the best known example is the MagSafe adapter: Apple saw many broken laptops which had been pulled to the ground when someone tripped over the charging cable, so they designed a charging cable with a magnetic connector which would harmlessly detach when you sharply tugged on it. But they’ve also used this data in other ways, like selecting more resilient materials for iPhones; their moves from plastic to glass, to various grades and colors of aluminum were driven by seeing what condition iPhones were in when they returned to the Genius Bar after months or years in the wild. The most common kind of accidental damage for iPhones is probably dropping a phone and shattering the screen. Apple has changed the screen glass a couple of times, and made an abortive attempt at moving to sapphire, but it hasn’t quite fixed that problem yet. But the second most common type is most likely liquid damage. I’m sure you know somebody who’s drowned an iPhone (and probably tried to revive it with a bowl of dry rice)—everybody does. That’s what the limited waterproofing in the iPhone 7 is really about. It’s not about taking your iPhone for a swim, or in the shower, or even out in the rain. It’s about accidentally dropping it in the toilet or pool, or forgetting it’s in your pants pocket when you do the laundry, or getting splashed when a car drives through a puddle, or any of a hundred other accidents which used to result in an expensive repair that made you less happy with your phone. So waterproofing (yes, I know, it’s actually water resistance) is something every iPhone user needs, even if they don’t know it. It’s an important feature. Unfortunately, it’s also a difficult feature. Every part of the phone that interacts with the outside of the phone needs to be redesigned, usually in ways which make them larger. And that’s a problem. The inside of an iPhone is valuable real estate There’s a story from the iPod days: examining a prototype one day, Steve Jobs said it was too big, but the engineers told him that making it smaller was impossible. So Jobs dropped the prototype in an aquarium and watched closely as it sank to the bottom, trailing bubbles. “Those are air bubbles,” Jobs said. “That means there’s space in there. Make it smaller.” Apple’s engineers have long since learned that lesson. Today, iPhones are crammed full of components, with as little wasted space as possible. Most of the space inside an iPhone is behind the display assembly. In this area, the thickness of components is limited; you can put chips and batteries here, but not much else. Access to the outside world is also obstructed—the screen is in front of you and solid aluminum behind. That means that any component which is nearly as thick as the phone, sends or receives radio signals through the antenna lines, or reaches the front of the case has to be in the bezel areas above or below the screen. That includes antennas, cameras, ports, speakers, sensors, microphones, and the Home button and Touch ID hardware. I’ve labeled an image (from the old marketing website) of the 6S internals to give you an idea of how much stuff is jockeying for space in these couple square inches: Inside an iPhone 6S Just eyeballing it, the headphone jack in the 6S probably takes up about 10 percent of the bezel space in the entire phone. (I’m talking about the entire jack assembly—the big whiteish piece in the bottom left—not just the shaft itself.) The only larger bezel components are the speaker, the rear camera, and possibly the earpiece. Think of real world places with very valuable real estate. In Manhattan, a not-so-profitable gas station occupying a parcel of very expensive land will often be bulldozed to make way for a tall building full of lucrative offices or condos. The inside of an iPhone is valuable real estate, and these bezel areas are especially scarce. Parts that aren’t providing enough value are likely to get bulldozed. Waterproofing takes a lot of space—especially when it demands a new Taptic Engine Here’s a similar image of the bottom bezel area of the iPhone 7. You might notice that most of the components are completely different: Inside the iPhone 7 The Taptic Engine is much larger and is partially behind the new, non-mechanical Home button. The Home button change is probably both for waterproofing (it’s hard to seal all of those seams) and for reliability (broken Home buttons are another common repair—or at least people think they are); an impulse from the Taptic Engine is now used to make the non-mechanical button “click” the way the old one did. But the new Taptic Engine protrudes into the space previously taken up by the headphone jack; I estimate it covers about a quarter of the jack’s depth, depending on the purpose of the three prongs just below the Taptic Engine’s main body. And it has to be there, in the bottom left of the phone; it must be near the Home button, and the speaker’s on the right side. Looking at the rest of the bezel, the speaker is also much larger and fully enclosed. Presumably this makes it louder and improves its waterproofing. There are also water-tight seals all around the rim of the phone. And there are a number of other new components here whose purpose I cannot identify; I’m guessing they’re either new antenna assemblies or watertight versions of the microphone and other components previously in that area. I don’t know of a similar image of the top bezel, but with a larger rear camera, a second speaker, and the need for similar waterproofing work in that area, I can only assume it’s gotten pretty crowded up there, too. Perhaps the unidentifiable parts in the 7’s bottom include a replacement for the antenna unit at the top of the 6S. So if the headphone jack couldn’t stay in the lower left, then where else could they have put it? It’s a huge component, it’s only getting bigger if it’s being waterproofed, and it absolutely must be in one of the cramped bezels. Keep in mind as well that, even with the headphone jack gone, there’s tons of other stuff that still won’t fit in the bezels. The 9.7″ iPad Pro has a really cool “True Tone” display which changes its color temperature to match the lighting conditions. It’s gotten rave reviews, and I thought it was a shoe-in for the iPhone 7. But it didn’t make the cut—it requires two extra light sensors in the bezels, and there just wasn’t room for them. Ports are especially difficult to waterproof Besides being literally holes in the phone, ports are also places where electricity is directly exposed to the outside world. It’s well known that electricity and water don’t mix—or rather, that they mix all too well. That means ports need special attention when you’re waterproofing. The iPhone 6S has two ports: the Lightning port and the headphone jack. Lightning was introduced only a few years ago; given how serious an issue water damage has been and how long Apple’s product cycles are, I suspect they were thinking about waterproofing from the beginning, so this would have been pretty easy to handle. But the headphone jack is a different story. The headphone jack was ultimately designed a century ago and Apple can’t change its design to make it easier to waterproof. Other waterproof phones have struggled with the headphone jack; they’ve either provided a plug you’re supposed to put in when it’s not in use, or they’ve not proven to be as waterproof as advertised. That’s not to say it’s impossible to waterproof a headphone jack, or that other manufacturers haven’t done it. But the most dependably waterproof port is the one you removed. It doesn’t actually do very much So the headphone jack takes up lots of precious bezel space, is especially difficult to waterproof, and is in the way of the necessary expansion of the Taptic Engine. It’s causing a lot of problems. How much is it bringing to the table? Is it pulling its weight? Well, the headphone jack has three purposes: Get stereo audio out of the phone. Get mono audio into the phone. Get volume and play/pause signals into the phone. All of these are not only redundant, but doubly redundant: the Lightning port and Bluetooth radio can both do all of these things. The headphone jack can’t really do anything else. You can’t connect other accessories to it. (Well, you can do some simple, passive things like a Square card reader, but this is hacky, insecure, provides a poor user experience, and can be done better through Lightning or Bluetooth.) You can’t provide power through it, so active noise cancellation headphones need separate batteries. You can’t perform media commands beyond the basics provided by the Apple inline remote, or figure out what the phone is playing, or even learn the current volume level. In fact, before the iPhone, it wasn’t even particularly common for phones to have standard headphone jacks. Most phones before that had proprietary headset connectors. The main reason the iPhone used a standard headphone jack was that the iPod did first. For a dedicated music device, headphone compatibility is pretty much a necessity, but a phone has a lot more on its plate. The headphone jack is a gas station in Manhattan. There are more valuable things that could be done with the space. It does half of what it does in incompatible ways There are actually two standards for stereo-plus-headphones: Headphone jacks The iPhone uses CTIA (except in China, where OMTP is legally required), but some manufacturers use OMTP, and others used to use OMTP but have switched to CTIA. If you plug in incompatible devices, the plug will mechanically fit, but the headset won’t work properly. Even leaving this issue aside, the play/pause and volume buttons are the Wild West. The only standard in this area, Android’s Wired Audio Headset Specification, appears to have been introduced in 2015, years after every phone manufacturer was already shipping headphones with controls on the cable. By that time, Apple had already shipped hundreds of millions of remotes that could never be made compatible with it. This whole area is an intractable mess. Headphone cables Stink Have you ever noticed that the feel of the plastic in an Apple headphone cable has changed over time? That’s Apple trying to reduce the cable’s tendency to knot in your pocket. Unfortunately, the cable is long enough that it’s mathematically impossible to keep it from tangling, but they can try to make it a little bit better. Headphone cables also snag (Apple responded to this by making iPods and iPhones pause when the headphone cable is yanked out of them). They end up on the wrong side of clothes and straps. They turn out to be too short or too long. They fray and break. In general, they’re just an overall nuisance. Lightning cables are the same way, but wireless Bluetooth headphones avoid all of these problems entirely.  AirPods and other devices with the W1 chip can automatically switch between your different devices, so if you’re listening to music on your computer and then answer a call on your phone, they can seamlessly switch over without you having to unplug and re-plug a cable. That’s really convenient (and it encourages people to buy all-Apple, too). A headphone-to-Lightning adapter is cheap enough to ship with every iPhone and compatible with all devices supported by the old built-in port. Adapters aren’t ideal, but they’re a good solution for getting us over the hump. In the long run (once the price drops) Apple believes that Bluetooth is the future for casual headphone use, while Lightning will serve advanced use cases like professional audio equipment. The only real cost, they believe, is the pain of the transition. If we ever want to leave the headphone port behind, that pain will have to be borne eventually. And they believe that now is as good a time as any to get it over with.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Samsung Galaxy S8 Leaks In One Place Posted: Oct 29 2016, 11:32am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in Rumors | Technology News   Concept By Steel Drake   The Samsung Galaxy S8 is coming in the Spring and Samsung is anxious to release it to make the Galaxy Note 7 disaster forgotten. Here is everything we know about the Galaxy S8. 2017 will really be interesting for the tech world as we will witness the latest and greatest products from some of the finest tech companies in the world. Samsung Galaxy X is going to be the first ever fully flexible and folding smartphone by Samsung, which is going to be debuted next year. Apple is most likely to renew its iPhone line up and introduce an all-glass build and AMOLED displays. Don't Miss: The Black Friday 2016 Deals on Sale Now Although all this might give all the fans out there a rush of adrenaline, there will be usual business as well. It has also been indicated that Samsung will launch another smartphone which is next in line to the Galaxy S7 in 2017, most probably in February or March. It will be Samsung Galaxy S8. Samsung has earned tremendously by launching Galaxy S7 and Galaxy Note 7 in 2016 and their sales will continue to provide between now and 2017. Samsung’s game plan changed when there was a defect found in Galaxy note 7, it was reported handsets had started exploding. Thus, putting users at risk. Samsung quickly looked into the matter and found out that the battery was the cause of the explosions. Samsung began a massive replacement and recall program, which is still in progress. It is expected to cost Samsung $1.5bn. This shortfall could be picked up by Samsung Galaxy S8. The company has rather big plans for 2017. With flexible phones including Samsung S8 and the note. Apple played low with its iPhone 7 launch, which offers only some incremental update, certain upgrades and a better camera. Apparently Apples planning big changes for the next year as it will be iPhone's 10th Anniversary, this is a good opportunity for Samsung to clean up its mess. What will the new Samsung Galaxy 8 offer? There have been some rumors regarding this matter. The following outlines predictions regarding the handset according to Samsung’s habits and trends. Samsung Galaxy S8: Design Former leaks have indicated that Samsung will follow its trend of 2015 and 2016 , with Galaxy S8 and a Galaxy S8 Edge both being launched. The curved EDGE display will prevail. Statements made by Samsung execs hint that the curved display might be extended to all the company’s flagship brands in the future. Thus, in 2017 Samsung Galaxy S8 model supporting the name as such and the EDGE DISPLAY design will be launched. Furthermore Samsung’s mobile boss stated that ‘’ Samsung has considered that it would make the edge display as the identity of the Galaxy S smartphone line up if the company can provide consumers differentiated user experience through software and user-friendly functions." Though it is not set in rock. The new handset may just bear a flat screen but my money is on the curved one. The other parts of the designs are rather tricky. The previous two generations have sported the same metal and glass designs. The company might change this to keep the users interested. With Samsung being slow to change their designs as history depicts. The S6/S7 are not too bad on the eye and S7 being waterproof. There is not much of a need for change in my opinion, is there? The biggest question is obviously the removal battery feature. Many Samsung users say that they miss it. LG launched the LG G5 which has a removable battery compartment. Though the sales of LG were not in the same league as those of Samsung’s products. So it can be concluded that this feature is not a deal breaker for many smartphone users now. Keeping in mind Samsung’s industrial trends, it is difficult to predict a major change of color or texture in the new handset. It cannot be imagined that Samsung will follow the tracks of LG and Lenovo in modular back panel accessories. Sources indicate that the new handset is being crafted while keeping VR in mind, the venture is known as “Project Dream” which is in line with Google’s Android based VR project named “ Google Dream”’. This project has a set of specs that will be required and Google has them distributed to the OEMs. Though this might not affect Galaxy S8’s exterior features. All and all I think that Samsung will promote Galaxy S8 as a solid product and Galaxy X will entertain the users bored of Galaxy 8’s design. Samsung Galaxy S8: Display Seeing that if the VR rumors are true then the handset will use a 5.5in 4k resolution (3840 x 2160 pixel) display. The market already has many 4k resolutions handsets in competition, Samsung might want to push further along the trend with better resolution. It has been heard that Galaxy X will have a 4k display so it makes sense for the S8 too. This may give rise to further problems such as added battery drain. At this point even if this does not play out as predicted it can be expected to have the QHD resolution as the Galaxy S7. Samsung is the reigning king in high quality displays, to its safe to assume that Samsung will keep to its legacy and its signature Super AMOLED with clever diamond sub-pixel layouts. Thus Samsung Galaxy S8 can be predicted to have a better finer display. Sources state that “Now the Korean tech giant is promoting the curvy screen as its premium smartphone line up’s key identity,”’.Sources said the company has already started securing display panels in two sizes — 5.1 inch and 5.5 inch — from its own display-making unit Samsung Display, the world’s sole producer of double-edged screens.  Samsung Galaxy S8: Camera It was reported earlier that Samsung has been working on a new sensor design that could make the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy Note S7’s capturing capabilities even better. Samsung's new kit has an f/1.4 aperture on a 1/1.7" CMOS sensor rated at between 18MP and 24MP according to sources. Furthermore, the Galaxy S7 has 12MP camera module featuring an f/1.8 aperture and a 1/2.5" sensor size using a Sony sensor. At this time we cannot be sure if the new sensor in a part of Samsung’s ISOCELL or BRITECELL technologies. As icing on the cake, its further heard that Samsung is expected to have a dual-sensor camera and it will be engineered by Samsung Motors aka SEMCO. Hence, the firm will be making its own imaging tech. A Weibo tipster has stated that S8 will support both a 12MP Samsung S5K2L2 sensor and an as-yet unidentified Sony 13MP sensor, both of which will operate in tandem and some special feature capabilities. He also says to expect a front-facing 8MP camera and the Galaxy Note 7's iris scanner. Samsung Galaxy S8: Hardware. This is a little difficult to predict. Samsung has typically updated its Galaxy S flagship category immensely after every generation. However as the S8 is set to launch at MWC in early 2017, so the Qualcomm might not have much time to produce next-gen chips considering how little has been explained about the Qualcomm Snapdragon 830 and supposed Samsung Exynos 8995. It seems that they are not in process yet and they have to be if the handset is set to be launched soon.  Failing that we'd be looking at Samsung using a tweaked version of its current Exynos 8890 and/or the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820/821 and it might cause uproar among the fans and critics alike. In the case of memory, Samsung has so far offered the Galaxy S7 series in 32GB and 64GB flavors with 4GB RAM, and the Galaxy Note 7 with 64GB storage and 4GB RAM, in spite of rumors that the Note 7 would land with 128GB storage and 6GB RAM. However, Samsung has now confirmed that the Galaxy Note 7 will have a variant released in China with this 128GB/6GB combo.  Memory, Samsung has offered the Galaxy S7 series in 32GB and 64GB flavors with 4GB RAM, and the Galaxy Note 7 with 64GB storage and 4GB RAM, in spite of rumors that the Note 7 would land with 128GB storage and 6GB RAM. However, Samsung has now confirmed that the Galaxy Note 7 will have a variant released in China with this 128GB/6GB combo.  Keeping Samsung operation techniques it will want to provide higher RAM and storage in S8. So a return in the microSD card might be witnessed. The finger print scanner and the iris scanner may make a return from the Galaxy Note 7. We will have to wait and see what Samsung has in store for us and we really hope Galaxy S8 is not exploding like the Galaxy Note 7. Samsung Galaxy S8: Home Button We are still not over the news of Galaxy Note 7 catching fire. Nevertheless new rumors are in town regarding the hardware of Samsung Galaxy 8. The new Samsung Flagship phone is rumored to give up its present click form of the Home button and might have something to Apple’s iPhone 7 non moving Home button. Samsung Galaxy 8 might not even have a home screen button at all leading to a whole screen front.  Another addition also includes an arrangement of dual rear cameras. The changes are pretty impressive but yet are rumors. We still have to wait for the final release. Al Assistant The Vice President of Samsung mobile communications Lee Kyeong tae has said the S8 will have a slick design, an improved camera and most interestingly enhanced Artificial intelligent assistant.

(Real Time with Bill Maher) Share Written by Leslie Josephs Obsession Glass September 24, 2016 If Apple wants to live up to its motto of “think different,” perhaps it should try not releasing a new phone for a change. That was the message HBO talk-show host Bill Maher had for the iPhone maker on Friday (Sept. 23). And he advised consumers to think twice before forking over their dollars for unnecessary upgrades. “The only people who really need you to get a new phone are the shareholders,” Maher said. But just because investors want Apple’s stock price to rise “doesn’t mean you need to stand in that nerd line and buy it.” Apple unveiled the new iPhone 7, which scrapped the headphone jack and boasts an upgraded camera and longer battery life, at its Sept. 7 event. The changes to the device are comparatively minor, as Quartz reporter Mike Murphy noted in his review: “There’s nothing groundbreaking about the new iPhone, but also nothing particularly terrible either.” From Maher’s vantage point, Apple’s serial release of new products is indicative of corporate America’s unhealthy obsession with growth. “Somewhere along the way we bought into this insane idea that everything always has to get bigger, especially sales,” he said. He argued that the constant drive for better financial performance can lead companies to engage in unethical behavior, citing the Wells Fargo fake accounts scandal as a prime example. “It’s that very pressure for growth, endless growth, even when you’re filthy rich, that led them to a crime where they cheated and deceived their customers,” he added. Maher put the onus on consumers to see through corporate manipulations and stop buying things they don’t need. “Somebody has to teach Americans that we don’t always need something new or better every year.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Staying safe on your smartphone USA TODAY 24/09/2016 Steve Weisman © Reuters A customer tries on a new iPhone 7 Plus in Australian's flagship Apple store in Sydney, September 16, 2016 as the iPhone 7 range goes on sale for the first time. The launch of Apple’s iPhone 7 has been greeted with much enthusiasm.  The new phone comes with all of the latest bells and whistles, including the iPhone 7 Plus’ dual-lens camera.  However, when getting a new phone many people give little thought about what they need to do to protect their privacy and security.  Whether you are getting a new smartphone or continuing to use an older model, everyone should be taking precautions to protect their privacy and security.  Here are 10 ways to protect your privacy and security on your smartphone: 1.  Password protect your smartphone and use a complex password that cannot be easily guessed.  A good way to create a strong password using capital letters, small letters and symbols is to take a phrase, such as IDon’tLikePasswords and just add a couple of exclamation points or other symbols at the end to make a password like IDon’tLikePasswords!!!.  This is a strong password, and you can actually use this as a way of creating a base password that you can use to create unique passwords for all of your accounts by merely adding a couple of letters at the end of the password to customize the password for particular accounts.  For instance, your Amazon password could be IDon’tLikePasswords!!!ama. 2.  Particularly in these days in which ransomware presents such a tremendous threat, you should regularly backup the data, photos and videos from your phone to your computer, the cloud or even a USB external hard drive.  Depending on the type of phone you have, your smartphone may already provide a mechanism for backing up your data in the cloud or you can get an app which can be used to do this. 3.  Don’t store confidential information on your smartphone.  Hackers can’t steal what you don’t store on your smartphone.  4.  Disable Bluetooth when you aren’t using it.  If you are not pairing it to something, such as your car, you should disable it so that nearby hackers can’t connect to your smartphone. 5.  Install mobile security.  There are a number of good security software programs that can not only provide protection from viruses and malware, but also can help prevent unauthorized access to apps, help detect phishing emails and even provide some protection from ransomware.  However, it is important to remember that the best security software is always going to be up to 30 days behind the latest zero-day defects, which are newly discovered software vulnerabilities that hackers and identity thieves exploit particularly before defenses are created. 6.  Due to the fact that no security software program is totally effective, it is critical to refrain from clicking on links in text messages and emails unless you have absolutely confirmed that they are legitimate.  Sending malware through phishing emails and text messages or spear phishing emails and text messages particularly tailored to you that lure you into trusting the email or message and clicking on a link that downloads malware on to your smartphone is an effective tactic used by hackers and identity thieves.  Most of the biggest data breaches and ransomware attacks have started with spear phishing.  Unfortunately, often we may be partly to blame for being vulnerable to spear phishing because many people share too much personal information on social media that is gathered and used by the hackers to craft spear phishing emails and text messages that appear trustworthy. 7.  Public Wi-Fi is notoriously insecure, and you can’t even be sure when you use public Wi-Fi if you are using the Wi-Fi of the coffee shop where you may be sitting or the Wi-Fi of the identity thief sitting nearby.  Consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN), which enables you to send encrypted communications through a separate and secure private network while you are on a public network.  8.  Keep your operating system up to date with the latest patches.  Here is a link to the latest security updates for Apple’s iOS.  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207145  Some phones will automatically install the latest security updates; however, you can go to your Settings app to see if you need to install new updates.  Delays in patching your operating system can make you vulnerable to attacks for which there already is a defense. 9.  Turn off auto-fill.  Although it may take a few moments longer to input your personal information such as passwords and credit card information each time you visit a website you commonly use, it is important to not store that information on your smartphone, thereby leaving it vulnerable to hackers. 10.  Only get apps from legitimate sources such as Google Play and iTunes because the danger of getting malware-infected apps is just too great when you go to sources that may be operated by cyber criminals or merely do not have effective vetting processes.  No vetting process is perfect, and malware-infected apps can be found everywhere, but you have a much better chance of getting a legitimate app from sources such as Google Play and iTunes. Making privacy and security a part of your regular smartphone use is not difficult.  It just takes a little effort.

However, the orders for components of the new iPhones beat suppliers' estimation.  ( Apple ) Advertisement The weekend sales of the newly launched iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus were lower than launch weekend sales of iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus. Apple launched its new-generation iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in early September and both devices hit the shelves on Sept. 16. The new iPhones are packed with better features than their predecessors. An improved chip, new color options, better camera capabilities and new software features of the novel iPhones have attracted millions of iFans across the world. A previous Tech Times report highlighted that Apple raised the order quantities of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus components in anticipation of high sales. The report said the iPhone maker ordered between 72 million and 78 million new iPhones for 2016, and the figure was 20 percent more than analysts' estimation. Ming-Chi Kuo, a well-known Apple analyst at KGI Securities, also predicted high sale volume for the new iPhones. However, according to Germany's market research institute GfK, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus's launch weekend sales have not been great. By analyzing Apple's sales channels, GfK found that Apple's new iPhone sales were 25 percent lower year-over-year. This is not the first instance a GfK's report has rocked Apple. In 2015, the market research firm also reported that iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus turnover was not as impressive as claimed by the company. It is worth noting that Apple has not officially revealed the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus's first weekend sales figure. A report from Taiwanese publication DigiTimes cites sources familiar with Apple's manufacturing partners and suggests that Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus chip orders for the first quarter of 2017 are likely to fall 20 percent less than the chips ordered in the same period of 2016. "Apple has requested its manufacturing partners stock ICs for a combined 50 million iPhone 7/7 Plus units in the third quarter of 2016, and another 45 million units in the fourth quarter, according to sources at analog chip firms. The estimated volume for the first quarter of 2017 has reduced to 35-37 million units, said the sources," reports DigiTimes. Although this year's iPhone launch weekend sales have been reported as lower than last year, Apple is said to be pushing its iPhone component makers to make 100 million units of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in 2016. Apple suppliers were estimating to get orders for about 80 to 85 million units. It has just been about a week since the official release of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Even though launch weekend sales are low, holiday sales could be higher for the two new offerings from Apple. TAG Apple, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

The biggest audio-related news of the event was, of course, the removal of the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7. The impact of that one decision will be rippling through the audio industry for years to come. Why? Because of the level of influence Apple and the iPhone have, both with other smartphone makers and with audio accessory and component makers. The ability to deliver the highest possible raw media quality -- regardless of the device upon which it is played back -- should be the goal of any media playback device, and particularly one that's so incredibly influential. The problem is that the implications of the move on audio quality are not likely to be good for most people. For all of its convenience, wireless audio connections are generally lower-quality than wired connections because of the need to compress the file over the available wireless bandwidth. Given that most people are starting with highly compressed MP3 or AAC-encoded music files to begin with, that essentially means you're degrading an already degraded signal. Not good. There is debate on how much of a difference many people can hear across different levels of audio-encoding algorithms as well as wireless transmission compression methods, but common sense tells you that mixing the two together can't be good. (And to be clear, yes, I think most everyone would be able to hear the difference between a wired connection of an uncompressed file and a wireless connection of a compressed file.) Plus, you don't hear anyone saying, "Oh, well, HD video is good enough, because that's the maximum resolution of the iPhone's screen, so why bother with 4K video? Why should audio be treated differently?" The ability to deliver the highest possible raw media quality - regardless of the device upon which it is played back - should be the goal of any media playback device, but particularly one that's so incredibly influential. Of course, some of this hearkens back to Apple's largest impact on music: The creation of the iPod/iTunes combination that completely rewrote the rules of music distribution. The iPod created an amazing level of convenience, flexibility and portability for music that is hard to imagine not having on all our devices today. The iPod sacrificed audio quality for convenience, and the implications of its focus on highly compressed music extend to today. However, the iPod also sacrificed audio quality for convenience, and the implications of its focus on highly compressed music extend to today. The big problem in the early days of digital music was sound files were very large and took up too much storage capacity in uncompressed, CD-quality form. Audio-encoding techniques like MP3 and AAC offered 10x reductions in file size, while leveraging a variety of psychoacoustic techniques to keep the music still sounding reasonably good. It was just too tempting a tradeoff to pass up. Today, however, storage costs are significantly lower and network bandwidth speeds are significantly higher, so there's no longer a really viable technical reason to stick with compressed audio. Yet compressed audio still dominates the landscape, primarily because of Apple's initial and ongoing influence. With the company's efforts and investments in growing its Apple Music service -- which it mentioned has now reached 17 million subscribers at the beginning of the iPhone 7 launch event -- there is a clear opportunity to once again set a new standard for audio file formats. By choosing to offer uncompressed CD-quality (16-bit, 44 kHz) digital audio files -- or even better, high-resolution 24-bit, 96 or 192 kHz - as standard, Apple could singlehandedly and dramatically improve the state of digital audio quality around the world. Now, that would take courage. Of course, there's also the possibility that the rumors of Apple purchasing Tidal - a music streaming service that offers uncompressed and high-res audio streaming - could come to pass, and Apple would "inherit" the capability. Apple could singlehandedly and dramatically improve the state of digital audio quality around the world. Now, that would take courage. In addition to improving the quality of the audio files, Apple could have used the announcement of the headphone jack removal to highlight the second part of the audio quality equation - the quality of the connection to headphones and speakers. Though few know it, Apple's proprietary Lightning connector supports the ability to transmit uncompressed and even high-resolution audio in digital format to external devices. Essentially, it provides raw access to the files before they're converted from digital into audible analog format. In addition, Lightning can provide power for enabling features like noise cancellation without a battery in connected headphones, and access to additional controls, such as triggering Siri. It's a powerful though underutilized interface. Part of the problem is that using Lightning requires paying a royalty to Apple, whereas using the 3.5mm audio jack never did. When Apple removes the headphone jack, it will also, by default, remove the audio DAC (digital-to-analog convertor) from the iPhone, because it's no longer necessary. Instead, with Lightning-based headphones, that digital-to-analog conversion needs to be done by headphones or other speakers directly connected to the Lightning jack. While that does add costs to these devices, the good news is that this allows peripheral companies like Sony, Philips, JBL, Audeze and others to build headphones that leverage high-quality DACs and produce really great sound - depending, of course, on the original resolution of the file being converted - hence my earlier comments. Though details remain unclear, the new Apple Lightning-based earbuds included with the iPhone 7s have none of these extended features, and likely use the same more generic-quality DAC that Apple used to include in the iPhone. What's odd, and perhaps telling, about Apple's commitment to higher-quality audio is that it now owns one of the best-selling headphone makers in the world in Beats and yet, they don't currently offer a single set of Beats headphones with a Lightning connector and external DAC. Even if Apple wanted to somehow keep the removal of the headphone jack a secret from Beats staffers, there's no reason they couldn't have encouraged the development of a set of high-quality, Lightning-based Beats headphones. Yet none exist, nor did Apple even announce one. For a company that talks a lot about how much it loves music, Apple sure doesn't seem to care that much about audio quality, and that's frustrating. Instead, it focused its efforts on announcing wireless Beats headphones based on Bluetooth and some proprietary extensions enabled by its new W1 chip. While there's obviously nothing wrong with that, the new Solo3 and other Beats headphones seem once again to be focused on convenience over audio quality. In theory, later versions of Bluetooth could support wireless transmission of uncompressed audio, which takes 1.41 Mbits per second, but most Bluetooth audio leverages 128K-256 kbits per second compressed audio. Apple also chose not to support Qualcomm's AptX technology (originally developed by CSR, the Bluetooth silicon maker that Qualcomm acquired), which offers support for high-quality audio streamed over Bluetooth. The new Apple AirPods offer similar capabilities, limitations and, likely, audio quality (though much shorter battery life). Again, the focus is on convenience over quality. If Apple had developed some new higher-quality, lossless methods of transmitting audio to these W1-equipped devices, the company clearly would have touted it, yet it didn't. Instead, much of the focus and concerns around the AirPods were on the possibility of losing them. For the record, I believe this is a big issue, but not as much of one when you're wearing them as when you're not. Just ask anyone who's ever misplaced a Bluetooth headset. It happens all the time. Given how much time Apple spent justifying the removal of the headphone jack at their event, it's clearly cognizant of what a momentous impact the decision represented and how poorly some might perceive the move. Yet, instead of turning that negative into a positive -- as it clearly could have done -- Apple added insult to injury by calling the development "courageous." Frankly, it was a missed opportunity of potentially enormous proportions. The bottom line is, for a company that talks a lot about how much they love music, Apple sure doesn't seem to care that much about audio quality, and that's frustrating.

Fans -- Don't Get Too Excited About the iPhone 7 Strong pre-orders for the iPhone 7 drove up shares, but investors may be getting ahead of themselves. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Sep 24, 2016 at 9:32AM Image Source: Apple. The launch of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest smartphone has lit a fire under the stock. It was widely assumed prior to the announcement of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus that the devices would bring incremental improvements with no major new features compelling Apple's installed base to upgrade -- and that's exactly what Apple delivered. But investors grabbed hold of a few pieces of data suggesting that the iPhone 7 is selling well ... and ran with them. As of market close on Sept. 22, shares of Apple were up 6.4% from the day before the official launch event. Strong pre-orders Sprint and T-Mobile separately reported that iPhone 7 pre-orders were well ahead of previous years. T-Mobile stated in a press release that pre-orders from Friday through Monday following the iPhone 7 reveal were up by nearly a factor of four compared to the next most popular iPhone. Sprint pegged the increase in pre-orders in the first three days compared to last year at 375%. Along with this news, reports of long waits for online orders from Apple of certain models fueled the idea that the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were in high demand. As of this writing, a jet black iPhone 7 Plus won't ship from Apple until sometime in November. Maybe not that strong Ordinarily, Apple is thrilled to announce the number of iPhones it sells during launch weekend. Last year, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus moved 13 million units, up from 10 million the year before. But this year is different. Following the iPhone 7 release, Apple announced that it would halt the practice of disclosing launch weekend sales numbers. A company doesn't stop reporting figures that make it look good. The lack of data from Apple suggests one thing: The iPhone 7 launch probably wasn't much better than the iPhone 6s launch. If it was, Apple would be the first to let you know. There are other reasons to be skeptical. Long wait times for online orders reveal that demand is outstripping supply. However, without knowing how the initial supply changed from last year, no conclusions can be drawn. The strong pre-order numbers from T-Mobile and Sprint are also not quite what they seem. All the major carriers are offering extremely aggressive promotions in order to move the iPhone 7. By trading in an iPhone 6 or 6s, customers can get an iPhone 7 for free, as long as they agree to stick with the carrier for two years. Last year, launch deals for the iPhone 6s were nowhere near as generous, making the comparisons less meaningful. The real question that investors should be asking is this: How many phones is Apple going to sell through the entire cycle? The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus broke launch-weekend records, but they still produced the first year-over-year decline in quarterly iPhone sales later on. These pre-order numbers and launch-weekend sales reflect demand among early adopters -- those who upgrade to the latest and greatest at the first chance -- not overall demand. The iPhone 7 is a high-quality device, and Apple is going to sell a lot of them. But the initial information that investors have received about pre-orders and long wait times isn't enough to draw any real conclusions. These aggressive promotions may simply be pulling sales forward, instead of creating new demand. I interpret the fact that the carriers are getting more generous over time with launch promotions as a negative for Apple. It takes more prodding to get customers to upgrade now than it did in the past. Perhaps the iPhone 7 will return Apple to growth. Perhaps it won't. Right now, we don't have enough information to do anything but guess. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Sep 24, 2016 at 10:00AM Apple Pay on the Web. Image source: Apple. Remember in the late '90s when PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) first launched, and its big feature was being able to pay for things on the internet with just an email address and password? In the nearly two decades since, PayPal has grown to become a massive player in online payments, processing over $86 billion in total payment volume last quarter alone. E-commerce and online payments are about to have another moment just like that, but this time around it's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the forefront. With Touch ID and Apple Pay being separately launched in recent years, it became increasingly obvious that Apple should and would eventually implement the technology and service on the Mac. The upcoming MacBook Pros are rumored to finally add a Touch ID sensor, likely in the power button that's built into the OLED touch panel that serves as a dynamic function key row. In the meantime, Apple just launched Apple Pay on the Web with macOS Sierra, leveraging its Continuity technology to authenticate through an Apple Watch or iPhone. Even now, before the Mac gets Touch ID, Apple Pay on the Web is a game changer. And it only gets better from here. How it works Apple has released frameworks for developers to implement Apple Pay in apps and on websites. Much like how PayPal just needs merchants to implement PayPal on their sites in order to accept PayPal payments, the same goes for Apple. Example of the Apple Pay prompt. Image source: Author's screenshot. Once a site supports Apple Pay, customers will see the familiar Apple Pay button. Click that, and your Mac will automatically load up all of your payment and billing information. This information is still being stored in the mobile device, and you can authorize the payment by either double-tapping the side button on Apple Watch, or using Touch ID on iPhone. That's it. This has a lot more potential than at retail stores, since the added convenience is more meaningful. Swiping a credit card has always been a tough hurdle to beat in terms of convenience, since it's already fast and easy enough as it is. But everyone hates inputting payment info on the Web constantly. This is especially true on mobile devices, but also true on the desktop. As Touch ID slowly makes its way through the Mac lineup while an increasing number of merchants adopt the service, it's going to be almost too easy to pay for the things on the internet. The competition PayPal doesn't really have a way to offer a competitive alternative here. While its standard email and password authentication is still easy, the company can't adopt biometric authentication as easily since it doesn't control the hardware. PayPal is popular internationally, and should still enjoy a strong position in geographical markets where Apple has a weak presence. A greater threat will be Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android Pay on the Web. Google is starting by bringing Android Pay to mobile websites, releasing APIs earlier this year for developers to implement. Android Pay uses various authentication methods, since not all Android devices have fingerprint sensors. But Android can't really make the leap from mobile to desktop, which is where the real opportunity lies. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Apple's Reported Plans to Challenge Amazon Make Sense, But Won't Move the Needle Much Apple might have some ways to differentiated its rumored home speaker. But competition will still be stiff, and the addressable market modest for a company of Apple's size. Eric Jhonsa Sep 24, 2016 10:00 AM EDT With Amazon's (AMZN)  Echo speaker/voice assistant line having gradually become a hit, and Alphabet's (GOOGL)  Google on the verge of launching a rival device, it looks as if Apple (AAPL) has decided it, too, needs to offer a speaker/voice assistant device for homes. Apple's reported plans are quite understandable, and the company might have a few ways to make its device stand out, particularly to iPhone/iPad users. But given the competition and the relatively modest size of the addressable market, the product is unlikely to have a big financial impact on the world's most profitable company. Bloomberg reported on Friday Apple is prepping "an Echo-like smart-home device based on the Siri voice assistant." It adds the device has reached the prototype testing phase, but cautions Apple's plans aren't finalized and the project could still be scrapped. The Information had already reported in May an Echo-like device is being prepped. But VentureBeat reported a few days later Apple's home assistant would be built into a new Apple TV set-top, rather than work as a standalone device. It looks as if The Information's report was closer to the mark. Bloomberg's scoop comes just nine days after Amazon unveiled a new version of its hockey puck-shaped Echo Dot device that goes for just $50 -- $40 less than the original Dot, and $130 less than what the original Echo sells for -- and features a better speech processor. It also comes ahead of an Oct. 4 Google event at which the company is expected (among other things) to share a launch date and pricing for its Google Home speaker/assistant, which was first unveiled at its May I/O conference. Android Police reports Home, which (along with Android 7.0) supports a new Google Assistant service, will sell for $129.

Breaking News Day at a glance Weather Horoscopes Ireland Business World Showbiz #Discover Sport Tech Jobs Property Login Trump presidency Public-sector pay Syria Weather conditions Health Nama Apple said to be considering its first retail store in Seoul, right next to Samsung's HQ PreviousNext 24/09/2016 - 15:25:26Back to Business Home Apple is interested in opening its first retail store in South Korea, the home of rivals Samsung. The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple has made enquiries about expanding into the country, even citing sources who claim the iPhone maker has already looked at sites across the street from Samsung’s headquarters in the capital, Seoul. (AP) This also happens to be the location of Samsung’s own flagship retail store, an impressive three-storey building in the city’s up-market Gangnam district. Moving into South Korea would be a bold strategy as well as an aggressive one for Apple, as the country’s smartphone market is dominated by Samsung and fellow Korean electronics giant LG, who between them account for around 80% of the market. The Asian market has become increasingly important to Apple in recent years, with the tech giant opening 36 stores in China at last count, as well as six in Hong Kong and seven in Japan. (Richard Drew/AP) Apple will also be looking to take advantage of Samsung’s recent battery issues that have blighted the launch of the Note 7, with many units worldwide forced to be recalled over risks of catching fire and exploding. However, Samsung’s share of the global smartphone market continues to rise, moving up to just over 22% of the total market in the last quarter. Apple’s actually fell in the same period according to research firm Gartner – from 14.6% to 12.9%. The new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, launched earlier this month, will set about changing that.

Meanwhile, it had maintained a number-one ranking on TripAdvisor for tours in Brooklyn. But in July, Lavalle’s world shifted dramatically – he found himself down to his last $200.” Along the way, the entrepreneur learned critical lessons about cash flow management, expansion and global economics. Now he has a new strategy and is attempting a turnaround. Get the story at this link. THE BUSINESSES THAT PLATFORMS ARE ACTUALLY DISRUPTING “Platforms are all the rage these days. Powered by online technologies, they are sweeping across the economic landscape, striking down companies large and small. Uber’s global assault on the taxi industry is well known. Many platforms, some household names and others laboring in obscurity, are doing the same in other sectors,” says Harvard Business Review. “Surveying these changes, you might conclude that if your business isn’t a platform, you had better worry that one is coming your way. Everyone from automakers to plumbers should count their days as traditional businesses. And maybe you should jump on the platform bandwagon too. If it worked for Airbnb, why not you?” Based on our research into the wave of online platforms that have started in the last two decades, we don’t necessarily disagree. Traditional businesses should worry, and maybe they should think about platform strategies. But we think these conclusions are overwrought – and miss what’s really going on. The businesses most at risk from platforms powered by rapidly improving online technologies aren’t, in fact, traditional businesses that sell products and services to consumers. They’re “traditional” matchmaker businesses that have been operating platforms for connecting different groups of customers. “The evidence is striking that these existing matchmakers, rather than traditional firms, have so far experienced the greatest disruption from new platforms.” For more on this story and how it may affect your business, connect here. INSIDE APPLE AND IBM’S APP MAKING MACHINE Fast Company posts, “This is how the (unlikely) partnership actually works, as told by the people from both companies who manage it every day.” “On a July day in 2014 some people from IBM and Apple got together in a room at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California to start work on their recently announced business app creation partnership. The fact that the two companies were working together at all sounded a little unlikely; IBM, after all, was once cast in Apple mythology as the big, slow, and safe antithesis of everything Steve Jobs wanted his company to be. At least in the consumer space, the two were bitter rivals.” “The IBM people brought with them to Cupertino that day a mobile app they’d been working on – a fuel calculation app for airline pilots – that they thought might serve as a starting point for the partnership. It was built by IBM people, who had also built some powerful data analytics into the background. The IBM people hoped the Apple people would see it and be impressed, and then the two companies would continue building the app together.” But that’s not what happened. IBM’s app – all 40 screens of it – was a bloated mess. One Apple UI expert in the meeting said simply “that’s not going to work,” a person who was there told me. Pilots, the expert said, would not go through 40 screens in an app, even if they were currently doing the same tasks on paper. So began the Apple/IBM partnership, which is officially known as IBM MobileFirst for iOS. IBM’s fuel app didn’t end up launching the partnership, but the Apple UI expert’s criticism of it summed up the design sense that would guide the creation of IBM MobileFirst apps going forward. It also said a lot about the what the dynamic of IBM and Apple’s working relationship would be. Follow this link to learn more. TWO FAMOUS GOOGLE ALUMS ARE ADVISING A SECRET STARTUP “Alex Teichman crawled on the carpet as the dog ran around him. A camera watched them closely nearby,” says Business Insider. “On the screen of the computer, Teichman’s outline was glaring red, despite him being on all fours like the dog. The pet, though, was a shining green.” It was graduation day from Stanford’s StartX incubator, and Teichman and his cofounder Hendrik Dahlkamp had built a home security system home that can tell the difference between humans, a potential threat, and things like dogs running around a yard. However, the video of Teichman versus the dog is the last public evidence of a company then-called Snitch. In early 2015, IEEE wrote the only story about what the duo was working on, complete with the video. “Since then, though, buzz has been slowly building around the “well-funded” and “first-rate” mysterious company and its newly discovered ties to major Google alums. With its focus on machine vision and their expertise in self-driving cars, speculation about the project’s potential is growing.” A few recent clues discovered by Business Insider hint at what the tight-lipped startup might be working on. You can see those hints at this link. HOW TRUMP COULD WIN THE DEBATE “Hillary Clinton will almost certainly win Monday night’s epic presidential debate on points — and still could lose,” reports POLITICO Magazine. “It’s hard to see how Clinton, who has marinated in public policy for 30 years and is preparing for the debate like it is the invasion of Normandy, won’t repeatedly best Donald Trump on substance. Her strength in this area perfectly matches Trump’s weakness. Trump has appeared to learn for the first time such basic information as that the Trans-Pacific Partnership doesn’t include China and that Russia has already invaded Ukraine on the debate stage or during a media interview. He sometimes reads his speeches as if they include revelations to him — “so true,” he’ll interject after coming across a striking fact or observation in the text. If Trump has spent time hitting the briefing books, his campaign has kept it under wraps and he has yet to reveal any hint of a new policy depth in anything he’s said over the past few weeks. So Trump won’t be particularly well-informed, and figures it won’t particularly matter — and may well be right. Trump has a significant built-in advantage in that there is a lower standard for him — not because the media isn’t tough enough on him, as all the media mavens agree, but because he is the de facto challenger and candidate of change in a change election. Trump can win by clearing a bar of acceptability, whereas Clinton has to do more than that and either significantly wound Trump or make a compellingly positive case for herself that has so far eluded her in both 2008 and 2016. For more on this intriguing analysis, follow here. LIBERALS SEE HILLARY’S FOCUS ON BIG DONORS AS DATED “In 2012, B. Rowe Winecoff, a retired social worker from Newton, Iowa, contributed $120 to President Obama’s re-election campaign. But he has yet to give any money to Hillary Clinton in this election. “This year just seems dirtier than ever,” said Mr. Winecoff, a Democrat, in the The New York Times. “Even as newly released financial disclosures reveal that Mrs. Clinton enjoys a substantial fund-raising advantage over Donald J. Trump, she is struggling to replicate the sort of small-dollar juggernaut that Mr. Obama enjoyed in his campaigns and Senator Bernie Sanders relied on in this year’s Democratic primaries.” In an illustration of the lack of enthusiasm for her among some liberal activists, just 24 percent of the contributors to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign so far have given $200 or less. In 2012, 43 percent of the money to Mr. Obama was from contributors who gave $200 or less, and this year 58 percent of the giving to Mr. Sanders’s grass-roots bid came from small-dollar donors. “Without this online network, Mrs. Clinton is being made to continue with an aggressive calendar of fund-raisers with rich donors as Election Day grows near — events that can limit her time in swing states and reinforce concerns that give rank-and-file Democrats pause.” For the complete read, go to this link. LIFE OF THE GRAND OLD PARTY U.S. News & World Report says, “The “Growth & Opportunity Project” commissioned by the Republican National Committee following the 2012 presidential election was supposed to be the party’s blueprint for a rebound back to power.” “The 97-page document – more commonly and grimly known as “the autopsy” – was a noble, ambitious enterprise that listed a series of specific recommendations for how the GOP could improve its campaign mechanics, messaging, candidate recruitment and fundraising. No priority was greater than making inroads on demographic diversity: increasing the party’s appeal to minorities, women and youth. After Mitt Romney’s loss, despite the support of traditional GOP coalitions like white men and evangelical Christians, it was deemed a matter of survival.” But nearly four years after its submission, a U.S. News investigation – which included interviews with more than three dozen Republicans at all levels across the country – shows that some of the most significant changes sought, particularly on demographic outreach, haven’t come to pass.

Hillary Clinton’s leads are shrinking in the battleground states of Colorado and Virginia, according to a new poll from Quinnipiac University that also shows Donald Trump up in Georgia and Iowa. “The findings reflect a tightening in the presidential race across the country, as Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, continues to make up ground in swing states ahead of next week’s presidential debate.” “Iowa, Virginia and Colorado are a metaphor for what is happening in the presidential race,” Peter Brown, the Quinnipiac poll assistant director, said in a statement. For the complete story, follow this link. NEW STUDY SHOWS A CHILD’S FINGERPRINT DOESN’T AGE Forbes says, “A new study from biometric researchers at Michigan State University points to evidence that digital scans of a fingerprint of a child six months old can be recognized one year later. This finding illustrates that fingerprints from a child, even as young as six hours old, showed distinguishing features that can be used for identity and recognition. The prevailing theory is that the fingerprint of an infant for identification later was unreliable.” “In the study conducted at Saran Ashram hospital in Dayalbagh, India, researchers collected the fingerprints of 309 children age 0 to five years old at four different times over a period of one year. They were able to show in the study that state-of-the-art fingerprint technology yields a high recognition accuracy of 98.9% for children six months or older.” The importance of this finding will help developing countries recognize children for vaccination tracking, supplementary food delivery and national identification documents of young children six months and older. The identification of children through fingerprinting could also turn the tables on the more than more than five million children who lose their lives to vaccine-preventable diseases each year in developing countries.

By India Ashok September 24, 2016 14:36 BST It is still unclear as to how long it may take for Apple to come up with a patch which will fix the vulnerabilitiesApple A "severe" security flaw has been uncovered in Apple's newly-released iOS 10, which according to security researchers, can allow hackers to crack the passwords for backups stored on a Mac or PC 2,500 faster than before. A latest report says as compared to iOS 9 or previous iPhone OS (operating system) versions' protection technique the backup data mechanism in iOS 10 is vulnerable to password-cracking tools commonly used by hackers. Russia-headquartered Elcomsoft researcher Oleg Afonin said in a company blog, "This new vector of attack is specific to password-protected local backups produced by iOS 10 devices. The attack itself is only available for iOS 10 backups. Interestingly, the 'new' password verification method exists in parallel with the 'old' method, which continues to work with the same slow speeds as before. The new security check is approximately 2,500 times weaker compared to the old one that was used in iOS 9 backups." Elcomsoft researchers discovered that when iOS 10 backups that are saved to a PC or Mac via iTunes, password-cracking tools can be used to conduct brute-force attacks at the alarming rate of 6,000,000 per second. Additionally, the researchers said that if hackers are successful in cracking the password, they would then be able to "decrypt the entire content of the backup including the keychain". Apple working on security update to fix the issue "We're aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC. We are addressing this issue in an upcoming security update," an Apple spokesperson said in a statement. "This does not affect iCloud backups. We recommend users ensure their Mac or PC are protected with strong passwords and can only be accessed by authorized users. Additional security is also available with FileVault whole disk encryption." Elcomsoft CEO Vladimir Katalov told Motherboard that they had not alerted Apple about the vulnerability prior to publishing it. However, he claimed that the firm has responded to a request from Apple's security team, which asked for further information about the vulnerability. "Apple is definitely aware they have implemented [the flaw] themselves :)," Katalov said. Are there other vulnerabilities for iOS 10? According to security experts, contrary to popular belief, iOS, like other mobile OS is not immune to threats from malware. Check Point mobile security researcher Daniel Padon told IB Times UK, "Unlike the common belief, iOS is far from being immune to malware, and they manage to find their way into iPhones worldwide. For example, in the first half of 2016, two iOS malware even made it to the top 10 most common mobile malware worldwide. The malware, XcodeGhost and AceDeceiver infected thousands of iOS devices." Security researcher Will Strafach told IBTimes UK, that in the case of the above mentioned malware, "iOS10 cannot really prevent this type of malware. Both instances are related to apps being submitted to the App Store and approved by Apple. Because Apple has such a fast review period, they seem to often miss apps that use private APIs and accept them into the App Store." He added that Apple has since modified its OS to restrict private APIs, which he said "is a pretty smart move as it allows for fast approvals and can kill the effectiveness of a certain type of private API abuse at a system level instead of trying to go app by app, but on the other hand, it means that you may need to wait some time for a fix to ship." However, he added, that there are ways to circumvent Apple's restriction. Strafach said, "For example, Apple has tried to ensure that apps cannot check what other apps are installed on a device, but there is a private API called LSApplicationWorkspace which presently still works to allow access to this information even in iOS 10 (and gives a nice amount of information about each app as well). This is abused by some apps which are live in the store now, and it is very difficult to 'restrict' this API on Apple's side as it would actually cause unrelated issues related to legitimate use cases for the MCS framework that the private API is found within. "Situations like this are difficult cases, and surely will give opportunists some time to abuse what they can while it is available, but Apple's long term strategy for handling this type of thing will eventually make it very difficult to do anything nefarious regardless of what you can sneak into the store." iOS 10 security flaw may not be fixed with just a regular update Although Apple may be eager to fix the vulnerability, given the complex and varied software systems involved, it may take more than just a regular security update to comprehensively address the issue. It is still unclear as to how long it may take the tech giant to come up with a patch which will fix the vulnerabilities. "The fix itself is probably not so easy, because that hash might be used for some other purposes we are not aware of," Katalov added. "So I guess that not just iOS update is needed, but also iTunes update as well, and probably some changes to the backup format."

 Apple may be shopping for car companies, but Tesla shouldn't be on its list Matthew DeBord Sep. 24, 2016, 8:50 AM 19,347 facebook linkedin twitter email print The right man for Apple? AP Last week, rumors circulated that Apple was investigating an investment in or an acquisition of British supercar maker and Formula 1 powerhouse McLaren.  McLaren said that the reporting was off the mark, but it's obvious to anyone paying attention that something is going on with Apple and its interest in transportation. Earlier this year, the Cupertino colossus invested $1 billion of its $200-billion-plus cash hoard in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service. Then, of course, there's the mysterious "Project Titan," Apple car experiment that is either going to remake mobility as we know it — or is falling apart at the seams. My take is that Apple is gradually turning itself into a sort of stealth holding company; it can't figure out what to do will all that excess moolah, so like a person with a bulging bank account, it's going on a shopping spree and will sort it all out later. Drop $3 billion on Beats in 2014, throw a billion at Didi, pick up McLaren for something in the same pricing ballpark — the synergies will eventually appear. Buy Tesla? The McLaren news also revived an idea that's often been bandied about: Apple should buy Tesla. The notion, daffy as I think it is, makes more sense than getting mixed up with a manufacturer of high-tech sports cars. The tech world is very attracted to an Apple-Tesla tie-up because it would combine two of the most beloved brands that Silicon Valley has yet produced. For many, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the new Steve Jobs. Like Musk, a visionary. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images But that's the problem. Apple has grown so large that it's become a company that's less about innovation and more about managing its achievements, which are considerable. In commenting on the Apple-should-buy-Tesla argument in the past, I've usually asked why Apple isn't yet doing a stand-alone TV, the best opportunity to completely reinvent the user experience for a familiar product. I think it's because they've talked themselves out of it — something that wouldn't have happened when innovation was on the ascent at the company, before Jobs' death. For all its stumbles and growing pains, Tesla is rapidly innovating. Just last week, the automaker released a major software update for its vehicles that contains at least one totally new technology for cars: Cabin Overheat Protection, which enables a Tesla to use its large battery packs to cool itself off when the car isn't on, making the interior safer for small children and pets. Apple, meanwhile, is busy screwing up EarPods and the headphone port on the new iPhone 7, telling customers that should be courageous about these needless tweaks to a product that's getting long in the tooth. Project Titan Not gonna happen. BI Screenshot/Motor Trend Channel There is some logic to Apple buying Tesla. Project Titan appears rudderless — Is it a real car? An in-car interface? A self-driving technology? — so at least by acquiring Tesla, Apple would center the undertaking. But then Apple would need to figure out what to do with Elon Musk. And therein would lie the challenge, as Musk and Apple CEO Tim Cook are the two most dissimilar leaders in modern business: mercurial visionary versus a modest caretaker. Cook inherited a world that Apple had already changed, while Musk is in the thick of trying to change it again. Additionally, even if Apple figured that it could swallow Tesla's $30-billion-ish market cap without developing managerial heartburn, it would be adding the Palo Alto carmaker as Musk and his team are headed into a deeply challenging period. It would be one thing if the only major objective to achieve were Musk's goal of delivering 500,000 vehicles annually by 2018, or launching the Model 3 mass-market vehicle on time in 2017. But there's so much more: Complete an acquisition of struggling solar-panel leaser and installer SolarCity; get the Nevada Gigafactory up and running and cranking out lithium-ion battery cells in huge numbers; establish Tesla Energy as a viable power-storage business; continue to expand the Supercharger network, especially in China; grapple with the blowback from a spate of Autopilot accidents, one of them fatal; hit up Wall Street for another capital raise; and execute the post-Model 3 agenda, which includes developing an electric semi-truck, a compact SUV, and maybe even a pickup. That's a lot of problems to buy for a lot of money, even by Apple's standards. GM debuts the Chevy Bolt. Bill Pugliano/Getty Images The limits of tech Finally, it's worth thinking about whether tech companies, generally speaking, are really equipped to play a role in the transformation of mobility. We have this idea that Apple and Google, simply because they're Apple and Google, can use their brainpower and cash mountains to deliver earth-shattering, insanely great progress. But so far, the only tech company that's had a massive impact on transportation is Uber, and that's because it's always been in the mobility business. Sure, Tesla has made its contribution, but on balance the overall effect has been marginal; the vast majority of cars on the road are still powered by gas engines, and, in any case, Tesla is increasingly becoming a hybrid of a technology company and an old-school automaker. The companies that are starting to move the needle are actually the traditional carmakers. They have the scale to get new products into the market quite rapidly, as GM has done with its Chevy Bolt electric car. Optimistically, GM could sell as many Bolts in the next two years — production starts next month — as Tesla has sold in its entire existence, about 150,000 vehicles. So maybe Apple should forget about the Teslas and McLarens of the world. If it really wants to do something with cars, Detroit could be the place to go for its shopping spree.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Apple reportedly testing Siri-powered smart home device like Amazon Echo and Google Home Apple is reportedly working on an Amazon Echo-like smart-home device based on the Siri voice assistant, notes Bloomberg. Citing people familiar with the matter, the report claims that the project had started more than two years ago, and the prototype is now being tested. Apple’s Echo-rival will also be voice-activated smart home speaker with similar functionality as the Amazon Echo, but it will be more intelligent, adds report. The device can have more advanced microphone and speaker technology. Furthermore, some of the prototypes in testing included built-in cameras capable of facial recognition, and may able to distinguish between another person. There is no official statement from Apple as yet, neither do we see the Cupertino giant commenting about it in near future. But this might me one of the big things in Apple’s portfolio next year, when the company will celebrate its 10th anniversary. So until then, we’ll have to take these all rumours with a pinch of salt.

Michael Short/Bloomberg   Karen Turner The Washington Post WP Bloomberg     Several iPhone 7 users have reported via Twitter that they are hearing a hissing noise coming from the device while it's being used. Stephen Hackett, a writer for the blog 512 Pixels, was one of the first to report the hiss, according to 9to5Mac. The noise was coming from the back of the phone near the Apple logo while Hackett was running the iCloud restore process. "During use, I noticed a high-pitched sound coming from the device that was loud enough to hear as it sat on my desk," Hackett said. "I didn't need to press my ear to the back of the phone to hear it." After Hackett tweeted about the noise, several other people tweeted that they have had similar experiences. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the noise. Some have pointed to the phone's new A10 processor, which helps to prolong the battery life, as the source of the noise. Whether the iPhone 7's processing noises are truly unique to this generation of the iPhone is unclear. Rene Ritchie, a blogger who covers Apple at iMore, reported that he spent several days listening to the hisses of the new Apple releases against the past two generations, as well as other products, such as the iPad and MacBook. "They all make the same noises, and all to differing degrees," he wrote. He said the processing activity necessary to transfer data onto a brand-new phone is strenuous, which could be one reason users with freshly unboxed iPhone 7 devices may be hearing loud noises. "It seems highly likely nothing out of the ordinary is going on," Ritchie wrote. When Hackett notified AppleCare, Apple's extended-warranty program, about the issue, the company responded that it would send a replacement phone. "I have no reason to believe it is a widespread issue, but I found it odd and wanted to share," he said.

Now others a rushing to play catch-up, including Google with its own Home device, and, if rumors are true, Apple has a product brewing that will use Siri to control a home’s lights, appliances, and other connected products. The latest on a Siri-powered home speaker from Apple comes from Bloomberg, which reports that the product has entered into the prototype testing phase within Cupertino. Believed to have been in development for two years now, the device is said to function similarly to Amazon’s Echo and its Alexa voice assistant; users will communicate with Siri via voice commands, and it will control things like appliances, lights, curtains, locks and more using Apple’s HomeKit tech. It’s reasonable to believe that a Siri speaker will act as a sort of combination of two features Apple has already released: opening Siri up to developers on both iOS and macOS, and the implementation of voice control on the latest Apple TV via the Siri Remote. In fact, sources told Bloomberg that when the previous Apple TV was in development, there were once plans to outfit it with a speaker that would recognize voice commands spoken from the couch, instead of into a mic on the remote. While this concept may have been pushed back and turned into a stand-alone speaker, Apple is also said to be planning a feature that will go above and beyond what existing smart speakers have. Namely, a facial-recognition camera that would be used to detect and recognize different users when they enter a room, automatically settings like lights and temperature to their preferences. Of course, this device is still early in the development cycle, and certain features — or even the whole project itself — could be scrapped altogether. Should the prototype testing turn out successful, however, we’ll no doubt continue hearing about the device in the months to come.

Raymond Ronamai   September 24, 2016 17:29 IST Amazon Great Indian Sale smartphone offersREUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Apple's latest flagship smartphones – the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus – were released after months of hype. It was reported that the devices might bail out the Cupertino giant from poor sales of iPhones in the last few quarters, but it appears to be a case of false hopes, with its sales said to be lower than its predecessor's. German research firm GfK has claimed in a report that the sale over the launch weekend of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is 25 percent lower year-over-year, according to PhoneArena.

Apple, Flipkart team up for iPhone 7 sale Business Today 24-09-2016 BT Online © Reuters image Apple has partnered with e-commerce giant Flipkart to sell its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in India starting October 7 in a move to expand its online availability. The tie-up with Flipkart will mean the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will be available at the official launch price online and will carry the Apple warranty. The partnership will also be extended to Apple'solder models. Flipkart will directly source the iPhones from Apple for the first time instead of buying from third-party sellers. This deal will give an edge to Flipkart to earn a higher profit margin on the sale of the iPhones over competitors like Amazon and Snapdeal who will have to rely on third party sellers. On the other hand, Apple will not have to endure sharp discounts on its products like before. Flipkart is the biggest e-tailer in India and Apple will leverage this to its own benefit. Flipkart will now have to sell the products at the official price decided by Apple, which would eventually stabilise the prices in the online space. Earlier, Apple products were subjected to absurd discounts. Previously, Infibeam was the only authorised online reseller for Apple but it mainly dealt with the wholesale supply ofApple products. On the other hand, Flipkart will be the first online retailer to sell Apple products directly to consumers. Prices for iPhone 7 start from Rs 60,000 for the 32 GB variant and go up to Rs 80,000 for the 256 GB variant. Prices for the iPhone 7 Plus start from Rs 72,000 for the 32 GB variant, and go up to Rs 92,000 for the 256 GB variant.Ahead of the launch of new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Apple slashed the prices for iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SEat Rs. 50,000, Rs. 60,000 and Rs. 44,000 respectively.

We Put It to the Test There’s a lot of cool new stuff packed into the Apple iPhone 7. It can handle a dip in the pool. It has a big crush on wireless headphones. And damn but those two shades of black are gorgeous. But the camera is by far the most important feature. Apple‘s pretty sure it has built the ultimate Instagram and Snapchat machine, and even has its sights on pro shooters. The iPhone 7 and its bigger sibling the iPhone 7 Plus feature some big camera upgrades, but the 7 Plus is particularly remarkable. Apple touts it as the one to use for low-light photography, and even made an ad, called “Midnight,” about a kid’s all-night photoshoot of amazing scenes. The specs are top-notch: dual lenses with 28 and 56mm focal lengths, an f/1.8 aperture, optical image stabilization, and an even brighter flash. Everything comes together to make better shots in under all conditions, some of which would make the iPhone 6 melt down. How much better is it?

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software After Google, Apple is Now Stepping in to Rival Amazon Echo September 24, 2016, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Chrome Not Backing In-Built Ad-Blocking; Plans to Better Ads Instead Sphericam 3: Beast Certainly, But Not an Enchanting Beauty Amazon picked quite an odd platform in the form of speakers to hurl their Alexa powered personal assistant services. But it seems to have worked out surprisingly well for the company, as two tech giants are now stepping in the shoes of Amazon to launch a rival product. The first one, like we all know, is Google, who will be introducing their Google Home speaker device powered by Google’s personal assistant and voice recognition services next month. Now, it’s Apple who is said to be working on a similar device to catch up with the rivals in the considerably new domain of technology. Apple’s Echo-rival will be having Siri integration, which will be functioning as the personal assistant in the device to cater various home-control functions like controlling home appliances, handling locks and lights, and even curtains via voice commands. Alongside, Siri integration would also mean that the device will be capable of handling more than just home control, like having control over email, Twitter, Apple Music, and other services in iPhone. According to Bloomberg, Apple has been working on the project for nearly two years, and their device should draw the line between Google Home and Amazon Echo with advanced audio peripherals that include advanced microphone as well as speaker setup. Besides, this will also be employing the task of augmenting the iPhone devices with home automation. There has been no finalization of whether the device will come out in the said form. Chances are also there that Apple could wind up the project before it comes alive. But the instant popularity of the Echo devices, which has guided Amazon in expanding Amazon to further devices, and the arrival of the Google Home could set the project up and running inside the Apple premises.

And the Scottish DJ showed his appreciation for Newman with a remix of 'Blame' which was also performed earlier in the evening. Earlier, Disciples opened the show at London's Roundhouse. They started their set with the popular hit 'They Don't Know' as well as remixes of Gorgon City's 'Imagination' and Jude and Frank's 'La Luna'. And 'How Deep Is Your Love', their song with Calvin, was also a hit with the crowd. John Newman took to the stage at 8.30pm for a 50-minute set, starting with an energetic performance to 'Give Me Your Love', 'Timing Game' 'Olé' and 'Blame It On The Night'. John also credited his family, partner and close friends for motivating him to continue with his music career. He said: "The people who make my life worth living. The first one being my mum, the other being my girlfriend, my brother. "But there's one reason I'm stood on this stage and that's thanks to my good friend Calvin Harris. Thank him for this next track ['Blame']." John also declared he uses music as a way to express his feelings and vent about matters plaguing his mind. He said: "I think music doesn't have to be for releasing and having number ones, you commit to music to get s**t off your mind, right?" He continued his performance with 'Not Giving In' and 'Can You Love Me Again' before throwing the drum kit off the stage. The Apple Music Festival continues until September 30 with performances from the likes of Britney Spears, Michael Buble and Robbie Williams. For those who were unable to catch Calvin in person, the show - and the rest of the 10th annual free festival gigs - is available live and on-demand to Apple Music members in 100 countries.

Why iOS 10 Is Not As Safe As iOS 9 International Business Times 9/24/2016 Corazon Victorino © Provided by IBT US Apple released iOS 10 last week to iPhone and iPad users excited over the prospect of new features coming to their devices. However, the Cupertino tech giant may have forgotten to mention what the iOS 9 successor does not come with.  Apparently, Russian cybersecurity firm Elcomsoft has found out that the iOS 10 is lacking some implementations that could make it safe against hackers. The firm discovered recently that iOS 10 does not come with certain security checks that are present in iOS 9, as per Phone Arena. The absence of security checks is said to make iOS 10-running devices an easy target of brute-force password attacks. This type of attack involves hackers trying out passwords by characters until getting the right one that would make the device vulnerable, as per Phone Arena. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 109.95 -0.04 -0.04% Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN ▼ 404.56 -15.52 -3.69% Sanofi SA SNYNF ▼ 81.85 -0.95 -1.15% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 756.40 +9.91 +1.33% Elcomsoft stated on its blog that with iOS 10’s new password verification mechanism for backups, hackers can penetrate devices using random phrases and character combinations at least 2,500 times faster than iOS 9 and older OS iterations.  The Russian firm clarified that iOS 10’s shortcomings are only applicable to backups, which can only be hacked if the hacker has local or remote access to the mobile device, personal computer or Apple account credentials of a user.  Another issue that was recently uncovered is the downgrade of the hashing algorithm for iOS 10. Security researcher Per Thorsheim, the CEO of security firm God Praksis, said that from SHA1 with 10K iterations, Apple downgraded the algorithm to plain SHA256 with a single iteration.  The downgrade makes it possible for an attacker with a common desktop computer processor to brute-force a password. Phone Arena has learned that with the weaker security, brute-force attacks on iOS 10 backups have a 40 times faster success rate than on iOS 9 backups.  Thorsheim told Threat Post that the changes Apple implemented in iOS’s password protection mechanism is a “massive weakening of security and privacy.” He also added: “I can’t see any reasonable logical explanation why Apple would have done this. This must be a bug on Apple’s part.” To reiterate just how bad the situation is, Elcomsoft’s Oleg Afonin explained that when jailbreaking a 64-bit iOS device, hackers would still not have the advantage of extracting decryption keys for Keychain, which contains password or authentication tokens to applications and security services that require authentication credentials.  With iOS 10, Alfonin stressed that hackers can have access to the operating system’s backups, enabling them to extract and decrypt Keychain data.  Apple has yet to react to reports about its alleged less secure mobile operating system.  Go to MSN Home More in Money 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney Up Next 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from International Business Times Crown Asks For £369M For Palace Overhaul International Business Times Haiti Elections Set To Finally Go Ahead International Business Times Trump's Environmental Assault May Face Obstacles International Business Times Lindsay Lohan Gives Fans Happiness Advice International Business Times International Business Times View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

A high-level editor at a top tech blog secretly worked for Apple for months Tech Insider 9/24/2016 Biz Carson © Provided by Business Insider Inc Chris Ziegler A deputy editor at The Verge took a job at Apple while still employed at the tech blog, according to a note posted by The Verge's editor-in-chief Nilay Patel.  On Friday, the news organization revealed that Chris Ziegler, a founding member of The Verge, had been working for Apple since July, but didn't tell anyone about his dual employment. "Obviously having an Apple employee on The Verge staff is a conflict of interest," Patel acknowledged in the note. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 109.95 -0.04 -0.04% Ziegler had actively worked on stories throughout July while also employed by Apple. After he fell silent in August, The Verge tried to get in touch with him since they were "in the dark and concerned for Chris". It wasn't until early September that The Verge verified that Ziegler had been employed at Apple the whole time and promptly terminated his employment from The Verge and parent media company, Vox, the same day. The Verge says an independent editorial review found it "did not have any impact on editorial decisions or journalism produced at The Verge or elsewhere in Vox Media." "Chris did not attempt to steer any coverage towards or away from Apple, and any particular decisions he helped make had the same outcomes they would have had absent his involvement," the editor's note reads.  During Ziegler's time at The Verge, he wrote primarily about cutting-edge car technology, including . His last post on the site about BMW's self-driving car efforts is .  Vox Media did not respond to questions regarding how far back the editorial review went, how it was discovered he worked at Apple, or why he was kept on payroll after not showing up for work. Instead, the company's statement pledged to "continue to be transparent" if new information is discovered: "Chris is no longer an employee of The Verge or Vox Media. Chris accepted a position with Apple, stopped communicating with The Verge's leadership, and his employment at The Verge was terminated. Vox Media's editorial director Lockhart Steele conducted an internal review of this conflict of interest, and after a thorough investigation, it was determined that there was no impact on editorial decisions or journalism produced at The Verge or elsewhere in Vox Media. We've shared details about this situation with The Verge's audience and will continue to be transparent should any new information come to light." Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple blogger John Gruber Ziegler in the company directory, so it's unclear whether he remains employed by Apple at this time.

autoevolution cars moto news car reviews spyshots driven cars newspaper green Compare Cars BAC Calculator   Editorial Coverstory Motorsport Testdrives archive Auto Shows Tuning Car Finder Photo of the Day Glossary of automotive terms Masthead RSS Feeds White Tesla Model X Sits on Gold Vossen Forged Wheels 24 Sep 2016, 9:44 UTC · by Mihnea Radu / Home / News / Car Profile People say that the Tesla Model X has no visual appeal at all, that it's just a bloated version of the sedan, and it will never go off-roading. However, we look at it as the most feature-rich model in the range. Do you want a little bit more space for not much more money? The answer is usually yes. So in a way, the Model X is the Apple iPhone 7 Plus or the Samsung Note 7 of the Tesla family. Just like the latest smartphones, the Model X has its fair share of flaws, controversial ones at that. No, you don't need a dongle to use it, but you might want to put your hands back on the steering wheel. Anyway, putting new wheels on the Model X is a bit like installing a custom iPhone case. Sure, you might lose some of the factory-fresh appeal, but you end up with an electric device that nobody else has... hopefully. Maybe taking a few cues from the Apple color pallet, Vossen Wheels has adapted one of their forged alloys to a gold color. To our eyes, this is actually a copper alloy look, but Apple says it's gold, so we aren't going to argue too much. Against the white body of the Model X, these alloys really stick out. Of course, there are a few non-colors on the car, like chrome for the trim and black for the window tint. But the gold is what really sticks out. And just like the iPhone is offered with different sizes of SSD memory, depending on how much you are willing to pay, so too is the Tesla Model X available with different batteries. This one happens to be the 90D, which is a fast car. Of course, everybody knows the Model S sedan with the P100D kit the fastest Tesla and one of the fastest cars in the world.

HYDERABAD: Apple quietly acquired a little-known Hyderabad-based startup a few months ago for an undisclosed amount and while little is known about what Tuplejump does, the word is that this is part of the Cupertino-based giant's exploration into artificial intelligence. Known in the trade as an acqui-hire, nearly all of Tuplejump's 16 employees are in the process of becoming Apple staffers. A back-of-the-envelope calculation by an expert put the valuation at about $20 million (Rs 133 crores). "When there is a talent hire, the cost of hiring is usually calculated based on the last few years' salary," the expert said. "So, for a 16-member team, I think it would probably come up to around $4 million a year — making this deal for something around $20 million (including for possible IP evaluation)." Tuplejump is Apple's first acquisition in India. Including this, the iPhone-maker has bought three artificial intelligence companies this year, the others being Turi and Emotient. Focus on Artificial Intelligence Apple's AI-based assistant Siri is facing increasing competition from similar services out of Google, Amazon and Microsoft. "Apple has been acquiring machine-learning companies. Increasingly, services and products are becoming AI-based — bots, speech recognition, tagging of user's photos, finding faces," said Viral Shah, co-creator of open source language Julia and co-author of 'Rebooting India' along with Nandan Nilekani, Infosys cofounder. "If Apple is building a self-driving car that will also have machine-learning and AI in it, it is only natural for them to acquire talent around machine-learning and AI," Shah said. Apple did not give any details on the Tuplejump acquisition, only saying, "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans." TechCrunch first reported the news. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook had visited Hyderabad in May, shortly after the Tuplejump acquisition, to inaugurate his company's first development centre in the country. During his first official visit to India, Cook also announced plans to set up a design and development startup accelerator in Bengaluru and open retail outlets in the country. While iPhone purchases have increased in India, globally Apple is struggling with slowing sales. Tuplejump was founded in 2013 by Rohit Rai, Satyaprakash Buddhavarapu and Deepak Alur. While Rai and Buddhavarapu relocated to Apple's office in Silicon Valley in May, Alur joined Premji Invest-backed Anaplan as engineering head. Rai and Buddhavarapu were equal partners in Tuplejump as of March 31, 2015. The bootstrapped company reported a profit of about Rs 80,000 in 2014-15 on revenue of about Rs 70 lakh, according the company's annual report. Experts anticipate more acquisitions of machine-learning and AI startups. "At least four-five technology giants, who are looking to acquire startups in the field of AI and machine learning, have approached us," said Thiyagarajan M, head of M&A at software product think-tank iSpirt. "Suddenly, this area has developed a lot of acquisitiveness."

Starting with watchOS 3, the steps to enable it has changed, so we’ll show you how it’s done. Making room for the Emergency SOS slider, Apple made it so you’ll no longer find a Power Reserve mode slider in the slider menu. Now, you’ll need to follow these steps: 1) Swipe up from the bottom of the display to reveal Control Center. 2) Tap on the button at the top left that shows your current battery percentage. 3) Once you’re in the battery view, tap on the Power Reserve button. 4) You will now be given a prompt message. Tap on the Proceed button to continue. Your Apple Watch will now be placed into Power Reserve mode. In this mode, you should see nothing more than the time in green digital format and you can’t access any software features of your Apple Watch until you reboot it by pressing and holding on the side button. If your power is too low to reboot your device, connect your Apple Watch to a power source to charge the battery up some and then try to reboot it once again. In a pinch, this feature can help you keep your Apple Watch from dying, but still allows it to keep track of time for you. If you use it wisely, you may never have to worry about losing track of time again.

PC-Tablet Videos Tech Apps Telecom Science Business Social Auto Reviews How-To’s Featured Apple pushes iOS 10.0.2 update with headphone audio bug fix and more By Anand Narayanaswamy - 24/09/2016 Within days of the official launch of iOS 10, Apple has released the second iteration of its software dubbed as iOS 10.0.2. The update addresses an issue that could prevent headphone audio controls from not working temporarily. Moreover, the new iOS 10.0.2 update also resolves an issue that caused images to exit when turning on iCloud Photo Library. It also fixes an issue that prevented users from activating few app extensions. The new iOS 10.0.2 update measures 33MB in download weight. To manually verify the existence of the update, you need to navigate to Settings | General | Software Update. Regarding problems, the Cupertino-based tech giant is hopeful that there will not be any cases that effectively bricked few iDevices during the download process. Previously, few iPhones became unusable when users were attempting to install the new iOS 10 build. T-Mobile issues notification not to install iOS 10 Incidentally, T-Mobile has released a notification, which prompts customers with the Apple iPhone 6, Apple iPhone 6 Plus and Apple iPhone SE not to install iOS 10 until Apple sent out a software fix. However, Apple released the required patches the very next day. Apple also released iOS 10.1 beta to the general public. This update also includes the addition of Portrait Camera mode for the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. This will enable iPhone 7 Plus owners to leverage the advantage of the second camera on the rear of the phone. It works by adding a blur effect on the background of portraits shot with the handset. iOS 10 features The iOS 10 enables you to deliver messages in your own handwriting. You can also change the way your message bubbles will look like. Moreover, you can send hidden message or image, which will be exposed upon swiping. The iOS 10 provides an ability to express greetings with animations including the capability to deliver messages decorated with fireballs, heartbeats, sketches, stickers, and emojis. The new Home app included with iOS 10 enables you to activate lights, unlock doors and even raise your window blinds. You can make use of the 3D Touch in apps such as Calendar, Weather, and Stocks for a quick glance at the required information. By default, the iOS 10 has been loaded in the recently released iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. If you have iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s plus, you can upgrade from iOS 9 to iOS 10.

Planning to buy the iPhone 7 Jet Black? You might want to reconsider Hindustan Times 24-09-2016 That shiny colour, the glare it produces. Yes! It is natural for you to fall in love with the new ‘Jet Black’ colour option that Apple is offering with its new iPhone 7 family. But is it a good idea to pay extra for the Jet Black edition? It absolutely depends but we thought we will let you know the extra mile you will probably have to go through before you get your hands (make sure they are not greasy) on the ‘dream device’. Firstly, Initial quantities of the iPhone 7 Plus have sold out globally as Apple Inc prepares to roll out its new gadget in stores, the company said last week. Supplies of the larger size of Apple’s new phone have been exhausted in all shades, and the smaller iPhone 7 has also sold out in the new jet black colour, the company said. Customers are already unable to buy the sold-out phones on site from Apple stores, but they are continuing to place orders for their desired models online, Apple said. “We sincerely appreciate our customers’ patience as we work hard to get the new iPhone into the hands of everyone who wants one as quickly as possible,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller had said in a statement.  © Provided by Hindustan Times This means that the same might just happen in India after the Tim Cook-led company launches the new phones on October 7. “The demand for the Jet Black edition of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is really high. While people are asking for only Jet Black option, Apple is only capable of sharing very few units,” a source told HT under the terms of anonymity. He also said that the ratio of orders and units received is 100:1. This clearly means that a waiting list will have to be maintained by retailers or they have to ask the customers to buy a different colour variant.  Secondly, the Jet Black has a smudge problem. You will end up cleaning the phone many times a day. To stop the smudge problem, you will have to cover up the phone but if you do so (without a transparent cover), there is no point in buying the Jet Black.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Area Roundup 9-23-16: Apple Valley throttles Adelanto Friday Sep 23, 2016 at 12:01 AM Sep 23, 2016 at 11:50 PM Staff Reports APPLE VALLEY — Apple Valley head coach Matt Rohrbaugh always enters the game following Bell Week with a little trepidation. He didn’t want the Sun Devils to have a letdown week after beating Victor Valley in the team’s biggest rivalry a week prior. Apple Valley scored 28 points in the first quarter to erase any of those fears and went on to crush Adelanto 56-14 on Friday night. Quarterback Mossy Bell threw two touchdowns and rushed for another two while passing for more than 160 yards on a night just about everything went the Sun Devils’ way. “The offensive line did a great job of blocking for our guys,” said Rohrbaugh. “I think coming off the Bell Game like that there’s a lot of emotions and so you try to avoid having a let down. We had a couple sloppy turnovers and the guys were resilient and battled through it. Apple Valley led 35-14 at halftime and outscored the Saints 21-0 in the second half. The Sun Devils rushed for more than 300 yards with Seth Baker and Charles Logan carrying most of the load. Baker rushed for more than 100 yards and picked up a touchdown, Logan also scored on the ground while Donovan Ferguson and Andrew Chambers also added touchdowns. The Sun Devils’ final nonleague tuneup comes on the road against Barstow where the team will look to go 5-0 against the Desert Sky League. Apple Valley opens Mojave River League play at Oak Hills. AHS 0 14 0 0 — 14 AVHS 28 7 14 7 — 56 Prep Football Hesperia Christian 60, Riverside County Education Academy 0 At Hesperia, the Patriots stayed undefeated with a blowout win. Hesperia Christian led 46-0 at halftime. “Our team really stepped up tonight,” Hesperia Christian coach Dean Dorsey said. “We had a couple of frustrating practices this week, but the kids overcame that and played a great game.” Quarterback Austin Luton completed 7 of 10 passes for 143 yards and three touchdowns and also ran four times for 87 yards and a TD. On defense he had seven tackles and forced a fumble. Connor Scott carried the ball eight times for 76 yards and added 17 tackles, one forced fumble and three fumble recoveries. Quentin Wilson caught three passes for 62 yards and three TDs, returned a punt 65 yards for a TD and had an interception and seven tackles on defense. Zach Shilling had five carries for 41 yards and two TDs and also had nine tackles and a forced fumble. Trevor Bragg ran for 25 yards and a TD on two carries, forced a fumble and recovered a fumble. Spencer Doherty blocked a punt and added nine tackles. The Patriots (4-0) play at New Designs University Park on Friday. Burroughs 32, Barstow 7 At Ridgecrest, the Burros scored 32 unanswered points in a nonleague win. The Aztecs scored first on a 1-yard touchdown run by Dominic Manley in the first quarter that made it 7-0, but it was all Burroughs from there. Burroughs cut Barstow’s lead to 7-6 when Austin McCullough hit Bryson Pippin for a 6-yard TD pass in the first quarter and neither team scored again before halftime. McCullough and the Burros heated up in the second half. The QB ran for a short TD to start the third quarter, then Lucas Lusher ran for a 1-yard TD early in the fourth to make it 18-7 Burroughs. McCullough threw a 20-yard TD to Antonio Ramirez and added a long TD pass to Donte Williams to cap the scoring. Barstow hosts Apple Valley (4-0) in its final nonleague tuneup on Friday then begins Desert Sky League play with the Axe Game against Victor Valley at home on Oct. 7. Calipatria 36, Riverside Prep 20 At Oro Grande, the Silver Knights lost a nonleague game. Riverside Prep led 20-14 entering the fourth quarter but Calipatria scored the final 22 points. “It just got away from us at the end of the game,” Riverside Prep assistant coach Mark Mora said. Silver Knights quarterback Domenick Woods threw three TDs passes, two to J.J. Strawder and one to Ryan Renfro. Riverside Prep (1-4) hosts Desert Christian on Friday.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Apple buys India-based machine learning startup Tuplejump Apple Apple buys India-based machine learning startup Tuplejump By Bindu Nair - Apple has bought an India-based startup called Tuplejump in its mission to gobble up as many machine learning companies as it can. The tech behemoth had previously bought Perceptio and Turi as part of its spree, making the new firm its third acquisition in a matter of months. In its typical fashion, Apple is not confirming the news outright. It responded to TechCrunch’s query on the matter by stating that it buys smaller technology companies from time to time and chooses not to discuss its purpose or plans. This is usually its standard response when asked such a question, which probably means it has indeed bought the business being discussed. There aren’t any details about how much Apple parted with to acquire Tuplejump as yet. The latter’s FiloDB open source project was apparently what caught the former’s attention. The program’s aim was to apply machine learning concepts and analytics to huge amounts of complex data the moment it’s streamed in. Also Read: Apple joins hands with Flipkart to sell iPhone 7 in India FiloDB is currently continuing its existence as an opensource project. It now has its own repository and features newly committed code. What Apple wants to do with it and Tuplejump to a larger extent is unclear right now, though there’s a chance the brand is hoping to apply the startup’s efforts into iCloud. In other major acquisition news, rumors are swirling that Apple is planning to buy McLaren. If true, the move will probably be in service of boosting its self-driving car plans. Nothing has been confirmed till now, though the car manufacturer did send out a statement clarifying that it wasn’t in talks with the handset maker over a potential investment.

The company is apparently developing something it calls Spoken Editions, which are short clips that take writing from a variety of publishers and transform it into spoken word content… Spoken Editions were leaked on iTunes earlier today, though Apple has seemingly already pulled the evidence. According to today’s report, one of the companies Apple is working with for Spoken Editions is SpokenLayaer, which creates streaming audio and podcasts for a variety of different publications. Currently, SpokenLayer works with publishers such as Forbes, Huffington Post, TIME, Reuters, Smithsonian, Scripps, and more. Today’s leak offered a hint at what kinds of publications Apple will be working with for Spoken Editions from the start. For instance, Wired will have Spoken Editions for “Business,” “Science,” and its homepage, while TIME will offer a Spoken Edition called “The Brief.” Other publications include Forbes, .Mic, Bustle, OZ, and Playboy. In terms of monetization, Spoken Editions will include audio ads to make up for ad revenue lost due to readers turning into listeners. The ad revenue will be shared between the publisher and SpokenLayaer, though. While SpokenLayer CEO Will Mayo declined to talk about Apple’s Spoken Editions feature, he did note that his company is more than capable of handling the task. “We have a distributed network of voice-over talent that is tagged and managed,” he said. “We make sure Wired sounds like Wired and any other publication sounds like those publications. The voice and style of any brand is in its writers and the reporting it does. That’s unique for every publication, and that uniqueness is honored.” One likely possibility for Spoken Editions is that they will be integrated into the alleged standalone Siri device that Apple is believed to be working on. Spoken Editions would allow for users to get an audio look at news throughout the day with the Siri device, much like Amazon Alexa already does. Earlier today, it was reported that Apple’s Siri-powered device is already in prototype testing. Spoken Editions are an interesting idea by Apple, who helped push the digital audio consumption method to the mainstream with podcasts. Spoken Editions could also be integrated into Apple News, as well as the Apple TV. Spoken Editions are expected to go live in earlier October.

X World View: Ireland’s Apple windfall is developing world’s loss Apple’s Irish HQ sees profits earned in vulnerable regions being sent to the State Sat, Sep 24, 2016, 06:00 Sorley McCaughey An Apple MacBook in the European Parliament. The EU Commission claims Ireland has granted illegal tax benefits to Apple. Photograph: Patrick Seeger/EPA         Of various concerns about the European Commission’s ruling on Apple, perhaps the most uncomfortable is that the arrangement between Ireland and Apple is likely to have undermined the development of some of the world’s poorest countries. Regardless of which way the European Court of Justice rules on whether State aid was at play, Apple’s use of a stateless entity, notionally located in Ireland, results in countries of the Middle East, India and Africa – as well as in Europe – seeing profit generated in their respective regions being funnelled away from their tax authorities and into Apple Sales International in Ireland. Apple uses a company structure not unusual among American tech firms in locating its headquarters for operations in these regions in Ireland. But what the commission’s ruling has laid bare is that tax avoidance of this type has serious consequences, with the impact of these being felt by some of the most vulnerable people in the world. Of course, until the full ruling is publicly available, it is impossible to say how much the various countries in those regions are potentially entitled to. In absolute terms the vast bulk is likely to have been generated in Europe, but even a relatively small amount in an African context has the potential to be transformative – and life-saving. By way of illustration, in 2011 the entire health budget of Sierra Leone was just under $28 million (€25 m) – a mere 0.21 per cent of the €13 billion Apple is being asked to repay. European Commission refuses to comment on Noonan claims EU tax harmonisation: an issue that won’t go away Apple expects to offset €13bn Irish tax bill by paying less in US Moral questions All of this of poses serious moral questions for a Government whose aid programme is acknowledged as being among the world’s best, and whose recently updated foreign policy places human rights at its centre. Clearly, a tax policy that undermines the ability of developing countries to raise sufficient revenue to deliver on their human rights obligations is hugely damaging to those countries, but also to Ireland’s international reputation. ADVERTISEMENT There is still strong support, both among the Irish public and most political parties in this country, for Irish international tax policy which has tax competition at its core. However revelations such as these represent a fundamental moral challenge to that support – and one the Government has previously struggled to fashion an appropriate response to. For example, in early 2015, a report from the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) estimated that Africa loses as much as $50 billion a year to corporate tax avoidance. The report makes explicit reference to the Double Irish scheme as a means by which companies are able to avoid tax in developing countries. In Budget 2015 the Government moved to close the scheme down. However, instead of doing that immediately, it is gradually phasing it out over five years. For a country like Sierra Leone, where life expectancy is 51, it must seem vexing, to say the least, to observe a prosperous, wealthy European country allowing a scheme that has been shown to damage the economies of African countries. Company secrecy The extent to which other companies continue to enjoy the benefits of the Double Irish, or other, as yet unknown, avoidance schemes, at the expense of developing countries, is unclear– or at least is not available publicly. Publicly accessible data about what companies do in each of the countries in which they operate is not yet the industry standard. Having this data – known as country-by-country reporting – publicly available would make it easier for developing and developed countries to identify instances where companies may be engaging in dubious activities, while also acting as a deterrent to companies considering anti-social tax practices. The Government has resisted calls from civil society, the European Parliament, and a growing number of industry bodies, to oblige companies to make the data public. But if Ireland’s tax policy is to continue to be based on competing with other states on lower taxes, the very least the Government should be doing is to insist on the highest levels of transparency from multinationals operating here. Public country-by-country reporting would be an important step in that direction, would restore some faith in the multinational sector, and go some way to rebuilding Ireland’s reputation.

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT CONTACT NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS LINKED STORIES iOS 10 WWDC 2016 The In-Between Macs My New iPad Pro Keyboard: The Razer Mechanical Keyboard Case Why I’m Considering Bear as a Notes App Replacement This week's sponsor Secrets a beautifully simple password manager, now Free on the App Store Opening Any Apple Maps Place or Address on the Web By Federico Viticci Yesterday, Benjamin Mayo reported that Apple published public webpages for "some landmarks and points of interest" listed in Maps: Apple is now publishing public web pages for landmarks and POI in its Apple Maps database: here’s one such place. The website link shows details about the place such as location, name, telephone number and reviews. The design is identical to the cards in the iOS 10 Maps app. When on an Apple platform, these URLs appear to act as deep links into the native Maps app. If viewing in Chrome or on a non-Apple device like Android, the fallback webpage is loaded. The purpose for these URLs is unclear, but it may possibly foreshadow a larger move by Apple to offer its own online mapping service to compete with Google Maps on the web. I did a bit of digging, and I discovered that you can open any Apple Maps place or address in another web browser if you reformat the URL properly. To share a place or address from Apple Maps, you first need to open the detail card and tap the share icon. By default, Maps won't expose the maps.apple.com URL, but we can use Workflow's extension and its 'Get URLs from Input' action to extract the URL and copy it to the clipboard. By default, an Apple Maps URL looks like this: https://maps.apple.com/?address=Piazza%20del%20Colosseo%201,%2000184%20Rome,%20Italy&auid=14961796774748722351&ll=41.890221,12.492317&lsp=9902&q=Colosseum&t=m That's the Colosseum in Rome – arguably, a point of interest. Let's try with a generic address: https://maps.apple.com/?address=Corso%20Italia%2020,%2001100%20Viterbo,%20Province%20of%20Viterbo,%20Italy&ll=42.418399,12.106154&t=m As you can see, Apple is encoding the address and using coordinates to compose the URL. Normally, these URLs are used as deep links on iOS/macOS to launch the Maps apps directly. In his article, Mayo provided an example of a place viewable on the web. The URL was: https://maps.apple.com/place?address=10365%20Gorenflo%20Rd%0ADiberville%2C%20MS%20%2039540%0AUnited%20States&auid=3930665398072383877&ll=30.441054699999999%2C-88.889284200000006&lsp=9902&q=Park%20at%20Lemoyne Notice the difference? Before the address parameter, the URL has place – presumably, a query that turns an address into a special "place" type that can be viewed on the web. I assumed that reformatting the URL with the same technique would work for any place or address – not just the ones discovered from Safari suggestions as 9to5Mac reported. My assumption was correct: if you insert the place query, it appears that any Apple Maps URL can be viewed on the web with browsers that aren't Safari. To make this easy to test, I created a workflow that you can run inside Maps to get the URL, reformat it, and open it in Chrome for iOS. Opening a Maps place in Google Chrome. Here's what you need to do: Install Chrome on iOS; Open a place/address in Apple Maps and use Share; Run the workflow from the Workflow extension; The place will open on the web using Chrome. This should come in handy if you want to quickly share an address from Maps with someone who doesn't have an Apple device, without having to look it up again in Google Maps. Hopefully, Apple is making the first steps towards a full Maps web interface with search and exploration features. In the meantime, you can get this workflow to open places and addresses on the web.
