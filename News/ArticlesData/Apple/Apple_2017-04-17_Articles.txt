Apple enters self-driving car race Tuesday, April 18, 2017     Tweet SAN FRANCISCO, California (AP) — Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already reshaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. Ending years of speculation, Apple’s late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs — and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. Apple goes mobile ... In a new way Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn’t discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear. The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. “Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” the company said then. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation.” Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple’s director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company’s interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion, prevent millions of crashes, and save thousands of lives annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstays phones, tablets and personal computers. A next big thing Although iPhone’s ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world’s most valuable company, the company hasn’t had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trendsetting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo’s fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than two million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionised. It wasn’t the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. Deep pockets With US$246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about US$50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they’re interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple’s interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project “Titan”. Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead. ADVERTISEMENT POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES   1. We welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

(CSCO) Stock About to Bite the Bullet With a Crazy Move Oracle Corporation (ORCL) Stock: Don’t Call It a Comeback. It’s Really Not View All Posts After enjoying a sizzling start to the year and hitting an all-time high, the rally in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) appears to be cooling off. Shares of Apple stock have been slipping over the past week, probably as investors begin to worry that they’re fast approaching nosebleed territory. Source: Beni Krausz via Unsplash After all, AAPL has already exceeded five-year highs on common valuation metrics including price-to-earnings and price-to-book. Those concerns have not been helped by recent Wall Street sentiment regarding the upcoming iPhone 8. Wall Street appears to be deeply divided regarding whether the iPhone 8, to be launched later this year, will spur a mega-buying cycle or simply a good-enough one. The latest analyst to express its reservations is Susquehanna, which reckons that Apple will only ship 100 million iPhone units during H2 vs.110M-115M previously estimated. FBN’s Shelby Sherafy has also sounded the alarm, saying that Apple stock’s one-way trip higher could come to an untimely end because iPhone 8 will only drive a ”good” upgrade cycle and not a ”supercycle” as is widely expected. iPhone 8 Supercycle or Bust? The iPhone 8 is expected to sport pretty cool features, including an OLED screen, 3-D sensors and wireless charging that will supposedly prove too alluring for the throngs of Apple fans. Indeed, bullish analysts might be right on the money if a recent Piper Jaffray survey on teenage consumer trends is any indication. The survey found that 81% of teens expect their next smartphone to be an iPhone — the highest level of AAPL love ever recorded. Bearish analysts though have countered by pointing out that Apple’s track record when it comes to new product launches is nothing to write home about. Apple has already delayed the launch of numerous products in the past, the most recent being iPad Pro 2 by months. Some analysts are a bit optimistic the new iPad could arrive in April, while others are far less sanguine and expect an October launch. A September launch had initially been chalked in for iPhone 8 — now it appears eager buyers won’t be getting their hands on the iconic smartphone till much later. There are reports that the new iPhone could be delayed by weeks or even months. The delay appears to be in connection to the use of curved OLED screens that eliminate the bezels. Why that should be a major issue considering that Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) has been using them on its smartphones for years is anyone’s guess. All that hullabaloo about iPhone 8 delay is not hard to fathom. Buyers of tech hardware are notorious for delaying their purchases when a new iteration is due to hit the shelves. The longer AAPL delays the iPhone 8 launch, the more H2 sales are bound to suffer … which in turn could see Apple stock take a big hit. Could Trump Come to the Rescue? In reality, though, it would take a really bad delay — maybe a month or more — for Apple’s top line to get dinged. AAPL is set to enjoy easy comps thanks to last year’s awful sales, especially during the latter part of 2016. Apple endured double-digit sales contraction after posting revenue declines of 12.8% for Q1 FY16, 14.5% for Q2 FY16 and 8.9% for Q4 FY16 before returning to growth during Q1 FY17, when it posted modest growth of 3.3%. Apple sold a mere 45.5 milllion and 78.4 million iPhone units during the third and final quarters of 2016. I believe the company can easily top that figure even in the event that iPhone 8 is delayed for two to three weeks. In any case, investors have already been warned about a possible delay, so the bad news is probably already baked into Apple stock.

Privately run shops in HCMC have received a letter, with a warning about intellectual property infringement, from VOTRA, the legal representative of Apple in Vietnam In the letter, VOTRA said that brands and logos of Apple, iPhone, Apple Store, iPad and iPod all have been registered by the US manufacturer in Vietnam and its intellectual property is protected by Vietnamese laws.  Therefore, iOS device distribution shops using the brands and logos to advertise products without Apple’s consent is the infringement of intellectual property. The document pointed out that the shops sell Apple’s products, but the products are not genuine but counterfeit products or products imported to Vietnam, not through Apple’s distribution channels. This has led to a misunderstanding that the shops are authorized resellers. Apple Vietnam was established in November 2015, headquartered at 6th Floor of Me Linh Point Building, No 2 Ngoc Duc Ke Street, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1, HCMC. Apple said that Apple devices will not receive the manufacturer’s official warranty if users cannot show the bills of sale (SN/IMEI) from authorized resellers worldwide.  Privately run shops which distribute iPhones through unofficial channels are concerned about Apple's recent announcements on warranties and intellectual property copyright. In late 2016, iPhone users complained that their devices were suddenly locked. Meanwhile, many iPhones could not be used after users performed line 2 reset operation.  Apple is applying tough policies to protect its brand and reputation in Vietnam. This could be seen as a warning for people against buying iPhones without clear origin. In its letter, VOTRA asked privately run shops to stop the illegal use of Apple’s brands and trademarks within seven days after they receive the document.  The shops have also been asked to stop the sale of fake products and products with no clear origin. Mai Trieu Nguyen, director of Mai Nguyen Luxury, an authorized reseller in Vietnam, applauding Apple’s moves, said that the illegal use of Apple’s brands and logos will mislead users and affect the operation of authorized distribution chains. The representative of FPT Shop said that Apple’s moves will benefit customers, because customers will feel more secure when buying Apple’s products. Only authorized resellers will have Apple’s logo, while the products with no clear origin will be eliminated because they bring risks despite lower prices.

Technical issues like the lamination of OLED panels and adoption of 3D sensors were cited as possible reason to delay the iPhone 8 launch by the Cupertino-based firm, in earlier reports as well. But the possibility that Apple might scrap the fingerprint sensor from iPhone 8 never came into the picture. "While this (housing of fingerprint sensor) creates some risk of production delays, at this point we do not believe it materially threatens volume through the coming iPhone cycle," Pacific Crest told the Investors. Pacific Crest explained: “The anticipated move to a full-screen OLED panel in the coming iPhone 8/X eliminates the physical home button, which necessitates a move to a virtual home button and an optical fingerprint sensing solution to read fingerprints through the OLED panel. “At this point, we do not believe Apple's optical fingerprint module provider has firm orders for production, which suggests Apple does not have functionality of the optical fingerprint sensor ready. Additionally, we believe Apple has evaluated Synaptic's (SYNA) optical fingerprint solution, but that it has not been qualified.” If Apple fails to include an optical fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 8, it will have to rely on other biometric 3D-sensors to unlock the device. In this context, the firm could opt for facial recognition and/or iris scanner, as used by its rival Samsung in Galaxy S8 models. "Since fingerprint login is such a widely used feature and 3D sensing is unproven for this purpose, a wholesale elimination of fingerprint sensing in the OLED iPhone would create incremental risk to consumer adoption," Pacific Crest said. And if delayed, the iPhone 8 will make its way to the markets in October or November, according to Chinese-language Economic Daily News (EDN).

The investment bank's lead Apple analyst Amit Daryanani said the company's iPhone mix continues to remain positive, with "more" Plus-sized models sold in the quarter than it previously forecasted. iPhone 7 Plus models carry a $120 premium over iPhone 7 models, contributing to a higher average selling price. RBC now estimates Apple will report quarterly revenue of $53.5 billion, matching the high end of the company's guidance. Apple is scheduled to report its second quarter earnings results on May 2 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time. MacRumors.com will provide live coverage of Apple's conference call at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time. The bank said it remains positive about AAPL based on so-called "iPhone 8" refresh cycle tailwinds, benefits from a possible capital allocation increase, the acceleration of its growing Services category, and potential upside from U.S. Donald Trump's political agenda in relation to taxes and cash repatriation. Apple's stock price has been rising steadily since November, as rumors suggest the company will launch its first iPhone with an OLED display and slim bezels, potentially mirroring the design of Samsung's new Galaxy S8. Many analysts have maintained a "buy" or equivalent rating on AAPL since March or earlier. Last week, RBC Capital Markets generated headlines when it outlined the potential benefits of a completely speculative Disney acquisition. In a lengthy research note, the bank said such a deal would create a "tech and media juggernaut like no other" and instantly expand Apple's services, content, and media portfolio. Assets such as ABC and ESPN, for example, could lay the foundation for Apple's long rumored but elusive streaming TV service. An excerpt from Daryanani's research note obtained by MacRumors: Together, Apple and Disney would instantly have access to global distribution via Apple's installed base and the global iTunes store, and a massive library of content and studio capacity via Disney to make future movies and shows. A digital content service could be put together in relatively short order. Apple has the advantage of integrating its price to consumers with its hardware. For example, buy a new iPhone and receive a 12-month subscription to the streaming service for free.Daryanani said the so-called "mega deal" would diversify Apple away from hardware and help the iPhone maker fulfill its goal of doubling its Services category by 2020. He also thinks it would be an appropriate use of Apple's massive cash hoard, should the U.S. ever offer a cash repatriation holiday. A prerequisite to Apple-Disney is a regulatory environment that would allow Apple to use its huge amount of cash assets for a domestic acquisition. If a cash repatriation tax holiday results in a 9% tax on offshore cash brought to the United States, we estimate that Apple would effectively have access to cash of $223 billion. After adjusting for operational requirements, Apple should have $200 billion cash available for discretionary uses.Daryanani said there is a "greater than 0%" chance that Apple acquires Disney, but he admitted that the odds are low at this point. Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's "Mad Money" show, believes the Apple-Disney speculation was more about influencing the stock market than anything else. "The only thing that's really accomplished by this kind of speculation? The short-sellers will be afraid to bet against Disney's stock because of newfound fears of a takeover lurking. It really does put a bid underneath, simply because it was just too juicy to ignore," Cramer concluded.AAPL closed at $141.83 on Monday. The Walt Disney Company closed at $113.78.

Rating: 1 Votes infinitejest 1 hour ago at 11:05 pm That would be disastrous for both companies... I think quite the opposite. Content is one thing Apple still lacks. The more I think about the acquisition ('http://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/acquisition.html'), the more it makes sense to me. Not sure, if it's ever gonna happen, but I hope so.

The iPhone 8 will supposedly serve as Apple's 10th year anniversary gift to customers, thus, many believe that Apple will introduce some of the high-end features available in the market today. Concerns of Fingerprint Sensor There are rumors that Apple might delay the release of iPhone 8 mainly because of the problem posed by fingerprint sensor. Perhaps, Apple may be inclined in scrapping the fingerprint sensor entirely. According to a report of Pacific Crest Securities analysts, "The anticipated move to a full-screen OLED panel in the coming iPhone 8/X eliminates the physical home button, which necessitates a move to a virtual home button and an optical fingerprint sensing solution to read fingerprints through the OLED panel," as posted on Investors . This group of analysts believes that Apple currently does not have this kind of fingerprint sensor functionality ready. He report also suggested that Apple has yet to decide on Synaptic's optical fingerprint solution. Selfie Camera, Other Features of iPhone 8 According to the list that iDropNews collated, the iPhone 8 will have a 5.8-inch OLED display which is the first time for any iPhones. The dimension of iPhone 8 is the same size as iPhone 7; however, the display size will be bigger as there will only be 4mm left remaining on the bezel. The dimension of iPhone 8 is said to have a width of 72.5mm and a height of 149.5mm, while the depth is about 7.1mm, same as iPhone 7. Like the issue of Fingerprint sensor, reports suggest that an invisible front-facing camera will be hidden underneath the display. No details yet were made available about this selfie front camera's specifications. The upcoming iPhone 8 is also said to have the wireless charging technology and a large power button featuring two points of contact. Another very interesting feature of iPhone 8 which is quite visible is its contoured casing. According to Korean website ET News, Apple will adopt 3D glass material at the back which will extend on all sides reportedly curved edges.

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ We're in full swing for Apple iPhone 8 rumors and a lot of the chatter has been regarding the "premium/pro" version of the next iPhone. That's the model expected to have a bezelless OLED display and because of that design, Apple has to do something different with the Touch ID fingerprint scanner. But, that has been proving difficult. The prevailing theory is that Apple wants to embed the Touch ID sensor under the display and essentially hiding it. However production issues for such an advanced component have been popping up according to sources in the supply chain. Because of these issues, some have speculated that Apple might do something drastic like put the Touch ID sensor on the back of the phone, which some apparently hate, but we find no faults with.  But, according to Andy Hargreaves, analyst for Pacific Crest Securities, it could be an all-or-nothing choice by Apple. In a research note shared with MacRumors, Hargreaves thinks the "likely options for Apple include a delay of production or elimination of fingerprint sensing on the OLED iPhone." That's right, he actually thinks Apple might release an iPhone without a Touch ID sensor at all. We think that's basically madness. There's no way Apple would do that given its push on security and privacy, and how deeply integrated the sensor is with Apple services at this point. No "pro" iPhone is going to be released without Touch ID.  So, we'd say Hargreaves real prediction is that if Apple can't figure out the production issues in the next month, it will likely end up delaying the premium iPhone. That also seems troublesome, given the whole point of it is to hit the 10 year anniversary, but we'll have to see.  source: MacRumors Final Apple iPhone 8 schematics allegedly leaked by Foxconn insider 17 Apr Prev news Company developing a physical QWERTY keyboard Moto Mod will meet with Lenovo 17 Apr Next news Close Apple has reportedly nixed 'wraparound' iPhone 8 display design, opts for 18 Apr LG G6 on Verizon getting its first update with April's security patches 18 Apr Red discoloration of the Samsung Galaxy S8/S8+ displays upset buyers in 18 Apr Company developing a physical QWERTY keyboard Moto Mod will meet with Lenovo 17 Apr Now reading: Touch ID issues may delay OLED iPhone 8 says analyst Touch ID issues may delay OLED iPhone 8 says analyst 17 Apr Final Apple iPhone 8 schematics allegedly leaked by Foxconn insider 17 Apr This Samsung app is getting a legendary roasting inside the Google Play 17 Apr New Oppo Find 9 image gives another wishful glimpse at the phone that never 17 Apr Samsung sends out update to prevent users from remapping Bixby button 17 Apr The Verizon Wear24 LTE smartwatch is launching on May 11 17 Apr older posts Related phones Apple iPhone 8 Compare Specifications News[38] Rivals Photos Size it Videos iPhone 8 Related News   Supposed iPhone 8 schematics reveal an LG G6-like device   Analyst: Low yields on embedded Touch ID tech is Apple's biggest problem with the iPhone 8   Wall Street analyst says 3D-sensing might be pushed back to the 2018 Apple iPhone 8s   Analyst: Apple iPhone 8 to be delayed but will still be available for the holidays   Alleged Apple iPhone 8 schematic shows vertical dual camera setup on back (Update)   Report: Apple orders 70 million OLED screens; 3D face recognition confirmed for iPhone 8 15 Comments Options Close Follow › Following Show comments: default show moderated comments Display mode: Threaded Chronological Newest first Always view all comments Save posted on yesterday, 21:20 2 Reply 1. kiko007 (Posts: 4723; Member since: 17 Feb 2016) Who is this guy?

So, it has already missed the 10 year anniversary. I understand that there are hopes that the 10th edition of the iPhone will be special. But, throwing in non-applicable words when Apple isn't even using the word "anniversary" makes no sense. When it comes to anniversaries, we could only wish that wives graded on the same curve as tech writers in search of hyperbole. posted on yesterday, 22:03 0 Reply 7. omnitech (Posts: 412; Member since: 28 Sep 2016) Lol they did nothing for the 5th or 8th anniversary, why would Apple suddenly give their sheep something for the 10th? iPhone 7s is this year. iPhone 8 is next year.

GreenMan (Posts: 1661; Member since: 09 Nov 2015) I'm certainly glad to see (assuming the leaked iPhone 8 schematics are authentic) that Apple is sticking with 16:9 aspect ratio and doesn't seem to be copying Samsung or LG. When I heard rumors that the iPhone 8 will be taller, I was a little concerned and a little 'confused' about it... For two reasons: 1. Remember when Apple went from 3:4 aspect of iPhone 4S to the standard 16:9 with the iPhone 5...? Lots of older apps were facing compatibility issues because they were not optimized for The newer 16:9 ratio. Unlike Android, Apple can't mess with its aspect ratio like that because apps runs natively on iOS. Hence I was amazed while at the same time a tad curious...! 2. I personally think that this new 18:9 or 18.5:9 aspect ratio is nothing but a fad that will fade away. My Lumia 430, with it's 4" screen has a weird aspect ratio of 15:9 (Actually 5:3, but MS cals it a 15:9, for whatever reasons) and it has a really nice feeling. The display is short, albeit wide (800x480 screen resolution) and it makes a REALLY nice compact phone for day to day usage. It is basically in the shape of a pocket hence slips in really nice. And the wide screen makes it easier to type and to view web material. 4" is small... But not necessarily...! 16:9 iPhone 5 just somehow feels TINY in front of my Lumia with the same screen size...! So, the taller screen on The S8 doesn't "feel" or "seem" bigger than a 5.5" Phone with the very traditional 16:9 aspect ratio... And I wish Samsung just drop it for good... Oh well, G'Day! posted on yesterday, 23:22 1 Reply 14. GreenMan (Posts: 1661; Member since: 09 Nov 2015) Wide screens gives a weird assumption that it's bigger, its human psychology. Hence the televisions and computer monitors are getting wider and wider...! Not only that, but wide screens are also better for media for consumption and web viewing. Acording to Blackberry (when they launched the Passport) a line must contain 16 words for perfect reading pleasure...! Oh well, G'Day! view all comments Want to comment? Please login or register.

The company is struggling to solve issues related to placing the fingerprint scanner underneath the smartphone's display.  ( Apple ) Advertisement Advertisement Apple may have to drop the Touch ID from its upcoming iPhone 8, according to Pacific Crest Securities equity research analyst Andy Hargreaves. The iPhone 8 may not come with the core feature if Apple is not able to solve the problems that it has encountered in embedding the fingerprint sensor beneath the display of the smartphone within about a month, Hargreaves said. iPhone 8 To Move Touch ID Beneath Display A previous report claimed that Apple is currently working on two different versions for the upcoming iPhone 8. The first version of the smartphone will have Touch ID technology, previously positioned on the home button, located underneath the device's display. This will allow the iPhone 8 to have a near bezel-less front, with the bezels only measuring 4 mm around the screen. The second version, meanwhile, is an overall larger device compared to the iPhone 7. The report of a near bezel-less iPhone 8 was corroborated by leaked renders of the smartphone, showing no Home button in front of the device. However, it was previously reported that Apple is having trouble getting the technology to work. The integration of the Touch ID underneath the iPhone 8 display remains the "biggest bottleneck" in the preparation of mass production for the smartphone. Apple already technically removed the home button with the iPhone 7, as the mechanical button has been replaced with a static button that is touch sensitive. Apple also introduced 3D Touch in the iPhone 6s, which can be used to transfer home button functions to other parts of the screen. However, Touch ID remains a core feature in the iPhone 8, as it is used for a variety of purposes. The fingerprint scanner allows users to unlock their smartphone, log in to various apps and services, and authenticate Apple Pay transactions. iPhone 8: No Touch ID Or Delayed Release? According to Hargreaves, there are two options for Apple, and that is to either move forward with the iPhone 8 without Touch ID technology or to delay the release of the smartphone. If Apple is able to solve the challenges that it is facing in the integration of Touch ID technology into the iPhone 8 screen within about a month, Hargreaves said that the company will likely place volume orders right away to begin the mass production of the smartphone. However, if the issue is not yet solved in that time frame, the iPhone 8 may not come with a fingerprint scanner. Dropping Touch ID from the iPhone 8 will put a lot of pressure on 3D sensing technology to offer the same security in verifying the identity of the smartphone's owner. Suppliers have claimed that the 3D sensing technology of Apple is fast and very reliable, increasing the chances that Apple will drop Touch ID from the iPhone 8 if it is unable to find a workaround for its current problems. Whether Apple will push out the iPhone 8 without Touch ID technology or instead delay the smartphone's release to be able to incorporate the core feature remains to be seen, but for the sake of user security, it would be best if Apple will be able to include the feature in its upcoming premium flagship device.

Facebook and Apple’s arrival produced a surge in electricity demand in Prineville throughout the past several years that has overwhelmed the Bonneville Power Administration’s transmission capacity. But BPA is now working on a plan that calls for doubling Prineville’s capacity for electricity within a few years. The plan, presented to city and economic development officials last week, would involve upgrading electrical substations and changing how the federal agency manages power on its grid. Under the proposal, the region’s capacity would start increasing in 2019 from 560 megawatts to 1,145 megawatts. “We’re excited we’ve got a path forward, which is obviously key,” said Roger Lee, director of Economic Development for Central Oregon. Long-term requirements for the plan may involve bringing a new transmission line into the area, a project BPA acknowledged “would be a significant challenge” and take more than six years to complete. The city first learned of its power troubles last year after an unidentified manufacturer proposed bringing 300 jobs to Prineville to build an energy-intensive factory. City officials wanted to keep the company interested in the community, prompting BPA to start considering its options to address the electricity needs. It is not clear whether the company will still be interested in the city by the time Prineville’s capacity for electricity has been expanded.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Stocks to Buy for Your Grandchildren in April A stock can be a gift that keeps on giving, in more ways than one. Here are three good choices. John Rosevear, Keith Speights, and Reuben Gregg Brewer (TMFMarlowe) Apr 17, 2017 at 6:14PM What's a good stock to buy as a gift for a child? Obviously, it would be nice to choose a company that will be healthy and profitable for decades to come. But beyond that, we'd argue that a good choice would be one that stands a strong chance of generating outsize returns in the coming years and will teach young investors lessons that will serve them well as they move into adulthood and begin choosing investments on their own.  Our specialists have rounded up three choices that seem like good gifts for a smart young person: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Here's why they made those choices.  Image source: Apple, Inc. The stock I got is still a good choice today John Rosevear (Apple): On my 14th birthday, I received what would turn out to be an intriguing gift: one share of the newly public company then known as Apple Computer. I'm a little embarrassed to admit how long ago that was (Editor's note: It was 1981). Let's just say that my parents recall paying all of $14 for it. The return on that $14 over the last 36 years has been remarkable -- especially when you consider that with splits, that one share is now 112 shares. (It's roughly a thousand-bagger at this point.)  But take note: Despite the tremendous success it has enjoyed in recent times, many of those 36 years were absolutely terrible for Apple's stock. Between management changes, poor strategies, and products that just didn't work out, Apple has had plenty of ups and downs over the years. That will likely be true of the next 36 years of Apple's history, too. But I held on to the stock, and the investing lessons learned from the ups and downs along the way have turned out to be the real gift, just as my parents probably intended.  Apple today isn't the punchy just-public start-up it was way back in 1981. That makes it a very different kind of investment. (Among other changes, Apple pays a dividend these days.) But it's a company that most American kids know well -- and one that stands a pretty good chance of generating outsize profits and teaching young investors important lessons for decades to come.  It's not just Spam anymore Reuben Gregg Brewer (Hormel Foods): It's always nice when you can buy a company for the grandkids that piques their interest -- and this makes Hormel Foods a great option. That said, you might think of Hormel as the maker of Dinty Moore, Hormel Chili, and Spam, which it is. But your grandkids are probably more familiar with the company's newer products like Muscle Milk, Justin's nut butters, and Wholly Guacamole. The acquisition of these up-and-coming brands is helping to push Hormel into the future.   But a good brand portfolio and a management that's willing to adjust to the times aren't sufficient to make Hormel a good buy. You have to add in the fact that Hormel has increased its dividend for 51 consecutive years. And that, despite the acquisitions, debt stands at just 5% of the capital structure. Or that Hormel has the No. 1 or 2 spot in 35 product categories (sure, that includes Spam, but also a whole lot more).   The final reason to look at Hormel right now, however, is the yield, which is hovering around 2%. That's not a huge number, but it's at the high end of the company's own history, suggesting it's cheap today. Management is expecting near-term performance to face some headwinds, which helps explain the relatively high yield. But that's just a buying opportunity if you are looking to the long term at this well-run food maker. A perennial favorite Keith Speights (The Walt Disney Company): Probably no other company in the world puts a gleam in kids' eyes like Disney does. It sometimes even puts a gleam in the eyes of grown-ups. Buying Disney stock for your grandkids could be an educational experience for them. Children who are of grade-school age and older are likely already aware of the company's theme parks, Disney Store retail outlets, and the obvious cable TV networks that Disney owns, such as the Disney Channel and Disney Junior. However, they might not realize that it owns other networks like ABC, Freeform, and ESPN. As you watch movies with your grandkids, you could point out which ones are made by the company in which they own a part. There will be some obvious Disney movies like Beauty and the Beast. However, older kids who watch movies such as Captain America and Guardians of the Galaxy might not be aware that Marvel is part of Disney.   Of course, the most important reason for buying stock for your grandkids is for the investment to grow. Disney stock should be a solid choice to meet that primary objective. Over the last 10 years, its share price has more than tripled. Total returns from owning the stock were even higher due to the dividend, which currently yields 1.39%. Disney appears to be in great shape for the future as well. Although the trend of canceling cable subscriptions has hurt some of the company's operations, particularly ESPN, the company still has a lot going for it. Its movies and theme parks continue to be successful. Disney is the kind of stock that your grandkids can own and even buy for their grandkids one day. John Rosevear owns shares of Apple.

Over 40 years later, it’s one of the largest companies in the world, but Wozniak believes that by the time 2075 rolls around, Apple, Google, and Facebook will be even bigger entities than they are today. Speaking to USA Today last Friday, Wozniak compared Apple to IBM, which was founded back in 1911. "Apple will be around a long time, like IBM,” he said. "Look at Apple's cash. It can invest in anything. It would be ridiculous to not expect them to be around (in 2075). The same goes for Google and Facebook." The iPhone maker reported $246.1 billion in cash reserves for Q4 2016, a new record for the Cupertino company. Wozniak also believes that cities of the future will be designed and built from scratch and located in deserts, where housing won’t be a problem. People will be shuttled between domed structures, but if you want to go outside you’ll need a special wearable suit. Wozniak predicts a time when AI becomes ubiquitous in all cities. Shopping, communication, and entertainment will be carried out via smart walls and surfaces, while medical devices will enable self-diagnosis and doctor-free prescriptions. "The question will be ethical, on whether we can eliminate the need for physicians," he says. Just like Elon Musk, the Woz thinks a colony will eventually come to exist on Mars, though he believes communicating with aliens is pretty unlikely. "It's worth trying," he says, "but I don't have high hopes." Let's hope humanity lasts long enough to find out if Wozniak's predictions come true. “The Future of Humanity: Where Will We Be in 2075” is the subject of this weekend’s Silicon Valley Comic Con (SVCC), which Wozniak helped create last year. Around 75,000 to 100,000 people are expected to turn up to the three-day event in downtown San Jose, which features appearances from William Shatner, John Cusack, Buzz Aldrin, and the 30th-anniversary cast reunion of Star Trek: The Next Generation.

Apple’s iOS 10.3 update delivered an impressive set of changes including new features, a ton of security patches, and some useful tweaks. It was a solid update but it was far from perfect. In early April the company’s pushed out an iOS 10.3.1 update and it brings a new security patch and bug fixes to iPhone, iPad and iPad touch owners. iOS 10.3.1 is a small bug fix update but small bug fix updates aren’t immune to problems. iOS 10.3.1 problems are popping up and some iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users are noticing performance issues. We’ve heard about UI lag, random reboots, apps locking up, and more in the days since the iOS 10.3.1 update’s release. While your first inclination might be to contact Apple Support or schedule a Genius appointment at an Apple Store, there’s a very good chance you’ll be able to fix your iOS 10.3.1 performance issues yourself. In fact, it might take you just a few seconds. Today we want to share some tips that’ve worked for us in the past. Here’s how we’ve managed to fix bad iOS performance in the past and these might work for you and your version of iOS 10.3.1. These tips should work for iOS 10.3 as well. Restart Your Device If you start noticing poor performance on your device, the first thing we recommend is a simple restart. This will take you just a few seconds but it could have a significant impact on your device’s performance. Most of you already know how to do this but if you’re new to iOS, simply hold the power button down, slide to power down your phone or tablet, and then hold the power button down again to power the device back on. Reset Your Network Settings If you’re seeing slow downloads on the internet, in apps, or in the App Store, we recommend resetting your network settings to see if that clears up the issue. To do this, go to your Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. This will cause your device to forget your Wi-Fi passwords so make sure you have all of those handy before you start the process. It should only take a few moments to complete. If this doesn’t help fix your connectivity issues, we’ve got some more remedies available on our list of fixes for common iOS 10 problems. Cleanup Your Device If you’re running out of space on your iPhone or iPad do some spring cleaning. Reducing the amount of clutter on your device could provide you with a nice boost to your device’s speed and overall performance. If you’ve owned your device for awhile there’s a good chance you’ve accumulated tons of items you no longer use. Maybe it’s videos you no longer watch or need, maybe its an app or 10. Whatever the case, it’s a good idea to track these files and apps down and delete them. You might be surprised at how much space you’ll clear up. To quickly check how much space you’re using on your internal storage, head into your Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage and select Manage Storage. Update Your Apps If you’re dealing with poor app performance you’ll want to check to make sure your apps are up-to-date. If you don’t have automatic updates turned on it can be hard to stay on top of app updates. Developers have been pumping out updates in the first half of the year and there’s a chance you might’ve missed an important release. Head into the App Store and see what you can find. Just make sure you read reviews before you install a new version. Stop Automatic Downloads Automatic app downloads are extremely useful if you’re the kind of person that’s unable to stay on top of app updates. That said, the feature will make your device’s GPU work which could lead to poor performance or weird battery drain. If you’re fine with manually updating your apps, at least temporarily, try disabling Automatic Downloads on your device. To do this, go to Settings > iTunes & App Store. Once you’re there, you’ll want to toggle the switch to turn off Updates located in the Automatic Downloads section. Stop Background Refresh Background Refresh is another useful feature that could be hampering your device’s performance, With this feature turned on, your apps will be refreshed with new information while the app is in the background. For example, your Facebook feed will constantly be updated without having to actually open up the app. Shutting this function down could help your device’s CPU so it’s worth a shot if you don’t need instant access to your data. To do this, go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh and toggle Background Refresh off. This will shut it down completely. You also have the ability to go down your list of apps one-by-one and make a selection on a case-by-case basis if you wish to do it that way. Reduce Transparency & Motion Effects If you’re noticing choppy animations and transitions try reducing transparency and motion effects on your device. Let’s start with Motion Effects. iOS 10 provides you a sense a depth when you tilt your device and when you open and close your various applications. Adjusting this feature a bit could help smooth out iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.3.1 performance on your phone or tablet. To reduce Motion Effects in iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.3.1, go to  Settings > General > Accessibility and toggle Reduce Motion on. Note that reducing Motion Effects will disable some features like the bubble effect in the Messages app. Now that you’re in the Accessibility part of your device’s settings you’ll want to try reducing transparency. This will reduce transparency and blur effects. By reducing these features, you could help your device’s GPU. To Reduce Transparency, tap Increase Contrast and then tap the toggle to turn on the Reduce Transparency function. Try the iOS 10.3.2 Beta Beta software can be problematic but there are times where users actually see improvements over the official software. If you’re desperate, you might try the iOS 10.3.2 beta to see if it helps your device’s performance. iOS 10.3.2 is a small release (as of right now) so don’t expect to see any new features or tweaks. Apple hasn’t announced an official iOS 10.3.2 release date yet so we’ll be moving through the beta without a release timeline. Start Over If nothing here helps, and you can’t find a fix anywhere else, you might want to factory reset your phone. If you can’t take your device into an Apple Store, try erasing your device and starting over from scratch. This has been known to have a positive effect on performance, particularly on older devices. Before you reset your phone to its factory defaults, you’ll want to make sure you’re completely backed up. You’ll also need to put aside an hour or two of free time to make sure the process goes smoothly. If you’ve backed everything up and you’re ready to wipe your device clean, head into Settings > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings to get started. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 7 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 11 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 11 2 Responses 04/01/2017 Clamster Reply You should turn off iCloud Keychain before resetting network settings because otherwise you will lose all your wifi logins in all of your Apple devices. It’s real PITA if you just blithely follow online suggestions to fix problems with a quick network settings reset. 04/17/2017 Анастасия Reply Yes Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

However if there is one thing that could still be standing in 2075, it could be Apple. This is according to Apple’s co-founder Steve Wozniak who believes that Apple will still be around by that time. According to Wozniak, he was quoted as saying, “Apple will be around a long time, like IBM (which was founded in 1911). Look at Apple’s cash ($246.1 billion, as of the end of its last fiscal quarter). It can invest in anything. It would be ridiculous to not expect them to be around (in 2075). The same goes for Google and Facebook.” Of course whether or not Apple will be the same company that it is today remains to be seen. After all we’ve seen many brands rise and fall and reinvent themselves over the years, like how Nokia started out as a being a paper mill, or how Nintendo began as a card company which evolved itself into a gaming company that is beloved by millions of gamers around the world, old and young. However let’s not forget that there have also been many companies that were huge at one point in time, only to eventually fade away into obscurity. It’s already hard to predict how Apple will fare in the next 10 years, let alone the next 58 years, but what do you guys think? Are companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook still be around come 2075? Filed in Apple >General. Read more about iPad, iPhone and Macbook.

Phones by Ben Fox Rubin 17 April 2017 6:45 pm BST @benfoxrubin iPhone 8 may have hit a roadblock with its Touch ID Three possible scenarios Apple would have to face if suppliers aren't able to embed the fingerprint scanner into the phone's display. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 1:11 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Red flags keep popping up over Apple's new fingerprint sensor for its next iPhone. Pacific Crest Securities analysts said in a note to investors Sunday that Apple's component suppliers were struggling with a new fingerprint sensor. That sensor is expected to go under the phone's cover glass to let Apple remove the iPhone's current home button and create a larger display. The investment bank claimed these manufacturing issues could result in shortages or delays in availability for the new, 10th anniversary iPhone, which is expected to see huge demand. Otherwise, Apple might scrape the new fingerprint sensor in the device, which is expected to be announced in September. Pacific Crest isn't the only place reporting such problems. Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri last week said issues came up from putting the sensor under the phone's cover glass. If the new sensor doesn't work, Apple may decide to move the sensor to the back of the phone, similar to the new Samsung Galaxy S8. A mockup showing this possibility surfaced online last week. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS US Edition Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 LG G6 Project Scorpio Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus VPN LG gram 13 review An Ultrabook that's thin and light but also slight By Jason Cipriani Laptops & portable PCs  Shares 1. Introduction, value and design 2. Performance, battery life and verdict Our Verdict Between the screen that bounces with each touch and a housing that feels hollow, the price tag doesn’t match the build quality of the LG gram 13 despite its incredible battery life. For Fantastic battery life Fast fingerprint sensor Thin screen bezels Against Weird fingerprint sensor placement Awkward camera placement Build quality doesn’t match price With portable and powerful laptops priced below the psychological barrier of $1,000 now somewhat of a commodity, the premium segment is one where a device has to live up to its price tag. Typically, manufacturers set themselves apart from the pack with design, and unique features (fingerprint unlock, excellent battery life, etc.).  The LG gram 13 we reviewed costs much less than Apple’s 12-inch MacBook and comparably to Dell’s XPS 13. On the spec sheet, the gram 13 is more similar to Dell’s offering than Apple’s MacBook, having far fewer ports and a different class of processor (Intel Core i5 for LG vs. Intel Core m5 for Apple). That said, we find that the LG gram 13 struggles to live up to that four-digit price point, especially when stacked against comparably-priced Ultrabooks. Spec Sheet Here is the LG gram 13 configuration sent to TechRadar for review:  CPU: 2.5GHz Intel Core i5 -7200U (3MB cache, up to 3.1GHz) Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 RAM: 8GB DDR4 (2133MHz) Screen: 13.3-inch FHD (1,920 x 1,080) IPS LCD touchscreen Storage: 256GB SSD Ports: HDMI, 2 x USB 3.0, USB 3.0 Type-C, microSD reader, headphone/mic jack Connectivity: Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 8265; Bluetooth 4.1 Camera: 1.3 megapixel camera Weight: 2.07 pounds (921g) Size: 12.1 x 8.3 x 0.6 inches (307 x 211 x 15cm; W x D x H) Price, availability and value LG currently sells two variations of the LG gram 13. One version  – the version we received – has a touchscreen, while the other variant comes in white and lacks a touchscreen and fingerprint sensor. The touchscreen version costs $1,099 (about £885, AU$1,465), with the touch-free model discounted to $999 (about £804, AU$1331).  We were unable to find any models with improved specs or the option to personalize the LG gram 13’s internals.  Furthermore, out of the US, UK, and AU LG web stores, the LG gram 13 was only listed in the US store. The good news is that LG uses third-party sites, such as Amazon or B&H Photo to fulfill orders of the gram 13. In other words, if you live in a country where LG doesn’t expressly offer the gram 13, you can try to order through another seller.  As for whether you should, well, we’ve found comparably-priced laptops with far stronger build quality (but not better battery life) than what’s on display here – we’ll just say that for now. Design LG touts that the exterior of the gram 13 as made of a “nano carbon magnesium alloy;” a metal compound that feels more like plastic than the aluminum shell competing higher-end laptops typically use, but also tends to be lighter. With the lid closed, the gram 13 measures a mere 0.6 inches (15.24 mm) tall at its thickest point. On the right side of the laptop is where you find a microSD card reader, headphone/mic jack, and a USB 3.0 port.  The left side of the laptop is home to the charging port, another USB 3.0 port, a full HDMI port, and a USB 3.0 Type-C port. Additionally, this is where you can find two indicator lights – one a charging indicator, the other a hard drive activity light.  With the lid open, the first thing you’ll notice is a black rectangle in the upper-left corner of the trackpad. Admittedly, at first we thought the rectangle was yet another sticker – such as the “Powered by Intel” decal or Energy Star assurances – we would have to remove. After a few seconds, however, we quickly realized it was the fingerprint sensor. It’s an odd place for one, considering you’re not likely to scan your finger as often as you’ll use the tracking surface for everything else. It doesn’t get in the way, per se, but we found ourselves ignoring the upper left portion of the trackpad altogether.  Just above the keyboard, lodged into the laptop hinge, is a 1.3-megapixel webcam, relocated from the more traditional location of above the display. By moving the camera down, LG was able to use smaller bezels to on the sides and top of the screen. The same, unfortunately, can’t be said about the bezel below the screen.   In total, the gram 13 weighs 2.07 pounds – or 939 grams, if you were curious. It’s incredibly light and doesn’t bog down a backpack as you trek from meeting to meeting or class to class. In comparison, Apple’s MacBook weighs 2.03 pounds (921 grams), while Dell’s XPS 13 weighs 2.7 pounds (1,225 grams).   Fingerprint ID is a fine bonus Setup and use of the gram 13’s fingerprint sensor is similar to that of any modern smartphone with a similar feature – in fact, it closely resembles the process LG uses on its flagship smartphones.  After touching, lifting, and replacing your finger on the sensor, the gram 13 learns your fingerprint and uses Windows Hello to unlock your computer with a touch, instead of a password.  Windows Hello is a convenient way to streamline the login experience, either when switching user accounts or signing in after the gram 13 has been turned off.  We didn’t have any issues with the scanner recognizing a finger, with very little time elapsed between a touch of the fingerprint sensor and the computer unlocking. Muffled speaker placement One design choice we have to question is the location of the stereo speakers on the gram 13. Each speaker is located on either side of the device, with two nondescript ports barely noticeable.  During our testing, the speakers were often muffled or inadvertently covered up when using the gram 13 on a lap, or even by placing an arm next to the side of the unit.  Even when the speaker ports are left unblocked, the sound quality and volume is rather weak and quiet. Listening to music often required a volume setting of 70 or higher just to hear at a comfortable level. 1 2 Current page: Introduction, value and design Next Page Performance, battery life and verdict Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

It has found its way onto the iPad and also the 2016 MacBook Pros, but according to analyst Andy Hargreaves of Pacific Crest Securities, there is a possibility of the iPhone 8 launching without the feature. In an excerpt of his research note obtained by MacRumors, “Likely options for Apple include a delay of production or elimination of fingerprint sensing on the OLED iPhone. We believe Apple continues to work on solving its optical fingerprint issues. If it’s able to solve the problems in the next month or so, it would likely place volume orders at that point.” Hargreaves also notes that this could lead to a delay in the iPhone’s launch. “This would likely lead to a delay of the OLED iPhone launch, but we would not expect it to meaningfully affect volume for the cycle. If it’s not able to fix the problems in that time frame, Apple may be forced to eliminate fingerprint sensing from the OLED iPhone altogether.” We have heard rumors that Apple could be considering introducing a facial scanning feature with the iPhone 8’s front-facing camera, but whether or not it was meant to be in addition to Touch ID or to replace Touch ID remains to be seen. Alleged drawings have also recently surfaced which suggests that Touch ID could be moved to the back of the phone, but in any case take it with a grain of salt for now.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish New Report ‘Confirms’ iPhone 8’s Vertical Camera Placement By Tyler Lee on 04/17/2017 18:43 PDT According to a recently leaked sketched that allegedly depicts the iPhone 8’s design, it was revealed that Apple could be considering changing the orientation of its dual camera setup from one where the lens is placed side-by-side horizontally, to a design where the lenses are stacked on top of each other vertically. We’re not sure why Apple would do that or what reason there might be for such a design, but Japanese blog Macotakara (via 9to5Mac) seems to have “confirmed” that the design is real. Apparently Apple plans to use these new cameras for virtual reality, which is interesting considering the fact that Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has long championed augmented reality, considerably more so compared to VR. The report goes on to confirm other aspects of the phone, such as how it will sport a glass front and back, and will feature a stainless steel band that wraps around the middle of the phone. This echoes an earlier report from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who has predicted such a design, which in case you’re unfamiliar should result in the phone looking similar to the iPhone 4/4S. Safe to say you should definitely take this with a grain of salt for now, but if Macotakara’s report is accurate, the design of the iPhone 8 has moved from engineer to design validation test status, which means that Apple could be closing in on the final design.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Apple received a permit to test self-driving cars in California Oscar Raymundo 18 April, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News It seems like Apple has not yet hit the brakes on its self-driving car. As of Friday, California’s Department of Motor Vehicles now lists Apple as one of the companies with a permit to legally test self-driving cars in the state. This means that Apple’s self-driving initiative, codenamed Project Titan, is back on track. California requires all companies with autonomous vehicles to register before hitting the road. Other tech companies like Google and Uber, alongside car manufacturers like Tesla and BMW, have also received permits to test their self-driving technology on public roads. Uber’s permit was recently secured in March, but the company had been conducting rogue trials for a while. According to The Wall Street Journal, Apple’s permit covers three 2015 Lexus SUVs and six different drivers who must sit behind the wheel to monitor the driving and takeover when needed. In addition to the permit, the state of California also requires companies to file public reports about their self-driving tests, including crash reports and how many times the human driver has had to take over. This could send Apple for a loop, as the company is notorious for keeping all of their testing info a secret prior to launching new products. Why this matters: This is the first indication we’ve seen in a while that Apple’s super-secret Project Titan is still in the pipeline. Previously, there was an insane amount of speculation about Apple’s self-driving car project. In 2015 alone, Apple filed permits to build a “auto work area” near Cupertino, leased a super-secret testing facility, and met with the California DMV. In 2016, however, Apple seemed to have pivoted the initiative, opting for creating just the self-driving software to license to established car-makers instead of assembling an entirely new Apple vehicle. This is a departure for Apple, which has created a legacy by developing both hardware and the software aspects of all its products. Now that Apple will have to file public reports regarding its self-driving trials, expect more information to become available about Project Titan.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Apple said to be targeting a stake in Toshiba’s memory chip business Martyn Williams 18 April, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Apple is the latest company to be linked with a possible bid for an investment in Toshiba’s sizeable computer memory business, which is up for sale. The company is prepared to make a direct investment of several billion dollars in Toshiba Memory for a stake of “several tens” of percent, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported in its lunchtime news. The report said Apple is also considering a joint bid with Foxconn Technology, which manufactures the iPhone. Toshiba is a major supplier of components for the iPhone. Apple could not immediately be reached for comment. The memory chip business is one of the Toshiba’s jewels, but is up for sale as part of Toshiba’s attempts to dig itself out of a multibillion-dollar hole caused by the collapse of Westinghouse. Cost overruns and delays on projects in South Carolina and Georgia incurred billions of dollars in losses. Earlier this week, Toshiba finally released its first financial report in nine months, reporting a $5.9 billion-dollar loss due to the problems at nuclear power business Westinghouse. The memory chip business reported a profit of $934 million on sales of $5.8 billion. The release came without the blessing of auditors – a highly unusual move for a Japanese company – and with a warning that the entire company could collapse. Any acquisition of the memory chip business faces hurdles. The business is run as a joint venture with Western Digital under a deal that is said to give the US company exclusive negotiating rights over any acquisition of Toshiba’s stake. Also, Japan is hesitant to allow a foreign company to acquire the business, because it doesn’t want key Japanese semiconductor technology to fall into foreign ownership.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Relive the golden days of MacOS with this in-browser emulator Chris Mills @chrisfmills April 17th, 2017 at 2:44 PM Share Tweet Last year, Apple switched from OS X to macOS as the naming scheme for its desktop operating system. But long before the days of Yosemite or El Capitan, Apple had a very different MacOS. The Macintosh computer, and its easy-to-use graphical interface, was the product that put Apple on the map. You’re not going to see any original MacOS computers in use today, but luckily, the Internet Archive isn’t going to let a technological gem like MacOS die so easily. Don't Miss: Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7 Plus and every top Android phone: The ultimate speed test That’s why the Internet Archive has put up a page that allows you to run a version of MacOS in your browser, for free. If you click here, you can fire up a Mac from 1991 with an operating system and a bunch of software already pre-installed. The Internet Archive, being a good responsible library, even includes a good description of what you’re playing with and why: System 7 (codenamed “Big Bang” and sometimes retrospectively called Mac OS 7) is a single-user graphical user interface-based operating system for Macintosh computers and was part of the classic Mac OS line of operating systems. It was introduced on May 13, 1991, by Apple Computer. It succeeded System 6, and was the main Macintosh operating system until it was succeeded by Mac OS 8 in 1997. Features added with the System 7 release included virtual memory, personal file sharing, QuickTime, QuickDraw 3D, and an improved user interface. System 7 was the first Apple operating system to be available on CD, although it shipped on a set of 15 floppy disks initially. Unlike earlier systems, System 7 itself did not come bundled with major software packages. Newly purchased Macintosh computers had System 7 installed and were often bundled with software such as HyperCard, At Ease and Mouse Practice. Nothing about the OS feels similar to a modern-day Mac, with the exception of the font. Resolution, the file layout, and especially the computer-browsing animations feel hilariously old, but Apple’s old Chicago font closely resembles the same font used for menus and titles today, only at far worse resolution.

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ 3D models of the Apple iPhone 8 Some years, the big leak that reveals what the next iPhone is going to look like is right in front of our faces. Take the totally redesigned Apple iPhone 4 which Steve Jobs compared to a "beautiful old Leica camera." Exactly seven-years ago today, an Apple iPhone 4 was found on the floor of a bar in San Jose. Soon, images of the next iPhone were all over the place. In March 2014, a factory worker inside Foxconn leaked out photos showing the design of the Apple iPhone 6. Mind you, these images were taken in March, a good half a year before the phone was unveiled. Already, you could see the protruding camera and the antenna lines from the CAD CAM images on the computer screen. Today, a schematic diagram supposedly lifted from a Foxconn factory reveals what is said to be the final design of the 10th-anniversary model, the Apple iPhone 8. The diagram is said to be the actual one used in the manufacturing process to help build the device, which will feature a 5.8-inch OLED screen using 2.5D glass. As previously leaked by Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 8's front-facing camera will employ a 3D scanner with face recognition capabilities. Apple could be having issues with the production of this technology, which is one reason why the phone might be delayed. According to the source, the side buttons will not be mechanical. You cannot press them down, but you will feel haptic feedback when you adjust the volume or turn on the phone. The power button is long enough to be used for two different functions, and Touch ID will be embedded under the screen. As recent rumors and sketches have shown, the dual camera setup on back could be laid out in a vertical fashion. We do suggest that you take all of this information and the accompanying images with a pinch or salt (heck, you might need two). Although past scenarios have proven that the design of the next-gen iPhone can be discovered five to six-months in advance, those kind of situations are rare indeed. Still, it doesn't hurt to ask yourself if you would be happy with this design if the schematics turn out to be legitimate.

Get so tired of you fools always want to start an argument over an opinion. He thinks its ugly. He isnt wrong because you dont agree. And agreeing with someone doesn't mean they are right. That's the problem with you iDiots. You have no respect for an opinion that doesn't agree with your own. The camera like that in the corner is "ugly". I personally don't find the phone to be 100% ugly. But the S8 certainly looks better. What would be good is if, iOS 11 has a new UI that brings out the phone looks. If they plan to keep using the girly fag colors of iOS 7...it is gonna be ugly. Samsung changed the UI to make the phone look ever better and its a nice blend. posted on yesterday, 19:58 6 Reply 17.

Had this been a Note8 schematic and someone called it ugly, you'd be typing out essay after essay telling them that they should just kill themselves. You're in absolutely NO position to be telling anyone to respect someone else's opinion.

TechieXP1969 (Posts: 12833; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) Right now the S8 is a reality and its a beautiful phone. But when another leak showed a vertical camera, evefryone was whining that Apple wouldnt make that. I'd say they are. Samsung considered it too as we have seen a leak actual S8 with it. Their must be a benefit in this design. Like maybe the cameras side by side if for a wider angle, but in vertical could give you a better depth of field. I dont care what its for, but Apple really needs to centralize the camera. If it has a bump, a lopside phone is a terrible idea. Sometimes I want to set the phone down and the odd wobble annoying. Both Apple and Samsung should not advertise the wallpaper taking up the whole screen, until it does. Other than the camera, it looks pretty good. The S8 right now still looks better. posted on yesterday, 20:19 0 Reply 30.

Updated: April 18, 2017 @ 12:53 am Full Forecast News Sports Life Entertainment Dining Buy & Sell AP Apple Inc.'s Touch ID Troubles newsfeedback@fool.com (Ashraf Eassa) Apr 17, 2017 Updated 3 hrs ago 0 Analyst Andy Hargreaves with Pacific Crest, in a research note obtained by MacRumors, offered some commentary with respect to the Touch ID situation for Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) upcoming iPhone. As readers may be aware, Apple's iPhone 8 is widely expected to have a Touch ID sensor embedded underneath the display itself, rather than underneath a dedicated home button. Readers may also be aware that rumors continually swirl about Apple potentially facing serious difficulties in getting this technology into volume manufacturing. Image source: Apple. Let's look at what Hargreaves had to say. A tale of two options Hargreaves says that Apple "continues to work on solving its optical fingerprint issues." If Apple can work out the kinks "in the next month or so," the analyst says, then Apple "would likely place volume orders at that point." He does note that even if Apple does get it all sorted out within the next month, this would still necessitate a "delay of the OLED iPhone launch." The silver lining, according to Hargreaves, is that such a delay wouldn't "meaningfully affect volume [shipments] for the [product] cycle." However, if it can't get these issues worked out, then "Apple may be forced to eliminate fingerprint sensing from the OLED iPhone altogether." Goodbye, Touch ID. Hello, 3D sensing? In the case that Apple does, in fact, eliminate Touch ID from the OLED-based iPhone 8, Hargreaves argues that the rumored 3D sensing functionality that's expected to be coming to this device could serve as a "viable and innovative replacement for the highly popular fingerprint sensor." Indeed, Hargreaves says, citing "suppliers," that the 3D sensing technology "is both fast and highly reliable, even in low-light scenarios or from odd angles." Foolish take To be blunt, I'm not convinced that this potential 3D sensing technology can really serve as a general-purpose replacement for Touch ID. For example, Hargreaves says that the 3D sensing tech works well in low light, which is certainly nice, but what about situations in which there's practically no light? Can the 3D sensing solution remain "fast and highly reliable" even in that case? Even if Apple were to solve that problem, there's still the huge issue of convenience, particularly vis-a-vis Apple Pay (a point that Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri briefly mentioned in his own note discussing Apple's Touch ID woes). Today, Apple Pay works by having the user hold her or his phone up to the reader and then touching the fingerprint sensor. It's simple and convenient, which is probably one of the major reasons that Apple Pay continues to gain traction. How would customers use Apple Pay using the 3D sensor? Would a user need to explicitly load the Apple Pay application, stick his or her face in front of the front-facing camera, and then once the image is captured, move the phone near the reader? This sounds much less convenient and, frankly, probably more annoying than just pulling out a credit card and swiping it or sticking it in a chip reader and signing the screen.

In my view, Apple must include Touch ID on the OLED iPhone, especially if the "standard" iPhone 7s and 7s Plus include it (lack of Touch ID could drive potential iPhone 8 customers to buy a cheaper iPhone 7s or 7s Plus instead). At this point, I'm hopeful that Apple figures out the issues with its in-screen Touch ID solution, but if it can't get it to work in time, I'll be interested to see what Apple ultimately ships.  10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Supplier a Blessing or a Curse? It can be a blessing, but with a caveat. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 17, 2017 at 12:45PM In the wake of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Imagination Technologies' (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF) disastrous disclosure that the former will dump the latter's technologies from its future A-series applications processors (Imagination relies on Apple for slightly more than half of its revenue), as well as the rumors that Apple could be working to dump Dialog Semiconductor (NASDAQOTH:DLGNF) from future iPhones as well (Dialog depends on Apple for nearly three-quarters of its revenue), it's worth asking a simple question: Is being an Apple supplier a blessing or a curse? The upside to being an Apple supplier The benefit of being an Apple supplier is that it orders a lot of components. For a large company, Apple business can serve as a nice boost, and for a small company, it can be a truly game-changing event. Image source: Apple. Indeed, for those small companies that win the "Apple lottery," the dramatically increased revenue not only leads to a significant improvement in the company's financial condition (boosting the stock price, perhaps substantially), but it can do so much more than that over the long term. The increased revenue can give a newly minted supplier the ability to invest more aggressively in future products, which not only helps it maintain its position with Apple but also gives it the ability to expand its portfolio of products and court additional customers. In other words, it can trigger a positive feedback loop that, over the long term, can be phenomenally transformative. An example of a company that did this well is semiconductor intellectual property vendor ARM Holdings, which invested heavily in widening its portfolio of products -- offering a wide range of processor cores to target the entire range of smartphones, building out a serious mobile graphics licensing business, and even trying to push into new areas such as servers, networking, and more. However, it's not always sunshine and rainbows. The real risk of Apple dependence Some suppliers that see their fortunes turn dramatically for the better after scoring deals with Apple fail to diversify or expand their businesses and clientele. This is sometimes due to the fundamental market dynamics and opportunities making it difficult to grow beyond Apple; other times, it can be due to complacency. Take, for example, the case of Imagination Technologies. This company tried quite hard to expand beyond Apple. It entered the CPU core licensing business with its acquisition of MIPS Technologies, it has gotten in the low power communications IP business with its Ensigma technology, and it has even tried to expand its customer base with its PowerVR graphics. These efforts, however, ultimately didn't even work. Now that Apple intends to cut Imagination out of its future chip designs, it is faced with the serious risk that within the next few years, its Apple-related revenue (a bit more than half of total revenue) will quickly evaporate. Even with Apple's business, Imagination found it difficult to achieve sustainable profitability -- without it, I can't see how it can sustain current operations. Indeed, the risk with having such a high dependence on Apple is that a company's operating expenses naturally expand commensurate with current and expected future revenue levels. If those expected revenue levels come way down, then it can be tremendously difficult -- if not downright impossible -- to remain on its current course (or even remain in business).  What to look for when investing in Apple suppliers I'm not trying to discourage investors from necessarily investing in Apple suppliers, or even ones with very high Apple concentration -- some of them are superb businesses that aren't at significant risk of losing Apple's business in the near to medium term. What I do want to encourage investors to be, though, is selective. Try to pick suppliers that Apple can't easily design out of its phones (for example, those with rare, highly specialized technologies), as well as suppliers for which vertical integration on Apple's part wouldn't make much sense. By no means is picking such suppliers easy -- it can be phenomenally difficult, actually -- and even ones that don't appear to be at high risk can still get bad news from Apple.   Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Apple TV To Add Picture-in-Picture Mode And Multi-User Support In tvOS 11 By Ali Salman 19 hours ago 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple will potentially reveal tvOS 11 sometime in June at the WWDC event. At this point in time, there are not any major details for what they might feature and have in store for users. However, a new report from The Verifier published today, suggests that the Apple TV will receive a pretty notable update with features like Picture-in-Picture and multi-user login modes. So let’s dive in to see some more details on the report and see what else could potentially be part of the update. tvOS 11 To Add Picture-in-Picture And Multi-User Mode? The report provides a model through which tvOS 11 will allow users to add multiple Apple IDs. These multiple accounts will be used by different family members in the house. Once a person logs in to their specific account, they will only see their media content and information. For instance, an individual user will see only their playlists and songs in the Apple Music app, view their own personal photos in the iCloud Photo Library in Photos. Apart from this, users will see their apps and layout on the home screen. Related Apple Wants Siri to Recognize Your Voice Only for Added Security As noted by The Verifier, the switching of the account from one user to the other will be as simple as changing a channel. Apple does not feature the ability to add multiple accounts in iOS as well. However, the company did add Shared iPad features for educational purposes with the release of iOS 9.3 last year. According to the source, Apple rests in the final stages to develop the feature, however its integration into the upcoming tvOS firmware will be delayed until later this year. Advertisement Apart from this, tvOS is also said to bring the Picture-in-Picture functionality to Apple TV. Initially, Apple unveiled the feature with iOS 9. Now, it’s good to see that the company is making its way to the set-top box. Picture-in-Picture mode on an Apple TV definitely makes sense and tvOS will be streamlined with other operating systems from the company. Basically, the Picture-in-Picture mode allows users to dock a windowed video to a corner of the display. This allows the user to continue navigating and browsing sections of tvOS in search for other content or apps. While users would probably not have the option to play two Picture-in-Picture videos at once, it is still a welcome addition to the platform.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple Will Replace Your iPad 4 With an iPad Air 2 – But Under Certain Circumstances By Uzair Ghani 17 hours ago 13Shares Share Tweet Submit It has come to our knowledge that Apple will replace a user’s iPad 4 with an iPad Air 2 if the need arises. Apple’s iPad 4 Stock is Dwindling Fast, Therefore it Will Likely Give You an iPad Air 2 Replacement if Your Tablet is Broken Released back in 2012, the iPad 4 is an old tablet, without a doubt. But, if for some reason, your tablet breaks down and Apple is left with no choice except give you a replacement, then the company will likely throw you an iPad Air 2 as a replacement. This is due to the fact that the iPad 4 is dwindling down in supply very fast and the iPad Air 2 is available more readily. Related iPad Air 2 128GB Model Gets A 38 Percent Discount – See The Deal Right Here Advertisement Here’s the internal memo as leaked by MacRumors regarding the matter: Starting March 30, iPad 4th generation whole unit repairs may be substituted to iPad Air 2 models. Apple’s repair and order management tool will indicate for each repair if a substitution will take place. Please note the substitute part’s color and capacity to ensure the customer understands what their replacement iPad whole unit will be. Before you get excited that Apple will give you an iPad Air 2 in exchange for your broken iPad 4 there and then, please note that the company will assess your device first before landing on a decision. It’s likely that a small part replacement will be carried out by the company easily, but if the damage is more than beyond control, then only expect an iPad Air 2. Also, it should be kept in mind that the iPad Air 2 is subject to region availability as well. This means if you the area you’re living in that has iPad 4 in stock, then you won’t be getting an iPad Air 2. Related WCCFtech iPad Air 2 International Giveaway This is a great little move from Apple, as it ensures that users get at least something in return rather than nothing at all. If your luck is sky high and were hoping for brand new tablet after your iPad 4 broke down, then you might want to walk towards your nearest Apple Store or an authorized Apple repair outlet. Who knows you might end up walking out with a brand spanking new tablet from yesteryear!

There is also new information about the handset’s camera, and it corroborates recent reports of a vertically-aligned dual-camera module.  On Monday, Mac Otakara outed some details about the rumored “iPhone Edition,” which is also referred to as iPhone 8 by many technology news sites and analysts. According to the Japanese blog, Tim Cook’s company is adopting a familiar design that makes use of a stainless steel frame to hold together the front and back glass panels of the upcoming iPhone. The enclosure is going to be sandwiched by the glass plates, just like what Apple did to its 2010 edition smartphone.  The blog also indicated that the next-generation iPhone will come with flat OLED display and with 2.5D cover glass on the edges. The slight curvature on the edges would give it distinction from the design Apple adopted for the iPhone 4. The design is said to have already made it through the tech giant’s engineering verification testing (EVT) process, so it’s very likely for the 10th anniversary iPhone to debut with the glass sandwiched hardware.  READ: Is Apple ditching iPhone 8 display-embedded Touch ID?  Interestingly, Apple intends to improve the stainless steel frame for the upcoming iPhone. So unlike the iPhone 4, the company is working on an improved version of the enclosure utilizing the technology it is using with its Apple Watch smartwatches. However, it wasn’t made clear if the steel chassis would be polished or would come with matte finish, as pointed out by Apple Insider. Another feature that is expected to launch with the iPhone 8 is a more advanced dual-camera module. A recently leaked diagram actually shows the module to be vertically aligned. Reports are already spreading the word about the vertically-aligned iSight Duo camera on the back of the next iPhone. According to MacRumors, the reason behind the vertical lenses is in order for the module to be positioned horizontally when the handset is used in a VR headset.  Lastly, the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s Plus that are expected to debut alongside the iPhone 8 are now reportedly sporting thicker bodies than their predecessors. This would mean that the cases for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus won’t fit them.  Apple’s iPhone 8 is now believed to sport the same stainless steel frame found on the iPhone 4.

He has worked on Kello, a mechanical watch analyzer for iOS, and Twixt Time, a watch and clock accuracy analysis tool for iOS. Gorilla Glass, Liquidmetal, sapphire, and now ceramic, Apple continues to push the boundaries of materials science through design. Apple's product line has evolved through a number of significant material advancements over the decades. Early Apple I computers were cased in wood. German designer, Hartmut Essligner ushered in the iconic, 'Snow White' design language of the original Mac with the Apple IIc. That off-white, injection moulded plastic look endured in the Mac line for nearly two-decades, until it was supplanted by the candy-coloured iMac that was inspired, in part, by the success of Swatch watches. The company then started to dabble in metals like steel, titanium, and aluminum for the enclosures of its iPods, PowerBooks, and the venerable Mac Pro. Parts of a Swatch watch. Its economic layout was inspired by the unibody design of the Concord Delirium. The breakthrough product that laid the foundation for the aluminum dominated era of Apple products we are presently in was the MacBook Air. Milled from a solid block of aluminum, its unibody design achieved with one single component what had previously required dozens of components and delivered it in a package that was unbelievably thin and remarkably strong. According to Doug Satzger1, former Creative Lead of Apple's Industrial Design team, in the years leading up to the release of the MacBook Air, "We started researching watch companies just to understand machining metals, finishing metals, product assembly." The Jaeger-LeCoultre Master Ultra Thin and MacBook Air both employ tapers to appear thinner than they are. It's no secret that Jony Ive and crew admire and draw inspiration from the craft of watchmaking. Shortly after unveiling Apple Watch to the world, in an interview with the Financial Times, Ive expressed, "We're a group of people who love our watches. So we're working on something, yet have a high regard for what currently exists." Shelves in the Industrial Design Studio house books that are dedicated to watches. In 2013 Jony Ive and Marc Newson (now also a designer at Apple) collaborated on a watch with the 180 year old Swiss brand, Jaeger-LeCoultre. Newson himself is cofounder of Ikepod Watches, whose innovative strap designs had a pronounced influence on the straps of the Apple Watch. A set of premium watchmaking tools, hand-picked by Jony Ive and Marc Newson for an auction they curated for Sotheby's. Enter Ceramic Given the influence of the watch industry on the company's industrial design, it seems fitting that Apple's exploration of a new class of materials, beyond plastic, aluminum, and other metals, would begin with the Apple Watch. That new class of material being ceramic. Ceramic has been in the Apple Watch line from day one. It debuted first as the back cover for the steel Apple Watch and gold Apple Watch Editions, housing the heart rate sensors while simultaneously providing a durable, passive surface through which the watch could be charged inductively. Two years later, with the announcement of Series 2, the Apple Watch Edition went full ceramic. Full ceramic is a notable distinction for a watch. Few watch companies bother attempting to make the entire outside of a watch from ceramic. Rado was one of the first companies to introduce the use of ceramics in watches back in the 1960s. Most of their ceramic watches employ steel, titanium, or plastic for part of the case and the entire caseback. The same remains true for most watch brands who offer ceramic timepieces. It was only relatively recently that Rado began to do away with the need for a metal core, beginning with the True Thinline in 2011. One of the only other watch brands to boast a fully ceramic case is Rado's big brother, Omega. Both brands are owned by the Swatch Group and both have benefited from the material advancements coming out of Swatch's research and development arm, Asulab. The Upside of Ceramic Ceramics are a really broad class of material and not all ceramics are created equal. The particular flavour of ceramic Apple has chosen does a good job of balancing hardness and impact resistance, while looking great doing it. The ceramic for the case of the Series 2 Apple Watch Edition is composed of aluminum oxide, zirconium, and yttrium oxide. Aluminum oxide provides scratch resistance, zirconium brings resilience, and yttrium oxide adds stability. The sapphire crystal protecting the screen of the Apple Watch Edition is a form of transparent ceramic that is more or less pure aluminum oxide. Coupled with the fully ceramic crown, the entire outer surface of the watch is pretty much impervious to scratches, dings, dents, or discolouration. After years of daily use, it's likely it will still look as good as the first day it came off of the production line. Ceramic is also radio-transparent. This means that radio chips, like those for Bluetooth, GPS, or WiFi, can get greater coverage using less energy. It also renders the contrasting black circle on the back of the watch less necessary and Apple could, in the future, ship a watch with a more seamless case back of one solid colour. The Downside of Ceramic A cracked lug, where the strap would attach, on a ceramic watch case. Ceramic's Achilles' heel is that it can crack or chip if dropped or hit hard enough. In traditional ceramic watches, this kind of damage primarily tends to occur along sharp edges or where the ceramic is thin. As already mentioned, the zirconium-based ceramic that Apple is using helps provide some resilience against impacts. In addition to this, an argument could be made that the physical shape of the Apple Watch makes it the most impact resistant, ceramic watch on the market. Its rounded shape will help to distribute the force impacts and objects that do hit it are likely to glance smoothly off its glassy, white surface. There are no exposed, thin edges. Cutouts in the case to accept the strap that might otherwise be susceptible are subtly chamfered and reinforced when the strap is in place. The Apple Watch case plays well to ceramic's strengths while mitigating its one weakness. That said, it would be nice to see Apple eventually introduce a folding clasp option for the Apple Watch Edition, which would serve up an added layer of security. Drops resulting in damage to ceramic watches tend to happen when undoing or doing up a strap while standing over a hard surface like tile floor, which happens to be a common floor treatment in washrooms and locker rooms where watches are frequently put on or removed. A folding clasp connects the two sides of the strap into one continuous loop that makes it harder to drop the watch when taking it on or off your wrist. Titanium clasp covered in black ceramic, from an Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean Deep Black. Looking Ahead Is ceramic the next big step in Apple's product evolution? Could there be a ceramic iPhone in Apple's future? It's feasible, but given that that the material literally needs to be machined with diamonds, in the short-term it's unlikely beyond an iPhone Edition. 1From an interview with Leander Kahney in 'Jony Ive: The Genius Behind Apple's Greatest Products' Reader comments Apple Watch and the story of ceramics 1 Comment View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating delta4s This is Apple at its best.

The analyst note followed earlier reports claiming that Apple was facing low yield rates in integrating Touch ID beneath the display, perhaps looking towards a rear-device implementation. Would you still buy the iPhone 8 even if it lacked Touch ID? Take Our Poll Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Earlier reports have claimed that Apple is developing new biometric technologies for the iPhone 8, including facial and eye recognition. If Apple indeed implements these features, then the lack of Touch ID would be somewhat less notable. However, Apple has been working towards a Touch ID-based world since the launch of the iPhone 5S. The company recently brought the feature to the Mac, while third-party apps have been implementing the security method at rapid pace. It seems odd for Apple to abandon the feature despite its massive success, essentially restarting the adoption process and limiting it to just iPhone 8 users. Furthermore, the lack of Touch ID on the flagship model would also create fragmentation in the iPhone lineup: the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s would presumably feature Touch ID, while the iPhone 8 wouldn’t. Thus creating issues for developers and Apple alike in terms of software features. As you can probably tell, I don’t personally buy into the theory that Apple would even consider ditching Touch ID on the iPhone 8 because of manufacturing difficulties. While I hope it doesn’t turn out to be the case, I’d rather Touch ID be on the back of the device than not there at all. It also, however, depends the implementation of other biometric technologies. As we realized with the Samsung Galaxy S8 this year, facial recognition doesn’t come without its flaws and Apple isn’t one to mess around when it comes to user security. If Apple can implement facial/eye recognition in a way that’s reliable and secure, however, I’m all for it. After all, I’d have a very hard time moving back to a world without Touch ID, but I seriously doubt it’s something that Apple is even considering. What do you think? Would the lack of Touch ID be a deal breaker for you come iPhone 8 season later this year? Let us know in the comments below and the poll below.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile This is supposedly Apple’s final iPhone 8 design Image Source: ifanr Zach Epstein @zacharye April 17th, 2017 at 9:41 AM Share Tweet Apple’s upcoming redesigned iPhone 8 is currently the subject of much debate in the rumor mill. Apple’s unreleased iPhones always leak long before they’re announced on stage in California, but we’re far enough away from the new model’s unveiling that there are still plenty of questions that remain unanswered. Will the display feature slightly curved edges or will it be flat? Will the new Touch ID fingerprint scanner be embedded beneath the screen or will Apple unfortunately have to relocate it to the back of the phone due to manufacturing issues. Those are just a few of the big questions we still have, but now a new report out of China claims to have revealed the details surrounding Apple’s final iPhone 8 design. What’s more, included 3D models based on freshly leaded schematics may be our first look at what Apple has planned for us later this year. Don't Miss: You can still get an NES Classic Edition right now on Amazon Earlier on Monday morning, we shared some leaked schematics that supposedly show Apple’s final iPhone 8 design. The schematics in question supposedly came from inside one of Foxconn’s factories, and they will presumably be used in the actual manufacturing process that will soon be underway. The same extensive post from Chinese tech blog ifanr also includes what are said to be 3D models of Apple’s upcoming new flagship iPhone, which will feature Apple’s first new iPhone design in three years. In 2016 and 2015, Apple reused the same iPhone design it first introduced on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus back in 2014. Here’s a look at the 3D models posted by ifanr: If the 3D models above are indeed the real deal, then the renders below may be our first look at Apple’s finished iPhone 8 design: Two things in particular stand out from the leaked schematics and 3D models. First, if they are accurate, Apple does plan to embed the fingerprint reader into the display. The iPhone 8 will be the first widely available smartphone to include an in-display fingerprint reader, if this leak pans out. The second noteworthy detail is the lack of curved edges on the iPhone 8’s screen. A number of solid reports from mainstream media sources have suggested that the sides of the iPhone 8’s display would be slightly curved, perhaps following the curvature of the phone’s 2.5D glass face. Apart from the unsightly vertical dual camera configuration, this proposed iPhone 8 design would mark an impressive leap beyond Apple’s previous designs, which all include massive bezels surrounding the displays. LG and Samsung have both introduced new flagship models with significantly smaller bezels, and Apple is expected to do the same later this year.

The last we heard, Apple was ditching the idea of making self-driving cars to focus on self-driving technology only. And now, Apple has obtained an official permit to test self-driving cars in California - and it suggests the iPhone maker really does plan to reinvent century-old automobiles, sort of how it took mobile phones and reinvented them into the modern-day smartphone we all carry in our pockets. As spotted by Business Insider, California's Department of Motor Vehicles updated its website last week, adding Apple and 29 other companies to its registry of firms that are actively testing self-driving vehicles in the state. Google is another tech giant on the list. The permit seems to confirm that Apple is definitely developing self-driving car technology, and it plans to test it on Lexus vehicles. Apple might make a new MacBook Pro adapter - one we actually want Any manufacturer of autonomous technology must apply to the California DMV before it can test a vehicle. On 14 April, California issued Apple an a permit that covers three vehicles - all 2015 Lexus RX450h SUVs - and six drivers. Apple confirmed that it was granted the permit, and it pointed to an old statement it made about heavily investing in "machine learning and autonomous systems". Apple reportedly has a secret unit of 1,000 employees working on what it has dubbed "Project Titan" in Sunnyvale, California. For years now, the unit has been developing self-driving technology, but last year, it brought on Bob Mansfield, an longtime Apple executive and engineer, to scale back and set new goals. Apple is thought to have ditched the idea of a full-fledged self-driving car as a result. You can read more about Project Titan from Pocket-lint's round-up.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Share Your iCloud Photos with Friends Who Don’t Use Apple Products By Jason Fitzpatrick on April 17th, 2017 You’re busily sharing vacation photos in an iCloud Photo Stream when somebody announces they don’t have an iPhone and can’t participate. What do you do? Like just everything Apple, iCloud Photo sharing is both super simple to use when everyone is using Apple products and also propriety. That means your pals with Android phones and the like just aren’t going to tap into the full iCloud photo sharing experience. You can, somewhat, share the experience but you’ll end up with a situation like you do with iMessage—where some people have green bubbles, some have blue, and it’s the difference between enjoying the iMessage group chat experience or getting left out. RELATED ARTICLES How to Create Shared and Collaborative Photo Albums on Your iPhone Why Are Some iMessages Green and Some Blue on My iPhone? Thankfully there is a way to bring non-Apple users into the fold (sort of) by making a simple tweak to the settings of your shared iCloud album. Unfortunately, however, that solution isn’t without its shortcomings. What shortcomings, exactly? Well… Non-Apple friends only can view the shared photos (in a clunkily-designed web-based viewer at that). They cannot add photos to shared albums, leave comments, or otherwise interact with the album like your friends with iPhones can. There is no user control when you share outside of Apple’s walled garden—Apple outsiders just get a URL to the aforementioned web-based viewer. Even though the URL is a long randomized string, there is no user validation. Anyone with the URL can look at all your shared photos. The randomized URL is permanently assigned to the specific album and you cannot regenerate it. This means if you turn the feature off because the URL is leaked to someone you don’t want to have access, you’ll need to delete the whole shared album (losing all the shared comments and contributions) and make a new shared album if you ever want to use the URL sharing feature again. In other words, the iCloud photo sharing feature is good enough for simple use solutions—say, you want to send the URL to grandma back home so she can your family vacation photos—but not so great if you’re trying to create a true secure and shared collaborative experience between your friends. With that in mind, let’s take a look at how to share an iCloud album with non-Apple users as a quick and dirty solution. We’ll then look at a better cross-platform solution if you want your friends to partake in the social and collaborative experience. Open Up iCloud Photos to Non-Apple Users By default, iCloud Photo albums are not set up for sharing with non-Apple users. Not only do we need to make a little tweak to the album we want to share, we also need to notify our friends of where to find the album. To get started open up the “Photos” app on your iOS device. Tap the “Shared” cloud icon located on the bottom navigation bar. RELATED ARTICLE How to Create Shared and Collaborative Photo Albums on Your iPhone Select any of your shared albums. We’re using an album named “Pet Photos” that we already shared during our previous tutorial on configuring shared iCloud Photo albums. If you don’t have any shared albums yet, hit up that tutorial and share an album before proceeding. After you open the album, tap the “People” button at the bottom. Here you’ll find all the settings for this specific shared album. At the top, you’ll see your Apple-product-using-friends because their Apple accounts are associated with the shared album. For everyone else, we need to turn on the “Public Website” option. Once you turn “Public Website” on, you’ll see a URL under the entry plus a “Share Link” option. All the shared album URLs look like this: https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/[a long random alphanumeric string]/ We’ve blurred the string in this screenshot because, as we noted above, each URL is permanently associated with the shared album and doesn’t change unless you delete the album entirely and start over. You can share this link from your iPhone anyway you want to—text it, email it, share it via an instant messaging platform, whatever. The recipient just has to visit the URL in a browser to view the photos. They’ll see your photo album as a simple slideshow that includes the album name, the captions of your photos, and a link that allows them to download individual photos. As we noted above, non-Apple users cannot leave comments or upload photos which. Using Third Party Tools to Collaborate with Non-Apple Friends RELATED ARTICLE How to Create and Share Collaborative Albums in Google Photos If you want to set up a simple and free collaborative album between your iOS and Android—and even desktop—friends, we highly recommend you use Google Photos. It captures the same experience—shared albums, collaborative album building, shared comments, and more—in a way that is totally cross-platform. Google Photos even boasts an identical look and functionality across both iOS and Android. For help setting up a collaborative Google album, check out our full guide. While the simple (and someone ugly) shared URL method might be fine for some dead simple file sharing with relatives who just want to view the photos and maybe download them to print off for the fridge, if you want to create an integrated experience for everyone we can’t recommend Google Photos as iCloud Photo Sharing alternative strongly enough.

As readers may be aware, Apple's iPhone 8 is widely expected to have a Touch ID sensor embedded underneath the display itself, rather than underneath a dedicated home button. Readers may also be aware that rumors continually swirl about Apple potentially facing serious difficulties in getting this technology into volume manufacturing. Image source: Apple. Let's look at what Hargreaves had to say. A tale of two options Hargreaves says that Apple "continues to work on solving its optical fingerprint issues." If Apple can work out the kinks "in the next month or so," the analyst says, then Apple "would likely place volume orders at that point." He does note that even if Apple does get it all sorted out within the next month, this would still necessitate a "delay of the OLED iPhone launch." The silver lining, according to Hargreaves, is that such a delay wouldn't "meaningfully affect volume [shipments] for the [product] cycle." However, if it can't get these issues worked out, then "Apple may be forced to eliminate fingerprint sensing from the OLED iPhone altogether." Goodbye, Touch ID. Hello, 3D sensing? In the case that Apple does, in fact, eliminate Touch ID from the OLED-based iPhone 8, Hargreaves argues that the rumored 3D sensing functionality that's expected to be coming to this device could serve as a "viable and innovative replacement for the highly popular fingerprint sensor." Indeed, Hargreaves says, citing "suppliers," that the 3D sensing technology "is both fast and highly reliable, even in low-light scenarios or from odd angles." Foolish take To be blunt, I'm not convinced that this potential 3D sensing technology can really serve as a general-purpose replacement for Touch ID. For example, Hargreaves says that the 3D sensing tech works well in low light, which is certainly nice, but what about situations in which there's practically no light? Can the 3D sensing solution remain "fast and highly reliable" even in that case? Even if Apple were to solve that problem, there's still the huge issue of convenience, particularly vis-a-vis Apple Pay (a point that Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri briefly mentioned in his own note discussing Apple's Touch ID woes). Today, Apple Pay works by having the user hold her or his phone up to the reader and then touching the fingerprint sensor. It's simple and convenient, which is probably one of the major reasons that Apple Pay continues to gain traction. How would customers use Apple Pay using the 3D sensor? Would a user need to explicitly load the Apple Pay application, stick his or her face in front of the front-facing camera, and then once the image is captured, move the phone near the reader? This sounds much less convenient and, frankly, probably more annoying than just pulling out a credit card and swiping it or sticking it in a chip reader and signing the screen. In my view, Apple must include Touch ID on the OLED iPhone, especially if the "standard" iPhone 7s and 7s Plus include it (lack of Touch ID could drive potential iPhone 8 customers to buy a cheaper iPhone 7s or 7s Plus instead). At this point, I'm hopeful that Apple figures out the issues with its in-screen Touch ID solution, but if it can't get it to work in time, I'll be interested to see what Apple ultimately ships.  10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Digital Trends Home > DT Daily > Microsoft: Shadow Brokers’ hack exploits… Microsoft: Shadow Brokers’ hack exploits have already been patched By Bill Roberson — April 17, 2017 12:54 PM Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: There’s no place for home Fortune is saying that Apple may have hit a stumbling block in the creation of their top-tier iPhone, which rumors say will likely be called the iPhone Edition. One key feature of the Edition could be a front display covering the entire front of the phone, which would, of course, require some sort of trick to implementing the home button at the bottom of the screen. And that’s where Fortune says Apple has run into a problem. Apparently, Apple is having problems getting the fingerprint reader under the display to work. If they can’t figure it out soon, analysts say Apple may have to move the fingerprint reader to the back of the phone, which is what Samsung did with the new Galaxy S8. But “innovation” icon Apple probably doesn’t want to be seen as copying Samsung, so what to do? Traditionally, Apple finalizes iPhone design in March so phones are ready to sell in September. If they can’t get this figured out soon, that could delay the much-anticipated device, which is another negative for Apple. Looks like it’s crunch time for Jony and Tim. But you might want to update pretty much everything You may have heard how a cache of hacks against Windows machines were recently released by the so-called Shadow Brokers hacking group, and if you’re worried about getting victimized, we understand you concerns. So does Microsoft apparently, and they quickly went on the offensive after the release to assure Windows users that the OS is fully patched up against the threats, some of which date back nearly a decade. However, some of the vulnerabilities were only patched last month, according to a Microsoft blogpost on April 14th that included a table showing which updates addressed which threats. We’ve at link to the table, which is also full of links, of course. They also advised anyone not running up-to-date software to, you know, update it as soon as possible. Can tech feed the world? What’s one thing every person on Planet Earth does every day? Check Facebook? Well, not yet, but everyone does need to eat every day, and with 7.5 billion people needing daily nutrition, scientists are working to develop tech that can feed everyone – now and in the future. For the next couple of weeks here at DT, we’re taking a closer look at the Future of Food: how it’s grown, where it’s grown, and the cutting-edge technologies used for everything from growing, harvesting and distributing food, to the latest genetic discoveries that could end up feeding everyone when the population hits 10 billion people in the very near future. It’s the Future of Food, and there’s a lot to talk about. Hit this link for the first taste of our new series.
Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Martin Hajek Supplying screens for the iPhone 8 is an offer LG and Samsung just can’t refuse Chris Smith @chris_writes April 17th, 2017 at 7:12 PM Share Tweet Reports last week said that Google wants to invest almost $1 billion in LG Display’s OLED manufacturing plants to secure OLED displays for the Pixel 2 series, although the two parties did not sign an agreement. New reports from Korea claim that LG is eyeing a bigger opportunity for next year: Apple’s iPhone 8. The company is expected to confirm during a board meeting in June that it’ll provide OLED displays for the iPhone 8 next year. That doesn’t mean the Pixel 2 deal isn’t on the table, just that the iPhone seems to be the kind of opportunity LG can’t refuse. Don't Miss: These are the Netflix originals generating the most buzz online According to Business Korea , LG Display “virtually decided” to supply small and medium panels for Apple’s iPhone 8. Apparently, Apple asked LG directly to submit bids. “We received a request to take part in a bid for receiving an order for small and medium-sized OLEDs from Apple,” a senior LG Display official said. “At the end of June, we will make a decision based on OLED production technology, capacity and the accompanying investment volume in an extraordinary board meeting.” LG Display needs to make huge investments to manufacture OLED displays for smartphones, but the company doesn’t want to miss out on the current display trend. Smartphone makers are moving from LCD to OLED screens, with Apple leading the charge. “The annual sales volume of the iPhone 8 with OLEDs is estimated at 40 million units,” representative of the display industry said. “Although LG Display was a few months behind Samsung, its E5’s annual production volume reached 5.5 million units, bringing LG Display enough volume to supply OLEDs not only to Apple but to Chinese smartphone makers.” Samsung will be the big initial winner of Apple’s move to OLED, as LG’s biggest rival owns 95% of the smartphone OLED display market. Reports claimed that Apple inked OLED deals with Samsung worth over $9 billion. Samsung is also rapidly expanding its OLED factories to meet increasing OLED display demand. A report from The Investor says that Apple’s iPhone 8 will secure parts from Korean suppliers, including Samsung Display for OLED screens. Because Apple is less experienced in OLED, Samsung Display is expected to play a key role in the overall supply chain management for OLED screens, which means it’ll use its own key component suppliers. Samsung’s System LSI will supply the display driver chip for the OLED screen, a contract worth some $422 million. Because one unit costs $5, the report notes that Apple is expected to make some 80 million iPhone 8 units this year alone.

By Emily Bary April 17, 2017 5:38 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple recently got a permit to test self-driving technology in California. Illustration: Getty Images Don’t get your hopes up quite yet for an Apple car. Fans were excited to learn Friday that the company got a permit to test out three self-driving Lexus vehicles in California, but Apple is fighting an uphill battle.

The permit marks a rather tame foray into a crowded field. While Apple company could adapt some of its existing technologies for use in self-driving cars (like entertainment and mapping), the company still struggles on the hardware side. It doesn’t manufacture products -- the iPhone is made by a third party -- so it would need to find a company to do that. Apple, meanwhile, is already years behind Tesla and Google in terms of testing self-driving technology, according to Gene Munster, an analyst with Loup Ventures. “The typical automotive design process takes five to seven years,” Munster wrote in a research note on Monday. The desire to make a car is reminiscent of Apple’s much-speculated ambition of making a full-fledged television, which still hasn’t come to fruition. “Apple is almost certainly exploring how it could build an entire car, but as we learned the hard way with an Apple television, exploration does not mean a product comes to market,” he wrote. “Apple is the best connected device maker in the world and the car is the biggest connected device in the world. There is a natural fit in the self-driving car market if Apple can figure out how to get past the challenges of making the hardware.” In this case, making that hardware is a big if, even for Apple. Big Picture: News of an Apple permit to test self-driving cars excited fans, but the company faces many challenges in the automotive space.

Are you someone who's totally obsessed with all things Apple? Proud to be an Apple-crazed, Apple-loving, Apple-enthusiast? Looking to show off your passion for retro Apple products alongside your modern, sleek iPhone 6, SE, or 7 Plus? Then why not check out some of the best Apple-centric iPhone cases and skins to adorn your tech with?! Here are some of the best iPhone cases and skins to try out if you're an Apple enthusiast! Note: Redbubble uses the same stock iPhone case for every model and just puts a different print/design on each one. If you love the way one fits, you'll love 'em all! Vintage rainbow Apple Logo Jobs Retro Apple Macintosh iPhone case Apple iMac Blueberry Apple Retro wrap/skin Vintage rainbow Apple Logo If you're someone who likes to think different, loves the vintage look of the rainbow Apple logo, and fancies a minimalist, clean-looking cell phone case design, then the Vintage rainbow Apple Logo case from Redbubble might be a favorite for you. Designed to function and fit as a clip-on, one-piece case, this slim-fitting iPhone accessory won't give you a ton of extra protection but can help save your phone from shattering and smashing during accidental bumps and small falls. The Vintage rainbow Apple Logo case comes with access to all ports and buttons, meaning you don't need to put it on and take it off over and over again to charge it. This particular vintage case comes in sizes for every iPhone from the iPhone 4 on. See at Redbubble Jobs Steve Jobs: Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower. If you've been a fan of Apple since the beginning, then you've probably heard of a man named Steve Jobs. Now you can celebrate Apple's leading man with a Jobs-themed sleek and stylish case from Redbubble! This smooth, gray case is made from a durable, shatterproof material that doesn't offer up a ton of protection, but will still keep your iPhone safe from short falls or light bumps. On the back of the case is a simple, starkly contrasted portrait of Jobs in his signature round-frame glasses, while on the front, a raised bezel protects your screen when you lay it face-down. If you're interested in the Jobs case, you can pick it up for any iPhone from the 4 on for around $31. See at Redbubble Retro Apple If you're someone who likes to match your iPhone faceplate colors to your cases to keep things looking consistent and clean but still want that li'l extra pop of color to showcase your Macintosh passions, then check out the Retro Apple case from Redbubble. The Retro Apple case is designed to be durable, with shatterproof casing and a raised bezel on the front, but it doesn't have the same protection as a bulky Otterbox-type case. Redbubble has sizes for every iPhone from the 4 on, and goes for around $31 online. The best part about the Retro Apple case? The stunningly bright colors of the vintage logo on the back, which are embedded directly into the case – not just sitting on top like some logos that are just waiting to fade away over time! See at Redbubble Macintosh iPhone case Steve Jobs: I don't think I've ever worked so hard on something, but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life. Almost everyone who worked on it will say that. None of us wanted to release it at the end. It was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands, it wouldn't be ours anymore. Adorn your iPhone with a little retro love with this vintage Macintosh iPhone case from Redbubble! This case design is made to make your iPhone look like a classic Macintosh computer. It's the same color as the Macintoshes of old, complete with rainbow Macintosh logo. If you want to get a bit nostalgic and grew up on Macintosh, then this case is definitely for you. It's available for every iPhone from the 4 on, for around $31. See at Redbubble Apple iMac Blueberry Tony Fadell: It wasn't until the Apple Macintosh that people understood what true hardware-software integration was about. It took one company to line it up: low-cost hardware, cool graphics, third-party products built on top of it, in an all-in-one attractive package that was accessible to consumer marketing. Chances are if you grew up in the 80s/90s/early 2000s, you desperately lusted after those colorful iMac's that were in all the movies and TV shows; they were just so bright and colorful and futuristic and, well, awesome! Now you can capture the magic of that retro, see-through piece of tech with the Apple iMac Blueberry case. This iPhone case can be ordered to fit every iPhone from the 4 on, so you don't need to feel left out on this #throwback, retro case trend. If you're not a huge fan of the blue color, there are a few other options to pick from, including Grape, Tangerine, Lime, Strawberry, and Bondie Blue. See at Redbubble Apple Retro wrap/skin If you're someone who prefers the precise, minimalist look and feel of an iPhone skin over the bulkier look and feel of a traditional case but still want to show off your love for Apple products everywhere, then we suggest taking a peek at the Apple Retro wrap/skin from Slickwraps. Designed to fit and secure to the contours of your iPhone with a smooth matte finish, the Apple Retro wrap/skin isn't the most protective option for your iPhone, but it sure is sharp and eye-catching. On the back of your iPhone, you get the traditional retro rainbow Apple logo, while the wrap itself is a milky/cream color, which is very reminiscent of the old Apple color palettes. If you're scared about messing up the wrap's installation, don't worry! Slickwraps has something called a GOOF policy, which allows you to contact them within 30 days for a full replacement. You can pick up the Apple Retro wrap/skin for every iPhone from the iPhone 5s and on for around $20. See at Slickwraps How do you show off your #AppleAddiction?

We've got the answers right here! If you've been using Apple's Game Center in the past, you've undoubtedly noticed the drastic changes the service underwent with the launch of iOS 10. The gaming social network has been dramatically reduced in size and scope, nixing the app and focusing on the third-party app integration options, instead. Everything you need to know about Game Center What happened to Game Center in iOS 10? How can I tell if a game supports Game Center? How to sync your game history with Game Center How to delete games from your Game Center history How to view your achievements How to view leaderboards How to add and remove friends in Game Center How to invite or challenge someone to play a Game Center game How to play a game in iMessage How to disable game invites to nearby players How to record your gameplay on iPhone and iPad How to switch between Game Center accounts on Apple TV What happened to Game Center in iOS 10? Before iOS 10, Game Center was Apple's gaming-themed social network that connected through your iCloud account: It was built around a standalone app that let you add friends, challenge their high scores, and invite them to play games. It may never have been a great social network — but it was there. When Apple axed the app as part of its 2016 software upate, the company turned Game Center into an optional integration service for third-party games. Unfortunately, in doing so, Apple crippled a lot of Game Center's functionality — including adding and deleting friends. What happened to Game Center in iOS 10? How can I tell if a game supports Game Center? Unfortunately, there's no badge on an app's download page to highlight whether or not it supports Game Center: You'll have to download it to confirm. If a game has an iMessage app, however, it definitely supports Game Center. Open the game after you've downloaded it. If Game Center is supported, you'll see the Game Center banner appear at the top of the screen. You'll also be able to access leaderboards and the like by finding the Game Center button. (It looks different in every app.) How to sync your game history with Game Center One of Game Center's perks is game syncing: Apple will automatically save your game history to iCloud, where you can then recover it on any device you own that's also logged into iCloud. Switching from one device to the other is easy: Make sure you're connected to a Wi-Fi or Cellular network. Close the game you've been playing on your iPhone. Open the game on your iPad. How to delete games from your Game Center history Don't want to keep your saved game data, leaderboards, or achievements for a game? All you have to do is delete it locally from your home screen. Tap and hold on the game you wish to delete. When the icon begins to wiggle, tap the X in its upper left corner. Tap the X. Press Delete. If you want to start your game from scratch, simply redownload it from the App Store. How to view your achievements If you've been collecting achievements while playing a game, you should be able to view all your achievements from within the app. Launch a game from your Home screen. Tap the achievements button. Each game will have a different location and some may use a different icon; many games use a trophy icon for achievements. Tap on the achievements tab. NOTE: Not all games will have achievements; it's up to the developer to include this feature in the game. How to view leaderboards If a game offers leaderboards, you'll be able to check those inside the app in question. Launch a game from your Home screen. Tap the achievements button. Each game will have a different location and some may use a different icon; many games use a trophy icon for achievements. Tap on the leaderboards tab. How to change your nickname in Game Center. Launch the Settings app from your Home screen. Tap Game Center. Tap your nickname. Type in your new nickname. Tap Done. How to add and remove friends from Game Center As of iOS 10, you can no longer see your Game Center friends list, nor invite or delete individual friends from the Settings app. How to add friends Adding friends is managed on an individual game-by-game basis, through iMessage. Your game may or may not support this feature. Find your game's Add Friends button, if it exists or is supported, and tap it. Send an invite to your friend via iMessage inviting them to play the game. More likely, you'll see an option to invite friends via Facebook integration; this doesn't connect to Game Center, but offers game developers an alternate way to connect friends together to play a game. How to delete friends Unfortunately, the only current way to remove friends from Game Center is to remove all of them at once: There's no way to manually curate your list of friends. Launch the Settings app from your Home screen. Tap Game Center. Tap Remove all Game Center Friends. Tap Remove All Friends. How to invite or challenge someone to play a Game Center game If your game supports multiplayer invitations or challenges, you can challenge your friends to beat your achievements or high scores. How to invite someone to play a multiplayer game Note: Your game may or may not support this feature; multiplayer invitations are implemented on a game-by-game basis and Apple offers no concrete list for apps that support Game Center. Find your game's Invite button, if it exists or is supported, and tap it. Send an invite to your friend via iMessage inviting them to play the game. How to challenge a friend Note: Your game may or may not support this feature. In addition, challenges only work if the person you wish to challenge is already on your friends list — you can't challenge anyone in your Contacts list, for instance. Launch a game from your Home screen. Tap the achievements button. Each game will have a different location and some may use a different icon; many games use a trophy icon for achievements. From here, you have one of two options: Tap on the leaderboards tab and tap your high score in your friends list, then select Challenge. Tap on the achievements tab, select an achievement, and then tap Challenge. How to play a game in iMessage Some games offer built-in iMessage apps, which let you play the game directly in your iMessage conversation. To check and see whether your game supports iMessage, simply look it up in the App Store — games that support the feature will have a "Offers iMessage App" banner under their app icon, and you can see what form that game takes by looking at their included iMessage screenshots. To start a new game, do the following: Open a conversation where you want to have a game. Tap the right arrow button to open up the App drawer. Select the app icon. Swipe through the various iMessage apps until you find the game you want to play. Tap on it, and press Start Game. How to disable game invites to nearby players By default, if you're playing the same multiplayer game as someone close to you, you can send invites to them over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Of course, this only works if the game you're playing supports game invites. You can turn this feature off in your settings. Launch the Settings app from your Home screen. Tap Game Center. Tap the Nearby Players switch. If the switch is green, that means the feature is active, and if the switch is white, that means the feature has been disabled. You can turn the nearby players feature on again at any time by following the same steps listed above. How to record your gameplay on iPhone and iPad Apple's Game Center not only gives third-party apps leaderboards and multiplayer options, it also offers gameplay recording features. If the app you use supports Game Center's ReplayKit, you can record your screen and microphone during gameplay to share it with friends, or stream it online to make some cool "Let's Plays." How to record your gameplay on iPhone and iPad How to switch between Game Center accounts on Apple TV How do you switch Game Center accounts on Apple TV? Easy, just use Settings! A lot of the games you can play on the iPhone and iPad are also available on Apple TV, and much like gaming on iOS, tvOS can track your progress in games that support Game Center. If you share Apple TV with other members of the household, though, you may want to switch between Game Center accounts, depending on who is playing at any given time.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Apr 17, 2017 at 4:13PM Options are one of the more complicated facets of investing, and one of the subjects that listeners most often request us to cover on Industry Focus. On this week's Tech episode, we're taking the dive and doing a beginner's introduction to options. Motley Fool tech analyst Dylan Lewis talks with options expert JP Bennett about what exactly options are, how they work, and a few risks investors need to keep in mind when using them. This video was recorded on March 24, 2017. Dylan Lewis: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, March 24, and we're talking options. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined in the studio by Motley Fool premium analyst JP Bennett. JP Bennett: Thanks for having me, Dylan!  Lewis: Yeah, JP, what's up? I think this is the first time you've been on Industry Focus, right? Bennett: It definitely is. Lewis: For listeners who might not know JP, he works on The Motley Fool Options product with Jeff Fischer. I think it's fair to say that you're also known at HQ for having the wildest hair in the office. Bennett: [laughs] I think that would be a pretty fair assessment. Lewis: Do you want to describe the look you're working with right now? Bennett: Right now, it's bleached to be pretty close to white. It's getting a little bit long in the tooth, so I need to go in for a haircut, but we're just rolling with it for right now. Lewis: Do you get your haircuts done at HQ? Bennett: No, I do not. I have to go work with someone who I have a lot of trust in, because when you put that much bleach in your hair, you get very close to bleaching it to the point where it falls out. If you're off by just a couple of minutes, you could see me with very short hair the next time. Lewis: Listeners, if you want to check out JP's look, check out the videos we're going to post on fool.com. We always wind up breaking up our podcasts and posting them as videos and stand-alone articles. So, we're talking about options today. Today's discussion was really a product of some conversations that I had with listeners at our meetup in Austin during South by Southwest. Any time we meet up with listeners or people who are fans of the show and The Fool, I always like to ask them, "What do you like that we do? What aren't we covering enough that you're interested in?" And I had several people, I think John and Bruce, a couple guys to give shout-outs to, who had mentioned, "We'd love to hear more about options. It's something we would love a primer on, at least an introduction to." And it's something I don't know all that well, frankly. So, when you don't know something, you bring in someone smarter than you talk about it. Bennett: Well, that's debatable. Lewis: [laughs] So, today's episode, we'll do an Options 101 with Professor JP Bennett, and then we'll talk about some of the questions that we got on Twitter, because I put out a little call to see what people were thinking and what they were curious about when it came to options. To kick us off, what are options? Bennett: In a nutshell, options are what are referred to as derivative instruments. They derive their value based on something else. In this case, it's the underlying stock. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) options are going to have a value based on where the stock of Apple is trading at a given time. And although I think most listeners will know that there are a myriad of options strategies with crazy names and a bunch of different options positions, it might seem like there's so much to learn. But if you boil it down, there are really only two options you can use. There's calls and there's puts. Calls benefit when a stock rises. Puts benefit when a stock falls. And you can either buy or sell them. So, there's really only a couple of basics that you just have to master, and then the world opens up and you have a myriad of possibilities, in terms of strategies that you can do. Lewis: Yeah. And you get into that complexity when you start layering these different options together. So, how do they work, and what are the different elements that people need to focus on? Because, at the end of the day, these are really contracts, right? Bennett: Yes. They're derivative instruments, but they enable you to use leverage. Every options contract represents the right to control 100 shares of a given stock. One Apple call contract represents the right to buy 100 shares of Apple. So, they really have the potential to leverage your returns, or leverage your losses. So, when you're using strategies, you have to be mindful of that. So if you look at a hypothetical company, the stock is trading at $100, if you own a call with a strike price -- just to double back, a strike price is the price that is specific to the option that you either buy or sell, and that's the pivot point for where the value is derived. The stock is trading at $100, you buy a call contract with a strike price of $100, that means that you have the right to buy shares at the price of $100, regardless of where the stock is trading at expiration. The stock could double and be at $200 at expiration. You still get to buy shares for $100. So, that's where your profit comes from. If the stock is trading at $100 and you buy a call contract with the strike price of $90, then you get the right to buy those shares at $90. For every stock, there is specific expiration dates. Within that expiration date, there are a bunch of different strike prices. It will depend based on where the stock is trading, how liquid it is, and things like that. So, you can tailor the strategy to suit your needs. Lewis: If you're looking at a call option, and that is, if you're going to go long, the opportunity to buy a stock at a predetermined price, what you're really looking at here is the exercise price, the duration, and then the premium that you're paying for that contract. That's the fee that you're paying for the optionality. Bennett: If you want to get into the weeds in terms of how options are priced, there are really only a few matters that really determine the price. Like you said, the strike price in relation to the stock price. The implied volatility -- so, a stock that really doesn't do much, it just meanders along, the odds of it moving significantly from where it currently is is pretty low, so the premium that you just mentioned that you will have to pay for that isn't very high. You have to worry about the risk-free rate -- though, in current environments, you really don't have to, because it doesn't have much of an influence. And, you have to worry about how long the option will be alive for, so to speak, because they are instruments that have a finite life period. So, you can buy options for some stocks that expire at the end of the week. In some cases, you can buy ones that go out up to two years. So, there are just a few things that you really have to have a handle on to make sure. I don't really think we have time to get into the weeds in terms of pricing and determining whether or not you're getting a fair price. But, there are really only a few factors that you have to focus in on. Lewis: We talked about calls, do you want to talk a little bit about puts as well? Bennett: Yep. Puts. If you think about, specifically, put writing, that's actually one of our bread-and-butter strategies in Motley Fool Options. If you think about it, put writing, whereas calls benefit when the stock goes up, puts benefit when the stock goes down. So, if you're bearish on a stock, you could buy puts. But actually, what we prefer to do is sell puts. When you're selling a put, you're going to bring in that income. If you buy an option, you have to pay for that right to either sell shares at a given price or buy shares at a given price. When you sell an option, you're taking, essentially, the other side of that trade. So, you're being compensated for that. If you sell a call, you may have to sell shares at the strike price. Because we don't know where the stock is going to end up, you're going to get paid a premium for essentially taking on that risk. When you sell puts, you're basically saying, "Maybe the stock falls below the strike price. We don't really know, so I'm going to require you to pay me a premium in order for me to take on that risk from you." So, if you want to think about it, one of the best analogies is probably, you're an insurance company in this case, you don't really know what's going to happen, but you can help someone in terms of protecting them from a stock falling. In order to protect them, to provide that insurance, you have to be compensated. If you buy auto insurance, they don't just provide you that insurance for free, you have to pay them for them to be willing to take on that risk. So, basically, in the case of writing puts, you find stocks that you really like, you find a strike price that you're OK with buying shares at, and you make sure you're getting fairly compensated in terms of the premium that you'll collect. And you basically become the insurance company for the person who's taking the other side of that trade. Lewis: And the logic with that is, you would be buying these shares at a price that's lower than the current market value. So, because it's a company you like anyway, you're willing to, say, buy it at $90 three months from now, even though it's trading at only $100. Bennett: Yeah. Go back to Apple, it's around $140, it's like, "$135 is a great price for Apple. It's not there yet. I would buy it as soon as it hits that. But in the meantime, I'm going to collect some income by selling puts at that strike price. If it gets there, great, I'll get those shares. If not, at least I'll have generated some income while I'm waiting for that to happen." Lewis: What are some of the other really common option moves that you guys use in Motley Fool Options? Bennett: The two basics, put writing, we already touched on, and the other one that is normally a great strategy for beginners is covered calls. In a covered call, you already own the underlying stock. So, you own 100 shares of Apple, let's say. And you layer on top of that selling calls. So, Apple is trading around $140, you can potentially say, "Sell the $145 call." So, basically, what you're doing is increasing the income that you're going to generate from a given position. You're going to get the dividend from Apple, but in addition to that, you're also going to generate that option income. Now, the potential downfall of that is that you have to sell those shares at $145 if the stock ends above it and you don't do anything. Again, little side note, there are a bunch of different things you could do as you get close to the expiration if you don't want to sell shares. But that's the biggest risk of writing covered calls. So, one of the cornerstones of that is never write covered calls on stocks you don't want to sell, because eventually, you're going to end up in a position where the stock skyrockets, and you just sit there and you're like, "I should not have covered those shares." That extra $2 per share in income really doesn't offset the sting of a stock moving $15-$20 by the time expiration comes. Lewis: Yeah. And one thing that I think is probably worth clarifying for listeners is when options get exercised. I think that might be something that's a little bit confusing. It might be that you write puts and I take the other side of it, and I pay a premium for that. But, if the strike price doesn't wind up being somewhere that's opportune for me to exercise it, it will just wind up expiring, and I'll eat that premium. Bennett: Yeah. In most cases, the person that's taking the other side of the trade is a market maker. Think about Wall Street, he's one of those guys on Wall Street with his computer, he's basically hedging out a bunch of positions and doing stuff like that. In the vast majority of cases, you have to wait until you get really close to expiration for those options to be exercised, because an options premium is composed of two components. There is the intrinsic value, which is the discrepancy between the current stock price and the strike price. If you bought calls of Apple at $140 and it goes up to $145, you now have $5 of intrinsic value because you're essentially buying the stock at $5 below the current market price. The other component is the component that decays away over time, and that's what's referred to as time value. That is a function of some of the things we referred to in the past. That component kind of withers away. So, when you're selling options, that's the component you want to go away over time. If you have bought an option, it doesn't make sense to exercise it unless there really isn't all that much time value left. Now, there are certain instances, like I said. For every general rule of thumb, there are those exceptions. There's something referred to as dividend poaching, and things like that. But for the vast majority of cases, unless there's no time value left on the option, those options won't be exercised. So, one of the great things, here at The Motley Fool, we're long-term investors, we like to think in the long term. Because options are instruments that have a small lifespan, maybe three or four months, especially when you're writing puts, that's a sweet spot for where we're targeting, they can  [...] on value pretty significantly over that time. You sell the put option and the stock falls, the value may increased by a smaller percentage in terms of dollars -- so, the stock falls $1, maybe your puts only change by $0.50. But, in terms of percentages, the move is going to be a lot greater. So, you can see those fluctuating values and just think to yourself, "Oh my gosh, what did I get myself into?" But, you just have to sit pat and have that long-term, "Here's why I initially did the strategy, we're going to ride it out and wait and see and let that time out," because that time value component is going to fluctuate significantly. But over time, because, say you buy an option that expires in four months -- that's worth a lot more, because a lot more can happen in four months than if you bought an option that expires five days from now. The odds of the stock moving over the course of three or four months is a lot higher than over the course of five days. So, the time value, all things equal, ceteris paribus, the option that expires in three or four months from now is going to have a lot more time value than the one that expires in five days. Lewis: You touched on downside a little bit. One of the reasons we started talking about options on the show is that a lot of people had been looking at Snapchat and saying, "This is a company that a lot of people are bearish on, should I short it?" And we had introduced the idea that, I'm generally against shorting because it opens you up to a ton of downside risk. And you'll see people use options as a limited-downside way to do some of the similar types of betting against a stock.  Bennett: Yeah, but there's no risk-free lunch. There are definitely things to consider when you're using it to make a bearish bet. In the case of Snapchat, what I would suspect in terms of the option premiums, especially for the puts, if there are a lot of bearish investors and they don't want to short, they want to play through options, those puts are going to cost a pretty penny. One example that is so crystal clear in my mind because it was one of the first instances of seeing how options can be influenced by short interest and what's happening in a stock is to go back in the early days of Tesla, when it was $15-$30. What you saw, even back then, there were a ton of people that said, "This stock is worthless, they're not going to do it." So, there was a really high short interest. Essentially, the cost to borrow, you have to pay a fee to borrow those shares to sell them on the market and short -- that was becoming pretty prohibitive, in terms of your potential return, because you're paying that fee. So, what a lot of people did it is, they shifted over into the options market, and were using options to make bearish bets against Tesla. Now, what ended up happening was, because so many people were doing that, basically, the premiums got skewed so heavily that the normal rules or things you see happening in the options market in terms of pricing just got thrown completely out of whack, and it really wasn't even that attractive to go bearish. It was actually really attractive to go long Tesla stock through options, because those puts cost so much money because it's something that everybody wanted to do. So, that's something that, you can use it to make bearish bets on companies, but if it's a really crowded trade, you also have to be very mindful, you have to be extremely mindful of how much you're paying or how much you're collecting. Lewis: Yeah, I think the important thing to remember is, like other financial instruments, there is the intrinsic value side of things, but there's also the market sentiment that plays a role in the price that you're paying for it. Bennett:Yeah. Options, just like with investing, they are tools that can be used to create a lot of good, but they can also be used as tool of weapons of mass destruction, and completely destroy your portfolio. But, because they are leveraged instruments, you can do an extremely short order. Lewis: I think that might be a good segue into my next question. What are some other things people should know about options? Or, maybe some misconceptions about them? Or, before you do anything with options, please know this? Bennett: Before you do anything with options, you really have to get a hang of the lingo, what goes into a strategy, the payoffs for particular strategies, and really what's at stake. Yes, it is investing. Yes, the underlying instrument is the stock. But, there are definitely noticeable differences, in terms of buying to open, writing contracts, the lingo, how things behave over time based on what the stock is doing. If you don't go into it having a pretty good grasp of that, you can get overwhelmed pretty quickly. Getting a good knowledge base -- for Options, the service that I work on, we have what is called Options U, Options University. We always tell members, "Go through the educational material first. Make sure you're extremely comfortable with everything. Potentially even open up a paper trading account just to get familiar with how everything works. Move extremely slowly, and make sure you're extremely comfortable with what you're doing before you do anything." The next thing is something we've touched on a couple times. Never forget that these are leveraged instruments, in terms of, you're buying it, or potentially selling 100 shares of stock. You can think of it and go, "Man, I'm selling these puts, I'm generating $1 per share, that's 100 shares per contract, that's nice, but this stock isn't going to fall that far. These puts are way out in the money, so let me sell 15." So, instead of dealing with 100 shares, you're now dealing with 1,500. The risk there, depending on how high the stock is, currently, that's a pretty significant chunk of change that you may have to be on the hook for, because anything can and will happen in the financial markets. So, always stay humble and never get greedy. We prefer to sell options more than we buy them. We can get into why we do that a little bit more. But, because of that, like I said, we're the insurance company, we're taking the other side of that trade. And although it works out more often than not, you're generating a lot of income, and it can become pretty easy if you're not disciplined to say, "Man, the last 10 trades I did worked out great. I am a genius at this," and then you go, "I'm going to slowly increase the number of contracts I write over time," and before you know it, you're in over your head, and then maybe the market falls, or one or two of the stocks you were using options on tank. Then you're just up the creek without a paddle. Lewis: Yeah. I think a lot about the 13 steps to investing that we have on fool.com. That's the intro to buying stocks and things like that. One of the pieces of advice early on is to buy your first stock, just buy one share. Buy a really small position, maybe just one share, and follow it for a little while and see what happens, and understand what makes stocks move, what people are looking for in that company, and then take larger and larger bites as you become more familiar. It sounds like your advice for dipping your toe into options is exactly the same. Bennett: Oh, yeah, definitely. Lewis: Since I knew we were going to be talking about options, I put out a call on Twitter to see what questions people had. JP, we talked intro stuff, and I get the sense, even having this conversation, we talked about the jargon and the terminology and how it can be kind of tough to get used to, it might be a lot to throw at listeners. And we do have some resources on fool.com that people can check out. If you write into the show, I'm happy to send them along to you. But, let's get over to a couple things that people shot over to us on Twitter. I think it highlights how people are thinking about it, and some of the early questions that people have when it comes to investing in options. Jako asks, "Explain if/how options trading is different from gambling, please." Bennett: Great question. It's definitely something that, I believe it's kind of like a misnomer with options. People tend to think these are instruments that people who are in the markets, who are in Wall Street, or whatever, can use to create a lot of wealth, but anybody else who tries to use them is going to get hosed, or, even people who use them on Wall Street get into a lot of trouble. But it basically is just like with investing. With stocks, I believe the biggest advantage that individual investors have is their time horizon. You can try to day trade, but you give up a lot of that advantage, and really, it's going to hurt you over the long run. It's the same thing with options. You can create strategies, or basically try and trade, in a way that is very similar to gambling. If you get a home run in one of your first couple strategies, you're really set, but otherwise you're going to end up with no money. Or, you can do what we do. In Options, we target consistent winners, basically creating a diversified portfolio of options strategies to generate income and long-term capital gains, and do it in a much safer, low-risk manner. Basically, we do that in terms of how we structure our trades, what types of trades we favor, the strike prices we use, expiration dates, how much we pay. If you basically go -- I'm just looking at it right now -- our updated accuracy list for all of our close positions, we have co-advisors Jeff Fischer and Jim Gillies. For Jeff Fischer, he has a 94.6% success rate in terms of all of those strategies finish generating positive returns. For Jim Gillies, it's 87.9%. So, more often than not, we're making money on an options strategy. If you know a casino where you can go to where you can gamble and achieve those success rates, please fill me in, because I would love to go there and make a lot of money and retire early. Lewis: That's an excellent point. The house has a much steeper advantage when it comes to gambling. Bennett: I would also add -- what you said just triggered it for me -- basically, with options, you can set it up so that you are betting against the house or that you are the house. We like to set it up so that we are the house, so we are winning more than we're losing. Lewis: It's always better to be the house. We also got a couple questions from Patrick. "In what situation, if ever, would you have a call option and a put option on the same stock?" This might be more of an advanced option concept that we're going to touch on here? Bennett: There are straddles, there's strangles, there's a bunch of different strategies -- Lewis: More of that jargon. [laughs]  Bennett: -- iron condors, there's a bunch of different strategies that could utilize that. Basically, thinking about those strategies, if you're buying them, you probably want to have the stock move significantly. If you think about a straddle or strangle, you're basically using puts and calls that are relatively close together -- they're either the same strike price, or maybe they're off by $5. So what you want to happen is, if you're long those, you want the stock to move really sharply in either direction so that one is going to end up worthless but the other is going to end up with a lot of money. So, you go into earnings, you buy the puts, you buy the calls, the stock spikes hard, the puts end up worthless because they're out of the money, but the calls end up with a lot of value, so you make a lot of money that way. Or, you can do the opposite. A strategy that we've used, I think we have one or two that are currently active, and we actually have one that is active on the other service I work for, Motley Fool Pro. Basically, what it's referred to is a covered straddle. Basically, what you're doing there is instead of buying those options and hoping or praying that the stock is going to move a ton, basically, we have stocks that we think are relatively steady, so we're looking to double our income. We own those shares, we own 100 shares, and then we're also setting up a covered call by selling calls against that, but we're also selling puts. We're also saying, "We'd like to buy more shares if it falls; if not, we're going to generate extra income." So, that can be an example of, potentially, a higher success rate strategy, in my opinion. Lewis: The thought there is, you're betting that it's going to stay within a pretty tight band over the course of the contracts. Bennett: Yes. And if it moves sharply in either direction, we're OK with that. Lewis: Another question Patrick had, "Are there different fundamentals to look at when considering buying a long option versus buying a stock? Or, maybe, when should I buy both?" Bennett: This tees up one of the cornerstones of how we invest using options. We basically repeat it until we're blue in the face whenever we have live chats and meet members that are considering joining Options or something along those lines. We are investors first, and we look at the businesses, we study the businesses, we come up with what we think the stock is worth, our estimate of what the intrinsic value of the underlying stock is. And only after we have a stock that we really like, we feel comfortable with understanding what the future holds for the business and what the value of the stock is, then do we look to see if the options market is providing us with a strategy that we can utilize. We don't let the tail wag the dog in terms of, "Those puts look really good, I'm going to look at the stock, but my mind is already made up. The company could be completely garbage, but those puts pay so good, I'm just going to write them anyway, fingers crossed." We never do that. It's always, business first, options strategy second. That's basically, the reader there is hitting the nail on the head is look at the business, find businesses and stocks that you like. Then look to see if you have an options strategy. Lewis: He gets at, in the second half of that, "When should I do both?" You were talking about several strategies before where you own the stock, and then you're also, possibly, buying long options, or using instruments based on where you think the stock price might be going in the next couple months or years. Bennett: Yeah. If you're really bullish on a stock, you can basically set up options strategies that have leverage upside. Going back to a strategy that is still ongoing but pretty close to being set in stone is, we have what's referred to as a bull call spread on Apple. We set it up last year, when we were having the market sell off and everybody was panicking. Basically, we bought calls that strike at $85, and we sold calls that strike at $90. There's a $5 increment there, which means the max payout is $5. If the stock ends above $90, the calls that you own at $85 end up being worth $5 more than the calls that you sold. So, that's what you're going to make. And we basically paid a little bit under $2.50 for that right. So, basically, there's an opportunity to double your money as long as the stock finishes above $90. And with the stock at $140, even though you would have done really well if you'd just bought shares, the return that we were able to generate using that strategy is obviously much higher. Lewis: And that's where leverage comes into play. Bennett: Bingo. Lewis: The last question that Patrick had was, "I'm near the expiration of the option. Do I think about it differently if it's in the money versus out of the money?" This is something we touched on a little bit in the first half of the show. Bennett: Yeah. When you get close to expiration, depending on the strategy and what your plans are going for, you do have to think about it a little bit differently. When we set up strategies like I referred to earlier, we just let them mature and see what happens in the market. But then, when you get close to expiration, if it's out of the money or in the money and what you need to do will, again, depend on the strategy and what's likely to happen over that couple of days. So, let's say you wrote puts and they end up out of the money, and you get close to expiration. You don't have to do anything. They're going to end without any value, so your best bet there, or, your appropriate course of action to minimize transaction cost and things like that is to do nothing, because after expiration Friday, your broker is going to come in and wipe those obligations from your account, and you're free to write more puts in the following day. If they're in the money and you want to take shares, don't do anything, your broker will automatically put those shares into your account and take out the cash needed to buy those shares. On the flip side, if you have covered calls, if they're out of the money, don't do anything, they're going to expire worthless. If you're in the money and you want to sell shares, don't do anything, your broker is going to do it for you automatically. The differences come into play when you don't want that outcome. Even though, with puts, let's say you want to buy the shares at that given strike price, there could be instances where you want to do what is referred to as rolling the contracts. So, you'll buy back the contracts that you sold in the past, and you'll sell new ones. Maybe you sold April contracts. You can buy those back as you get close to expiration, and write ones for July or something along those lines. Same thing with calls. Basically, the nuts and bolts of it -- and I did a lot of rambling there -- is that it depends. More often than not, when you're asking a basic question with options, that's the appropriate answer. It's a lot easier when you have specific strategies and things like that to go through what you need to think about and do. Lewis: But if you're working with some of the simple options strategies, then more often than not, the broker is going to automatically handle things in the background for you. Bennett: There are certain instances where you're doing something that, just because of technicalities, the broker won't recognize, so you have to either call them up or take action ahead of time. But as long as the option is $0.01 in the money, the broker is going to automatically exercise it for you. Unless, if you have call contracts and they're worth one penny, you can call them up and say, "Dude, don't do it for me, it's not worth it." Otherwise, they're just going to do it. Whether or not you want that to happen is an entirely different matter. Lewis: One other thing I think is probably worth touching on with options and your brokerage is, this is something you need to opt into and apply to with pretty much all brokerages. If this conversation is something that piqued your interest and you want to learn more, please read up first. But if you want to go about possibly trading options down the road, it's not as simple as logging into your brokerage and going to the options center and making things happen, right? Bennett: Right. Again, this gets back to something we touched on multiple times. These are instruments that have leverage. The broker, because of self-interest, they just don't want to let anyone trade options. And also because of rules and laws and things like that. But, if you don't have the knowledge, you can do a lot of harm really quickly, and not really even understand it. So, basically, yeah, there is an application process that you have to go through. Nine times out of ten, depending on your broker, it's relatively basic and straightforward. Basically, what they're trying to get a feel for is, have you traded options before, how much do you know about options, how big is your account? If your account is really small, the damage that you can do is exponentially larger than someone who has a much larger account than you. Basically, after they get a feel for those types of things, there are different permission levels. I think it's foolish that there isn't a standardized permission level hierarchy. Some have levels one through three, some have zero through four, some have one through four. Basically, the higher up you go, the more permission you have. Level one, you're looking at stuff like covered calls, because there isn't a whole lot of damage you can do there. You can't write more calls than shares you already own. If the stock falls, you already own the stock, so there's not much damage there. You're not on the hook to buy shares, and you don't have the cash. But, the higher up in the permissions that you get, the more strategies you can get, and also, the more danger you can get yourself into. So, before they give you those keys, they want to be comfortable that you're not going to, in the first month of receiving permission, go out and basically blow up your account and make them have to close it.  But, one important thing to remember is, we often see this with members who join Options, is some brokers have our favorite strategies a little bit higher up on the hierarchy, and some members are frustrated, because they can only follow some of our recommendations, and they want to follow all of them. That probably isn't the best thing to do if you're just getting started. But, the thing to keep in mind here is, you can always go back and apply for a higher permission level. If you only get level one permission, do a couple trades, demonstrate to them that you know what you're doing, and then go back and ask for a higher permission level. It's very likely that you will receive it. There are very few cases where they won't. But, making sure that you don't get frustrated, and stick with it. Also, because there's a high learning curve, it's not the worst thing in the world, right? Lewis: Yeah, it's something that saves you from yourself. Bennett: Right? The way I like to think of it is, kind of like if there's an S curve with options. You learn about the extreme basics, and it's like, "There's only two options, you can only buy or sell, that's easy." And then you start studying and you realize, there's a lot here, and it can be pretty quick to get overwhelming. But if you stick with it, there's just this point where it clicks. And once you get a couple basic concepts down pat, the rest of it is smooth sailing. Lewis: Anything else before I let you go, JP? I know we already threw a lot at listeners. We probably might be setting ourselves up for a follow-up show at some point down the road. Bennett: I think that would be great, if members have a lot of good questions and stuff like that. Should I give a plug to Motley Fool Options, to join our service? Lewis: [laughs] I got you to talk about options for half an hour, I think you deserve the chance to plug that. Bennett: Go back, 94.6% and 87.9% for closed positions, that's a pretty good accuracy rating. But I would also encourage listeners, if you're interested in it, learn more. It really does open up a wealth of possibilities, in terms of generating extra income, which is great in this low-yield environment, putting up strategies that can benefit from upside to a much greater extent than the stock itself, maybe protect you in terms of, you can set up market hedges and things like that. There are a myriad of possibilities, and if utilized correctly, options are a great instrument to enhance your portfolio. But then, to go back, the closing point is that, for most investors, for a large percentage of investors, the options should only ever be a complement to a core long stock portfolio, because buying shares of great stocks and holding them for a really long time, that is not only tax beneficial, because you're deferring those taxes until you sell those shares, but it's really a way to generate most of your wealth, because these strategies are expiring at a much faster clip, so you're paying short-term capital gains. And even if you're paying long-term capital gains, the furthest you can delay them is two years. So, options can be fun, they can be cool, they can be enticing, alluring, use whatever word you want. Lewis: They're sexy. Bennett: Yeah, they're sexy. But, never forget to buy shares of great companies. Lewis: I think that's a great thing to end on there.

Here’s what we wrote at that time: The lines are merging … Apple, Inc, a Silicon Valley hot-shot once focused on personal computing and more recently focused on the software and features that power its army of next-generation, mobile computing devices, is becoming a media company … with a global reach. A company that will -under the leadership and direction of CEO Tim Cook– fully embrace the glittering lights of Hollywood, and the magicians and celebrities that power it, in the hopes of forging an “exclusive” members-only club built on the culture it feeds. … and further evidence of this can be seen in Apple’s recent roping in of the entire Cyrus family for an exclusive, members-only episode of Carpool Karaoke: The Series.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple Inc.'s Touch ID Troubles Another analyst thinks that Apple's innovative new in-screen Touch ID tech isn't ready for prime time. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 17, 2017 at 5:30PM Analyst Andy Hargreaves with Pacific Crest, in a research note obtained by MacRumors, offered some commentary with respect to the Touch ID situation for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming iPhone. As readers may be aware, Apple's iPhone 8 is widely expected to have a Touch ID sensor embedded underneath the display itself, rather than underneath a dedicated home button. Readers may also be aware that rumors continually swirl about Apple potentially facing serious difficulties in getting this technology into volume manufacturing. Image source: Apple. Let's look at what Hargreaves had to say. A tale of two options Hargreaves says that Apple "continues to work on solving its optical fingerprint issues." If Apple can work out the kinks "in the next month or so," the analyst says, then Apple "would likely place volume orders at that point." He does note that even if Apple does get it all sorted out within the next month, this would still necessitate a "delay of the OLED iPhone launch." The silver lining, according to Hargreaves, is that such a delay wouldn't "meaningfully affect volume [shipments] for the [product] cycle." However, if it can't get these issues worked out, then "Apple may be forced to eliminate fingerprint sensing from the OLED iPhone altogether." Goodbye, Touch ID. Hello, 3D sensing? In the case that Apple does, in fact, eliminate Touch ID from the OLED-based iPhone 8, Hargreaves argues that the rumored 3D sensing functionality that's expected to be coming to this device could serve as a "viable and innovative replacement for the highly popular fingerprint sensor." Indeed, Hargreaves says, citing "suppliers," that the 3D sensing technology "is both fast and highly reliable, even in low-light scenarios or from odd angles." Foolish take To be blunt, I'm not convinced that this potential 3D sensing technology can really serve as a general-purpose replacement for Touch ID. For example, Hargreaves says that the 3D sensing tech works well in low light, which is certainly nice, but what about situations in which there's practically no light? Can the 3D sensing solution remain "fast and highly reliable" even in that case? Even if Apple were to solve that problem, there's still the huge issue of convenience, particularly vis-a-vis Apple Pay (a point that Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri briefly mentioned in his own note discussing Apple's Touch ID woes). Today, Apple Pay works by having the user hold her or his phone up to the reader and then touching the fingerprint sensor. It's simple and convenient, which is probably one of the major reasons that Apple Pay continues to gain traction. How would customers use Apple Pay using the 3D sensor? Would a user need to explicitly load the Apple Pay application, stick his or her face in front of the front-facing camera, and then once the image is captured, move the phone near the reader? This sounds much less convenient and, frankly, probably more annoying than just pulling out a credit card and swiping it or sticking it in a chip reader and signing the screen. In my view, Apple must include Touch ID on the OLED iPhone, especially if the "standard" iPhone 7s and 7s Plus include it (lack of Touch ID could drive potential iPhone 8 customers to buy a cheaper iPhone 7s or 7s Plus instead). At this point, I'm hopeful that Apple figures out the issues with its in-screen Touch ID solution, but if it can't get it to work in time, I'll be interested to see what Apple ultimately ships.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The drawing is impressive, depicting an iPhone front dominated by screen with just 4mm of bezels on every side. However, the original sourcing is unclear and the details are pretty questionable … The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here The leak originates from iFanr.com, which does not have a history of Apple rumors, so this is definitely on the sketchy end of the scale. Very similar mockups were made late last week supposedly based on a Foxconn leak. These new drawings appear to based on the same source, although the depiction is slightly different. Today’s leak claims that the iPhone 8 will have a full-frame screen with rounded corners and almost no bezel on all four sides. The drawing is annotated and indicates that the surround bezels are only 4mm on each side. Whilst this alone would be somewhat believable, the drawings suggest that Apple will be able to integrate all of the other front-facing components underneath the display. This means the fingerprint sensor home button, the selfie/FaceTime front camera, the 3D depth sensors and the top phone speaker would all be magically hidden beneath the OLED display. In particular, it suggests that Apple will cut-out a small hole in the top of the screen to contain the top speaker. There are big doubts about how practical this is and whether it’s even possible. Apple has been rumored to be struggling to integrate just the fingerprint sensor below the screen, claiming that the company will be able to do that for all of the major components is hard to believe. The most notable photo in this latest set is the first one that includes measurements of various components on the chassis front. These dimensions do not match what we have seen previously either. The technical sketch also gives a glimpse as to the layout of the components that are supposedly beneath the display; the 3D infrared sensor, the FaceTime camera and the speaker. Although most of the interesting stuff in this supposed leak is on the front side, it’s worth noting that the back design is also different from other schematics we’ve seen. There’s no rear Touch ID (which would make sense if it’s integrated into the display) for a start. Also, the camera flash is in a different position in the vertical-stack. The previous leak put the flash at the bottom of the vertical dual-camera system whereas in this leak, the flash sits between the two irises. Apparently, this enables both cameras to support optical image stabilization — on the iPhone 7 Plus, only the wide angle lens has OIS. A couple more 3D renderings reveal symmetric antenna lines in each corner. There have been murmurings about Apple readying multiple final designs for the iPhone 8, as the company seemingly struggles with placing the fingerprint sensor underneath the display. In that case, it would follow that this leaked design is the ambitious prototype where everything but the screen is hidden. Even so, making a cutout in the OLED panel to accommodate the speaker is a big stretch. Take this report with much skepticism for the time being. If this all comes true, the iPhone 8 will be a very impressive device. iFanr made a physical mockup of what the phone will look like and the full-frame appearance is striking … Apple will officially unveil the iPhone 8 at a media event in the fall. It is also expected to announce minor revisions (dubbed ‘iPhone 7s’) to the existing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus form factors, with wireless charging and internal spec bumps.

Account switching makes a lot of sense for a shared device like the Apple TV, but users have wanted this feature on iOS for a while too. Would Apple ship account switching with tvOS and exclude the feature from iOS? Sony A6500 While the rumor that tvOS 11 will add account switching to Apple TV is unverified at this point, it’s a logical feature addition and hardly farfetched. Right now each Apple TV is tied to a specific Apple ID for Apple Music and Photos. iTunes Movies and TV Shows support accessing shared purchases through Family Sharing, but even that feature requires a lot of navigation. The rumored account switching feature would allow different users to access their own Apple Music libraries, iCloud Photo Libraries, and maybe even Home screen layouts. I could see this potential feature working with Apple’s new TV app and even iCloud game saves eventually. iOS 11 concept shows highly requested account switching feature on iPad But would Apple really ship tvOS 11 with account switching and not make the feature for iOS 11 too? The Mac has had account switching for ages; the feature could further close the gap between macOS and iOS. Apple could resist bringing account switching to iOS because iPhones and iPads are ‘personal’ devices and not shared boxes like the Apple TV, but you could argue every computer above the Apple Watch can be shared in some environment. I would love to have a family iPad to share around the house between me, my wife, and my kid. That could certainly hurt device sales versus one device per person, but the flexibility could encourage device sales in families that otherwise wouldn’t consider purchasing an iPad. I imagine this would work itself out. It’s harder to make a case for account switching on iPhone, but iOS is certainly in need of a guest mode. Currently you can’t easily share your iPhone with someone who needs to make a phone call or do a quick Google search without giving them full access. You could argue that storage has been a constraint on iOS that hasn’t been a problem on the Mac, but new iPhones and iPads ship with 32GB (like Apple TV) to 256GB so that’s no longer a major issue. Streaming is also popular now for music, photo, and video access. Apple has also been changing its playbook recently when it comes to projects like the iPad (see the new $329 model for example) so the argument internally against shared accounts a few years ago may not hold up anymore. Even if tvOS 11 doesn’t ship with a new account switching feature, we’ve certainly been teased by the multi-user feature on Apple’s Classroom app for iPad. Even on iPhone, the new security and account management section in the Settings app on iOS 10.3 looks like the groundwork for account switching for the optimistic. I’m less inclined to think we’ll see account switching on iPhone anytime soon, however, and figure we would see a model that looks more like the Mac where you choose users from the lock screen. Another scenario is that multiple user accounts on tvOS is the groundwork for user profiles on the rumored Siri Speaker. We haven’t heard much about Apple’s Amazon Echo/Google Home competitor lately, but it was reported last year that Apple was considering facial recognition features that allowed account switching from the rumored device. Now facial recognition is most frequently mentioned as a rumored iPhone 8 feature that we could see later this year. The last possibility is that Apple is simply addressing the problem of not being able to personalize the Apple TV experience for iCloud Music Library and iCloud Photo Library in the living room. In that case, account switching could be only intended for tvOS and not make it to iOS anytime soon (or that rumored Siri Speaker). Fingers crossed that this rumor pans out for tvOS 11 and makes its way to iOS 11 for iPad as well.

At the lower end of the pricing scale, the company suggests Woven Nylon and Sport Bands for the Apple Watch, each starting at $49, while wireless headphones fill out the middle ground at prices starting from $149. Last year, Apple also ran a special Mother’s Day ad as part of its Shot on iPhone series. Apple does seem to be avoiding the sexist trap into which some companies fall.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS US Edition Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 LG G6 Project Scorpio Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus VPN News Here's more evidence the iPhone 8 will be all screen Here's more evidence the iPhone 8 will be all screen By David Nield Mobile phones   Bezels begone Shares With (presumably) only five months to go until the big reveal, the rumors and speculation about this year's iPhones are ramping up nicely. Now we have more evidence that at least one of the models unveiled by Apple in September will just about completely do away with the bezels on the front of the device. When we say "evidence", it might not hold up in court, but the Chinese Weibo tipster who shared these images has got something of a track record for Apple kit. Plus, the design of the phone in these pictures lines up neatly with previous leaks we've seen recently. The leaked sketch and rendering show a device that's 137.4mm tall and 67.54mm, making it an almost exact fit with the dimensions of the iPhone 7. As many earlier rumors have suggested, the home button, complete with Touch ID, is going to sit below the glass. Or is it? One or two whispers have suggested that Apple can't figure out how to embed the necessary fingerprint smarts under an all-glass front screen, which means the Touch ID button would have to get moved to the rear. Maybe not even Apple knows at this point. The images also show a vertical dual-lens camera, which we've heard about before - apparently it's going to power some interesting 3D and augmented reality effects on the next premium-level iPhone. There's still a lot we don't know though, not least exactly how many different models Apple is planning to unveil. It's worth reiterating that these pictures may not come directly from Apple - plenty of designers are having a go at iPhone 8 mock-ups right now - but we think the track record of the source and the similarity with other rumors makes these images worth taking note of.

Remember Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML) from the 1990s? I do. Well, maybe some of the younger readers won’t. VRML was way ahead of its time. But now pure VR is in vogue. What happened along the way? This article at Motherboard tells the story. “VR Was the ‘Next Big Thing’ 20 Years Ago. What’s Different Now?” Plus, from the next article, comes a new concept (for me anyway). Diminished realty. Augmented reality, virtual reality and mixed reality are three realities that exist on the reality-virtuality continuum—and they are probably the three terms you have heard again and again.  However, there is a fourth reality you probably haven’t heard of—diminished reality. For the details, see: “New opportunities for augmented reality.” Moving on…. Over at 9to5Mac Zac Hall lays it out: “WWDC Wishlist: How Apple TV could improve with tvOS 11 this year.” He covers it all, and there’s more opportunity for tvOS than you may have thought about. A good read. Human beings just aren’t designed for boring, repetitive, strenuous jobs. But we’ve pressed them into service for that kind thing for centuries because there was no other recourse. So when you see videos like this, you may think, robots will put us all out of work!  But that’s also a good thing. Humans should be freed up to do much more interesting, creative things. That’s what my wife tells her college students. (Some aren’t yet listening.) Anyway, for a tasty, intriguing video (reminiscent of an ant farm), see: “Good news: the robot that takes your job might be cute enough to go viral.” Next. We haven’t heard much about Apple’s car project. The wind seemed to go out of those sails when we learned that Apple likely wouldn’t elect to go toe-to-toe with Tesla. Instead, Apple may be looking at designing the software for an autonomous system, a system that Apple would market to other car companies. Personally, I don’t think that’s going to work out because car companies want ownership/control and transparency into this kind of software. Even so, Apple seems to be moving forward. “Apple Receives Permit From California DMV to Test Self-Driving Cars.” We often hear about how Apple may have peaked. Claims are made that Apple is now substituting extracted revenue for innovation. In any case, companies struggle to become large and powerful—at which point a whole new set of problems arise. Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, is aware of that. Here’s how he intends to avoid the fate of a big company gone wrong. “This is the Jeff Bezos playbook for preventing Amazon’s demise.” As an exercise, read the article a second time and replace “Amazon” with “Apple.” See how it works. Finally, remember when Google was going to scan every book in print and make them all available on the Internet? The project was Google Book Search. Backchannel tells the story about lawsuits stalled Google’s early efforts. Fifteen years later, the momentum and passion is gone. Google Book Search is amazing that way. When it started almost 15 years ago, it also seemed impossibly ambitious: An upstart tech company that had just tamed and organized the vast informational jungle of the web would now extend the reach of its search box into the offline world. By scanning millions of printed books from the libraries with which it partnered, it would import the entire body of pre-internet writing into its database. The article goes on to explain how this project foundered a bit. Yet the Books fight was never as central to Google’s corporate being as that kind of all-consuming conflict. And it wasn’t all a waste, either. It taught Google something valuable. It’s easy in this age of the fiber Internet, exabyte storage, and supercomputers to conceive of grand plans. But whether a tech giant can stay with the vision, retain its key people, deal with legalities, implement the plan soundly, scale it, and extract long term value, before the technology landscape changes, is another thing altogether. This article is an excellent case in point. ______________________ Particle Debris is a generally a mix of John Martellaro’s observations and opinions about a standout event or article of the week (preamble on page one) followed on page two by a discussion of articles that didn’t make the tmo headlines, the technical news debris.

April 15, 2017 at 2:50 EDT PM Jack Smith April 16, 2017 Not sure if Apple can easily turn it around in K-12. I see articles like this almost every morning. “On Monday, the Hastings Board of Education is set to approve the purchase of 1,200 Chromebooks to replace the aging computers at the high school.” “At that time, the district opted for Macbook Air laptops as they were the best option on the market for the high school.” But I think this should really had Cook getting it a long time ago. “At Apple CEO Tim Cook’s old high school, they are selling their MacBooks to buy Chromebooks” This was last year and little has changed. We have always been an Apple hardware house and Windows strictly for gaming. I have a HUGE family and for the last 2 years been replacing the kids Macs with Chromebooks. They are just a better solution, IMO. Apple dropped the ball. Our schools were all Apple hardware. Over the last holidays the last Macs were replaced with Chromebases. A room full of iMacs in the Library for whatever they now call AR. There is confusion that Chromebooks take from Windows and that is just incorrect in many situations. Chromebooks take far more from Macs, IMO. April 16, 2017 at 8:59 EDT AM wab95 April 16, 2017 John: A quick word about Dieter Bohn’s excellent piece in the The Verge, and the improvement of the iOS platform specifically. I think, based on numerous comments and criticisms over the years, including yours, combined with my own user experience, that there are two modifications that Apple could make to iOS, at least on the iPad, that would take it to the next level and effectively compete with traditional PCs, not to mention Google Chromebooks and MS Windows 10 Cloud. First, as Bohn points out, is multi-user capability, with true user-specific configurability as one sees on the Mac (and most PCs). My technical ignorance of what is required to solve this problem biases me to likely under-estimate the challenges involved with an iOS device, however it would seem that this is something that could be solved by Apple leveraging their cloud computional investment, in which a user’s configuration is stored in the cloud and then they simply log into their iCloud account and access that configuration, which is then loaded onto the device, piecemeal as needed for speed of getting started. Not unlike one’s music account, which is in the cloud and only those elements that you specify are loaded onto the hardware. Given that Apple’s work suite is now cloud-centric, I don’t see why this should be such a big technological leap, but that is the blissful status of ignorance. Perhaps Apple could weigh in on this topic with one of their iPad infomercial pieces and explain. Better still, hopefully they are assiduously working in the background to ‘make it so’. Second, would be to have multiple working windows open in the iPad, not unlike macOS. Again, my ignorance is likely unmasked by asking, why could this not work the way it does with the video screens on the iPad Pro, be it a Skype teleconference, a movie from iTunes or Netflix, in which one can shrink the size of the screen and literally move it around with a flick of the finger. With a tap of the finger or pencil or even with a keyboard command, a window could be brought forward and perhaps auto-enlarge. This would improve, in my view, the multi-tasking experience on the iPad, even if there were an upper bound to the number of apps that could be windowed at a time. This, to me, seems as soluble a problem as was the earlier challenge of video housed on a Unix platform that many argued could never solved. Until Apple solved it. I think that these two modifications alone to the iOS platform, at least on the iPad or even if confined to the iPad Pro, would make a substantial difference in the popular perception of the iPad’s readiness to assume the PC mantle. I would argue that both features should be available on any iPad, Pro or otherwise, if the iPad is to rule the school. On another note, I was tempted to comment on your ‘Apple should build family service robots’ piece the other day, but time did not permit. As I have commented on this multiple times before, I will simply refer the comment I posted on this topic 20 months ago https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/why-apple-should-be-more-interested-in-robots and say ‘ditto’.

"Apple will be around a long time, like IBM," Wozniak said in an interview Friday, as cited by USA Today. "Look at Apple's cash. It can invest in anything. It would be ridiculous to not expect them to be around. The same goes for Google and Facebook." Wozniak previously made a bold prediction regarding the emergence of laptop computers way back in 1982, so he has already shown somewhat of a knack for divination. In relation to Apple, he’s backing the tech giant to succeed in the field of self-driving cars. "Apple is such a large company it has to go after big markets," Wozniak told NBC on Monday. "And self-driving cars is one that we're all reading about every day...So I'm hoping Apple goes the same way with autonomous cars." Apple iPhone 8/X launch may be delayed as OLED fingerprint tech proves difficult to crack https://t.co/dOD7epRBsP— RT (@RT_com) April 17, 2017 He has now made several other bold claims which, given his track record, people might want to pay attention to. Wozniak claims the cities of the future will be designed and built from scratch in the desert, affording humanity a fresh start when it comes to urban planning, architecture and engineering. While he believes this will overcome housing issues around the world, he does unfortunately predict that we’ll be living in biodomes and will need wearable suits to venture outside. Read more Enter the Matrix: 'Humans are transforming into a new technological species' However, Wozniak’s vision of these futuristic cities also incorporates a lot of artificial intelligence technology embedded into everyday life: from self-driving cars to smart walls and medical devices that will self-diagnose and treat patients without necessarily needing a second opinion from a human doctor. "The question will be ethical, on whether we can eliminate the need for physicians," he says. This marks a huge turnaround from his previous apocalyptic predictions of humanity’s pursuit of artificial intelligence. "Computers are going to take over from humans, no question," Wozniak previously told the Australian Financial Review. Much like fellow tech pioneers Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, Wozniak also believes a colony on Mars is inevitable, though not quite as many others might have envisioned. In Wozniak’s 2075, the entire planet of Earth will be rezoned for residential use while Mars will be primarily used for heavy industry. We needn’t worry about bothering the locals, or any other extraterrestrials for that matter, as Wozniak doesn’t have “high hopes” that we’ll make first contact anytime soon. That said, he does give humanity a “random chance” of making contact with aliens. The Silicon Valley Comic Con, which Wozniak also helped found last year, combines the worlds of science fiction, pop culture and modern day technology to explore how they intersect and what humanity can expect in the coming years. The event will take place between Friday, April 21 and Sunday, April 23, at the San Jose Convention Center in San Jose, California. The cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation will stage a reunion at the event and will be joined by guests William Shatner, Adam West and former astronaut and space pioneer Buzz Aldrin. Gary Fisher, loyal friend to beloved actress and Star Wars icon Carrie Fisher, is also scheduled to make an appearance at the event. Pardon the interrufftion: Gary Fisher will be taking photos from 2:15 - 2:45pm on Saturday, April 22! 😍🐶 https://t.co/0rymQIh3Kcpic.twitter.com/xZwBw7rGVy— SVComicCon (@SVComicCon) April 17, 2017 Where to watch Schedule Where to watch Schedule News America UK Russian politics Business Sport Op-Edge More Live Where to watch In vision In motion RT360 Shows Schedule Business projects Legal disclaimer Privacy policy Feedback About us Vacancies Contact info On-Air Talent RT NEWS APP Android iOS Windows phone Windows 8 العربية Español Русский Deutsch Français ИНОТВ RTД RUPTLY Applications RSS facebook twitter youtube google-plus instagram soundcloud coub © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2017.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet / VentureBeat Apple today released the third beta version of iOS 10.3.2, an update to iOS 10.3, which itself is an updated version of Apple’s current mobile operating system, iOS 10. Earlier today the beta update became available to developers, and now Apple has also released it for public beta testers. Unlike developers, public beta testers can try out the latest Apple code free of charge, through the company’s Beta Software Program. If you don’t want to wait until iOS 10.3.2 becomes available to everyone as a regular update and you’d like to try iOS 10.3.2 public beta 3 but you’re not a part of the Beta Software Program, you can sign up here. Today’s update comes out to around 195MB, making it a bit larger than the unusually small second beta of iOS 10.3.2, which came out last week. It doesn’t appear that very much has changed in this build, though. Apple’s own release notes don’t point to anything major, even if there are bug fixes. That said, one person’s test indicates that this build delivers very slight performance increases. Last year Apple didn’t go past iOS 9.3.2 before introducing iOS 10. With WWDC scheduled for June 5-9, iOS 11 — or whatever it ends up being called — is right around the corner. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

The iPhone 8 is expected to drive a "super cycle" in sales of Apple's iconic mobile phone. If Apple can't make the sensor technology play nice with OLED displays, Pacific Crest wrote after talks with suppliers, the company could wind up delaying production or scuttling fingerprint sensing on the iPhone. Samsung (SSNLF) reportedly faced similar difficulties integrating a fingerprint sensor with an OLED display, before deciding to move the fingerprint sensor to the back of its flagship Galaxy S8. Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells AAPL? Learn more now. "At this point, we do not believe Apple's optical fingerprint module provider has firm orders for production, which suggests Apple does not have functionality of the optical fingerprint sensor ready," Andy Hargreaves of Pacific Crest wrote in a Monday note. Apple did not immediately respond to a query. Apple looked at technology developed by Synaptics (SYNA) , Hargreaves wrote. Synaptics promotes the ability of its sensors to operate underneath the glass of displays on smartphones and tablets. Hargreaves suggested that, at least for Apple, the technology "has not been qualified." Pacific Crest hasn't changed forecasts for iPhone sales, noting that Apple has time to work through issues. Apple could resolve the problem in the next month or so, Pacific Crest suggested. "This would likely lead to a delay of the OLED iPhone launch, but we would not expect it to meaningfully affect volume for the cycle," Hargreaves wrote. "If it is not able to fix the problems in that time frame, Apple may be forced to eliminate fingerprint sensing from the OLED iPhone altogether." Maybe Apple could go the route of the Galaxy, and put the sensor on the back. Following Samsung's lead in resolving technology challenges is probably not how Apple wants to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the iPhone.

By JenniferBooton Reporter Alphabet Inc.’s stock may have underperformed many of its peers over the past year, but analysts at Credit Suisse say that is set to change. While Facebook’s FB, +1.46%   stock has increased 29% in the past year and Amazon’s AMZN, +1.96% has rocketed 44%, Google parent Alphabet’s GOOGL, +1.78% GOOG, +1.65%  shares are up just 10%. But that underperformance relative to its big-cap rivals could soon change as YouTube and Google Cloud take up a larger piece of its total revenue pie. Read also: Alphabet downgraded on threat from Amazon On Monday, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju reiterated an outperform rating and $1,100 12-month price target on the stock. That target, which is among the most bullish on Alphabet’s stock, would catapult Alphabet’s market capitalization to $757 billion, above Apple Inc.’s AAPL, +0.55%  valuation. Apple’s market cap is $745 billion, though RBC separately predicted on Monday that it’d grow to $824 billion within the year. Shares of Alphabet soared 1.8% to close at $855.13 on Monday. They’ve increased 3.3% in the past three months, virtually in-line with the S&P 500. Amazon, Apple and Facebook have all outperformed over same time period, gaining 11%, 18% and 10.5%, respectively. The average rating on Alphabet’s stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average price target is $982.26, according to a FactSet survey. In a note to clients released Monday morning, Credit Suisse increased its cloud revenue estimate, added in additional revenue Google is expected to make from the newly-announced YouTube TV streaming service and forecast a larger-than-expected contribution from Google’s non-search business, including Google Cloud and Google Play. See also: YouTube TV promises 50 major broadcast, cable channels for $35 a month Among the problem areas are larger investments to enhance its cloud services business, which have weighed on profit growth and margins. Another worry that has dampened investor sentiment has been the deceleration of Google’s established search business, though Ju said that has caused investors to overlook some of the fast-growing aspects of Google’s business, such as the cloud. Mobile Ads Fuel Facebook Revenue Boost(2:29) Advertising gains helped Facebook drive 30 percent more revenue per user in the fourth quarter, ahead of an anticipated slowdown in growth later this year. WSJ's Lee Hawkins explains. Photo: Bloomberg News YouTube, Google Play and Google Cloud, while often are overshadowed by Google Search, are expected to make up one-third of Alphabet’s total revenue within three years, according to Credit Suisse. Last quarter, Google’s web sites raked in nearly $18 billion in revenue, comprising 85% of total sales. Also Read: YouTube to require 10,000 views before videos can get ads In its last earnings report, Google attributed much of its 22% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenues to mobile search and YouTube. Google doesn’t break out YouTube earnings specifically, however, and it currently loops cloud revenue in with newer initiatives it refers to as “other bets.” The company is expected to report fiscal first quarter earnings on April 27.

Her candied apple operation in the Flint Farmer's Market starts up at 9 a.m. every Tuesday and Thursday morning, when she and her employees begin prepping, dipping and dusting large granny smith apples with caramel, chocolate, ground candy bars and more. "A lot of love goes into them," Ginther said. "We've put a lot of time and effort into this." She'll be sending three of her best -- fellow Birch Run native Hali Motley, Alissa Rutkowski and Lucas Valota -- to operate the City Market booth, which will feature fresh apples from Flint. The apples range in price from $10 to $12, and each is hand-wrapped with a decorative ribbon. The cart offers a sample-of-the-week and will allow customers to vote on new apple ideas with a Facebook poll. The cart currently offers more than 100 varieties of apple and welcomes custom orders. "The chaos happens in Flint," Ginther said. "And they get to make the magic happen in Bay City" She cites the support of her husband, Gary, and family friends Glennie and Roger Ramsdell, who helped design and set up the hand-built cart that serves as her storefront, with the success she's seen since the Flint market's grand opening in June 2014. City Market is slated to open in summer 2017. Until then, customers can enjoy a candied apple from the cart during the market's open hours from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday and Thursday, and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday.

Apple hasn't provided any specific details about what's in iOS 10.3.2; it likely focuses on resolving bugs and smoothing over performance issues.

This marks the first time that the tech giant will be making a transition to OLED panels and the iPhone 8 is going to be the first recipient to feature the new display technology, resulting in brighter colors and better battery life. Thanks to Samsung’s massive hold on the smartphone OLED market, Apple will have no choice but to keep a healthy relationship with the manufacturing giant. However, according to the latest rumor, the iPhone maker has plans to bring LG into the fold of OLED production. Related Apple iPhone 8’s Design Drawings Reveal Dimensions, Screen Size, 3D Sensors & More Bringing LG Display to Mass Produce OLED Panels for 2018 iPhone Family Means Apple Will Have Greater Command on Pricing Negotiations According to a report, Apple approached LG Display with the intention of getting the manufacturer to mull over mass producing OLED panels for future iPhones. Now here is where the problem lies: LG does not have sufficient experience in making small OLED panels, which is why you continue to see IPS LCD displays on the likes of LG V20 and the G6. However, OLED-info claims that it is the sole supplier of OLED panels for the Apple Watch but in comparison to iPhone sales, the wearable’s numbers are extremely small. That being said, looking at the number of iPhones that are sold annually, LG will have to increase its production output and that will mean investing heavily in production facilities that can produce small to medium-sized OLED panels. Advertisement Though LG Display can experience a fair amount of growth in the OLED market by partnering with Apple, the California-based company also wants to reduce dependency on Samsung, like it has with several other manufacturers that supply it with key components. Related iPhone 8 to Feature Invisible Selfie Camera and Touch ID Sensor That’s Beneath the Screen for Maximum Bezel-Less Display There are few things that Apple is able to control and it is making sure that it can tighten its grip over that control. That would mean making its custom graphics processors and getting on with Imagination Technologies in the future. Which company do you think is going to be the ultimate winner out of this future partnership? Let us know your thoughts down in the comments.

Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple says 55-year-old Erik Gibson was slated to pilot a flight to Tampa, Florida, on Monday morning when Transportation Security Administration officers found the gun during routine screening. Apple says Gibson, who's from Louisiana, told authorities he forgot he was carrying the gun. He had flown to Albany from New Orleans on Sunday but had gone through a crew line that didn't have security screening. Apple said Gibson was charged with misdemeanor weapon possession and released on $200 bail. Officials don't know if he has a lawyer, and Southwest didn't reply to an email seeking comment. It was the second gun found by Albany baggage screeners in four weeks. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

On Monday, RBC Capital Markets lifted its 12-month price target to $157 from $155 and reiterated an outperform rating. That would increase Apple’s market capitalization to $824 billion from $740 billion currently. Apple’s stock hit a record high of $144.77 on April 4. Read Also: Apple approved to test driverless cars in California RBC analyst Amit Daryanani also increased his March-quarter iPhone estimates and fiscal 2017 revenue estimates, saying trends indicate consumer preference for Apple’s AAPL, +0.55% more expensive plus models, which have contributed positively to average selling prices. Also on Monday, Mizuho Securities reiterated a buy rating and $150 target, saying it expects Apple earnings to be in-line or slightly above estimates when it reports after the bell on May 2. While the company’s third-quarter outlook “could come modestly below estimates” as consumers delay planned upgrades ahead of the iPhone 8 launch in September, its large installed base and attractive valuation make it worthy of investment despite muted expectations, Mizuho said. See Also: Is San Francisco losing its tech talent to other cities? Analysts at Pacific Crest were cautiously optimistic as well. Andy Hargreaves warned that checks with suppliers suggest Apple is struggling with the optical fingerprint functionality expected on the OLED iPhone, which could lead to delays or the removal of it altogether. But he maintained his bullish quarterly estimates and reiterated an overweight rating and $150 target. Apple Loses Ground to Rivals in China(1:44) Apple is finding it hard to hold on to its slice of the Chinese smartphone market as the global giant faces tough competition from several homegrown brands -- Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi. Photo: Huawei/Oppo/Vivo/Xiaomi “While this creates some risk of production delays, at this point we do not believe it materially threatens volume through the coming iPhone cycle,” he said. The average rating on the stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average price target is $150.96, according to a FactSet survey of roughly 40 analysts. Shares of Apple inched 0.6% higher to $141.12 in Monday afternoon trade. The stock has rallied nearly 18% in the past three months and 28.5% in the past year, outperforming both the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.90% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.86% The DJIA has gained 4% in three months and 15% in the past year.

By JenniferBooton Reporter Alphabet Inc.’s stock may have underperformed many of its peers over the past year, but analysts at Credit Suisse say that is set to change. While Facebook’s FB, +1.46%   stock has increased 29% in the past year and Amazon’s AMZN, +1.96% has rocketed 44%, Google parent Alphabet’s GOOGL, +1.78% GOOG, +1.65%  shares are up just 10%. But that underperformance relative to its big-cap rivals could soon change as YouTube and Google Cloud take up a larger piece of its total revenue pie. Read also: Alphabet downgraded on threat from Amazon On Monday, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju reiterated an outperform rating and $1,100 12-month price target on the stock. That target, which is among the most bullish on Alphabet’s stock, would catapult Alphabet’s market capitalization to $757 billion, above Apple Inc.’s AAPL, +0.55%  valuation. Apple’s market cap is $745 billion, though RBC separately predicted on Monday that it’d grow to $824 billion within the year. Shares of Alphabet soared 1.8% to close at $855.13 on Monday. They’ve increased 3.3% in the past three months, virtually in-line with the S&P 500. Amazon, Apple and Facebook have all outperformed over same time period, gaining 11%, 18% and 10.5%, respectively. The average rating on Alphabet’s stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average price target is $982.26, according to a FactSet survey. In a note to clients released Monday morning, Credit Suisse increased its cloud revenue estimate, added in additional revenue Google is expected to make from the newly-announced YouTube TV streaming service and forecast a larger-than-expected contribution from Google’s non-search business, including Google Cloud and Google Play. See also: YouTube TV promises 50 major broadcast, cable channels for $35 a month Among the problem areas are larger investments to enhance its cloud services business, which have weighed on profit growth and margins. Another worry that has dampened investor sentiment has been the deceleration of Google’s established search business, though Ju said that has caused investors to overlook some of the fast-growing aspects of Google’s business, such as the cloud. Mobile Ads Fuel Facebook Revenue Boost(2:29) Advertising gains helped Facebook drive 30 percent more revenue per user in the fourth quarter, ahead of an anticipated slowdown in growth later this year. WSJ's Lee Hawkins explains. Photo: Bloomberg News YouTube, Google Play and Google Cloud, while often are overshadowed by Google Search, are expected to make up one-third of Alphabet’s total revenue within three years, according to Credit Suisse. Last quarter, Google’s web sites raked in nearly $18 billion in revenue, comprising 85% of total sales. Also Read: YouTube to require 10,000 views before videos can get ads In its last earnings report, Google attributed much of its 22% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenues to mobile search and YouTube. Google doesn’t break out YouTube earnings specifically, however, and it currently loops cloud revenue in with newer initiatives it refers to as “other bets.” The company is expected to report fiscal first quarter earnings on April 27.

By JenniferBooton Reporter Alphabet Inc.’s stock may have underperformed many of its peers over the past year, but analysts at Credit Suisse say that is set to change. While Facebook’s FB, +1.46%   stock has increased 29% in the past year and Amazon’s AMZN, +1.96% has rocketed 44%, Google parent Alphabet’s GOOGL, +1.78% GOOG, +1.65%  shares are up just 10%. But that underperformance relative to its big-cap rivals could soon change as YouTube and Google Cloud take up a larger piece of its total revenue pie. Read also: Alphabet downgraded on threat from Amazon On Monday, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju reiterated an outperform rating and $1,100 12-month price target on the stock. That target, which is among the most bullish on Alphabet’s stock, would catapult Alphabet’s market capitalization to $757 billion, above Apple Inc.’s AAPL, +0.55%  valuation. Apple’s market cap is $745 billion, though RBC separately predicted on Monday that it’d grow to $824 billion within the year. Shares of Alphabet soared 1.8% to close at $855.13 on Monday. They’ve increased 3.3% in the past three months, virtually in-line with the S&P 500. Amazon, Apple and Facebook have all outperformed over same time period, gaining 11%, 18% and 10.5%, respectively. The average rating on Alphabet’s stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average price target is $982.26, according to a FactSet survey. In a note to clients released Monday morning, Credit Suisse increased its cloud revenue estimate, added in additional revenue Google is expected to make from the newly-announced YouTube TV streaming service and forecast a larger-than-expected contribution from Google’s non-search business, including Google Cloud and Google Play. See also: YouTube TV promises 50 major broadcast, cable channels for $35 a month Among the problem areas are larger investments to enhance its cloud services business, which have weighed on profit growth and margins. Another worry that has dampened investor sentiment has been the deceleration of Google’s established search business, though Ju said that has caused investors to overlook some of the fast-growing aspects of Google’s business, such as the cloud. Mobile Ads Fuel Facebook Revenue Boost(2:29) Advertising gains helped Facebook drive 30 percent more revenue per user in the fourth quarter, ahead of an anticipated slowdown in growth later this year. WSJ's Lee Hawkins explains. Photo: Bloomberg News YouTube, Google Play and Google Cloud, while often are overshadowed by Google Search, are expected to make up one-third of Alphabet’s total revenue within three years, according to Credit Suisse. Last quarter, Google’s web sites raked in nearly $18 billion in revenue, comprising 85% of total sales. Also Read: YouTube to require 10,000 views before videos can get ads In its last earnings report, Google attributed much of its 22% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenues to mobile search and YouTube. Google doesn’t break out YouTube earnings specifically, however, and it currently loops cloud revenue in with newer initiatives it refers to as “other bets.” The company is expected to report fiscal first quarter earnings on April 27.

(AP) — A Southwest Airlines pilot has been arrested on a weapons charge in New York after airport security officers found a loaded handgun in his carry-on bag. Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple says 55-year-old Erik Gibson was slated to pilot a flight to Tampa, Florida, on Monday morning when Transportation Security Administration officers found the gun during routine screening. Apple says Gibson, who’s from Louisiana, told authorities he forgot he was carrying the gun. He had flown to Albany from New Orleans on Sunday but had gone through a crew line that didn’t have security screening. Apple said Gibson was charged with misdemeanor weapon possession and released on $200 bail. Officials don’t know if he has a lawyer, and Southwest didn’t reply to an email seeking comment. It was the second gun found by Albany baggage screeners in four weeks. Keep checking WDTN.com for the latest news, weather and sports.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Don't Waste This Opportunity, Apple iPhone naming has gotten needlessly complex, and that's a bad thing. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 17, 2017 at 4:26PM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) naming conventions for its most important product have been devolving for years, thanks to alternating between numerical successions and "s" appendages. The company made a rare move last year by keeping the same overall design for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, making it unclear whether the 2017 iPhone would be called the iPhone 7s, iPhone 8, or something different altogether like iPhone Edition. This year is also notable because it will be the 10th-generation iPhone, which could represent an opportunity for Apple to finally transition away from its numerical scheme and toward something more sustainable from a branding perspective. It only gets worse over time: If Apple theoretically continued on this branding path for another decade, the 20th-generation iPhone released in 2027 would be the nonsensical iPhone 12s. iPhone 7, the ninth-generation iPhone. Image source: Apple. Don't just take my word for it. Apple's former ad man, Ken Segall, who came up with the famous iMac name two decades ago, thinks we're approaching what he considers "The Great iPhone Naming Opportunity of 2017." Don't waste it, Apple Segall considers the "s" branding a "perfect example of a company shooting itself in the marketing foot." Apple has created an advertising hurdle for itself, where it needs to justify to customers why they should buy an "s" model when a fully redesigned model with more meaningful improvements can be expected the following year. As the iPhone family has expanded over the years to cater to a diverse range of consumer preferences, most notably including larger displays, iPhone branding has become needlessly complex. Segall is a big fan of simplicity, particularly in the context of marketing. He wrote both Insanely Simple (which focuses on Apple's obsession with simplicity) and Think Simple (which applies the same lessons to a broader set of companies). If Apple ends up using some confusing combination of 7s, 7s Plus, 8, and SE later this year, Segall makes a damning comparison: "[T]he naming will feel more like Toshiba than Apple." For example, Segall considers the possibility that Apple streamlines the branding under "iPhone 8," and releases a standard model, a larger "iPhone 8 Plus," a more powerful "iPhone 8 Pro," and a smaller "iPhone 8 Mini." It'd be even better if you drop the number. This isn't the first time this notion has been tossed around; many considered the possibility of an iPhone Air years ago, although Apple seems to be moving away from the Air brand in general, recently rebranding the iPad Air as just the iPad and the new MacBook looks set to supplant the aging MacBook Air eventually. The 10th-generation iPhone is the perfect opportunity for Apple to reset its branding strategy, and set it on a long-term course toward a simpler naming scheme. Apple should streamline its iPhone branding to be similar to the Mac: distinct, descriptive modifiers like "Pro" and "Mini" with product cycles represented by years. Consider "iPhone Pro (2021)" or "iPhone Mini (2019)" as examples. It's immediately obvious for consumers what they're buying, and that simplicity would go a long way.

Apple’s new flagship iPhone 8 is again said to feature a modern take on the iPhone 4 design in terms of materials. Macotakara also says the new iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models, which are expected to be iterative updates, may actually be slightly thicker than the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Sony A6500 For the iPhone 8, Macotakara expects a stainless steel band to wrap the exterior of the new handset while the front and back are all glass. Apple previously used a glass front and back with a stainless steel band with the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s design in 2010 and 2011. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has predicted a new design similar to the iPhone 4 in terms of materials for more than a year now. Macotakara adds that the flagship iPhone will retain the dual camera feature introduced on the iPhone 7 Plus, although the horizontal layout will switch to a vertical layout. According to the report, this design has recently moved from EVT to DVT status (engineer to design validation test). Recent iPhone 8 schematic leaks claimed to show this same design in EVT status. In terms of what Apple will do with Touch ID, the new report offers no clarity. The report believes Apple may use the new vertically stacked camera for virtual reality features. Finally, Macotakara believes the new iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus that we expect to be iterative updates at the current iPhone price points will be somewhat thicker due to a slight reworking. If so, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus cases may not fit the new models, according to the report. Apple previously bumped up the thickness from the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus with the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus to add 3D Touch with the pressure-sensitive display.

Red flags keep popping up over Apple's new fingerprint sensor for its next iPhone. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 141.83 +0.78 +0.55% International Business Machines Corp IBM ▲ 171.10 +1.57 +0.93% Honeywell International Inc HON ▲ 123.43 +0.93 +0.76% Comcast Corp CMCSA ▲ 37.20 +0.06 +0.16% Pacific Crest Securities analysts said in a note to investors Sunday that Apple's component suppliers were struggling with a new fingerprint sensor. That sensor is expected to go under the phone's cover glass to let Apple remove the iPhone's current home button and create a larger display. The investment bank claimed these manufacturing issues could result in shortages or delays in availability for the new, 10th anniversary iPhone, which is expected to see huge demand. Otherwise, Apple might scrape the new fingerprint sensor in the device, which is expected to be announced in September. Pacific Crest isn't the only place reporting such problems. Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri last week said issues came up from putting the sensor under the phone's cover glass. If the new sensor doesn't work, Apple may decide to move the sensor to the back of the phone, similar to the new Samsung Galaxy S8. A mockup showing this possibility surfaced online last week.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 April 2017 by Military News Exploring Apple Inc. Supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co.’s Outlook Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) , or TSMC for short, is the largest contract chip manufacturer. As such, its financial performance can be a reasonable indication of how things are going for many other chipmakers, particularly those chipmakers that sell products into mobile devices (since more than half of TSMC’s revenue comes from sales of chips into communications applications). In this column, I’d like to look at the comments that TSMC made about its business expectations and the overall chip industry on its most recent earnings call , which should be useful not just to investors in TSMC, but more generally to investors with exposure to the semiconductor industry. TSMC relies on sales of phones like the iPhone for much of its revenue. Image source: Apple. Second-quarter drop explained TSMC CFO Lora Ho explained that the company will see lower demand during the second quarter of the year (that’s the current quarter) „due to supply chain inventory management during the second quarter and mobile product seasonality.” TSMC co-CEO Mark Liu added some additional color to the inventory situation, saying that the company’s guidance in the second quarter „reflects a quite severe inventory adjustment by [TSMC’s] customers, particularly in smartphone and PC market.” Despite that, Liu claims that actual smartphone demand in the marketplace „appears stable in the second quarter [of 2017].” In other words, the sky doesn’t appear to be falling in the smartphone market (Liu didn’t explicitly address end-demand in the PC market), but TSMC’s customers may have gotten ahead of themselves in terms of the kind of inventory they built up. Market view and TSMC’s guidance Liu also offered TSMC’s view of the overall chip market as well as TSMC’s growth expectations for the year. He said TSMC’s view of the semiconductor market — excluding memory (i.e., NAND flash and DRAM) — will grow 4% this year. TSMC’s growth expectations for the contract chip manufacturing market, Liu indicated, is now 5%, down from a previous expectation of 7% thanks to „elevated inventory in the supply chain.” Interestingly, Liu reiterated the company’s previous full-year revenue growth target of between 5% and 10%, highlighting that this forecast indicates that TSMC expects to gain share in the contract chip manufacturing market. It might come down to Apple I think one of the keys to TSMC’s performance this year — particularly in the second half of the year — will be the performance of Apple ‚s(NASDAQ: AAPL) upcoming iPhone models in the marketplace. Apple’s upcoming iPhone models are hotly anticipated, and many analysts and investors appear to be expecting a „super cycle” for Apple once these new phones launch. Considering that TSMC generates significant direct revenue from Apple (Apple has TSMC build its internally designed chips) as well as significant indirect revenue (Apple suppliers build their chips at TSMC), robust iPhone performance in the marketplace would clearly be a positive for TSMC. Moreover, it’s worth noting that, broadly speaking, to the extent that Apple captures share against the major Android device vendors, TSMC should benefit. This is because most non-Apple flagship phones use integrated applications processors and modems designed by Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) and built by TSMC’s direct rival, Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) . This year’s iPhone models, on the other hand, will likely feature applications processors built by TSMC as well as cellular modems also built by TSMC. The better Apple does in the second half of this year, the better off TSMC should be. 10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Likely options for Apple include a delay of production or elimination of fingerprint sensing on the OLED iPhone. We believe Apple continues to work on solving its optical fingerprint issues. If it's able to solve the problems in the next month or so, it would likely place volume orders at that point. This would likely lead to a delay of the OLED iPhone launch, but we would not expect it to meaningfully affect volume for the cycle. If it's not able to fix the problems in that time frame, Apple may be forced to eliminate fingerprint sensing from the OLED iPhone altogether. Hargreaves doesn't believe that Apple has submitted firm productions orders for the optical fingerprint module which suggests the functionality may not be ready. He also believes that Apple has evaluated and passed on Synaptic's solution. This isn't the first time we've heard reports on possible delays due to the Touch ID. Analyst Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company reported last week that integrating the Touch ID sensor into the iPhone 8's display remains a big bottleneck for Apple. If Touch ID is dropped it would create enormous pressure on unproven 3D sensing tech to replace the verification system on current generation devices. Suppliers suggest that the solution is both fast and highly reliable, even in low-light scenarios or from odd angles. If this proves accurate, reliance solely on 3D sensing for biometric login and verification could be a viable and innovative replacement for the highly popular fingerprint sensor.

Reply · Like · Mark as Spam Dub Dublin - 11 hours ago Oh, come on, TouchID is NOT a show-stopper by any means, and in fact, as an owner of both a new iPhone with TouchID (my first, since I finally killed my old 4s) and a Surface Pro 4 with Windows Hello (IR camera), I can tell you that the technologies are roughly neck-and-neck right now, but Hello is far less obtrusive. That said, with a small amount of tweaking for shorter cycle times, the Win Hello system would be clearly superior - its recognition accuracy and failure rates are better than what I'm seeing with the increasingly annoying TouchID. (Really, I just wish I could get back to swipe-to-use...) I'm sure Apple can build IR face recognition using cutting edge parts and technology that's at least as good as what Microsoft fielded years ago. If TouchID dies, it sure won't bother me any, it's one of Apple's weakest features...

However, if Apple does aim for an all-screen solution, it beats the question: What happens to the Touch ID fingerprint sensor that currently sits within a soon-to-be-gone Home button? Many reports have suggested Apple may have found a play to place it within the rumored OLED display. Others say Apple could place it on the back of the device. Now there’s a new theory… Apple will drop it completely. According to analyst Andy Hargreaves (via MacRumors), the company’s inability to solve the optical fingerprint issue, could lead to it nixing the feature completely. In a note to investors, he wrote: “Likely options for Apple include a delay of production or elimination of fingerprint sensing on the OLED iPhone. We believe Apple continues to work on solving its optical fingerprint issues. If it’s able to solve the problems in the next month or so, it would likely place volume orders at that point. “This would likely lead to a delay of the OLED iPhone launch, but we would not expect it to meaningfully affect volume for the cycle. If it’s not able to fix the problems in that time frame, Apple may be forced to eliminate fingerprint sensing from the OLED iPhone altogether.” Related: iPhone 7 Plus review If this theory plays out, it would be unlikely to go over well with the company’s loyal customer base. It would also mean the iPhone 7s range would have a feature the iPhone 8 would not. This appears highly unlikely, unless Apple has a plan to bump up security with the addition of an alternate biometrics-based tool. Would you buy an iPhone 8 if the unthinkable happens?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Apple is having trouble getting the iPhone 8’s signature feature to actually work Chris Smith @chris_writes April 17th, 2017 at 3:08 PM Share Tweet The iPhone 8’s signature design feature will be a bezeless display extending from edge to edge. That means there’s no room for a physical home button on the device, so Apple has to “kill” it. However, more reports indicate the iPhone maker may not be able to do so this year. Don't Miss: These are the Netflix originals generating the most buzz online Technically, Apple already killed the physical home button with the iPhone 7 series. These devices do not have a home button that you can actually press. Furthermore, the iPhone 6s introduced the 3D Touch screen that theoretically allows Apple to relegate several home button functions to any region of the display. There’s one critical feature of the home button that needs to be preserved as well, the Touch ID fingerprint sensor required for unlocking the phone, signing into apps and services, and using Apple Pay. Touch ID isn’t something Apple can’t easily ditch, even if there are rumors that 3D facial recognition cameras will replace the fingerprint sensor. Apple wants to place the fingerprint sensor under the display, but that technology doesn’t appear to be ready yet. According to a Sunday research note from Pacific Crest Securities, Apple has issues with the new sensor, which could either delay the iPhone 8’s launch or force Apple to place it on the back of the handset. “The anticipated move to a full-screen OLED panel in the coming iPhone 8/X eliminates the physical home button, which necessitates a move to a virtual home button and an optical fingerprint sensing solution to read fingerprints through the OLED panel,” the research note reads, according to Investors . “At this point, we do not believe Apple’s optical fingerprint module provider has firm orders for production, which suggests Apple does not have functionality of the optical fingerprint sensor ready. Additionally, we believe Apple has evaluated Synaptic’s optical fingerprint solution, but that it has not been qualified.” Synaptics has been working on a similar fingerprint solution for Samsung’s Galaxy S8 but failed to deliver it on time for the phone’s launch. “Likely options for Apple include a delay of production or elimination of fingerprint sensing on the OLED iPhone,” the report also says, according to MacRumors. “We believe Apple continues to work on solving its optical fingerprint issues. If it’s able to solve the problems in the next month or so, it would likely place volume orders at that point. This would likely lead to a delay of the OLED iPhone launch, but we would not expect it to meaningfully affect volume for the cycle. If it’s not able to fix the problems in that time frame, Apple may be forced to eliminate fingerprint sensing from the OLED iPhone altogether. Similar reports from other analysts offered the same type of warnings, suggesting that Apple might be forced to delay the iPhone 8’s in-store launch this year to deal with Touch ID-related supply issues.

"I've totally changed my mind — We aren't talking about artificial intelligence that sits down and says, 'What is my life in the world? What do I have as obstacles? How do I solve them? What should I solve?'," Wozniak said. "Only humans do that." Wozniak's position is a reversal from his comments a couple of years ago, when he told The Australian Financial Review that there was "no question" that computers would take over from humans, and that such a prospect would be "scary and very bad." "What we are talking about for artificial intelligence hasn't gotten to that level of brain functionality yet," Wozniak told CNBC on Monday, calling it more like "semi-intelligence." Despite swelling popularity of artificial intelligence, Apple hasn't made the splash with Siri that Amazon has made with Alexa, its artificially intelligent assistant. But Wozniak said Apple may be playing its cards close to the vest. "A lot of other companies like Google have been more forthcoming and talking about what they're doing, Apple's tendency is to be quiet and shock you with what they come up with," Wozniak said. "These are going to be very important things in our future." Wozniak — who founded Apple in a garage with Steve Jobs in 41 years ago — believes that the company will continue to grow larger and more dominant until at least 2075, according to an interview with USA Today. Wozniak is headlining the upcoming Silicon Valley Comic Con, an event that aims to unite pop culture and technology. "It would be ridiculous to not expect them to be around (in 2075). The same goes for Google and Facebook," Wozniak told USA Today on Friday. One example of Apple's future with artificial intelligence could be in self-driving cars, Wozniak told CNBC on Monday. Apple has reportedly received a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California. "Apple is such a large company it has to go after big markets," Wozniak said. "And self-driving cars is one that we're all reading about every day, and almost every car company in the world is working toward that. I go back and think about what made Apple successful and as big as it is. Look at the iPhone... you know, it was questionable at first but that was the way everyone wanted to go...So I'm hoping Apple goes the same way with autonomous cars. That you have one car —that can be sold without a steering wheel maybe — that is so perfect that everyone goes, 'Oh my gosh, I want this.'"

The memo reads: Starting March 30, iPad 4th generation whole unit repairs may be substituted to iPad Air 2 models. Apple's repair and order management tool will indicate for each repair if a substitution will take place. Please note the substitute part’s color and capacity to ensure the customer understands what their replacement iPad whole unit will be. The decision to replace rather than repair will be decided on a case-by-case basis and is likely dependant on availability. Read More Follow iClarified Comments (1) Add Comment bulb nugget - 9 hours ago A few years ago, I traded in my iPad 4 for an Air 1 a year after its release and kind of regret it. And I thought they discontinued the air 2 considering that it wasn't on their site after a year of being released.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → On the Future of TouchID » April 17, 2017 ⌘ Permalink Rumors have it that Apple is struggling to put a TouchID sensor on the front of this year’s Unicorn iPhone 8. Here’s Andy Hargreaves, an equity research analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, via MacRumors, on the subject: Likely options for Apple include a delay of production or elimination of fingerprint sensing on the OLED iPhone. We believe Apple continues to work on solving its optical fingerprint issues. If it’s able to solve the problems in the next month or so, it would likely place volume orders at that point. This would likely lead to a delay of the OLED iPhone launch, but we would not expect it to meaningfully affect volume for the cycle. If it’s not able to fix the problems in that time frame, Apple may be forced to eliminate fingerprint sensing from the OLED iPhone altogether. I really don’t see this happening. TouchID is at the heart of unlocking the iPhone, iTunes payments and Apple Pay. Apple doesn’t want to rearchitect all of that, especially after preaching for years about the safety granted by a fingerprint sensor. While we’re on the subject, a lot of Apple people on Twitter this weekend seemed to be angsty over the thought of the TouchID sensor being on the back of the iPhone. Having reviewed and used several Android devices with this setup, I can say with confidence that it would not be the end of the world. There are downsides — mainly, unlocking the phone if its on a table — but the rest of the time, the location is totally fine. In fact, I think I prefer moving my finger over on the back of the back of an Android phone over wrenching my thumb over to the bottom-center of my iPhone.

(AP) — Officials are working to provide Prineville with enough electricity to ensure the central Oregon community can keep powering huge data centers operated by Facebook and Apple and make room for other companies to move in. Facebook and Apple's arrival produced a surge in electricity demand in Prineville throughout the past several years that has overwhelmed the Bonneville Power Administration's transmission capacity, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported (https://is.gd/vuE4Jk). But BPA is now working on a plan that calls for doubling Prineville's capacity for electricity within a few years. The plan, presented to city and economic development officials last week, would involve upgrading electrical substations and changing how the federal agency manages power on its grid. Under the proposal, the region's capacity would start increasing in 2019 from 560 megawatts to 1,145 megawatts. LATEST TRENDING VIDEOS: Story continues below "We're excited we've got a path forward, which is obviously key," said Roger Lee, director of Economic Development for Central Oregon. Long-term requirements for the plan may involve bringing a new transmission line into the area, a project BPA acknowledged "would be a significant challenge" and take more than six years to complete. The city had first learned of its power troubles last year after an unidentified manufacturer proposed bringing 300 jobs to Prineville to build an energy-intensive factory. City officials wanted to keep the company interested in the community, prompting BPA to start considering its options to address the electricity needs. It is not clear whether the company will still be interested in the city by the time Prineville's capacity for electricity has been expanded. ___ Information from: The Oregonian/OregonLive, http://www.oregonlive.com Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

In late March, Apple finally pulled its iOS 10.3 update out of beta. The iOS 10.3 update was a milestone upgrade bringing new features, tweaks, bug fixes, and a long list of security patches to iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. Apple quickly replaced iOS 10.3 with an iOS 10.3.1 update. iOS 10.3.1 serves as the current version of iOS 10 though its days are numbered. Apple’s confirmed an iOS 10.3.2 update for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch and the update is currently in testing ahead of a release later this year. While your focus should still be on iOS 10.3.1 we want to take an early peek at the iOS 10.3.2 update and outline the most important things to know as we push deeper into the month. Several important iOS 10.3.2 release details remain unconfirmed so this roundup also adds in a few things we expect from Apple’s roll out. We’ll continue to update this roundup with new details so check back for frequent updates. We should learn more about the iOS 10.3.2 update as it pushes through testing. You Can Try the iOS 10.3.2 Update Right Now If you want to try out the iOS 10.3.2 update ahead of its release you can thanks to the iOS 10.3.2 beta for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. Apple’s released its first iOS 10.3.2 beta to developers and those signed up for the free Beta Software Program. The company’s Beta Software Program is available to anyone with a working Apple ID. If choose to try the iOS 10.3.2 update ahead of its official release you’ll want to be very careful. Early iOS software can (and probably will) cause problems on your device. We recommend doing some prep work before you install early software on your device. If you do notice issues on your device you’ll want to report those issues to Apple. This way the company can improve the final release. At this point, its small change log and potential for problems, most of you will probably want to skip the beta and wait for the official version of iOS 10.3.2. It’s also worth noting that Apple appeared to have finally released  32-bit version of the iOS 10.3.2 beta. There are currently iTunes restore images for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c or the iPad 4. While an iOS 10.3.2 release is in the cards for these devices, we expect Apple to keep the iPhone 5 on iOS 10 when iOS 11 arrives in beta form this summer. iOS 11 is expected to arrived in early June at WWDC 2017. You Can Downgrade from iOS 10.3.2 Beta If you decide you want to try the iOS 10.3.2 beta note that you can drop down to an official version of iOS 10 if you can’t stand the bugs or its performance on your device. Apple is currently signing off on one update, iOS 10.3.1, which means you can downgrade to it if the going gets tough. Sadly, you can’t drop back down to anything older than iOS 10.3.1. The iOS 10.3 and iOS 10.2.1 downgrade options are now closed. For more on the downgrade process, see our iOS 10 downgrade walkthrough. iOS 10.3.2 Release Date Apple hasn’t confirmed an iOS 10.3.2 release date. And with no Apple event in sight, we probably won’t get an iOS 10.3.2 release date announcement ahead of time. At this point, we’d expect the iOS 10.3.2 update to go through a few more betas before its released to the public. A recent maintenance release, iOS 10.2.1, went through five betas before it was officially released to iOS users. iOS 10.3.2 Release Time The iOS 10.3.2 release date is hard to predict but the iOS 10.3.2 release time isn’t. The iOS 10.3.2 update will almost certainly arrive around 10AM Pacific on its release day. You can expect the same from all of Apple’s iOS 10.3.2 beta releases. Here’s what that will look like for other regions in the United States and countries around the world including Australia and Japan: Eastern – 1 PM Central – 12 PM Mountain – 11AM London – 6 PM Moscow – 9 PM New Delhi – 10:30 PM Shanghai – 1 AM Tokyo – 2 AM Melbourne – 3 AM Auckland – 5 AM Apple never releases its iOS updates on the weekend and has a tendency to release new software on Monday morning. iOS 10.3.2 Update: What’s New The iOS 10.3.1/iOS 10.3 updates delivered all sorts of changes including APFS, Find My AirPods, huge tweaks to CarPlay, and more. The iOS 10.3.2 beta 1, iOS 10.3.2 beta 2, and iOS 10.3.2 beta 3 change logs point to a much smaller update, one on par with the iOS 10.3.1 update. Developers poking around the iOS 10.3.2 beta haven’t discovered anything significant on board the new version of iOS 10.3, aside from a few bugs. This could change as the beta progresses but iOS 10.3.2 is looking like a minor release for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 7 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 11 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 11 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Print Email By Rob Enderle Apr 17, 2017 10:41 AM PT I don't know about you but I can't seem to get out of my head the image of that poor Asian doctor who, seemingly unconscious, was dragged off that United flight. The fact that the airline did that to a 69-year-old doctor just so it could save money moving employees around is nearly as unbelievable as the initial tone-deaf response from United's CEO, who blamed the passenger. (It was only after a tremendous backlash that the CEO offered an actual apology.) While the United debacle was going on, I happened to be reviewing Qualcomm's counterclaim against Apple, and holy crap. It alleges that Apple crippled the modems in some iPhones to cover up its use of cheap parts, and that it aggressively acted to prevent anyone, particularly Qualcomm, from pointing it out. I have the view that if you pay for a thing, you should get that thing -- and Apple customers, according to Qualcomm, are getting screwed. Given how we depend on our phones, my guess is that if this is true, it won't end well for Apple. I'll share some thoughts on customer abuse and then close with my product of the week: the Netgear Arlo Security Camera system (again). Customer Abuse I often wonder if top executives and boards have some weird undiagnosed disease that causes them, from time to time, to do something so incredibly stupid you have to wonder if someone snuck up on a bunch of them and hit them with a stupid stick. I recall having a discussion with an IBM exec I reported to back in the early 1990s about the company's practice of intentionally creating buggy products and then charging customers to fix the problems it had created. I asked why we were doing something that seemed insane, only to be told, effectively, that since the customer had no choice, IBM could do what it wanted to them and they would pay whatever IBM charged. It was like selling air. It remains one of the most idiotic responses I've ever heard, and shortly after I left the firm that entire executive team was canned. (Apparently the newly hired CEO, Louis Gerstner, agreed with my assessment.) Microsoft had a group of executives who covered up that Office 98 wasn't backward-compatible, and a different group covered up the issues with Windows Vista that should have prevented its release. Those issues created massive problems with customers, and most of the folks responsible lost their jobs as a result. To hit aggressive price points with lithium-ion batteries in the early 2000s, Sony covered up that they hadn't updated their lines to prevent metal contamination. The batteries became contaminated and caught fire, forcing massive recalls and pretty much wiping out Sony's lithium-ion battery business. Those batteries could have resulted in an impressive number of deaths had one of them gone up next to a better fuel source on a plane. The lithium-ion coverup followed Sony's institution of a program to put rootkits on PCs in an attempt to combat piracy, which opened those PCs to hacking and put customers at risk. The backlash over that helped wipe out Sony's Walkman business and opened the door to the iPod. Takata covered up that their airbags were not aging well and actually could kill drivers when they deployed. It apparently did not do anything to address the problem, which eventually was discovered and resulted in the biggest automotive recall in history. It still might put the company out of business. It appears that Samsung cut short quality testing to get the Galaxy Note7 out quickly only to find out it was catching fire. In an effort to address that problem quickly, it guessed wrong about the cause, and replacement phones caught fire too. To recover some of the costs associated with its massive recall, Samsung decided to sell refurbished Galaxy Note7s, and I doubt that'll end well. I think Samsung has a death wish. It really seems like an epidemic of stupid at times... United's Disastrous Decision There were two paths that United could have taken to move employees to another location without causing an uproar. One was to increase the voucher amount offered to passengers to a point where it was cheaper to charter a plane to move the employees, or simply to have in place what many non-airline companies use, a fleet of smaller planes for employees' use. What is particularly scary about the method that United chose is that it didn't factor in why people weren't taking a US$1,000 voucher to change flights. Its method for choosing which passengers to bump only focuses on connections, so those who were ending up at the destination airport were prioritized for bumping. What if someone's job depended on getting to a location on time? What if someone had a dying relative, a wedding or funeral to attend? What if someone were a doctor who needed to get to a critical patent? None of those possibilities was been taken into account, and the poor guy who was beaten up was in fact a doctor. United's decision has cost it millions in brand damage, and because the passenger looked as though he might have been Chinese, China is treating this like a racial attack on its people, which could result in sanctions. I bet that before this is over, Congress might put a law on the books addressing it. I'd name it "The United CEO Is An Idiot Law." (By the way, PRWeek wants its award back. Suddenly this is an Oscar 2017-like event.) It may even cost the CEO his job -- all because it didn't have a better way to move employees around, which is kind of sadly ironic given it is in the transportation business. At the end of that last linked article, the author asks why it took so long for United even to understand this was a problem. It was because, in the minds of its executives, customers had stopped being people and had become an exploitable resource instead. That attitude generally is considered a company and career killer. Apple's Secret War on Customers Between Apple and Samsung, I'm not sure which has the stronger tendency for suicidal policies. Apple clearly has a problem, because it is a firm that is valued largely for its innovation, and that is one word that largely has been used in the past tense since Tim Cook took over for Steve Jobs. While the iPhone has done well -- particularly this last quarter, thanks to Samsung's suicidal moves -- nothing else has risen to diversify Apple's revenue or offset a trend of increasing margin pressure. As a result, Apple has moved to a strategy of aggressively cutting costs. That sets a foundation for the kind of problem that I mentioned earlier in this column. You see, Apple customers effectively are locked in to Apple services -- which would be OK, as long as Apple didn't see it as an opportunity to mine them, and could grow its revenue and margins by creating more and more compelling products. However, Apple hasn't done that. The Apple Watch has languished, the iPad is in decline, and the iPad Pro has been a disappointment. MacBooks, Macs and iMacs have been cash cows for so long that reviving them seems increasingly unlikely, and is driving the company go cheap on components while considering charging more and more for iPhones. The Qualcomm filing basically just says "Apple is an assh*le," which is far from an uncommon position from any Apple supplier. It gets interesting on page 46 of the whopping 130-page document. It alleges that Apple not only has been using sub-optimal (read cheap) parts, but also has been threatening to retaliate should anyone point that out. Point 4 on page 46, basically says there are two iPhones in market sold as the same phone: one with cheap parts, and one with good parts but that Apple is crippling so that people can't tell the difference (and thereby avoid the bad phone). However, Apple can't cripple it enough, so people are barred from pointing out that the crippled phone is still better. WTF!?! Here is the thing: Increasingly we live on our cellphones. We depend on them to work if there is an emergency. Our lives increasingly literally depend on them, and folks think that by buying Apple they are getting the best. However, if Qualcomm is correct, they either are getting a substandard phone -- or worse, an intentionally crippled product. The potential consequences range from poor performance to bad connectivity, which could leave users with a phone that doesn't work when they most need it. Cutting quality while raising prices and aggressively covering that up only works temporarily. Eventually people figure it out -- and that didn't end well for IBM or for the CEO that shortly thereafter was fired. Like all of the other examples I've cited here, Apple's alleged action is customer abuse. If it turns out to be true, then it means that the only difference between Apple and all the rest of these bad examples is that Apple has taken more money from its customers. I expect that as a reason to buy from a company, that likely falls pretty low on anyone's list. I'll add one other element that I think is very similar to the old IBM and the new Apple. Both companies enjoyed -- and still enjoy -- phenomenal customer loyalty. Even though IBM's behavior had been going on for years, most customers seemed to give IBM the benefit of the doubt. As a result, when the problem became pronounced it went to nuclear unbelievably fast. Certainly, it was way too fast for the existing management team to respond, and the result was a purge. It eventually saved the company, but it was a very close thing. Apple's loyalty is, if anything, greater than IBM's was -- and today's consumer market certainly can move a ton faster than enterprise computing did back in the 1980s and early 1990s. What this means is that if this alleged anti-customer behavior is left in place too long, the backlash on Apple could be unrecoverable -- particularly if Google further reduces the migration pain to Android. Given that many of you have huge investments in Apple, I'm suggesting you might not want to have all those eggs in that same troubled basket. Diversification may save your ass. Wrapping Up There are times when I wonder if boards and CEOs either are mentally challenged or suicidal. From Samsung, to United, to Apple, this year has been an increasingly ugly example of executives behaving badly. I know I missed the chapter in management school that suggested screwing customers was a great business practice, but I seriously think those pages should be torn into little bitty pieces and tossed out, along with the idiots who adhere to this strategy. In any case, this month has provided a strong "teachable moment." Let's hope a lot of executives learn by watching rather than doing. It is never OK to abuse customers. When companies do, they have translated "customers" into "things." We really don't like being mistreated as "things." When I last wrote about this product, I'd installed two cameras and was impressed that the batteries had lasted a couple weeks. Well, it's been over a month, and I'm now up to 10 cameras. I've had to recharge only two batteries, both of which had more than half their battery life left even though they were in very high traffic areas, which suggests these puppies could last for months in low-traffic areas. We've caught stray dogs wondering in our yard, the gate left open and our dogs sneaking in and out of it, delivery people who have lied about deliveries, pet sitters who weren't doing what they said they were doing, and a herd of deer wandering in to munch on our newly planted flowers. This system is AWESOME! Netgear Arlo Pro The Netgear Arlo is my third camera system, and it was by far the easiest to set up. The lack of wiring means I can put the cameras anyplace I want, and I can install a ton of them. My dogs and cats each have their own tracking camera, but my wife had me move the one that was on her. (That'll teach me to tell her, huh?) I did figure out one thing: It is cheaper to buy the cameras in the bundle then one by one. You can get an Arlo system with four cameras for $350 if you shop around, while the cameras individually cost around $150. Sadly, I didn't figure this out until after I'd purchased an additional eight cameras. Further, you get up to five cameras with the free service, but if you want to go to 10 it will set you back $99 a year. However, you then get 30 days of storage for up to 10 GB of data. For 15 cameras, it's $149 a year and you get 60 days storage for up to 100 GB. Arlo just launched a $450 camera, and what makes it different is that it has local storage, a 3G/4G connection, and a massive battery. Sadly, this is only available to large companies or the government, and we know they would never use them to spy on you... It has been a long time since I was this excited about a product, and that is why the Netgear Arlo is my product of the week -- again! You could call this "the iPod of security camera systems."

The third beta of macOS Sierra 10.12.5 can be downloaded through the Apple Developer Center or through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store. According to the release notes accompanying the beta, the update "improves the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac." Apple's release notes don't often provide a lot of insight into what's included in new beta software, so we don't know what features or bug fixes might be included in the 10.12.5 update. No notable changes or major bug fixes were discovered in the first two betas, but should anything pop up in the third macOS Sierra 10.12.5 beta, we'll update this post. Update: Beta 3 is also out for public beta testers. Related Roundup: macOS Sierra [ 20 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) tywebb13 14 hours ago at 10:16 am Quick question: Do these beta updates really need to be front page news? Unless they reveal something incredible (like a hidden new Mac model) they're not really that newsworthy to the vast majority of people. Quick answer: Yes. I like to see it on the front page to inform me that the new betas are available. Sometimes I see other news articles on the front page that are not relevant to me and I just skip them. I don't then complain about their existence merely because they are not relevant to me. Rating: 13 Votes xgman 13 hours ago at 10:39 am I appreciate betas being announced on the front page.

Well, there are not many news from Apple worthy of anything, so why not to put it on the front page since there is nothing else to talk about.

I really don't mind, just as long as they don't do something like putting iOS on the front page and pushing MacOS to the Mac Blog. Rating: 3 Votes MrGuder 14 hours ago at 10:15 am "improves the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac." This is so generic, why can't they just say what it fixes? We don't need security info notes but other specific info for the user would be good. Time for a change in language?

Unless they reveal something incredible (like a hidden new Mac model) they're not really that newsworthy to the vast majority of people. I truly believe the front page must have a good number of Mac-related news, because it's important that Apple realizes that there's a number of customers who really care of the Mac as their primary Apple product. So, yes, I believe MacOS updates news should be on the front page. Rating: 1 Votes Mobster1983 11 hours ago at 01:05 pm Available for public beta testers as well. Rating: 1 Votes tywebb13 13 hours ago at 10:39 am Wouldn't you see them pop-up as an update on the App Store, yes? But I tend to look at tech news sites like macrumors more often than the mac app store or apple's developer downloads page. I think the same could be said of most developers too. Of all the times I first became aware of new betas the vast majority were via tech news sites like macrumors. Of course that same information is available via the mac app store and apple's developer downloads page, but it probably would take more time before I became aware of it that way as I don't look at those quite as aften as tech news sites.

Apple has also released a minor iOS 10.3.1 update, which focused on security improvements. Registered developers can download the third iOS 10.3.2 beta from the Apple Developer Center or over-the-air with the proper configuration profile installed. Apple doesn't typically provide detailed release notes for its iOS updates, so we don't yet know what features, improvements, or bug fixes might be coming in iOS 10.3.2, aside from some fixes for SiriKit car commands, outlined in the release notes for the first beta. As a minor 10.x.x update, we can expect iOS 10.3.2 to offer bug fixes and performance improvements rather than outward-facing features. No notable features were found in the first two betas, but if anything new is found in the third iOS 10.3.2 beta, we'll update this post. Update: Beta 3 is also available for members of Apple's public beta testing program.

Period That was funny because the original post was about battery life which can't be judged immediately. Even if it could, every user uses their phone in different ways. We should ban "How's battery life?" posts. Rating: 3 Votes Chazzle 12 hours ago at 12:13 pm The devs all sat around a table and asked, "Are we ready to turn on dark mode"? Devs all say - Nah. Fine, it is settled, put out a new beta, just change the number. Great job everyone! Clearly not a developer.

Rating: 3 Votes mindfawk 13 hours ago at 11:16 am It's actually not related to the status of your dev account at all. Perhaps you've installed the watchOS or tvOS profile, because they won't complain and will install without issue. I would: delete the profile you just installed, redownload/reinstall the profile ensuring it is the one for iOS and reboot again. I'm fairly certain it'll show up for you after that. Sadly, same thing. Deleted profile, rebooted. Installed profile, rebooted. 14F5075a still shows to be most recent. Thanks for the replies and suggestions though! Greatly appreciated! [doublepost=1492453748][/doublepost]I'm good! Stupidity on my part! I wasn't paying attention to which apple.com link I was pulling up on my browser and it was directing me to the public beta downloads and not the developer.apple site. Thanks for all the suggestions! [doublepost=1492454854][/doublepost]Boooooooo! This beta doesn't fix the GPS issues the last beta caused. I didn't realize how much I rely on the phone's GPS until it quit working while I was in Colorado visiting a friend.

Apple today unleashed iOS 10.3.2 beta 3 to registered developers. If that’s you, then you can download the update by going to Apple’s Developer Center or Settings > General > Software Update on your iOS device. There haven’t yet been any major new features discovered in iOS 10.3.2, and it’s likely that it’ll stay that way until the public launch. Because it’s an x.x.1 update, the iOS 10.3.2 update is probably more focused on fixing behind-the-scenes bugs and performance improvements rather than introducing major new features. Apple today also released watchOS 3.2.2 beta 3 to developers. There’s no word yet on when either update will be released to the public.

The iPhone 5 is getting older which puts a greater importance on each update Apple releases for the former flagship. iOS updates for older devices can have a dramatic impact on performance. Sometimes its positive. Sometimes, unfortunately, its negative. Apple’s latest update to the iPhone 5 is a tiny upgrade that’s much smaller than iOS 10.3, the update Apple pulled for unknown reasons last week. If you’re making the move to iOS 10.3.1 from the iOS 10.3 update, your iOS 10.3.1 update will be very small, just a few megabytes. If you’re coming from something older than iOS 10.3 (and we expect most of you are) you can expect your update to be massive (several hundred MB) thanks to the features and fixes from iOS 10.3. Its features and fixes are baked into iOS 10.3.1. This roundup will take you through our impressions of the iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.1 update’s performance and it will guide you through some of the key things to keep in mind as we push toward Apple’s next iOS 10 release. We’ll continue to update this roundup with new details as we get them so keep an eye out for frequent changes. iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.1 Update: Impressions & Performance   1 / 9 The iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.1 update is a small one (if you're coming to it from iOS 10.3) and it'll only take you a few minutes to download and install. It took about 15 seconds to download and another five to install.  If you are coming to iOS 10.3.1 from iOS 10.2.1 or something older, your download/installation is going to take a lot longer.  Due to the file system change and the other features on board, the iPhone 5's iOS 10.3 update took about five minutes to download and upwards of 15 minutes to install on our device. That's abnormal for an iOS update and it means you'll need to pay extra attention to the installation process.  If you failed to install iOS 10.3, we recommend setting aside 30 quiet minutes where you can monitor both the iOS 10.3.1 download and installation without distractions. Moving onto the update's performance.  We've been using the iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.1 update for a week now and the update has been pretty impressive. We're using the update on an aging AT&T model.  The iPhone 5's battery continues to work miracles. We haven't noticed any abnormal battery drain during our time with iOS 10.3.1 though that could certainly change down the road. If you do notice weird battery drain, take a look at our list of tips. Chances are, it's not iOS 10.3.1 causing your problems. We've tested the iPhone 5 and its new update with several different ISPs, routers and Bluetooth devices. We haven't noticed any major issues during our time with the upgrade. AT&T's LTE and 4G networks are working fine as well.  Random reboots were an issue for us on iOS 10.2 but we haven't noticed any during our time on iOS 10.3.1. That's a big improvement, for us at least.  The most noticeable change, outside of the new features, is to the speed of the device's user interface. Animations and transitions are fast and fluid and we haven't experienced any lag when opening up Control Center.  We also haven't noticed any lag when opening up and closing folders, something we did see on iOS 10.2.1. The movement is crisp. There's still some jaggedness when opening up some apps but hey, the phone is going on five years old. iOS 10.3.1 is treating our iPhone 5 well though you'll want to approach the update with a bit of caution if you're having an excellent experience on iOS 10.3 or below.  For more on the merits of iOS 10.3.1, see our list of reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone.   1 / 9 12 Responses 12/19/2016 Facebook lite apk Reply i like ios 10.2 more than 10.1. power berry slow lost 02/24/2017 Kent Reply After installing 10.2.1 on my iPhone 5s I started getting random reboots. At least 10 per day. If plugged into the charger, the reboots seemed to go away. 02/27/2017 Jarvis Reply Hi guys, I am using iPhone 5s with ios 9.3.3. I am getting reminders to update to whitetail 10.2.1 I’m not sure though, if I should go for an update or not since Internet is poisoned about 30% battery bug in ios 10. I’m new to iPhone, have almost no past experience of ios. As of now I am pretty satisfied with ios 9.3.3 just sometimes it becomes difficult to click on( x) while trying to close search box with some other minor hiccups, don’t know if it’s a software issue or hardware on my device. I’m kinda liking the health app. Although it is not measuring the floors climbed while it’s counting the steps taken. I am told it will count the floors climbed after I updated to 10.2.1 which kind of sounds weird. Please suggest me the right course of action. By the way what’s Jailbreak? Hoping to hear from you soon. 03/03/2017 Natasha Reply Updated to 10.2.1 yesterday and my phone wont start at all and has been at the Apple logo + loading bar screen for over 24 hours. :( 04/17/2017 Justice B. Reply Try a hard reset, hold down the power and volume buttons until you see the apple logo (~10 seconds). Just a suggestion, I don’t know if you’ve tried it yet but it worked for me 03/21/2017 Simone Reply I’ve been using iOS 10.2.1 on my iPhone 5c and I’m having really abnormal battery life it’s chargimg really fast and then when I use it for about 10 minutes it’ll go down by 20% I’ve restated and rebooted my phone but my battery life is still really abnormal please fix this 04/01/2017 Rick Devereux Reply I’m wondering if the disappearance of my toolkit with calculaor, flashlight, etc that used appear on first opening with an UP Slide before entering passcode had anything to do with the 10.2.1 software? The only thing I get now when I Up Slide on opening is a Music tool that does absolutely nothing for me as I don’t keep music on this phone. I can’t get rid of it no matter what I try, and I don’t know where to find the calculator, flashlight etc. I feel like I Apple just took my Swiss Army knife. grrr. 04/12/2017 Amy Reply I, too, was devastated when my toolkit went away. I thought , for sure, Applem had just sucked all of the joy from my life. Then, I swiped left…. 04/12/2017 Amy Reply I, too, was devastated when my toolkit went away. I thought , f had just sucked all of the joy from my life. Then, I swiped left…. 04/04/2017 Tester CPU Reply Best update for iPhone 5c ever. Battery go from 5 hours to 6,5-7! Speed and reactions. Nice. 04/04/2017 Fendi Reply Cara donlowd bbm versi lama Dan perbaharui ios 7.1.2 ke ios 8.0 04/11/2017 ANNOYED Reply WARNING !!! do NOT update the latest software for iphone if you have an iphone 5. Update 10.3.1 will continually ask you for to enter your passcode whether you have ever had one or not. It will not restart without one. I contacted Apple eventually through their help web site and although helpful at first and promising to call me back if we got cut off while they spoke to higher authority for a solution. THEY DID NOT. They came back after the first referral saying they needed at least 30 mins or so for me to hold on. I did and got cut off. No follow up and now the help support site seems to have crashed and even blocked my job referral email link they sent me advising me to find an alternative solution!! The only solution offered was to reformat and clear my phone as it had to have a passcode to unlock it after the update. I have had my iphone 5 since they first came out and it has never been locked or had a passcode or a finger print (they kept repeating this question) used. Not sure what to do now so I will go into an APPLE store tomorrow and hopefully they can either have found a fix for this problem or restore my phone to 10.3 which was working fine! Obviously I do not want to loose all my data and more importantly my photos of my new granddaughter who visited the other week. I WILL NEVER DO ANOTHER UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOT HAPPY APPLE!!!!!!!!!!

Apple gets the green light to test self driving cars on California roads The special permit lets Apple retrofit three 2015 Lexus SUVs with the hardware and software necessary to drive themselves, according to the Wall Street Journal. It also allows for six people who will ride in the cars and take over driving when necessary. Assuming Apple has been conducting successful Project Titan tests on closed tracks, the next logical step it to move to public roads where there are far more variables for a car to cope with. Does that mean Apple is a step closer to introducing its own self driving car? Maybe. Apple reportedly scaled back its car plans late in 2016 under the guidance of project leader Bob Mansfield to focus on software for autonomous vehicles. The team still has about 1,000 people, although Apple isn’t confirming anything—including that there even is a Project Titan. Assuming Apple is working on software only, tests still need to happen. That means outfitting cars with the necessary hardware—like three Lexus SUVs—and putting them on the road. Those tests need to happen on closed tracks and public roads, which fits nicely with the permit California’s Department of Motor Vehicles just gave Apple. It also fits with Apple making its own car. Testing the hardare and software elements for assisted and autonomous driving can happen on different cars, and it keeps Apple’s own designs secret. As TMO’s Bryan Chaffin said, it’s Schrödinger’s Car. It’s a complete car and it’s just software for other cars until Apple says otherwise. The permit doesn’t do anything to clear up exactly what Apple’s autonomous car plans are. It does, however, tell us Project Titan is still moving along. We just don’t know what direction it’s heading.

Photo: iFanr Keeping one of millennials’ favorite features — the all-important selfie camera — poses serious challenges for Apple engineers if the iPhone 8’s bezels are as thin as we expect. In a new mockup based on alleged iPhone 8 schematics that recently leaked, fans can get an early look at how Apple might make the entire front of the iPhone one giant display while also leaving room for light sensors, a speaker and a camera. Take a closer look: An OLEd display could make this possible. Photo: iFanr The top of iFanr’s mockup shows a 3-D sensor to the left of the speaker. To the right sits the camera and light sensor. Unlike the iPhone 8 schematics from last week that showed a Touch ID button on the back of the device, this concept embeds Touch ID into the display. Previous iPhones all packed sensors in the top bezel above the display. By using an OLED display on the iPhone 8, Apple could put the sensors directly behind the screen (as it did with Apple Watch, the first Apple product with an OLED display). The back of the mockup shows Apple switching to vertical dual-lens cameras. Instead of putting the flash on the side, it’s been moved in between the two lenses. Apple isn’t expected to unveil the iPhone 8 until this fall, so there’s plenty of time for things to change. Rumored features Apple is expected to add include wireless charging, AI-powered Siri, 3-D sensors and improved cameras. Leave a comment .

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Rumor Apple Wants LG to Get Into the OLED Manufacturing Business for 2018 iPhone Lineup By Omar Sohail 16 hours ago 27Shares Share Tweet Submit As most of you know, Apple has partnered with Samsung for the latter’s OLED panels for the Cupertino tech giant’s 2017 and possibly 2018 iPhone lineup. This marks the first time that the tech giant will be making a transition to OLED panels and the iPhone 8 is going to be the first recipient to feature the new display technology, resulting in brighter colors and better battery life. Thanks to Samsung’s massive hold on the smartphone OLED market, Apple will have no choice but to keep a healthy relationship with the manufacturing giant. However, according to the latest rumor, the iPhone maker has plans to bring LG into the fold of OLED production. Related Apple iPhone 8’s Design Drawings Reveal Dimensions, Screen Size, 3D Sensors & More Bringing LG Display to Mass Produce OLED Panels for 2018 iPhone Family Means Apple Will Have Greater Command on Pricing Negotiations According to a report, Apple approached LG Display with the intention of getting the manufacturer to mull over mass producing OLED panels for future iPhones. Now here is where the problem lies: LG does not have sufficient experience in making small OLED panels, which is why you continue to see IPS LCD displays on the likes of LG V20 and the G6. However, OLED-info claims that it is the sole supplier of OLED panels for the Apple Watch but in comparison to iPhone sales, the wearable’s numbers are extremely small. That being said, looking at the number of iPhones that are sold annually, LG will have to increase its production output and that will mean investing heavily in production facilities that can produce small to medium-sized OLED panels. Advertisement Though LG Display can experience a fair amount of growth in the OLED market by partnering with Apple, the California-based company also wants to reduce dependency on Samsung, like it has with several other manufacturers that supply it with key components. Related iPhone 8 to Feature Invisible Selfie Camera and Touch ID Sensor That’s Beneath the Screen for Maximum Bezel-Less Display There are few things that Apple is able to control and it is making sure that it can tighten its grip over that control. That would mean making its custom graphics processors and getting on with Imagination Technologies in the future. Which company do you think is going to be the ultimate winner out of this future partnership? Let us know your thoughts down in the comments.

Apple AirPods: The Good, Bad and Ugly About The Wireless Headphones. April 17, 2017 by Staff   Filed under News, Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns 1 Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) Apple AirPods reviews are doing rounds everywhere on the internet. For some users, the new wireless headphones make you a complete alien, while for some people, it is the future. Of course the AirPods are not a small deal as the tiny headphones even led Kristen Stewart to give them a try. But should you really buy AirPods? Is it worth paying US$159 for Apple’s AirPods? Here’s a careful analysis of the good, bad and ugly sides of the Apple AirPods. The Good As far as the features of Apple AirPods are concerned, the headphones come with the smartest technology available till date. The sensors tell the device whether they are in ear or out. You take them out and the music stops. Regardless of the device you use, the AirPods work efficiently with iPhones, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch as well. The battery lasts for five hours and a 15-minute charge can add 3 hours of life. The AirPods can survive for 24 hours with the charging case that comes with the package. Connectivity with Siri and auto pairing with Apple devices is flawless. Another good thing is that Apple has not kept AirPods limited to its devices. You can use AirPods on almost any non-Apple device. Note that Siri and pairing option will be absent in such cases. The AirPods are really comfortable and get fit perfectly. No matter whether you exercise, run or do some chores, they will not come out like the other headphones. You also don’t need to worry about your headphones getting caught in chair. That’s all you can find good in Apple’s new AirPods. The Bad The one thing about Apple AirPods is that they don’t fail in turning heads. Imagine yourself wearing Apple EarPods with their wires cut. That’s how you look when you wear Apple AirPods. An alien kind of feeling you get when you’re among people because the tech is still not widespread. But yes, it is not something really bad because when the cellular tablets arrived, strangers used to give weird look to those speaking on a giant mobile phone like device. No matter whether you find it a drawback or not, the lack of control is certainly a major flaw in Apple AirPods. Unlike the company’s wired EarPods, you don’t get any button to answer calls, turn volume up/down or change music. AirPods force you to do all this through Siri or directly through your device. If you really want to raise the volume, you will need to tap AirPods twice. Then Siri will be activated so you can ask her to raise the volume by saying “raise the volume” or something like that to finally get the volume up. No manual control, huh! The only good thing here is that you can reassign the activity that takes place after you double tap. Instead of activating Siri, you can assign the double tap to play or pause music. It will help you but your problems related to volume control and other abovementioned issues will remain the same. Apple’s new wireless headphones are easy to lose. If you are the one who keeps earphones anywhere, it is better you start learning to keep them in one place. If you are buying AirPods, the safest place to keep them is their case. But also make sure that you keep the case in a safe place because it is also a tiny piece. The Ugly Why do you buy headphones? A majority of us invests in new headphones because we expect better sound quality than what the free headphones can give. And when you’re investing US$159, you will surely expect them to give better sound. Now when Apple owns Beats, we expect the company to offer extraordinary sound quality in its headphones. Like I said that AirPods are Apple EarPod without wires, when it comes to sound quality, there is no difference. What you get from wired EarPods is what you will get from wireless AirPods. Do you really want to buy headphones that give you sound quality similar to 50-dollar headphones? It’s your choice, of course. Staff Writer; Corey Shaw Have any Tech Tips? News?

Read all about it below: Related articles Today's channel rundown - 17 April 2017 Today's channel rundown - 16 August 2016 Today's channel rundown - 15 September 2016 Today's channel rundown - 15 April 2016 Google's Russia deal Google has reached an agreement with the Russian authorities to open up its Android system to rival search engines in Russia, Reuters reports. The move comes after a two-year dispute with Russian competition authorities, which, according to the report, saw the country's competition watchdog, FAS, in 2015 declare that Google was breaking the law when it mandated that applications, such as Google's search tool, had to be pre-installed on mobile devices that use Android. The agreed-upon deal will see Google ditch its application demands on Android-based devices in Russia, as well as remove any restrictions on the pre-installation of rival search engines, Reuters said. IoT's latest malware Internet of Things (IoT) devices running Linux are at risk of a new variant of malware, according to the latest research cited by security partner LIFARS. The solution provider said that BrickerBot operates like Mirai - a malware program that targets, enlists and groups IoT devices into botnets for sweeping DDoS attacks. LIFARS notes there is one noticeable difference between the two malwares, however, which is that BrickerBot engages in PDoS - permanent denial of service attacks, which, according to the cyber security specialist, are specifically targeted at Linux/BusyBox-based IoT devices that leave their Telnet port open and exposed to the internet. Cloudera's IPO Software vendor Cloudera is pegging its share price at $12 to $14 a share in an IPO of 15 million shares, according to Seeking Alpha. By this reckoning, the Apache Hadoop-based software player will be valued at $1.79 billion, based on 128M shares outstanding expected after the offering, Seeking Alpha's figures note. The vendor has previously been valued at $4.1 billion, when in 2014 Intel snapped up a chunk of the company for $30.92 a share. The chip vendor may be on course to buy 10 percent of the forthcoming IPO, Seeking Alpha said. Apple's cars Apple Friday secured a permit for autonomous vehicle testing in California, according to various news outlets. Fox Business reported Friday that the permit was awarded by California's Department of Motor Vehicles and that it is Apple's first for autonomous cars. The outlet also noted that the permit allows Apple to test its cars on public roads. The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, described the issuing of the permit as "the clearest sign to date of progress in [Apple's] secretive efforts to develop self-driving car technology". Apple is pitting itself against Tesla, Google, Uber and General Motors, according to Seeking Alpha. Semiconductors' revenue Worldwide semiconductor revenue is set to hit $386 billion in 2017, according to the latest research from Gartner. The analyst said that the 12.3 percent rise comes after favorable market conditions meant an increase in momentum in Q2 2016, in particular for commodity memory. This will likely be corrected, however, in 2019 by additional capacity in DRAM and NAND flash, according to Jon Erensen, research director at Gartner. "While price increases for both DRAM and NAND flash memory are raising the outlook for the overall semiconductor market, it will also put pressure on margins for system vendors of smartphones, PCs and servers," Erensen said.

(Image: REUTERS/Thomas Peter) Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak believes that Apple, Google and Facebook will be bigger in 2075 and dominate the world. "Apple will be around a long time, like IBM (which was founded in 1911)," USA Today quoted Wozniak as saying on Sunday. "Look at Apple's cash ($246.1 billion, as of the end of its last fiscal quarter). It can invest in anything. It would be ridiculous to not expect them to be around (in 2075). The same goes for Google and Facebook," he added. sponsored Wozniak was speaking ahead of the Silicon Valley Comic Con (SVCC), which is themed as "The Future of Humanity: Where Will We Be in 2075?" The three-day conference, which Wozniak helped create last year, would explore the intersection of pop culture and technology. SVCC is expected to draw 75,000 to 100,000 from April 21-23 in San Jose. Wozniak has always dominated the list of people who make accurate predictions. In 1982, he said portable laptops would emerge and he has strong opinions on how we would live in 58 years. He made some other predictions on what type of planet we can expect in 2075. Also read: Infosys to Ramp up Local Hiring in US Amid Visa Concerns He said that deserts could be ideal locations for cities of the future, designed and built from scratch. There, housing problems will not exist and people will shuttle among domed structures. Special wearable suits will allow people to venture outside, he noted. Wozniak added that within all cities, AI would be ubiquitous. Consumers will interact with smart walls and other surfaces to shop, communicate and be entertained. "Medical devices will enable self-diagnosis and doctor-free prescriptions. The question will be ethical, on whether we can eliminate the need for physicians," he said. The technology entrepreneur is also convinced that a colony will exist on the Red Planet. He envisions Earth zoned for residential use and Mars for heavy industry. He said that there is no chance that people on Earth would be able to communicate with extraterrestrials. "There is a 'random chance' that Earthlings will communicate with another race. It's worth trying but I don't have high hopes," he said. Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs in 1976 and developed the 1976 Apple I computer. He primarily designed the 1977 Apple II, while Jobs oversaw the development of its unusual case and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply.

Steve Jobs’ custom Apple I and other historic machines are on display at Seattle museum Posted 13 hours ago by Devin Coldewey 0 SHARES Next Story New York’s Taxi commission to propose in-app tipping requirement for Uber Advertisement Long before the iPhone or even the Mac, Apple was a handful of people working in an industry that was only just beginning to take the idea of personal computing seriously. In the earliest days of those early days, Steves Wozniak and Jobs made their first device together: the Apple I. Few of these were sold, and fewer still survive — but the Living Computers museum in Seattle managed to get three. And one of them was Jobs’ personal machine. Paul Allen, the museum’s founder and patron, has caused to be assembled quite an impressive collection of devices from Apple’s history, many of which have been restored to working condition. The public will be able to tinker with a NeXT Cube as well as early Macs, but the pride and joy of the collection must be the Apple Is. The new exhibit, which highlights the collaboration and competition between Apple and Microsoft over the years as the companies grew, is open today. apple1working INF_3081 INF_3056 INF_2109 IMG_0433  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit The Apple I, you may or may not remember, wasn’t much of a hit. Only 200 were made — by hand — and it wasn’t long before the company put its hopes in the Apple II, which would go on to be more popular by far. One of the Is, however, Jobs kept in his office as a demo machine for industry people. When Jobs left in 1985 he left in a hurry, and this I was left behind on a shelf. Don Hutmacher, one of the company’s first employees, grabbed it and it stayed in his possession until he passed away last year. His wife generously allowed the museum to take care of it, and you can imagine their gratitude. Latest Crunch Report Uber Might Have To Support Tips | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes The team had their suspicious, but a tag inside the metal chassis — and the fact that it had a chassis at all, since Apple Is came just as boards — suggested it was more than a rare Apple I; it was the rarest. It’s signed “BF,” which would have been employee number one, Bill Fernandez. This was definitely, the team decided, Jobs’ custom machine. Because the Apple I didn’t have a ROM, and Jobs didn’t want to have to program it from scratch any time someone wanted to see it in action, he had a custom EPROM attached to it that initialized the computer with BASIC when it started up. Its RAM, the engineering team suspects, was also augmented so it didn’t run out and crash during the demo. The team at the museum read the contents of this EPROM and used it to set up a second, less historic Apple I. That one, which has had its power components modified to be a little less prone to catching fire or warping the circuit board, will now be available in this primed state for anyone to play with. Yes, anyone — the only operational Apple I on the planet right now, and your kid can type “butts” on it with fingers still greasy from the sandwich they got across the street. Crunchbase Steve Jobs Bio Steve Jobs was the co-founder and CEO of [Apple](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/apple) and formerly [Pixar](/company/pixar). Steve Jobs was born in San Francisco, California to Joanne Simpson and a Syrian father. Paul and Clara Jobs of Mountain View, California then adopted him. In 1972, Jobs graduated from Homestead High School in Cupertino, California and enrolled in Reed College in Portland, … Full profile for Steve Jobs That’s the mission of the museum, though: the Apple I, along with dozens of other ancient computers, from Altairs to mainframes from the 60’s, are deliberately there to be touched and, if not truly understood (few kids know BASIC these days), at least experienced. Ahead of the exhibit’s opening, a small reunion was held for a handful of people who had a hand in the early days of Apple, Microsoft, and the home computer industry. Steve Wosniak and Paul Allen met — for the first time, amazingly — and chatted over an Apple II. And it wasn’t until someone took stock of the situation that they realized that the entire original team that built the Apple I in Steve Jobs’ garage — minus the departed Steve — were together again for the first time in decades: Apple 1 Team Retouched Paul Allen and Woz Apple Group with Labels V3  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit The museum has also been working with the University of Washington to compile an oral history of this era of computing, and many of the people who figured in the creation of the Apple I. Now that the exhibit is open, feel free to drop by the museum and touch a few pieces of computing history — though you may need to brush up on your BASIC. 0 SHARES Featured Stories 10 years of hope and hard lessons on the Facebook Platform 9 hours ago | Josh Constine PSA: Going to a music festival?

The launch of the new modular Mac Pro is at least a year away as development has just started, so we have no idea what the machine will look like when it's finished, but that hasn't stopped designers at CURVED/labs from dreaming up a conceptual design that includes a simple Mac mini-style box and a matching Apple-branded display. The imagined Mac Pro features a design that's entirely upgradeable, with two slots for full-sized graphics cards, rotating housing sides, and easily accessible sections for the processor, RAM, and storage. Holes on the top are designed to allow hot air to escape, and there are added features like a Touch ID power button, a Touch Bar for accessing information on included components, and USB-C, USB-A, and HDMI ports, along with a microphone and a headphone jack. Accompanying the imagined Mac Pro is a revamped 27-inch Apple "Cinema Display" with ultra thin bezels, an iMac-style stand, and and USB-C ports at the back. Again, this is in no way representative of what the finished Mac Pro might look like, but it does imagine features that are in line with what Apple executives have said about the Mac Pro so far. It's going to be a high-end high-throughput machine that will facilitate regular upgrades to meet the needs of Apple's pro user base. And given its modular nature, it will ship with an Apple-branded "pro" display. Apple is in the process of "completely rethinking" the Mac Pro and execs say it will take "longer than this year" to finish. What that means is not entirely clear, but one rumor has suggested it might not launch until 2019. Apple has a dedicated team working on the machine, which will serve the company's "most demanding pro customers."

They never look like something Apple would design because they're almost always based off of old designs that they aren't going back to. And that monitor would never even stand upright. It's like this designer doesn't know how gravity works... that, or they assume gorilla clue on the bottom of the base plate.

What the hell is the obsession with size? I'd like to see a concept that shows the modular Mac Pro as big, or bigger, than the old cheese grater tower. Edit: Yes, I see it says "two slots for full-sized graphics cards" - with no room for anything else inside. Not that it could run two full-sized graphics cards considering there is no room for cooling or fans. Rating: 18 Votes mikeandbecka 6 days ago at 12:14 pm um no. This looks horrible.

The iPhone manufacturer’s name is plainly listed on the California Department of Motor Vehicles website as an approved autonomous vehicle tester within the state’s borders. Apple stands out on the list, which otherwise constitutes recognizable car companies and tech start-ups; Nissan, Subaru, Tesla, and Udacity are among them. May the speculative fanboys and dry-cut industry analysts get their engines started: Apple is formally outed as a consumer tech company pursuing automotive interests. MORE: The Apple Car: What We Know About the Company's Secret Project “Project Titan” was the codename applied to Apple's driverless car efforts, and the company has lately been hiring employees from Tesla. California’s legislative environment has been largely receptive to adopting robust driverless car laws. As the most populous state in America, it sees significant traffic mortality on its roadways: some 3,000 people die in California traffic accidents every year, and an estimated 90 percent of these incidents are the result of human error. The driverless appeal is clear to the Golden State: By removing the human variable from transportation, autonomous vehicle technology presents itself as a lifesaving technology. There’s still a way to go, as this technology is far from mainstream. California’s driverless vehicles are only legal for testing purposes for now; a trained operator is required to be behind the wheel at all times, regardless of the extent to which he or she is or isn’t steering.  MORE: The 32 Best Cars to Buy Now There’s also an important mechanism missing from the current legislation: a formal structure to certify a driverless car as roadworthy. Instead, companies will self-certify autonomous cars, which doesn’t sit well with one expert. Ryan Calo, robotics law expert and law professor at the University of Washington, tells WIRED this system is like “going to the DMV and saying, believe me, I’m an excellent driver... It makes me a little nervous, honestly.” Calo suggests it’d be better to see a universal standard upheld, or at least have third-party approval. But these remain nascent times for the seemingly inevitable driverless car paradigm. Google is widely identified as the main driverless car company after successfully helping pitch the idea to the general public, but the reality is that the mainstream driverless car of the future will only be made possible by lots of companies working to solve the same problems. And now we know Apple will be one of them. Want More? Sign up for our newsletter to get the latest adventures, workouts, destinations, and more.

Frequent Weibo leaker KK has shared renderings of what appears to be an iPhone 8 with a curved screen that covers the entire front of the device. An accompanying dimensional drawing shows that the bezel around the edge of the display is only 4mm thick, with the curved glass on either side of the screen accounting for 2.577mm of that width. The device itself measures 137.54 x 67.54 mm, which is roughly the same size as the iPhone 7 , but the screen is 5.768 inches diagonally - almost identical to the Galaxy S8. (Photo: ifanr.com) This suggests that it might share the Galaxy S8's unusual 18.5:9 aspect ratio, although the images do not confirm this. The drawing shows a narrow earpiece at the top of the screen, with the selfie camera, microphone and other sensors on either side. Read More iPhone 8 could have a MUCH longer battery life if Apple decides to make this one change The renderings suggest that these components will all be concealed below the glass, although it is unclear how this would work in reality. The Samsung Galaxy S8's 'Infinity' display (Photo: Daily Mirror / Sophie Curtis) With the display filling the entire front of the device, there is no dedicated Home button and no visible Touch ID sensor. Apple is rumoured to be trying to build Touch ID into the iPhone's display, but the company is reportedly struggling to perfect the technology, so it could resort to putting the sensor on the rear of the device. Read More Samsung DROPS one of the Galaxy S8's key features just days before launch One of the renderings shows the back of the phone with a new vertical dual camera setup, but no obvious dedicated Touch ID sensor (Photo: ifanr.com) The veracity of the new images can not be confirmed, but KK has on several occasions shared accurate details about previous devices, according to MacRumours . iDrop News and Benjamin Geskin posted their own mockups a few days ago, showing a very similar design. Read More Samsung Galaxy S8 vs Google Pixel: Which Android smartphone comes out on top? KK suggests that the new iPhone could be called the iPhone 8 , or alternatively the iPhone X or iPhone Edition. (Photo: ifanr.com) Apple is not expected to unveil its next iPhone until September, so even if the renders are accurate, the design could still change before then. However, given the praise that the Samsung's Galaxy S8 display has been met with so far, it would be unsurprising if Apple went down a similar route with its next iPhone.

Follow Sign in / Sign up Home Facebook Apple Google Publishing News Quality SUBSCRIBE TO THE MONDAY NOTE Jean-Louis GasséeBlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Apr 16 United: Broken Culture by Jean-Louis Gassée Credit: money.cnn.com In the aftermath of the abominable United Airlines incident, allow me to offer some thoughts about customer service, company cultures and the underlying sick process of regulatory capture. I’m a recovering Parisien. You know the type, sarcastic, seen-it-all, Gauloise hanging from the lower lip, concisely captured by an unknown artist: (There are enough tribe members to sustain a site that sells related paraphernalia.) True Parisian shopkeepers are dismissive of pesky customers unless they’re regulars, members of the circle. Our rue du Bac butcher once steered me away from a cut: “No, this one’s for the clientèle de passage’’, passers-by he’d never seen before and would never see again. When I was selected to run Apple France more than three decades ago, I had a disdainfully Parisien attitude to customer service. You inserted an interface card backwards and your Apple ][ no longer boots? Well of course it doesn’t…you did it wrong. After a few combative customer service encounters, I experienced an epiphany: No matter how “wrong” they may be, we're a prosperous business, we can afford to take care of these situations, but we can’t afford to let unhappy, affronted customers damage our reputation. Whenever a call was escalated to my office, I would immediately offer to buy back the customer’s machine. The offer was always emphatically declined, so we moved on to arrangements for shipment or perhaps a personal appointment at our service shop. Our business concluded, I would ask if the happy caller had children: “Yes…but why?” “For the t-shirts, of course, a small thank-you for bringing your problem to our attention…what sizes would you like?” A stray behaviorist in our ranks protested that I shouldn’t condition customers to complain, that it would result in more and more jeremiads. I disagreed, claiming that people don’t actually like to complain, and, indeed, we never had any scheming or deranged kvetchers. Over time, a customer service theorem emerged. When a customer brings a complaint, there are two tokens on the table: It’s Nothing and It’s Awful. Both tokens are always played, so whoever chooses first forces the other to grab the token that’s left. For example: Customer claims something’s wrong. I try to play down the damage: It’s Probably Nothing…are you sure you know what you’re doing? Customer, enraged at my lack of judgment and empathy, ups the ante: How are you boors still in business?? But if I take the other token first and commiserate with Customer’s complaint: This Is Awful! How could we have done something like this? Dear Customer is left with no choice, compelled to say Oh, it isn’t so bad…certainly not the end of the world.. It’s simple, it works….even in marriages, I’m told. There’s no downside to taking the It’s Awful position. If, on further and calm investigation, the customer is revealed to be seriously wrong, you can always move to the playbook’s Upon Further Review page. Which leads us to United Airlines’ customer service catastrophe last week. It started simply. United Flight 3411 was sold out (not overbooked) and all passengers were seated. At the last moment, four United personnel needed to be ferried from Chicago to Louisville and the ground staff dutifully asked for volunteers to cede their seats. By Federal Regulation (good luck trying to parse those if you’re not an attorney), airlines can offer up to $1,350 plus “other considerations” for each volunteered seat. The auction started, nobody budged; the offer was sweetened, still nothing. For reasons unknown, the compensation stopped at $800 (some say $1,000) and United staff selected four passengers using a secret sauce algorithm. Three of the “volunteers” disembarked without incident, but the fourth, Dr. David Dao, politely declined. That’s when United’s staff made a costly mistake, one that’s likely to be measured in hundreds of millions of dollars: They asked Chicago Aviation Security to forcibly remove the “offending” passenger. The video of a bloodied Dr. Dao being dragged in the aisle has been seen millions of times around the world. He ended in the hospital with a concussion, a broken nose and two broken teeth. It’s tempting to focus on United’s ground staff — what were they thinking? — but the bigger problem is United’s culture, the system of restrictions and permissions that denied the staff the authority to up the volunteer ante yet granted them power to ask for the violent removal of a customer. And in questions of culture, top management is the real culprit. United staff in Chicago showed poor judgment, but their bosses are guilty of having fostered a culture where this behavior is possible if not encouraged. Speaking of management, we now turn to United CEO Oscar Muñoz and his incomprehensible handling of Dr. Dao’s brutal removal. In a letter to United employees, Muñoz reassured his troops that he stood behind them, and that while he “deeply regret[s] this situation”, United “had no choice” but to manhandle the“disruptive and belligerent” Dao. Unsurprisingly, Muñoz’s message was universally panned for its tone-deaf, Orwellian language. As Time magazine asked, “United Airlines ‘Reaccommodated’ a Passenger. Is That the Euphemism of the Year?” What should he have said? “This is Awful. How could we have let something like this happen? As CEO, this is on me, this was on my watch.” There’s always time to discover more facts once the dust has settled and re-apportion responsibilities, but by relying on questionable sources — i.e. the United employees, themselves — Muñoz jumped to the wrong conclusions and blamed the victim. More than 48 hours after the beating, Muñoz offered a stronger apology, close to what he should have said in the first place: “This shouldn’t have happened and I’ll make sure it never happens again.” Some say Muñoz should fire his head of PR. No. As CEO, Muñoz has final edit on all of the company’s PR drafts; he’s the one who let the damaging statements go out. (Supreme irony: Just a few weeks ago, PR Week magazine gave Muñoz its Communicator of the Year 2017 award.) In the meantime, United stock has taken a beating, as has the company’s already so-so reputation. Besides the video viewed around the world and the deserved jokes (“Welcome to Southwest, where we beat our competitors, not our passengers”), there will be one or more costly lawsuits. As expected, politicians are jumping into the fray, demanding answers, pointing fingers. The grand prize goes to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie who wants U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to end airline overbooking. This is the same Chris Christie whose Bridgegate scandal cost Oscar Muñoz’s predecessor his job. I’m not making this up; see here. This leads us to the second and more important culture layer: Regulatory capture. What do our elected solons do once they get to Washington? They love their jobs and their taxpayer-subsidized healthcare and pension. So, they immediately start raising money for reelection. They don’t ask average schmucks for money; they go to lobbyists for pharma, Wall Street, insurance, telcos, energy conglomerates…and airlines. As their part of the courtship, our officials push through the regulations that these companies and industry groups have paid for (and written?), and kill the proposals that they don’t like. Indirectly but indisputably, our representatives give the service industry permission to treat paying customers with condescension and abuse. Let’s make no mistake, the reaction to the United beating of Dr. Dao is a testament to a powder keg of frustration with airlines’s obfuscating rules and customer-hostile behavior. (United’s Contract of Carriage, the 38,000 words document that describes its terms of business, is available here, enjoy!) How many beatings do we need before oligopolistic US airlines change their behavior and treat us as the customers who pay their people’s salaries and execs’ compensation? — JLG@mondaynote.com Airlines Travel United Airlines Customer Experience 103 16 BlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Jean-Louis Gassée Follow Monday Note Media, Tech, Business Models viewed from Palo Alto and Paris Share 103 Never miss a story from Monday Note, when you sign up for Medium.

Sony A6500 iOS 10.3.2 beta 3 is currently only available in beta for registered developers. The public beta version of each update usually follows a few days after the developer version if not the same day. tvOS and watchOS are also available as beta updates, although public beta programs are not available. Apple’s iOS 10.3 release included Find My AirPods, a new APFS file system, CarPlay improvements, and much more. Fixed in this Release SiriKit The new SiriKit car commands should now work as expected. Third-Party VPN Apps Third-party VPN apps should now work as expected. Notes and Known Issues Managed and Shared Devices The ability to update devices from a remote server is in development and may not yet work as expected. openURL When a third party application invokes openURL: on a tel://, facetime://, or facetime-audio:// URL, iOS displays a prompt and requires user confirmation before dialing. Siri Siri text responses may be incomplete. SOS SOS is only supported in India. WebKit Safari now supports the prefers-reduced-motion media query. This query allows a web developer to provide alternate page styles for users who are sensitive to large areas of motion. Users can change their preference for reduced motion in the Accessibility section of System Preferences. The iOS 10.3 update removes support for SHA-1 signed certificates used for Transport Layer Security (TLS) in Safari and WebKit that are issued from a root Certification Authority (CA) included in the operating system default trust store. All other TLS connections will continue to support SHA-1 signed certificates until late 2017.

(File photo) New Delhi: Apple showing 'iPhone 7' as 'iphone 7 plus variant' is among 143 advertisements dubbed as misleading by regulator ASCI, which also pulled up Coca-Cola India, Bharti Airtel and others for such campaigns. Mobikwik, HUL, Nivea, Amul, Opera, Standard Chartered Bank and Pernod Ricard are among the companies against which a total of 191 complaints were received by Customer Complaints Council (CCC) of the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) for January. ASCI upheld a total of 102 complaints in healthcare category, 20 in education, seven in personal care, six in food and beverages and eight advertisements from other categories. According to ASCI, Apple India was found using a wrong image in its advertisement for iPhone 7. "The advertisement text states 'The amazing iPhone 7 is here', but shows an image of iPhone 7 Plus variant, which is misleading by ambiguity and implication," said ASCI. The sector watchdog said although the advertisement had the Apple trademark with 'iPhone7' but said it didn't have any reference to 'series' in the advertisement text. "In absence of any visual of iPhone 7 variant, it was concluded that the advertisement is likely to mislead the consumers about the product advertised and its corresponding features," it said. Comments from Apple could not be obtained. ASCI also upheld a complaint against Coca-Cola India for Thums Up campaigne, in which the soft drink major has showcased a rider performing a wheelie in normal streets, traffic conditions, right amongst a few people. "This is contradictory to the disclaimer made in the advertisement - the actions are for representational purposes alone and must not be copied by viewers... It was concluded that though the overall advertisement is not objectionable, regardless of the disclaimer the specific visual... encourages dangerous practices, manifests a disregard for safety and encourages negligence," it said. When contacted, a Coca-Cola India spokesperson said: "On receiving feedback, we have on boarded suggestions from ASCI and modified the TV commercial (TVC). The revised TVC has been updated on air and on digital media." Similarly, it has also pulled FMCG major HUL for its advertisement of Rin Antibac, where it had claimed that the detergent powder with Ayurvedic extracts removes germs. However, ASCI said the claim "was not substantiated, and is misleading by implication and exaggeration as the advertised product does not have the property to provide germ protection in wear conditions". Commenting on the matter, a HUL Company Spokesperson said: "We, as a responsible marketer and member of ASCI, have always complied with its guidelines and recommendations. We have suitably modified the said advertisement as per their recommendation." Similarly, Standard Chartered Bank's claim of "up to 10 percent extra cashback on all spends with your Standard Chartered credit card" was found to be "false and misleading by ambiguity" as the cash back was limited to Rs 10,000 only. When contacted Standard Chartered Bank said: "The up to 10 percent cash back offer was a campaign launched last year. The cash back cap and all other relevant details were shared with customers over multiple communication channels. However, ASCI felt that we needed to make certain modifications, and we have taken their inputs on board." The regulator also upheld three complaints against leading telecom operator Bharti Airtel for "misleading" claims for free Calls Local + STD and a free upgrade for Airtel-V Fiber. "The ad claim, "Free Calls Local + STD" cannot be said free as the prevailing price for data without advertised incentive is less i.e. from the consumer's point of view, they have to make a payment of Rs 149 to avail this offer although they get only 300MB data versus 500 MB data," it said However, when contacted Airtel declined to comment. Complaint against Opera Software Asa claim for its mobile browser Opera Mini was also upheld where it had claimed that it saves data cost up to 90 percent while browsing "The advertisement's claim, 'Saves data cost up to 90 percent while browsing', was not substantiated with supporting data and is misleading by exaggeration," the CCC said. When contacted an Opera spokesperson said:" We adhere to the highest ethical standards and never share any exaggerated or misleading data with our consumers. Hence, our claim of Opera Mini saving up to 90 per cent data in our advertisement, is entirely true. We have proven our claims by internal and external tests from time to time over the years." Digital payment firm MobiKwik also failed to substantiate its claim of "India's most secure e-wallet" for Mobikwik E-wallet and found to be "misleading by aggeration". It also upheld complaint against Gujarat Co-Operative Milk Marketing Federation for ad of Amul Butter where it had claimed it to be a rich source of Vitamin A and stated that "Eat milk with every meal and live every day, worry-free". "It was considered the latter part of the statement to be misleading by implication and is encouraging excessive consumption of butter which may not be advisable from the health point of view," it said. Similarly, FMCG firm Nivea was also pulled for claims in the commercial of Nivea Protect & Care Deodorant. It was "considered to be misleading by ambiguity and implication that several other major ingredients of Nivea Creme are added to the deodorant product". airtel amul Apple ASCI First Published: April 17, 2017, 9:58 PM IST Read full article Next Story Recommended For You John Terry To Leave Chelsea At the End Of Season Kishwer Merchantt, Suyyash Rai Delete Their Snapchat Account; Watch Video Tubelight Teaser Is Out and Has Got Us Very Excited About Salman's New Film LG G6 Coming To India In April 2017: Might Be Priced At Rs 49,999 Sakshi Tanwar Talks About Co-Star Ram Kapoor And Web Series Karrle Tu Bhi Mohabbat About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News Kulbhushan Jadhav Case: PIL Wants Centre to Approach ICJ Summer Tips: 5 Hairstyles You Could Try This Season TRAI Forms Subgroups to Weed Out Dated Rules MapmyIndia Launches 'Hey Map' in Collaboration With Indian Organisations How Spain Became The World Leader in Organ Transplants Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp E-Learning Franchise Opportunity CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

Not only should the top speaker of iPhone 8 be cut through the glass cover, but the OLED panel itself. Many bloggers and outlets that reported on the story have noted that this may not even be possible. As you can see for yourself, the technical illustration suggests that the Cupertino company might hide all of the components that are currently located on the handset’s top and bottom chin right underneath the display. That, in turn, could enable Apple’s engineers to create a full-front or a nearly full-front display for iPhone 8. Based on these drawings, other components could be hidden right underneath the OLED screen, including: Home button Touch ID Next-generation FaceTime 3D camera Ambient light sensors Proximity sensor Laser rangefinder Infrared transmitter and receiver Top speaker Other things we can glean from the diagram: Bezels on all four sides measure just 4 millimeters 2.5D curved glass at the edges The OLED screen stretches 5.768 inches diagonally Symmetric antenna lines in each corner No rear Touch ID (contrary to last week’s report) Vertically aligned dual-camera system out the back True Tone flash sits between the two rear cameras Chassis is 137.54 mm tall and 67.54 mm wide Curiously, iPhone 8’s thickness is not shown. Bear in mind that purported dimensions shown on these illustrations don’t match prior schematics. While the physical slit within the OLED screen might permit the integrated earpiece to function properly, it’s unclear if putting a camera and other components behind the display is technically possible. Now, Apple’s filed a number of patents over the past few years and some of them do suggest that the company has been looking into integrating the front sensors and the Touch ID fingerprint reader behind the display assembly. A good example is a particularly exciting patent for “Electronic devices having displays with openings,” which simply sounds too good to be true. In it, Apple proposes poking a series of microscopic thru-holes between the individual pixels of an OLED panel to let the underlying sensors gather image and light data, radio waves and acoustic signals. Apple’s patent promises sub-screen speakers, cameras, sensors and more. Needless to say, the Cupertino company patents a lot of technologies but only a fraction of its inventions ever make it into actual products. That said, I simply cannot get my head around the idea of an iPhone with a hole in the display. I mean, are you seriously trying to tell me that having missing pixels at the top is a good user experience? I’m not even sure how that might work in real life. Even Galaxy S8’s Infinity Display doesn’t cover the entire front face of the device. If Samsung could integrate the earpiece along with the camera and the sensors underneath the display, I’m pretty sure they would have done just that. A report this morning stated Apple has been struggling to integrate an optical fingerprint reader into iPhone 8’s display so there’s that. Could Apple out-design Samsung with iPhone 8, do you think? Source: iFanr Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend New report says iPhone 8 has a slightly curved display at the edges below 2.5D cover glass iPhone 8 may have (slightly) curved screen after all Apple reportedly orders 160 million OLED panels for iPhone 8 from Samsung Display OLED for iPhone 8 could add $50 million to Apple’s March quarter expenses Related Topics AMOLED, Apple, Display, iPhone, iPhone 8, Leak, News, OLED, Rumors, Screen Reinaldo Simões Why not use a bone conduction earpiece? Having a hole on a display doesn’t seem good in an UX/UI standpoint, it’ll obstruct top content. smtp25 What if that top area was only for status bar .. if you watched a full screen movie for example, that area could just stay black like the Letterboxing does today. 5723alex . If the body size of the iPhone 8 will be smaller than the iPhone 7+ I am not interested, no matter what the screen size will be. Rowan09 I want the same size as the + all screen and I would be fine with it. ic0dex The 7 Plus is just to wide. I got a chance to use the Note 7 for about a month, I wish they make the new iPhone in that same size with more display. James Coulee A 4mm bezel is the same as on the iPhone 4: I find it a bit difficult to believe… On the other hand, Starck’s cellphone design for Xiaomi was able to substitute the earpiece slit with a piezoelectric ceramic driver that sits behind the display: If it’s possible, I don’t see why apple wouldn’t pursue that avenue. James Coulee Just to add a different point about the “hole in the display”: it would for sure coincide with the status bar where we already have a bunch of pixels that are pretty much “dead”. Half of it doesn’t display anything. smtp25 +1 .. read your comment just as I was typing the same thing above to someone else   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Daily Deals: $196 Ecobee3 smart thermostat, $41 Xbox Live membership, and more Report: next-gen ‘iPhone Edition’ to feature stainless steel frame, vertical VR camera How to enable Dark Mode on YouTube You can now organize your saved Instagram posts into private collections Apple posts third betas of iOS 10.3.2, macOS Sierra 10.12.5, watchOS 3.2.2 and tvOS 10.2.1   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: Don’t Stop the Party!, NoMoreStories, StatusPeek2, & more… AirDrop Remover nixes the AirDrop button from iOS Share Sheets StatusPeek 2 replaces the Notification Center grabber with the Status Bar Don’t Stop the Party! keeps your music playing during resprings This tweak customizes the ‘iPhone is disabled’ text that appears after failed passcode attempts iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2017.

It can be downloaded by connecting the Apple TV to a computer with a USB-C cable and installing the beta software from a registered developer account using iTunes. Because of the installation requirements, tvOS betas are limited to developers. tvOS 10.2.1 will not be available to the public until the final version of the software launches. Apple does not typically provide detailed beta release notes, so we don't yet know what's included in tvOS 10.2.1. It's likely to focus primarily on bug fixes, security enhancements, and performance improvements, so we may not know what's new until the software sees an official release. No notable changes were found in the first two tvOS 10.2.1 betas, but should anything new popup in the third beta, we'll update this post.

The third beta of watchOS 3.2.2 can be downloaded through the Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General --> Software Update. To install the update, the Apple Watch must have 50 percent battery, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the iPhone. watchOS betas require an iPhone running iOS 10 to install, and they're only available to developers because there's no way to downgrade the software on an Apple Watch. It's not yet clear if watchOS 3.2.2 introduces any new features or bug fixes because Apple doesn't typically provide release notes for betas. Given that this is a minor 3.x.x update, it's likely to focus primarily on bug fixes.

Apple’s autonomous vehicle project has been the company’s biggest open secret for years, but on Friday the California DMV added Apple’s name to a list featuring 29 other companies testing self-driving cars. “The permit covers three vehicles, all 2015 Lexus RX450h, and six drivers,” a DMV spokeswoman said, backing up previous reports that Apple is now focused more on the self-driving component than in building its own vehicle from the ground up. Apple declined to comment on the story in its usual fashion, pointing to its previous statement that it is “investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems.” Comments « Rumor: iPhone 8 with Touch ID under glass one of two prototypes being tested Daily Deal: Anti-Gravity iPhone Case » Related Stories iTunes Podcasts gets rebranded as ‘Apple Podcasts’ NYU student documents 6 weeks working on iPhone assembly line Qualcomm countersues Apple, seeks damages for breach of contract Report: Apple may drop Dialog Semiconductor, build its own power management chips Apple releases second betas of iOS 10.3.2, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1 Apple among companies buying commercials created by ‘Saturday Night Live’ cast Subscribe to iLounge Weekly Recent News Apple offering superior iPad Air 2 for fourth-generation iPad replacements Rumor: iPhone 8 with Touch ID under glass one of two prototypes being tested Apple granted permit to test self-driving car in California Happy Easter weekend from iLounge! iTunes Podcasts gets rebranded as ‘Apple Podcasts’ Leaked image reveals ‘iPhone 8’ render with vertical cameras, rear Touch ID sensor Apple quietly working on non-invasive blood glucose monitoring sensors Apple updates TestFlight program with support for multiple builds Spotify partners with ‘Spotty’ developer to create official Apple Watch Analyst says integrated fingerprint scanner could hold up ‘iPhone 8’ release Recent Reviews Koogeek Wi-Fi SmartSocket for Apple HomeKit Sony MDR-1000X Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones FiiO i1 Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Adapter Blue Ella Headphones Apple iPad (Fifth-Generation) AudioQuest NightOwl Carbon Headphones ExoLens PRO with Optics by ZEISS Wide-Angle Lens Kit Blue Sadie Headphones Circle with Disney Parental Control and Internet Filtering System Pioneer Rayz Plus Lightning Connector Earphones Recent Articles Top Five: The Best Products for Building a Smart Home with HomeKit Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of watchOS 3 Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of tvOS 10 Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of iOS 10 Inside the betas: iOS 10 Photos gets Advanced Computer Vision Inside the betas: iOS 10 Music app delivers ‘clarity and simplicity’ Inside the betas: iOS 10 Maps gets a major redesign Inside the betas: iOS 10 shakes up the user experience Inside the betas: watchOS 3 promises a real speed boost Inside the betas: A sneak peek at what’s new in tvOS 10 Win Subscribe Buy ADVERTISE | CONTACT US Search Sign up for the iLounge Weekly Newsletter iLounge is an independent resource for all things iPod, iPhone, iPad, and beyond. iPod, iPhone, iPad, iTunes, Apple TV, Mac, and the Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc. iLounge is © 2001 - 2017 iLounge, Inc.

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES NEW DELHI: Apple showing 'iPhone 7' as 'iphone 7 plus variant' is among 143 advertisements dubbed as misleading by regulator ASCI, which also pulled up Coca-Cola India, Bharti Airtel and others for such campaigns. Mobikwik, HUL, Nivea, Amul, Opera, Standard Chartered Bank and Pernod Ricard are among the companies against which a total of 191 complaints were received by Customer Complaints Council (CCC) of the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) for January. ASCI upheld a total of 102 complaints in healthcare category, 20 in education, seven in personal care, six in food and beverages and eight advertisements from other categories. According to ASCI, Apple India was found using a wrong image in its advertisement for iPhone 7. "The advertisement text states 'The amazing iPhone 7 is here', but shows an image of iPhone 7 Plus variant, which is misleading by ambiguity and implication," said ASCI. The sector watchdog said although the advertisement had the Apple trademark with 'iPhone7' but said it didn't have any reference to 'series' in the advertisement text. "In absence of any visual of iPhone 7 variant, it was concluded that the advertisement is likely to mislead the consumers about the product advertised and its corresponding features," it said. Comments from Apple could not be obtained. ASCI also upheld a complaint against Coca-Cola India for Thums Up campaigne, in which the soft drink major has showcased a rider performing a wheelie in normal streets, traffic conditions, right amongst a few people. "This is contradictory to the disclaimer made in the advertisement -- the actions are for representational purposes alone and must not be copied by viewers... It was concluded that though the overall advertisement is not objectionable, regardless of the disclaimer the specific visual... encourages dangerous practices, manifests a disregard for safety and encourages negligence," it said. When contacted, a Coca-Cola India spokesperson said: "On receiving feedback, we have on boarded suggestions from ASCI and modified the TV commercial (TVC). The revised TVC has been updated on air and on digital media." Similarly, it has also pulled FMCG major HUL for its advertisement of Rin Antibac, where it had claimed that the detergent powder with Ayurvedic extracts removes germs. However, ASCI said the claim "was not substantiated, and is misleading by implication and exaggeration as the advertised product does not have the property to provide germ protection in wear conditions". Commenting on the matter, a HUL Company Spokesperson said: "We, as a responsible marketer and member of ASCI, have always complied with its guidelines and recommendations. We have suitably modified the said advertisement as per their recommendation." Similarly, Standard Chartered Bank's claim of "up to 10 per cent extra cashback on all spends with your Standard Chartered credit card" was found to be "false and misleading by ambiguity" as the cash back was limited to Rs 10,000 only. When contacted Standard Chartered Bank said: "The up to 10 per cent cash back offer was a campaign launched last year. The cash back cap and all other relevant details were shared with customers over multiple communication channels. However, ASCI felt that we needed to make certain modifications, and we have taken their inputs on board." The regulator also upheld three complaints against leading telecom operator Bharti Airtel for "misleading" claims for free Calls Local + STD and a free upgrade for Airtel-V Fiber. "The ad claim, "Free Calls Local + STD" cannot be said free as the prevailing price for data without advertised incentive is less i.e. from the consumer's point of view, they have to make a payment of Rs 149 to avail this offer although they get only 300MB data versus 500 MB data," it said However, when contacted Airtel declined to comment. Complaint against Opera Software Asa claim for its mobile browser Opera Mini was also upheld where it had claimed that it saves data cost up to 90 percent while browsing "The advertisement's claim, 'Saves data cost up to 90 per cent while browsing', was not substantiated with supporting data and is misleading by exaggeration," the CCC said. When contacted an Opera spokesperson said:" We adhere to the highest ethical standards and never share any exaggerated or misleading data with our consumers. Hence, our claim of Opera Mini saving up to 90 per cent data in our advertisement, is entirely true. We have proven our claims by internal and external tests from time to time over the years." Digital payment firm MobiKwik also failed to substantiate its claim of "India's most secure e-wallet" for Mobikwik E- wallet and found to be "misleading by exaggeration". It also upheld complaint against Gujarat Co-Operative Milk Marketing Federation for ad of Amul Butter where it had claimed it to be a rich source of Vitamin A and stated that "Eat milk with every meal and live every day, worry-free". "It was considered the latter part of the statement to be misleading by implication and is encouraging excessive consumption of butter which may not be advisable from the health point of view," it said. Similarly, FMCG firm Nivea was also pulled for claims in the commercial of Nivea Protect & Care Deodorant. It was "considered to be misleading by ambiguity and implication that several other major ingredients of Nivea Creme are added to the deodorant product".

On Monday, RBC Capital Markets lifted its 12-month price target to $157 from $155 and reiterated an outperform rating. That would increase Apple’s market capitalization to $824 billion from $740 billion currently. Apple’s stock hit a record high of $144.77 on April 4. Read Also: Apple approved to test driverless cars in California RBC analyst Amit Daryanani also increased his March-quarter iPhone estimates and fiscal 2017 revenue estimates, saying trends indicate consumer preference for Apple’s AAPL, +0.55% more expensive plus models, which have contributed positively to average selling prices. Also on Monday, Mizuho Securities reiterated a buy rating and $150 target, saying it expects Apple earnings to be in-line or slightly above estimates when it reports after the bell on May 2. While the company’s third-quarter outlook “could come modestly below estimates” as consumers delay planned upgrades ahead of the iPhone 8 launch in September, its large installed base and attractive valuation make it worthy of investment despite muted expectations, Mizuho said. See Also: Is San Francisco losing its tech talent to other cities? Analysts at Pacific Crest were cautiously optimistic as well. Andy Hargreaves warned that checks with suppliers suggest Apple is struggling with the optical fingerprint functionality expected on the OLED iPhone, which could lead to delays or the removal of it altogether. But he maintained his bullish quarterly estimates and reiterated an overweight rating and $150 target. Apple Loses Ground to Rivals in China(1:44) Apple is finding it hard to hold on to its slice of the Chinese smartphone market as the global giant faces tough competition from several homegrown brands -- Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi. Photo: Huawei/Oppo/Vivo/Xiaomi “While this creates some risk of production delays, at this point we do not believe it materially threatens volume through the coming iPhone cycle,” he said. The average rating on the stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average price target is $150.96, according to a FactSet survey of roughly 40 analysts. Shares of Apple inched 0.6% higher to $141.12 in Monday afternoon trade. The stock has rallied nearly 18% in the past three months and 28.5% in the past year, outperforming both the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.90% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.86% The DJIA has gained 4% in three months and 15% in the past year.

On Monday, RBC Capital Markets lifted its 12-month price target to $157 from $155 and reiterated an outperform rating. That would increase Apple’s market capitalization to $824 billion from $740 billion currently. Apple’s stock hit a record high of $144.77 on April 4.

Also on Monday, Mizuho Securities reiterated a buy rating and $150 target, saying it expects Apple earnings to be in-line or slightly above estimates when it reports after the bell on May 2. While the company’s third-quarter outlook “could come modestly below estimates” as consumers delay planned upgrades ahead of the iPhone 8 launch in September, its large installed base and attractive valuation make it worthy of investment despite muted expectations, Mizuho said.

If Apple introduces a new edge-to-edge display as expected, Touch ID will have to change from its bottom front location as the chin is dramatically reduced. The best case scenario based on rumors is that Apple manages to implement the fingerprint scanner into the new OLED display, although low yield rates may rule that out this year. The less desired scenario is Apple moves Touch ID to the backside like Android phones today. Now an analyst has floated what would likely be an even less popular scenario: no Touch ID. Sony A6500 Analyst Andy Hargreaves at Pacific Crest Securities called this a likely option in a new research note shared by MacRumors:  Likely options for Apple include a delay of production or elimination of fingerprint sensing on the OLED iPhone. We believe Apple continues to work on solving its optical fingerprint issues. If it’s able to solve the problems in the next month or so, it would likely place volume orders at that point. This would likely lead to a delay of the OLED iPhone launch, but we would not expect it to meaningfully affect volume for the cycle. If it’s not able to fix the problems in that time frame, Apple may be forced to eliminate fingerprint sensing from the OLED iPhone altogether. This possibility certainly raises a few questions. Why would Apple choose to eliminate Touch ID altogether on the flagship iPhone only to presumably reintroduce it in the future when it can be integrated into the display? In this scenario, cheaper iPhones would have Touch ID while the flagship model does not as we expect iterative updates to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus alongside the new design of the iPhone 8. Touch ID on the back wouldn’t be favorable to Touch ID on the current front location, but relying on facial recognition alone presents new challenges for both convenience and security. At this point it’s no guarantee which approach Apple will take with relocating Touch ID or replacing its functionality on the edge-to-edge display iPhone, but the idea that Apple is going to make some change to how Touch ID works this year is certainly not going away.

By Emily Bary April 17, 2017 10:35 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple plans to report earnings on May 2. Illustration: Getty Images Tech earnings kick off this week, with Netflix reporting results Monday afternoon. Investors will have to wait a bit until Apple releases its earnings on May 2, but Wall Street, of course, is already speculating about what the company may say. On Monday, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani laid out the six big things investors should look out for. Get the best of Barron's Next every weekday.

Investors will want to pay attention to the number of iPhones sold in the quarter as well as any indications about the sales “mix” -- the percentage of more expensive “Plus” models sold during the first three months of the year. Daryanani predicts that Apple sold 51.9 million iPhones in total, roughly in line with the consensus estimate. 2) Apple’s gross margin refers to how much it made in revenue relative to Apple’s costs of materials. Daryanani thinks that increasing consumer preference for the iPhone 7 family (versus older models), and especially for the iPhone 7 Plus, could help margins, but the rising costs of chips could offset that. RELATED: Apple’s MacBook Trouble is a Cautionary Tale 3) With so much cash on hand, Apple could raise its buybacks and dividend. He thinks Apple could bring its dividend yield up to about 2%, from 1.6% currently, and increase its share repurchase program to about $35 billion, from $30 last fiscal year. These are generally regarded as shareholder-friendly moves. Of course, someone on the company’s conference call could ask about any plans for big acquisitions. 4) Apple has placed a big emphasis on growing its “services” segment -- businesses like the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. Investors should keep an eye on whether services became a greater portion of overall revenue during the latest quarter. RELATED: Apple: It’s No Longer About the iPhone 5) While the focus of Apple’s commentary will be the past quarter, Wall Street is hungry for any new information or indications about the iPhone 8, expected out later this year. Any slippage in delivery past September could dent the stock. 6) Lately Apple’s operating costs -- essentially the costs of running the business -- have become a greater portion of revenue, and Daryanani suggests paying attention to whether this trend continues.

On Apple's support site, and on various other forums, many of them have described a strange 'popping' sound coming from their notebooks, similar to the sound heard when you "slowly squeeze a plastic bottle". The problem appears to affect the 15-inch MacBook Pro more than the 13-inch models, and while some describe the issue occurring at random, others say they've only encountered it when engaged in more intensive tasks, such as playing games or streaming videos. 9to5Mac reports that some speculation has focused on the possibility that plastic components or glue used in the device's construction are being affected by heat being generated by the laptop. One user said they were "able to constantly reproduce the sound by pressing right at the bottom of the screen assembly in the middle." Another user, who said the popping sound was as loud "as a trackpad click", told Business Insider that it happens "multiple times a day. Notably when i open the laptop - usually after about 30ish seconds, but not every time. And then every 20-100 minutes after that. Some users claimed that Apple had replaced parts of their MacBook Pros under warranty to try to fix the issue, without success. Others said that Apple had blamed the problem on a "dent" in the bottom casing of the device, requiring them to pay $130 for repairs, despite many users having described the same issue without such a dent present on their machines. Whatever the issue, it's clearly annoying, but it doesn't appear to be a serious problem. Even so, those paying as much as $4,299 for the new MacBook Pro would obviously prefer to use it without such irritations.

On Monday, RBC Capital Markets lifted its 12-month price target to $157 from $155 and reiterated an outperform rating. That would increase Apple’s market capitalization to $824 billion from $740 billion currently. Apple’s stock hit a record high of $144.77 on April 4. Read Also: Apple approved to test driverless cars in California RBC analyst Amit Daryanani also increased his March-quarter iPhone estimates and fiscal 2017 revenue estimates, saying trends indicate consumer preference for Apple’s AAPL, +0.55% more expensive plus models, which have contributed positively to average selling prices. Also on Monday, Mizuho Securities reiterated a buy rating and $150 target, saying it expects Apple earnings to be in-line or slightly above estimates when it reports after the bell on May 2. While the company’s third-quarter outlook “could come modestly below estimates” as consumers delay planned upgrades ahead of the iPhone 8 launch in September, its large installed base and attractive valuation make it worthy of investment despite muted expectations, Mizuho said. See Also: Is San Francisco losing its tech talent to other cities? Analysts at Pacific Crest were cautiously optimistic as well. Andy Hargreaves warned that checks with suppliers suggest Apple is struggling with the optical fingerprint functionality expected on the OLED iPhone, which could lead to delays or the removal of it altogether. But he maintained his bullish quarterly estimates and reiterated an overweight rating and $150 target. Apple Loses Ground to Rivals in China(1:44) Apple is finding it hard to hold on to its slice of the Chinese smartphone market as the global giant faces tough competition from several homegrown brands -- Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi. Photo: Huawei/Oppo/Vivo/Xiaomi “While this creates some risk of production delays, at this point we do not believe it materially threatens volume through the coming iPhone cycle,” he said. The average rating on the stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average price target is $150.96, according to a FactSet survey of roughly 40 analysts. Shares of Apple inched 0.6% higher to $141.12 in Monday afternoon trade.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « LG may announce in June whether they've decided to Enter Apple's OLED Supply Chain as Requested | Main | A Federal Appeals Court Upheld a Jury Verdict for Apple in a case brought by Conversant » April 17, 2017 Russian Court Approves the Government's Deal with Google over Android Monopoly Case   Last month Patently Apple posted a report titled "Russia's Federal Anti-Monopoly Service Finds Apple Guilty of Price-Fixing." Today Google's Android is in the spotlight in Russia. it's being reported that Russian anti-monopoly watchdog FAS and Alphabet Inc's Google have reached an out-of-court settlement in a dispute over the tech giant's Android operating system, FAS said on Monday.   Alexei Dotsenko, FAS deputy head, told reporters that "Google will no longer demand exclusivity of its applications on Android-based devices in Russia and will not restrict the pre-installation of rival search engines and other applications."   The TASS Russian News Agency added that "The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) and US Corporation Google are planning to announce the results of negotiations on a settlement agreement regarding the company abusing its dominant position in the Russian market of mobile application stores on the Android operating system (owned by Google).   On September 14, 2015 the Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized Google Inc. and Google Ireland Ltd. as having breached the competition protection law under the complaint of the Russian Internet company Yandex.   According to the regulator, Google obliged manufacturers of Android OS-based devices to pre-install its applications together with Android platform. FAS said that Google's policy restricted installation of applications by other developers. Google did not agree with the ruling and appealed to the court.   On September 29, Google started to notify Russian users of the Android devices about the possibility of changing the search engine, deactivating pre-installed applications, installing third-party services (including third-party search engines and widgets, email, calendar, and other services) and changing position of application icons. Google noted it continues to work with FAS on technical execution of their orders.   FAS also imposed the fine for abuse of market dominating position in the amount of 438 mln rubles (US$7.8 mln). The amount of the fine consists of 9% of company's turnover on the Russian market in 2014 plus inflation.   In Reuters report on this story today they've added that "As part of the agreement, Google will also develop a tool allowing users to choose a default search engine on their Android devices.   The deal was approved by a Russian court earlier on Monday, Dotsenko said, adding that it was for a term of six years and nine months."   If FAS has made Google bend on their platform, could Apple's iOS be next?   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

But how do you know your machine is completely up to date? There’s no one-size-fits-all maintenance solution, so let’s understand how updates for your Mac and its software work. For example, you don’t have to use the Mac App Store to install operating system updates. Apple’s desktop storefront only goes so far when it comes to updating the rest of your system too. It’s also possible that there are times when delaying an update makes good sense. Let us fill you in on the details. macOS Software Updates Periodic operating system updates often include some of the most important changes, and as such they should be applied as soon as possible. Apple frequently patches security holes that can leave your Mac vulnerable to attack. At the same time it improves general system stability and sometimes add’s new features. A good example is the addition of Night Shift in macOS 10.12.4 Use a Mac at Night? Night Shift and Other Apps That Can Save Your Eyes Use a Mac at Night? Night Shift and Other Apps That Can Save Your Eyes Apple just dropped the latest macOS Sierra update with relatively few changes apart from one standout feature: Night Shift. Read More , which uses a blue light filter in a bid to improve sleep quality. Apple also releases updates specific to bits of hardware like your MacBook trackpad, or changes to the recovery partition. These are all tailored to your specific hardware, so you won’t download anything you don’t need. Important: Before you apply any updates, you should ensure you have a recent Time Machine backup Partition & Use Your Time Machine Hard Drive To Store Files Too Partition & Use Your Time Machine Hard Drive To Store Files Too If your Mac's hard drive is small and your Time Machine hard drive is big, it might be worth using the drive for both backup and storage purposes. Read More or third-party alternative 5 Local Mac Backup Solutions That Aren't Time Machine 5 Local Mac Backup Solutions That Aren't Time Machine There are lots of Mac backup options out there, and many of them have features that Apple's default backup app just can't compete with.

Update via Mac App Store The easiest way to update your macOS is using the Mac App Store, which has been included in every version of Apple’s operating system since version 10.6.6. Launch it with Spotlight 7 Good Habits Every Mac User Should Get Used To 7 Good Habits Every Mac User Should Get Used To Today we're going to share our favourite good Mac habits, while desperately trying to forget the bad ones. Read More or by clicking the dock icon, click on the Updates tab and look at the top of the list. Apple’s own updates will always appear above everything else. They’re often grouped together, and you can click on More to see each pending update or choose to install them individually. Click on Install, after which the update will be downloaded and applied. Download Updates Manually Sometimes Apple rolls out updates slowly, so the latest version may not show up in the Mac App Store. Maybe you really don’t like the Mac App Store, or you want to update a number of machines using a single downloadable file. This is where Apple’s regular downloadable patches are handy. These take the form of regular updates and combo updates. Regular updates include only the most recent changes, whereas combo updates include all changes for the current major version of macOS. As an example, if you haven’t updated your Mac for a while and would like to update from 10.12.0 to 10.12.4, you’ll need the combo update. If you keep things updated and are only moving from 10.12.3 to 10.12.4, you can get away with the regular update. To find out which version of macOS you are using, click on the Apple logo in the corner of your screen, then select About This Mac. You can download these files from Apple Downloads. Simply mount the DMG as you would any other software, then run the PKG installer. Your Mac will restart and apply the changes, no Mac App Store necessary.

There might be a better way. Read More to another Mac. Major macOS Version Upgrades Apple is committed to a yearly software update cycle, which means a new major revision of macOS is released every year (usually in October). These major updates are referred to as upgrades, and they’re completely free to download. Each new upgrade has its own name and version number: macOS Sierra is 10.12, the next version will be 10.13. Upgrades are released via the Mac App Store also, and will likely appear in the Updates tab at the top of the screen when a new version is available. You will also find links on the Featured tab, check out the screenshot below. You can click Download to grab the latest update from the store. It’s possible to download the next version of macOS and save the installer How To Install macOS & Save The Installer How To Install macOS & Save The Installer It's really easy to save the macOS installer to avoid multiple downloads, and worth doing even if you only have the one Mac. Read More , which is highly recommended if you’re going to be updating more than one machine. The upgrade will download and place an installer file in your Applications folder. Simply run it to begin the upgrade process, but save the installer beforehand if you want it. Important: Major operating system upgrades can take a while to complete, so make sure you’re connected to a power outlet if you’re on a MacBook. You should also have a recent Time Machine or other backup, because things can go very wrong macOS Sierra Installation Issues? Fix Common Mac Upgrade Problems macOS Sierra Installation Issues? Fix Common Mac Upgrade Problems How do you spot a frozen installation? What if your Mac runs out of space mid-install? And how do you fix the problem when you can't access your computer normally any more? Read More . Delaying Major Upgrades There are valid reasons for delaying major upgrades, and provided you have the latest security updates installed for your current version of macOS then you’ll only be missing out on new features. The main reason to delay an upgrade is due to software compatibility. @PropellerheadSW Hey! I saw that Reason 7 doesn't work with OS Sierra… is this true? — Bobby Mares (@MyGenuineFind) January 16, 2017 If you’re using a piece of software that you simply can’t live without, make sure it works with the next version of macOS before you install. We recommend checking with the developer, or testing on a spare Mac if you have one. Every year Apple rolls out a major upgrade, and every year apps stop working till developers can patch them. Be smart and think ahead. macOS Public Beta Program Apple’s modern public beta program has been running for a few years now, allowing users to test software before it’s ready for mass-consumption. You can opt-in to the program on Apple’s Beta Software Program website: sign in with your Apple ID, download the public beta access utility to enroll your Mac, then check the Updates tab of the Mac App Store. #3 A copy of the Mac OS X Public Beta. pic.twitter.com/mtpQv9J78C — Thor Mitchell (@ThorMitchell) March 29, 2017 Apple’s public betas are far more stable than the early versions they seed to developers, but beta software is still unfinished. As such you might want to avoid using beta software on a Mac you depend on for work, study, or other important daily tasks. If you’ve enrolled in the program and decide you’ve had enough, head to System Preferences > App Store and click Change next to “Your computer is set to receive beta updates” to opt-out. Regular Software Updates In addition to system files, regular software needs to be kept up to date as well. For software installed via the Mac App Store, you can simply launch the store, and click on Updates. By default automatic updates are off, so you’ll need to update manually via this method. If you installed software from anywhere other than the Mac App Store, you’ll need to update the software by launching it and checking for available updates. This option can usually be found by clicking on the application’s name at the top of the screen, then selecting Check for Updates. Most apps will tell you when there’s an update available, and many will install new versions automatically — like Google’s Chrome browser. Some older software may even require that you manually download the latest version. You should avoid third party apps that promise to update other software for you, as this is a front commonly used to install malware. Turn On Automatic Updates The Mac App Store can be used to keep your software up to date. That includes regular third party applications and operating system updates too. You can turn this on under System Preferences > App Store. Important: If you don’t regularly run a Time Machine or other backup, it could be risky to automatically install operating system updates. If something goes wrong, you might wake up to a black screen and unresponsive Mac. You might even need to reinstall the operating system via the recovery partition, and you’ll lose anything you haven’t backed up. Malware Hidden in Updates? In March 2016, Mac torrent client Transmission became infected with malware, or ransomware to be precise. The app was hit again with yet more malware in August of the same year. The primary method for spreading the included malware was by including it in a software update. Transmission acted quickly on both occasions, but blindly trusting the installer had consequences for more than a handful of users. We even produced a list of alternative torrent clients for those concerned about future attacks 4 Transmission Alternatives for Mac BitTorrent Users 4 Transmission Alternatives for Mac BitTorrent Users Transmission was struck with malware twice in one year, so you might want to consider a new Mac torrent app. Read More . Need a torrent client for Mac – I used to use Transmission but hesitant to download b/c of malware infections. What do you folks use? — scott blitstein (@scoblitz) October 31, 2016 The main problem is that there’s no way of knowing if the app you’re about to update has been compromised until it’s too late. It’s a rare occurrence, and it’s even rarer for it to happen twice, but it’s never impossible. This is another great reason to back up your system regularly. Mac App Store updates are scrutinized by Apple themselves. So these shouldn’t pose too much of a threat. Software downloaded from the store is sandboxed too, a measure put in place to protect your system from unwanted changes. Have you got any questions about updating your Mac?

Your Apple smartwatch could soon help to monitor your blood sugar levels. Reports suggest Apple has hired a group of biomedical engineers who are secretly working on developing sensors to monitor glucose levels, a potentially life-changing development for people living with diabetes. The initiative was originally envisioned by the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs; he hoped to bring technology to a point where it could make a real difference to the lives of people struggling with illness. As it stands, it's incredibly difficult to read the blood sugar levels of individuals without piercing the skin. The wearable devices, if created successfully, would help monitor important vitals, such as oxygen levels, heart rate, and blood glucose non-invasively. Advertisement According to  CNBC, the group of engineers have been working at a remote location for the last five years. They're working to develop optical sensors, which involves shining a light through the skin to measure indications of glucose.

Check the web address and make sure it is the right one. Also, make sure you don't follow any links on pages or in messages that you don't trust 100%. While that is sound advise, and will help you identify the bulk of phishing attacks, Chinese security researcher Xudong Zheng just demonstrated that things may not always be that easy. Punycode Phishing Attack He set up a special domain to demonstrate how this works. Point your browser to https://www.аррӏе.com/ and watch what happens. Somehow, you did not end up on Apple's website, but on a site that uses the correct URL, seemingly, and has a security certificate. If an attacker would have replicated Apple's website, and not displayed the "hey there" message, would you have noticed that you are not on Apple's site? You wonder probably how this works. The technique uses something that is called Punycode. Broken down to the essentials, Punycode enables you to register domain names with characters that are not native to a language. A basic example would be the German city of München. The letter ü is not available in English for instance, and that is where Punycode comes into play. The Punycode version of München is xn--mnchen-3ya. You can convert text on a site like Punycoder to see how other names are converted. One of the main issues from a security perspective is that some characters are not easily distinguishable. Compare the ASCII "a" with the Cyrillic "а" and tell me if you see the difference. An attack that makes use of these similarities are called homograph attack. Modern browsers come with security features that protect users from these kind of attacks. If you open this аpple.com domain name for instance, you will notice that most browsers displays the Punycode version of it (http://xn--pple-43d.com/) instead automatically. The security researcher discovered however that the protection in Chrome or Firefox fail if every single character is replaced with a foreign one. This is why this аррӏе.com domain name displays as if it is the real deal, even though it is actually xn--80ak6aa92e.com. Good news is that some browsers protect you against the attack already. If you use Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Safari or Vivaldi, you will notice that the Punycode address is displayed automatically. If you open the same domain name in Chrome, Firefox or Opera however, apple.com is displayed instead. That's a big problem obviously, as that address is not distinguishable from Apple's real domain name. The researcher disclosed the vulnerability to Google and Mozilla on January 20, 2017. Google created a patch for the issue which the company plans to roll out later this month in Chrome 58. Mozilla filed a bug on Bugzilla, but no consensus appears to have been reached yet. Firefox users who want to be on the safe side of things need to make a change in the configuration: Type about:config in the Firefox address bar and hit the Enter-key. Confirm that you will be careful. Search for network.IDN_show_punycode. Double-click the preference to set it to true. This forces Firefox to show Punycode when it is used. Chrome users on the other hand need to wait until Google releases a fix for the browser. Update: Chrome users can install Punycode Alert that warns users when a Punycode containing URL is loaded. Now You: would you have fallen for the attack?

They've know about this vulnerability for 2 1/2 months. As of now, a patch needs to be released quickly. Waiting for the next version sounds like a Microsoft-level excuse for allowing vulnerabilities to exist longer than they should.

In Edge while showing the real address if you click on the security lock the information says that: DST Root CA X3 identified the site as http://www.apple.com and the connection is secure... But in Firefox and Chrome it's way much worst.. Reply onedeafeye April 17, 2017 at 6:11 pm # I have Pale Moon as my default browser, Firefox as my backup. In both the about:config shows as false, yet in both I was unable to connect to either of the links referrenced in your article. The first link resolved to the following for both browsers: "Welcome to nginx! If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and working. Further configuration is required. For online documentation and support please refer to nginx.org. Commercial support is available at nginx.com. Thank you for using nginx." For the second link I got Server Not Found for both.

Reply Yuliya April 17, 2017 at 9:18 pm # I did that setting in FIreFox, great. I also tried Chromium 59 and the addressbar shows xn--80ak6aa92e, so Chrome users should expect this soon-ish? (Idk at which version is Chrome) Anyway, I usually expect what I should find when I visit a page, and I'm not going to do anything other than just visit (not create an account, purchase stuff, etc) unless I visit the said site for a while, if something's shady it usually comes up after a while if not sooner. Also I've been replacing а, е, с, х, итд for years to bypass word filters ;) So.. Reply Bobby Phoenix April 17, 2017 at 10:47 pm # A sad part about a web address is there is usually so much more than just the main domain. I know a lot of people who either click links from emails, or other websites, and never even look at the URL. Even if they wanted to go to Apple.com, and it showed the special characters, I know of a few who would think that was normal (If they even looked at it at all.). :-( Reply flyli5411 April 18, 2017 at 12:38 am # Have pale moon have not touched about:config clicked your link this what i got Server not found Pale Moon can't find the server at http://www.аррӏе.com.

I use MSE and the older free versions of Malwarebyte's Anti-Malware and Malwarebyte's Anti-Exploit. That's all I need for myself. Haven't seen a virus or malware object in many years. Anyway... out of all the browsers I have installed the Only browser that did Not connect to the demo page was IE 11, same results on my desktop and laptop, both running Win7 x64. Pale Moon, Firefox, Vivaldi, Chrome, and Comodo Dragon, ALL connected to the demo page. Vivaldi did not display "apple" in the address bar. Pale Moon and every other browser DID show "apple" in the address bar, at least Pale Moon shows the correct name in the security area of the address bar (far left end).

"iPhone X" concept by designer Gabor Balogh Hargreaves isn't the first analyst to think Apple could do away with Touch ID, but the move seems unlikely even as a last-ditch scenario. Touch ID is at the core of Apple Pay, and it appears much more likely that 3D facial or iris recognition would complement rather than replace fingerprint sensing. A more likely option fielded by Hargreaves is that Apple could delay "iPhone 8" production until its under-display fingerprint sensor solution is ready. An excerpt from his research note obtained by MacRumors: Likely options for Apple include a delay of production or elimination of fingerprint sensing on the OLED iPhone. We believe Apple continues to work on solving its optical fingerprint issues. If it's able to solve the problems in the next month or so, it would likely place volume orders at that point. This would likely lead to a delay of the OLED iPhone launch, but we would not expect it to meaningfully affect volume for the cycle. If it's not able to fix the problems in that time frame, Apple may be forced to eliminate fingerprint sensing from the OLED iPhone altogether.At this point, Hargreaves does not believe Apple's optical fingerprint module provider has received firm orders for production, which to him suggests that Apple does not have functionality of the optical fingerprint sensor ready. Additionally, he said Apple has evaluated and passed on Synaptics' optical fingerprint solution. Last week, Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri said Apple is facing yield issues with its AuthenTec-based under-display fingerprint sensor solution. He too speculated that Apple could remove Touch ID, but he believes it's more likely that Apple will put Touch ID on the back of the iPhone or delay production. If Touch ID were to be removed, Hargreaves said that would place significant pressure on unproven 3D sensing to replace the verification functionality that fingerprints currently provide. However, he said Apple's 3D sensing production appears on track, and could be a viable alternative to fingerprints. Suppliers suggest that the solution is both fast and highly reliable, even in low-light scenarios or from odd angles. If this proves accurate, reliance solely on 3D sensing for biometric login and verification could be a viable and innovative replacement for the highly popular fingerprint sensor.In February, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the "iPhone 8" will feature a "revolutionary" front-facing camera system with infrared for fully-featured 3D sensing capabilities. The advancements will enable the camera to determine the location and depth of objects placed in front of it. Pacific Crest Securities maintains a $150 price target for AAPL with an overweight rating.

Joe Mullin - Apr 17, 2017 4:22 pm UTC Larry Rosenstein reader comments 50 Share this story Apple went all-out in its patent assault on Samsung beginning in 2012, when Steve Jobs' promised "thermonuclear war" against Android became a reality. The patents used by the Cupertino device maker weren't just challenged in court, though. Various parties have challenged Apple's most important patents at the US Patent and Trademark Office, as well. On Friday, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued an opinion (PDF) about an "ex parte reexam," filed against Apple's patent by an anonymous party. The reexam claimed that one of the patents upholding Apple's big win against Samsung, US Patent No. 7,844,915, never should have been issued at all. The '915 patent was described in a general way as the "pinch to zoom" patent, but its claims describe a way of distinguishing between one-touch and two-touch operations. In 2013, the US Patent and Trademark Office's reexamination unit rejected all claims of Apple's '915 patent. A patent appeal board upheld the cancelation, leaving Apple to turn to the Federal Circuit, which has ultimate jurisdiction. On Friday, a panel of Federal Circuit judges sided with the patent office on some of the claims, but revived three others. The judges found that the Board was correct about the "scroll and gesture limitation" part of the patent, which was properly rejected. But it had a different definition of the "rubberbanding" limitation. This gets even more confusing because a different Apple patent, the '381 patent, is generally referred to as the "rubberbanding" or "bounce-back" patent. But the '915 patent also describes some elements of rubberbanding. When you pull down content on an iPhone, the phone takes a particular action—typically refreshing the page—if you pull past a certain point. The content then snaps back up, like a rubber band. Tiny tweak The Board of Patent Appeals found that Apple's "rubberbanding" patent claims were obvious in light of an earlier 2003 patent application by America Online, invented by Luigi Lira. That application describes a user scrolling between columns in a way that would cause another column to "snap into alignment with the display window." So, a touchscreen, a pulling motion, and then the content "snaps into alignment"—in the view of the Patent Office, AOL had a kind of "rubberbanding," invented years before Apple launched the first iPhone. Federal Circuit judges who considered the matter, though, said the Board improperly looked at all types of "rubberbanding." The judges gave weight to Apple's point that the earlier Lira patent "teaches that the screen should 'snap' to the next region of content" and achieved "the opposite effect from rubberbanding." Because the board should have limited its definition of rubberbanding to "sliding content backwards," the judges revived claims 2, 9, and 16 of the patent, remanding it for further consideration. Although this is just one piece of the seemingly never-ending Apple v. Samsung conflict, it is a significant one—the '915 patent was one of a few non-design patents that Apple won significant damages for. Looked at in a broader sense, the battle over the '915 patent is a pattern that has been repeated over and over again. Just like other patent holders, Apple tells judges and juries that its inventions were a "revolution" that should remain pristine icons of American innovation, untouched and unused by competitors. Upon further review, though, there are always earlier technologies that did almost exactly the same thing. When it comes down to brass tacks, Apple's inventions aren't so revolutionary; they're tiny tweaks to UI. The fact that the top patent judges in the country think that Apple should get a monopoly over snapping "backward," when snapping "forward" was invented years before, tells you a lot about how we got into the messy patent system we're in today. What Apple did incredibly well was to package and execute ideas that weren't that new. The combination of the iPhone's concepts, design, and execution was truly revolutionary. But you can't get a reward for that in the form of a patent, at least not one that holds up under real scrutiny. Of course, a patent skeptic might argue that the billions of dollars in iPhone sales that Apple reaped were a pretty good reward. Before we end, here's a brief recap on the state of play in the two big US lawsuits between the companies. The first Apple v. Samsung case ended up with a $399 million win for Apple after two jury trials and other tweaks to the damages figure. The case went to the US Supreme Court, which heard oral argument in October. The justices ended up tossing the case back to the Federal Circuit for yet another recalculation of damages. The second trial ended up with a $120 million win for Apple, which was ultimately upheld by the full Federal Circuit in October. Samsung has asked the Supreme Court to look at that, as well. If the justices aren't interested in hearing a second Apple v. Samsung case, then Apple's win will stand.   Joe Mullin Joe has covered the intersection of law and technology, including the world's biggest copyright and patent battles, since 2007.

If the non-invasive sensors come to fruition, it would be a breakthrough moment for medical science.  The late Apple CEO Steve Jobs envisaged the devices as another form of wearable technology, similar to a smartwatch or fitness monitor.  Apple has hired a team of biomedical engineers as part of the secret initiative, according to reports in CNBC. Up to 30 people are believed to be working on the project, which has be running for five years - according to CNBC's sources.  They say the firm has been carrying out clinical trials in San Francisco and has hired consultants to look into the rules and regulations around bringing such a product to market. The engineers are said to be working from a nondescript office in Palo Alto, around 15 miles away from the new Apple corporate headquarters in Cupertino, California. The researchers have been tasked with developing bio-sensors to monitor blood sugar levels.  Currently this involves taking regular blood samples, which can involve anything from a thumb-prick test to intravenous extraction.

A secret new research project being undertaken by Apple could lead to new sensors to detect diabetes. For many, the condition is managed with daily injections (stock image) The number of people with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 - the latest year for which global figures are available - according to the World Heath Organisation. The news comes at a time when the line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring. WHAT IS DIABETES  Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.  Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar Hyperglycaemia, or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels The number of people with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 - the latest year for which global figures are available - according to the World Heath Organisation. Companies are joining forces to tackle chronic diseases using high-tech devices that combine biology, software and hardware. This has jump-starting a new field of medicine called bio-electronics. Last year, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Google parent Alphabet Inc unveiled a joint company aimed at marketing bio-electronic devices to fight illness by attaching to individual nerves. U.S. biotech firms Setpoint Medical and EnteroMedics Inc have already demonstrated some early progress of bio-electronics in treating rheumatoid arthritis and suppressing appetite in the obese. Other companies exploring the technology include Medtronic Plc, Proteus Digital Technology, Sanofi SA and Biogen Inc. GUM DISEASE: A WARNING SIGN?  Gum disease could be an early warning sign of type 2 diabetes, a study suggests. Experts said dentists who discovered patients with severe gum problems should screen them for the condition.  A study of 313 middle-aged people by the University of Amsterdam found patients with severe gum disease were 23 per cent more likely to have type 2 diabetes, and 47 per cent more likely to have pre-diabetes than those with no gum disease. Writing in the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research And Care, they said this was because people with diabetes were more susceptible to infections and impaired wound healing. The researchers said it would be feasible to screen for undiagnosed diabetes in dental practices, focusing on people with the most severe form of gum disease. Picking up on diabetes and pre-diabetes early is essential in helping to avoid complications. Some 3.5million people have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes – but more than 500,000 are living with the condition unknowingly.

The new update is expected to be announced alongside the macOS 10.13, watchOS 4 and the iOS updates at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, Calif. in June. Multi-User Profiles On The Apple TV Apple is rumored to integrate a multi-user support feature on the Apple TV, which will allow users to create their own profiles tailored to content they like, similar to Netflix. Owners would be able to connect their Apple ID to the Apple TV to create their profile using an iOS device, an anonymous source told The Verifier. Users would be able to listen to their Apple Music content, view their iCloud photos and videos and use their apps once the Apple ID is linked to the Apple TV. Users will only have to connect their account once and then would be able to switch from and to profiles on the Apple TV easily, just like on Macs. Work on the new feature is said to be “in advanced stages,” but it could come after the first tvOS 11 update. Apple TV’s New Picture-In-Picture Feature Apple is also rumored to roll out a picture-in-picture feature, which would allow users to minimize the window of a movie or video to the corner of the screen to go to another app, according to The Verifier. The blog also said Apple will incorporate a live programming guide and offer monthly subscription TV content through partnerships, which has been rumored before. Earlier this month, a Recode report said Apple is apparently looking into selling a “premium TV bundle” which would include HBO, Showtime and Starz. For the future of the Apple TV, Apple is reportedly working on a new model of the Apple TV that could allow AR and VR content to be viewed “from the simulated stacked reality monitors directly on the TV via AirPlay,” the Israeli blog said this month. It was revealed in February Apple reportedly has 1,000 engineers working on augmented reality in Israel. The rumored updates for the Apple TV could help the Cupertino company compete against the Amazon Fire TV and Roku.

Apple's (AAPL) component suppliers are struggling with a new optical fingerprint sensor, which could lead to shortages or a delay in availability for Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 or elimination of fingerprint sensing from the next-generation smartphone. That's the assessment of Pacific Crest Securities analysts in a report to clients on Sunday. The Pacific Crest report follows other reports that say Apple is having problems producing its next handset, raising the possibility that it could miss its usual mid-September release window. "While this creates some risk of production delays, at this point we do not believe it materially threatens volume through the coming iPhone cycle," Pacific Crest said. The investment bank reiterated its overweight rating on Apple with a price target of 150. Apple shares rose 0.5% to 141.80 on the stock market today, moving back above a 141.12 follow-on buy point after undercutting that level on Friday. Among Apple supplier stocks, Pacific Crest named Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) as its favorites. "The anticipated move to a full-screen OLED panel in the coming iPhone 8/X eliminates the physical home button, which necessitates a move to a virtual home button and an optical fingerprint sensing solution to read fingerprints through the OLED panel," Pacific Crest said. "At this point, we do not believe Apple's optical fingerprint module provider has firm orders for production, which suggests Apple does not have functionality of the optical fingerprint sensor ready. Additionally, we believe Apple has evaluated Synaptic's (SYNA) optical fingerprint solution, but that it has not been qualified." If Apple cuts the fingerprint sensor from the iPhone 8, it would rely on a biometric login that relies exclusively on 3D sensing, Pacific Crest said. "Since fingerprint login is such a widely used feature and 3D sensing is unproven for this purpose, a wholesale elimination of fingerprint sensing in the OLED iPhone would create incremental risk to consumer adoption," Pacific Crest said.

Apple’s unreleased iPhones always leak long before they’re announced on stage in California, but we’re far enough away from the new model’s unveiling that there are still plenty of questions that remain unanswered. Will the display feature slightly curved edges or will it be flat? Will the new Touch ID fingerprint scanner be embedded beneath the screen or will Apple unfortunately have to relocate it to the back of the phone due to manufacturing issues. Those are just a few of the big questions we still have, but now a new report out of China claims to have revealed the details surrounding Apple’s final iPhone 8 design. What’s more, included 3D models based on freshly leaded schematics may be our first look at what Apple has planned for us later this year. Don't Miss: You can still get an NES Classic Edition right now on Amazon Earlier on Monday morning, we shared some leaked schematics that supposedly show Apple’s final iPhone 8 design. The schematics in question supposedly came from inside one of Foxconn’s factories, and they will presumably be used in the actual manufacturing process that will soon be underway. The same extensive post from Chinese tech blog ifanr also includes what are said to be 3D models of Apple’s upcoming new flagship iPhone, which will feature Apple’s first new iPhone design in three years. In 2016 and 2015, Apple reused the same iPhone design it first introduced on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus back in 2014. Here’s a look at the 3D models posted by ifanr: If the 3D models above are indeed the real deal, then the renders below may be our first look at Apple’s finished iPhone 8 design: Read More Two things in particular stand out from the leaked schematics and 3D models. First, if they are accurate, Apple does plan to embed the fingerprint reader into the display. The iPhone 8 will be the first widely available smartphone to include an in-display fingerprint reader, if this leak pans out. The second noteworthy detail is the lack of curved edges on the iPhone 8’s screen. A number of solid reports from mainstream media sources have suggested that the sides of the iPhone 8’s display would be slightly curved, perhaps following the curvature of the phone’s 2.5D glass face. Apart from the unsightly vertical dual camera configuration, this proposed iPhone 8 design would mark an impressive leap beyond Apple’s previous designs, which all include massive bezels surrounding the displays. LG and Samsung have both introduced new flagship models with significantly smaller bezels, and Apple is expected to do the same later this year.

Eric Risberg, AP Photo California's DMV has granted clearance to Apple for autonomous car testing on the state roads by  Mark Gurman, Bloomberg  | 17 hours ago Small Medium Large Apple will soon take its self-driving car software platform to public streets for the first time, a major step that gets the world’s largest technology company into a crowded race to reshape transportation. California’s Department of Motor Vehicles granted clearance for trials of Apple’s autonomous car technology on public roads, according to a notice on the DMV’s website last week. This is the first time Apple has received approval for such testing. The software tests will start soon with existing vehicles, according to a person familiar with the matter. They asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public. Apple started designing a self-driving car to take on Google and Tesla a few years ago, before it pulled back and focused on first developing underlying autonomous technology last year. The tests are the clearest, public sign yet that Apple is serious about a nascent field that could, in time, transform mobility and upend the auto industry. A quarter of all miles driven in the U.S. may be traveled in shared, self-driving electric cars by the end of the next decade, Boston Consulting Group said this month. Apple wants a piece of this action, but it’s got a lot of competition: 29 other companies have autonomous vehicle testing permits in California. Subject to standard regulations for testing autonomous technology on public roads, Apple’s test cars will have a person behind the wheel to monitor the testing. The California permit covers three Lexus RX 450h SUVs and six drivers, the DMV said. Google and Uber’s self-driving test cars also have people behind the wheel during tests. An Apple spokesman declined to comment beyond a statement issued in December when the company filed paperwork with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regarding safety practices for self-driving cars. RELATED Apple scales back its autonomous car project “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” Apple said at the time. The DMV’s website was updated Friday to acknowledge Apple becoming a permit holder. A March 30 copy of the website does not list Apple as having approval, indicating it was granted within the last two weeks. The permit requires companies to disclose traffic incidents related to their testing within 10 business days of the event. Apple’s self-driving technology is being developed in secret company offices in Sunnyvale, California – a short drive from its main Cupertino campus. The company also has a team in Canada working on a car operating system that would power the platform, people familiar with the matter have said. The self-driving car platform is designed so that Apple could choose to open it up to existing carmakers or eventually port it to an Apple-designed vehicle. Apple began to focus more on the self-driving technology last year after re-hiring former hardware executive Bob Mansfield to lead the project. Apple aims to decide on the final direction of the platform by fall of this year. You may also like...

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Moab Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi IPL 2017 Arvind Kejriwal News Money Apple, Coke, Airtel among companies pulled up for 143 misleading ads Representational Image (Thinkstock) Shares1 Mon, 17 Apr 2017-09:28pm , PTI Apple showing 'iPhone 7' as 'iphone 7 plus variant' is among 143 advertisements dubbed as misleading by regulator ASCI, which also pulled up Coca-Cola India, Bharti Airtel, and others for such campaigns. Mobikwik, HUL, Nivea, Amul, Opera, Standard Chartered Bank, and Pernod Ricard are among the companies against which a total of 191 complaints were received by Customer Complaints Council (CCC) of the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) for January. ASCI upheld a total of 102 complaints in healthcare category, 20 in education, seven in personal care, six in food and beverages and eight advertisements from other categories. According to ASCI, Apple India was found using a wrong image in its advertisement for iPhone 7. "The advertisement text states 'The amazing iPhone 7 is here', but shows an image of iPhone 7 Plus variant, which is misleading by ambiguity and implication," said ASCI. The sector watchdog said although the advertisement had the Apple trademark with 'iPhone7' but said it didn't have any reference to 'series' in the advertisement text. "In absence of any visual of iPhone 7 variant, it was concluded that the advertisement is likely to mislead the consumers about the product advertised and its corresponding features," it said. Comments from Apple could not be obtained. ASCI also upheld a complaint against Coca-Cola India for Thums Up campaign, in which the soft drink major has showcased a rider performing a wheelie in normal streets, traffic conditions, right amongst a few people. "This is contradictory to the disclaimer made in the advertisement - the actions are for representational purposes alone and must not be copied by viewers... It was concluded that though the overall advertisement is not objectionable, regardless of the disclaimer the specific visual... encourages dangerous practices, manifests a disregard for safety and encourages negligence," it said. When contacted, a Coca-Cola India spokesperson said: "On receiving feedback, we have on boarded suggestions from ASCI and modified the TV commercial (TVC). The revised TVC has been updated on air and on digital media." Similarly, it has also pulled FMCG major HUL for its advertisement of Rin Antibac, where it had claimed that the detergent powder with Ayurvedic extracts removes germs. However, ASCI said the claim "was not substantiated, and is misleading by implication and exaggeration as the advertised product does not have the property to provide germ protection in wear conditions". Commenting on the matter, a HUL Company Spokesperson said: "We, as a responsible marketer and member of ASCI, have always complied with its guidelines and recommendations. We have suitably modified the said advertisement as per their recommendation." Similarly, Standard Chartered Bank's claim of "up to 10% extra cashback on all spends with your Standard Chartered credit card" was found to be "false and misleading by ambiguity" as the cash back was limited to Rs 10,000 only. When contacted Standard Chartered Bank said: "The up to 10% cash back offer was a campaign launched last year. The cash back cap and all other relevant details were shared with customers over multiple communication channels. However, ASCI felt that we needed to make certain modifications, and we have taken their inputs on board." The regulator also upheld three complaints against leading telecom operator Bharti Airtel for "misleading" claims for free Calls Local + STD and a free upgrade for Airtel-V Fiber. "The ad claim, "Free Calls Local + STD" cannot be said free as the prevailing price for data without advertised incentive is less i.e. from the consumer's point of view, they have to make a payment of Rs 149 to avail this offer although they get only 300MB data versus 500 MB data," it said However, when contacted Airtel declined to comment. Complaint against Opera Software Asa claim for its mobile browser Opera Mini was also upheld where it had claimed that it saves data cost up to 90 percent while browsing "The advertisement's claim, 'Saves data cost up to 90% while browsing', was not substantiated with supporting data and is misleading by exaggeration," the CCC said. When contacted an Opera spokesperson said:" We adhere to the highest ethical standards and never share any exaggerated or misleading data with our consumers. Hence, our claim of Opera Mini saving up to 90% data in our advertisement, is entirely true. We have proven our claims by internal and external tests from time to time over the years." Digital payment firm MobiKwik also failed to substantiate its claim of "India's most secure e-wallet" for Mobikwik E- wallet and found to be "misleading by exaggeration". It also upheld complaint against Gujarat Co-Operative Milk Marketing Federation for ad of Amul Butter where it had claimed it to be a rich source of Vitamin A and stated that "Eat milk with every meal and live every day, worry-free". "It was considered the latter part of the statement to be misleading by implication and is encouraging excessive consumption of butter which may not be advisable from the health point of view," it said. Similarly, FMCG firm Nivea was also pulled for claims in the commercial of Nivea Protect & Care Deodorant. It was "considered to be misleading by ambiguity and implication that several other major ingredients of Nivea Creme are added to the deodorant product".

NEW DELHI: Apple showing 'iPhone 7' as 'iPhone 7 plus variant' is among 143 advertisements dubbed as misleading by regulator ASCI, which also pulled up Coca-Cola India, Bharti Airtel and others for such campaigns. Mobikwik, HUL, Nivea, Amul, Opera, Standard Chartered Bank and Pernod Ricard are among the companies against which a total of 191 complaints were received by Customer Complaints Council (CCC) of the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) for January. ASCI upheld a total of 102 complaints in healthcare category, 20 in education, seven in personal care, six in food and beverages and eight advertisements from other categories. According to ASCI, Apple India was found using a wrong image in its advertisement for iPhone 7. "The advertisement text states 'The amazing iPhone 7 is here', but shows an image of iPhone 7 Plus variant, which is misleading by ambiguity and implication," said ASCI. The sector watchdog said although the advertisement had the Apple trademark with 'iPhone7' but said it didn't have any reference to 'series' in the advertisement text. "In absence of any visual of iPhone 7 variant, it was concluded that the advertisement is likely to mislead the consumers about the product advertised and its corresponding features," it said. Comments from Apple could not be obtained. ASCI also upheld a complaint against Coca-Cola India for Thums Up campaigne, in which the soft drink major has showcased a rider performing a wheelie in normal streets, traffic conditions, right amongst a few people. "This is contradictory to the disclaimer made in the advertisement –- the actions are for representational purposes alone and must not be copied by viewers... It was concluded that though the overall advertisement is not objectionable, regardless of the disclaimer the specific visual... encourages dangerous practices, manifests a disregard for safety and encourages negligence," it said. When contacted, a Coca-Cola India spokesperson said: "On receiving feedback, we have on boarded suggestions from ASCI and modified the TV commercial (TVC). The revised TVC has been updated on air and on digital media." Similarly, it has also pulled FMCG major HUL for its advertisement of Rin Antibac, where it had claimed that the detergent powder with Ayurvedic extracts removes germs. However, ASCI said the claim "was not substantiated, and is misleading by implication and exaggeration as the advertised product does not have the property to provide germ protection in wear conditions". Commenting on the matter, a HUL Company Spokesperson said: "We, as a responsible marketer and member of ASCI, have always complied with its guidelines and recommendations. We have suitably modified the said advertisement as per their recommendation." Similarly, Standard Chartered Bank's claim of "up to 10 per cent extra cashback on all spends with your Standard Chartered credit card" was found to be "false and misleading by ambiguity" as the cash back was limited to Rs 10,000 only. When contacted Standard Chartered Bank said: "The up to 10 per cent cash back offer was a campaign launched last year. The cash back cap and all other relevant details were shared with customers over multiple communication channels. However, ASCI felt that we needed to make certain modifications, and we have taken their inputs on board." The regulator also upheld three complaints against leading telecom operator Bharti Airtel for "misleading" claims for free Calls Local + STD and a free upgrade for Airtel-V Fiber. "The ad claim, "Free Calls Local + STD" cannot be said free as the prevailing price for data without advertised incentive is less i.e. from the consumer's point of view, they have to make a payment of Rs 149 to avail this offer although they get only 300MB data versus 500 MB data," it said. However, when contacted Airtel declined to comment. Complaint against Opera Software Asa claim for its mobile browser Opera Mini was also upheld where it had claimed that it saves data cost up to 90 percent while browsing "The advertisement's claim, 'Saves data cost up to 90 percent while browsing', was not substantiated by supporting data and is misleading by exaggeration," the CCC said. When contacted an Opera spokesperson said: "We adhere to the highest ethical standards and never share any exaggerated or misleading data with our consumers. Hence, our claim of Opera Mini saving up to 90 percent data in our advertisement, is entirely true. We have proven our claims by internal and external tests from time to time over the years." Digital payment firm MobiKwik also failed to substantiate its claim of "India's most secure e-wallet" for Mobikwik E- wallet and found to be "misleading by exaggeration". It also upheld a complaint against Gujarat Co-Operative Milk Marketing Federation for an ad of Amul Butter where it had claimed it to be a rich source of Vitamin A and stated that "Eat milk with every meal and live every day, worry-free". "It was considered the latter part of the statement to be misleading by implication and is encouraging excessive consumption of butter which may not be advisable from the health point of view," it said. Similarly, FMCG firm Nivea was also pulled for claims in the commercial of Nivea Protect & Care Deodorant. It was "considered to be misleading by ambiguity and implication that several other major ingredients of Nivea Creme are added to the deodorant product".

Speaking to USA Today in an interview published on Sunday, Wozniak said that he will discuss the future at the three-day show in San Jose, Calif., which could have 100,000 people in attendance. His focus: "The Future of Humanity: Where Will We Be in 2075?" I n a teaser with USA Today, Woz, as he's come to be known, said big companies like Apple (aapl) should still play a prominent role in 2075. "Apple will be around a long time, like IBM (ibm)," Wozniak said in the interview. "Look at Apple's cash. It can invest in anything. It would be ridiculous to not expect them to be around (in 2075). The same goes for Google (googl) and Facebook (fb)." Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter Wozniak is one of the more prominent Silicon Valley figures, thanks in no small part to co-founding Apple in 1976. Over the last several years, Woz has been a vocal supporter for the technology and science community and last year, helped create the Silicon Valley Comic Con. The show, which will kick off on April 21, includes traditional Comic Con themes like comic book showcases, but also acts as a technology hub. This year, the show will feature exhibits from companies working in virtual reality and robotics, and include panel discussions on flying cars and implanting brains into computers. While Woz believes Apple could play a role in the world 58 years from now, he didn't say how that might happen. He did, however, tell USA Today that deserts could be where new cities are located in 2075, and people will wear special suits to get around. He also believes artificial intelligence will dominate human life and create a world in which people will interact with "smart walls" and be able to access "doctor-free prescriptions," according to USA Today. Woz also thinks that humans will have a colony in Mars by then, but cautioned that he doesn't have "high hopes" for humans interacting with other intelligent life.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why Apple Inc.'s A11 Won't Be Built Using 16-Nano Tech The schedule lines up nicely for a 10nm-powered iPhone. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 17, 2017 at 11:45AM Over on Twitter, semiconductor industry veteran Dick James with Siliconics recently posted the following thought-provoking Tweet, in which he comments on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (NYSE:TSM) 10nm chip manufacturing technology ramp-up plans:  Fast Q3 10nm ramp for Oct iPhone launch? Sounds a bit tight, will A11 chip be 16FF+? Seems to early for N12.. — Dick James (@Siliconicsdick) April 16, 2017 Although the fact that TSMC expects a "very fast" production ramp of its 10nm technology in the second half of 2017 (i.e. beginning in the third quarter) might make it seem, as James notes, that this might be too late to hit Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7s/7s+/8 production schedule, I don't think it is. Here's why.  Image source: Intel. Squaring the timing If TSMC only started mass production of chips using its 10nm technology in the third quarter, then there would be absolutely no chance that Apple's A11 chip would be built using TSMC's 10nm technology. It usually takes three months (possibly longer) to fully process a silicon wafer, with additional time required to package and test those chips, ship those chips to customers (in this case, Apple's contract manufacturers), and then integrate those chips into devices, like Apple's iPhone.  However, I believe that TSMC is talking about a revenue ramp up in this case. To dig deeper into this, we need to understand how TSMC recognizes revenue -- a fact that we can find in the chip-maker's most recent form 20-F filing.  TSMC says that it recognizes revenue "when the goods are delivered and titles have passed." It goes on to list a set of conditions that it needs to meet to recognize revenue, which I've reproduced below for the sake of convenience:  We have transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods; We retain neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;  The amount of revenue can be measured reliably;  It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to us; and  The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.  In other words, TSMC likely doesn't report revenue from a wafer sale until Apple (or, more likely, its contract manufacturer(s)) have at least gotten ahold of the finished wafer, if not processed, packaged, and tested chips from said wafer.  So, if TSMC begins production on the A11 this month, then finished chips bound for this fall's iPhone models should be ready to go in July or August, which is around when mass production of the next iPhone is expected to begin.  From a timing perspective, 10nm should be good to go for the next generation iPhones.  Beyond just timing The timing appears to work, but that's not the only reason that I'm confident that the next iPhone models will have 10nm-based processors. TSMC says that it expects that 10% of its entire 2017 revenues will come from sales of 10nm wafers. The only customers that could contribute this kind of volume and revenue in such a short amount of time are Apple and potentially Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and we already know that Qualcomm isn't using TSMC to build 10nm chips.  Beyond that, though, there are good technical reasons for Apple to move to the 10nm technology. Simply put, Apple is already shipping large chips (the A10 is about 125 square millimeters in size in TSMC's 16nm tech). If Apple wants to dramatically increase the features and functionality that it integrates into its A11 chip, it needs to throw in more transistors, which balloons chip size (the A10 is already quite large for a mobile chip). The move to 10nm technology should allow Apple to cram in much more functionality while keeping chip size in check.  All told, I'm very confident that this year's Apple A11 chip will be manufactured on TSMC's 10nm technology, not its older 16nm technology.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

The report said that LG was planning to be ready to supply Apple with OLED displays as a secondary supplier by 2018. A Korean tech report today states that LG may make it official during their board meeting scheduled for June.   A senior official at LG Display has told the press that "We received a request to take part in a bid for receiving an order for small and medium-sized OLEDs from Apple. At the end of June, we will make a decision based on OLED production technology, capacity and the accompanying investment volume in an extraordinary board meeting."   Business Korea reports that "LG Display judged that the company will lag behind the market unless they invest on time as displays of smartphones were rapidly shifting from LCDs to OLEDs.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 7 and 7 Plus hit stores to fight AIDS/HIV April 17, 2017 Jude Hanno News No comments Apple released their new red iPhone called “(PRODUCT)RED” iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus on March 24 to fuel the fight against HIV/AIDS. Apple is partnered with (RED) to provide a portion of the red iPhone’s proceeds towards the fight against HIV/AIDS. (RED) is an organization with a mission to make it easy for people and business to join the fight against the virus. For ten years, Apple and (RED) have worked together to fund programs that provide counseling, testing and medicine for those deal­ing with HIV/AIDS. The money raised by (RED) and Apple go towards the Global Fund. The organization aims to end the AIDS virus as well as tuberculosis and malaria. “Apple is the world’s largest cor­porate contributor to the Global Fund,” said Apple press contact Lisa Israel. The iPhone features a cherry red back with a white front and the same iPhone 7 capabilities. The iPhone 7 can be purchased at 128GB for $749, or at 256GB for $849. The iPhone 7 Plus can be purchased at 128GB for $869, or at 256GB for $969. Apple does not mention how much of the sales go towards the HIV/AIDS fund. “Apple is the world’s largest cor­porate donor to the Global Fund, contributing more than $130 million as part of its’ partnership with (RED),” said (RED) CEO Deborah Dugan. Throughout the ten years, Apple’s partnership has aided thousands of HIV/AIDS victims. In 2006, Apple created the (PRODUCT)RED iPod Nano, which also donated a portion of its proceeds to the Global Fund through (RED). According to Israel, Apple donated one dollar for every Apple Pay purchase made between Nov. 30 and Dec. 6 in 2016. UW Tacoma student Argenis Mangual is more a fan of the iPhone 6 than the 7 because of the headphone jack allowing users to charge and lis­ten to music without Bluetooth. “Its regular headphone jack allows charg­ing simultaneously,” he said. The (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are currently avail­able in all Apple Stores. “We want to leave the world better than we found it, and that’s why our longtime partnership with (RED) remains so important to us,” said Tim Cook, Apple CEO.
