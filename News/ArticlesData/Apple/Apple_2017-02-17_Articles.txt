The reliable Apple analyst talked about Apple’s plans of adding a virtual function area which would take the place of the device’s physical Home button. Kuo’s report also included information on screen resolution specs, which added knowledge on what to expect from the phone. Based on the details released, it’s likely that the iPhone 8 could have a higher 521 PPI density compared to the 320 PPI on the iPhone 7. There is also some reason to believe that Apple will be equipping Retina glass at 3x scale onto a device with a 4.7-inch screen. Kuo’s report also suggests that the iPhone 8 could have a resolution of 2436 x 1125. For comparison’s sake, the iPhone 7 has a 1334 x 750 screen resolution. This could mean that the iPhone 8 will have a main screen resolution that’s twice as much as the iPhone 6, 6s and 7 models. And since the screen region is said to measure 5.15 inches, a 512 PPI would make a lot of sense. If Kuo’s report prove to be accurate, it would be enticing to Android users who have since complained about the 4.7-inch low-resolution display available on the iPhone. The iPhone 8 could be a stellar device with a pixel density higher than the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models, both of which have a PPI of 325 and 401, respectively. Another thing that could be clear on the iPhone 8 is the use of a high-density screen at 3x Retina scaling. Currently, the iPhone models that don’t carry the Plus specs only use 2x scaling that produces 667×375 points. Given the numbers on Kuo’s report, it’s likely the iPhone 8 could be equipped with 3x scaling or equal to 812×375 points. As of this writing, the vertical resolution point is the same as what’s available on the Phone 7. This could indicate that the iPhone 8 will have a somewhat similar application design on the 4.7-inch iPhone. Although Kuo has been quite accurate with his reports, these numbers do not guarantee anything for the iPhone 8. But considering it is rumored to have wireless charging, improved water resistance, and even facial recognition technology, this year’s iPhone could be a bombshell compared to past models. We’ll know for sure once Apple unveils the device at a media event expected to take place in fall.   Tags: iPhone 8, Retina About Christine Torralba View all posts by Christine Torralba → ← Apple

Phones by Steven Musil February 14, 2017 4:54 PM PST @stevenmusil Bye-bye, home button? Taylor Martin/CNET The iPhone's home button may not be long for this world. Apple has been granted a patent for an "interactive display panel with IR diodes" -- a method that would let users activate a device through a virtual home button placed within the touchscreen. The technology, described in a filing made public Tuesday by the US Patent and Trade Office, could replace the physical home button that's traditionally occupied the space below the iPhone's screen. The patent was first spotted by Apple-tracking site AppleInsider. Ever since Apple co-founder Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in 2007, the round home button has been a focal point for navigating the gadget. But rumors of its demise began to swirl in 2013, when Apple introduced Touch ID, a fingerprint security sensor that allowed users of its iPhone 5S to bypass typing in a password. The Touch ID sensor is built into the home button today. That speculation only increased in 2015, when Apple filed a patent application to move the fingerprint sensor beneath the glass of the touchscreen, eliminating the need for a home button. As Apple marks the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone, the rumor mill is being fed by reports about big hardware changes expected on the next-generation phone many are calling the iPhone 8. The elimination of a physical home button is one of the rumored changes, as is a glass and steel body with a curved edge display; wireless charging; and even using an iris scanner as one way to unlock the device. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care.

The latest report from MacRumors says that the iPhone 8 will have 3D Facial Recognition. Apple has been rumored to ditch the physical Home Button on the new iPhone and thus replaced Touch ID technology. JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall stated that the 5.8-inch iPhone with edge-to-edge OLED display will have 3D facial recognition. The analyst added that the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus could also feature a 3D laser scanner, considering that Apple has increased volume of the module at its suppliers. The scanner is said to add $10 to $15 per module to the iPhone 8’s price, which is rumored to reach $1,000. The OLED display, glass casing and increased production raise the price of the phone by $100. Bigger display size and virtual capacitive buttons The analyst says that the 3D facial recognition is potentially more secure than Touch ID, which sometimes doesn’t work in wet conditions. Apple could also use the technology for increasing Apple Pay adoption among banks and retailers. The report goes even further and says that the 3D scanner may be used for augmented reality, but that might not happen until 2018. Apple did say that the company will start focusing more on AR. A 3D scanning API might eventually be made available to developers, who could find creative ways to enhance user experience. The analyst added that the iPhone 8 could see an official unveiling as early as WWDC 2017, which starts on June 5. However, Apple hasn’t announced any devices during WWDC since 2010, so we’re not that sure that the iPhone 8 will make an appearance this summer. Other rumors have suggested that Apple may not give up on Touch ID completely and embed a fingerprint sensor into the display. In addition, if Apple intends to ditch the home button, the phone would have to use virtual capacitive buttons and would have an actual display size of 5.5 inches but in a 4.7-inch body. #Apple#iPhone 8#iPhone 7s#iPhone 7s Plus#3D facial recognition subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple’s iPhone 8 to Ditch Home Button in Favor of Virtual Capacitive Buttons Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Apple to Contract Chinese Supplier of Flexible OLED Displays for Upcoming iPhone Apple iPhone 8 to Feature Reinforced Glass Back, Stainless Steel Frame Intel Makes Available Ethernet Connections CD 22.0.1 - Download Now NVIDIA Rolls Out GeForce Graphics Driver 378.72 Hotfix - Get It Now Don’t Hold Your Breath for a New Windows 10 RS2 Build These Days Apple Could Launch iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 Betas at WWDC 2017, June 5-9 3D Facial Recognition to Replace Touch ID on Apple iPhone 8 Twitter Makes Notifications from People You've Blocked Disappear First Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Reference Spotted Online Intel Makes Available Ethernet Connections CD 22.0.1 - Download Now    iPhone 8 concept new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple to Contract Chinese Supplier of Flexible OLED Displays for Upcoming iPhone more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

We’ll help you fix AirPods connection issues, AirPods charging problems and other issues like bad audio quality or problems switching them to another Apple device. Advertisement Apple’s short delay in releasing the AirPods helped iron out many issues, but there are still some problems that users run into while switching between the iPhone and a Mac. It is very easy to fix most AirPods problems and it is unlikely that you will need to return or exchange your AirPods. Common AirPods problems and how to fix them. Here are the most common AirPods problems; How to Fix AirPods That Won’t Connect How to Fix AirPods That Won’t Connect to Mac How to Fix AirPod Call Disconnect Problems How to Fix Bad AirPods Battery Life How to Reset AirPods We’ll show you how to fix AirPods problems below, including what to do if you need to reset them, which can solve many AirPods problems. How to Fix AirPods That Won’t Connect If your AirPods won’t connect to the device that you normally use them with, the first thing to try is very simply. Advertisement Put the AirPods back in the case. Wait about 10 seconds and then take them both out and put them immediately in your ears. How to Fix AirPods that won’t connect. After 3-5 seconds the AirPods should now connect to the device you primarily use with them. We find that if one AirPod won’t connect, adding the second to the mix is an excellent way to get them connected. Another thing that you can try is turning Bluetooth off on your iPhone or iPad and turning it back on. Swipe up to open the Control Center, tap on Bluetooth, wait 20 seconds and then tap on Bluetooth again. Once Bluetooth is back on you can try again. If this fails you may need to Reset the AirPods. Click here to jump to that section. Advertisement How to Fix AirPods That Won’t Connect to Mac If you have an older Mac, it can be tougher to connect the AirPods to it. We occasionally run into issues with the Mac Pro. The steps are similar to those listed above, but you may not want to turn Bluetooth off on your Mac if you only have a Bluetooth mouse. How to fix AirPods Mac connection problems. Instead, let’s unpair the AirPods from your Mac and then re-pair them directly to that Mac. From there, iCloud will connect them back to the other devices. Go to System Preferences -> Bluetooth on your Mac and click on AirPods. Click on the X to unpair them. You can unpair them from any other device that you connect them to including your iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. If possible turn off all the other devices after you unpair them. On the Mac, go into the Bluetooth settings again and pair the AirPods. From there iCloud should sync the connection to your other devices again. In many cases, this will fix your Mac AirPods connection issues. Advertisement How to Fix AirPod Call Disconnect Problems Some users report the AirPods disconnect on calls. This is especially annoying during important calls and while you are driving or walking. There are a lot of potential factors that can cause the AirPods to disconnect while on a call, so there are many steps you can try taking. How to fix AirPods call disconnect problems. The first thing to try is taking a call with just one AirPod in. This is the primary way we make calls, and it usually works without any problem. Set the AirPods to always use the right or left AirPod for the microphone. Go to Settings -> Bluetooth -> Tap on the i to the right of AirPods. Tap on Microphone and then choose left or right. Advertisement You may also want to try turning off Automatic Ear Detection. This means the AirPods won’t know if they are in your ear, so you lose some features, but it could help you nail down why your AirPods are disconnecting during calls. Go to Settings -> Bluetooth -> Tap on the i to the right of AirPods. Tap on the toggle to the right of Automatic Ear Detection.  You can also try restarting your iPhone completely and by making sure your AirPods are fully charged. If that doesn’t fix the issue you may want to try a complete reset of AirPods. How to Fix Bad AirPods Battery Life AirPods battery life should be about five hours on a charge, another 3 hours with just a 15-minute charge and about 24 hours total using the case to charge in between sessions. How to fix bad AirPods battery life. If you are experiencing bad AirPods battery life you should make sure that the automatic detection is on. This will pause the AirPods when you remove them and it will help save battery life in the long run. Go to Settings -> Bluetooth -> Tap on the i to the right of AirPods. Tap on the toggle to the right of Automatic Ear Detection. Green is on.  Avoid constantly flicking the case open and closed near your iPhone. We don’t know for sure that this is draining battery life, but it is triggering an AirPods animation on the iPhone so it would make sense that some kind of Bluetooth handshake is happening. Some users report that the AirPods case is draining fast without any use. If this happens you can try resetting the AirPods. If that fails, you should contact Apple and go into a store to exchange for a new pair of AirPods. How to Reset AirPods It takes about 15 seconds to reset the AirPods and this will solve many of the AIrPods problems listed above as well as general connectivity issues and glitchy AirPods behavior. Put the AirPods in the case. Find the button on the back and hold it for about 15 seconds. When the small LED flashes orange it is complete. Open the case next to your iPhone and reconnect. iCloud will then sync the connection to your other devices. We found that after we reset the AirPods they connected faster and more reliably. This is worth trying if you have annoying AirPods problems that you can’t fix any other way. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Today, Samsung heir and business leader Lee Jae-yong has been arrested for corruption, Mark Zuckerberg has outlined Facebook's plans to become a global community-building tool, Elon Musk has revealed more about his boring company and more.

Samsung boss arrested on bribery charges Lee Jae-yong, the heir to and effective head of Samsung, has been arrested on bribery charges in an ongoing corruption scandal that has swept through Korea's business and political elite (New York Times). Mr Lee, whose official position in the company is vice chairman, is accused of paying bribes worth $36 million to Choi Soon-sil, the cult-like figure who was the power behind the throne of disgraced Korean president Park Geun-hye. Mr Lee has been imprisoned pending indictment. Samsung has said in a statement that "we will do our best to ensure that the truth is revealed in the court proceedings".

Facebook plans to 'give people the power to build a global community' Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has described ambitious plans for the company's role in humanity's collective global future in an interview with TechCrunch and an essay published on Facebook. He says that Facebook's key goal for the future is to build a "global community" and that "our next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community - for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for inclusion of all". To this end, he's set out a plan that involves encouraging people to form "meaningful groups" using Facebook as the foundation for everything from information distribution to civic engagement. Meanwhile, and far more prosaically, Facebook is facing a lawsuit alleging that it stole trade secrets when it designed its Swedish data centre. 3. Elon Musk details more of his tunnel boring plans Elon Musk has revealed more about his current and future plans for his recently-revealed tunnel boring project (The Verge). Speaking to Bloomberg, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said that the project has "no full-time employees", but that it's being run by SpaceX engineer Steve Davis. Despite sharing staff, it's an independent company, and already has one tunnel boring machine (TBM), nicknamed Nannie. Musk eventually plans to build an enormous network of tunnels for cars and high-speed trains, but so far the only tunnel the company has dug is a steep shaft down into SpaceX's Los Angeles parking lot. The company will need permits to dig any further beneath LA's foundations. 4. Apple sets a date for its next Worldwide Developers Conference Apple has announced that its 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference will take place from June 5 to June 9 in San Hose, California (Ars Technica). The event, which is moving to a new and larger venue this year, is open to registered members of the Apple Developer Program and Apple Developer Enterprise Program, who will be randomly selected for the opportunity to buy a $1,599 ticket. It's also where the latest developments and updates to Apple's software and operating systems are revealed, so we can expect to get an early look at new versions of macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS to be released in autumn.

There is now facial recognition software for lemurs A team of lemur biologists and computer scientists has created LemurFaceID – recognition technology that can identify facial variations in lemurs with 97 per cent accuracy (WIRED). Identifying individual lemurs has previously relied upon cataloguing unique identifiers, such as differences in body size and shape, or the presence of injuries and scars, but this is not entirely reliable, though, as zoologists are forced to rely on factors that can change over time, or are perhaps too common amongst the localised lemur population. LemurFaceID could allow the animals to be recorded and monitored with minimal interference from biologists, which in turn, could reduce costs. While the software has initially been used in captive settings in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, the promise of using facial recognition in the wild could be of great benefit to the global lemur population. Book now for WIRED Health On March 9 at 30 Euston Square, London, WIRED Health's fourth annual event features speakers including the co-inventor of CRISPR; the scientist behind applying behavioural economics to public policy; and the entrepreneur tackling the fragmented health records system. 6. Researchers need more brains Researchers are facing a desperate shortage of donated human brains from people suffering disorders including depression, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and post-traumatic stress disorder (BBC). Brain banks around the world don't have enough donations from people with neurological disorders to enable scientists researching the conditions to carry out vital studies into the biological symptoms and potentially even causes of the disorders. Prof Sabina Berretta, scientific director of the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Centre in the USA, told the BBC : "If people think that there are no changes in the brain of somebody that suffers from major depression or post-traumatic stress disorder then there is no reason for them to donate their brain for research because (they think that) there is nothing there to find. This conception is radically wrong from a biological point of view." In the UK, the Human Tissue Authority provides information on how to donate your brain for medical research.

Microsoft's open-source sim will let you crash self-driving cars Microsoft has released open-source software designed to let developers crash drones and self-driving cars (WIRED). Called Aerial Informatics and Robotics Platform, or AirSim for short, the code creates a realistic training environment in which it's possible to simulate mistakes without real-world consequences. The system is built on the Unreal gaming engine and is able to show shadows, reflections, water on a surface and more real-world objects that are difficult to simulate. The code for AirSim has been made available on GitHub and the firm says it is still under "heavy development". Shital Shah, a Microsoft researcher behind the project, says the simulator has been designed for drones but can be used for other types of vehicles. 8. Play an online piano duet with an AI Google has today launched a delightful new web-based experiment that allows you to play a piano duet with an AI (TechCrunch). A.I. Duet, built on the open source Magenta TensorFlow music project, is designed to work by responding to what you play. You can use either a MIDI keyboard or your computer keyboard to play a few notes, and the AI will try to come up with an appropriate response melody. The results can be a bit hit-and-miss when it comes to musical quality, but it's great fun, and - although it's not necessarily how you're supposed to play with it - we were particularly entertained by playing it simple repeating arpeggios and chord sequences, and leaving the AI to improvise over the top while we kept up a backing track. 9. Gabe Newell: VR is for 'enthusiasts and hardcore people' In a rare interview with journalists from publications including Polygon, Valve CEO Gabe Newell has discussed virtual reality, the importance of open standards, and what the future could hold for Valve's game development. He says that VR is "a great thing for enthusiasts and hardcore people. Where we are today is way further down the road than we were a year ago. But it's just going to be this slow, painful fits and starts kind of thing. So while we are really happy with how things are going, yeah, it doesn't match up with what other companies are saying." While he describes current VR technology - including the HTC Vive that Valve co-developed - as "barely capable of doing a marginally adequate job", he feels that open hardware standards and completely new directions in game design are what's needed to make the technology's future. 10. The Romero family's latest game is free for mobile users Gunman Taco Truck, the first game designed by the son of developers John (Doom) and Brenda (Wizardry) Romero, Donovan Brathwaite-Romero is out now on mobile platforms (Eurogamer). The game, which was released at the end of last month on Steam for £8.99, casts you as a taco vendor trying to make their way across post-apocalyptic America, and combines mutant-shooting action with resource management and a taco-making sim. It's available to download for free now on Android and iOS.

Apple’s move comes as it seeks to boost its share in the world’s fastest growing major mobile market, where handsets far cheaper than Apple’s iPhones dominate. It also comes as smartphone sales growth is slowing in Asia’s other massive market, China. To lower prices, Apple has been seeking to set up local production and has been in talks with the Indian government regarding issues such as tax concessions. The industry source told Reuters the initial manufacturing of the iPhone SE model was not contingent on those concessions. Read | Apple moves closer to iPhone assembly in India, may manufacture in Bengaluru Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Economic Times newspaper earlier on Friday reported Apple planned to initially assemble 300,000 to 400,000 iPhone SE handsets in India. The industry source told Reuters the numbers would be substantially lower to begin with. The source also said it was too early to say what other phone models Apple would assemble at the Bengaluru plant. Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to India last year, with a third coming in the December quarter, according to market researcher Counterpoint, which estimates that three-quarters of smartphones sold in India were made locally. Read | Apple says ready to make in India, govt considers relaxing norms In the fourth quarter, Apple ranked 10th in India’s smartphone market but led the premium segment with a 62% market share, Counterpoint said. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and a host of Chinese players including Xiaomi and Vivo dominate India’s smartphone market where the vast majority of phones sold are priced below Rs 15,000 ($225). In comparison, the entry level iPhone SE model sells on Amazon.com’s India site for Rs 28,433 ($424). tags iPhone SE Apple Wistron Corp Bengaluru plant Make in India more from tech Here is what Mark Zuckerberg said about PM Modi in a Facebook post Feb 17, 2017 13:16 IST The Zuckerberg manifesto: How he plans to debug the world Feb 17, 2017 09:24 IST A Guide to Teaching Your Kids About Money Partnered feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

By: Samden Sherpa Published: Friday, February 17, 2017, 13:15 [IST] It was few days back when Priyank Kharge, IT minister of Karnataka, India, took to Twitter to announce that Apple would soon start manufacturing iPhones in India. And while it looks like Apple Inc has got the green signal from the Indian government, various reports are now indicating that in the coming months Apple could start assembling its lower-priced iPhone SE models at a contract manufacturer's plant in Bengaluru. Moreover, it has been said that Apple's Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp will be setting up a plant in Bengaluru to focus solely on assembling iPhones. SEE ALSO: Apple iPhone 8 production to start early this year As per Economic Times newspaper, Apple was expected to initially assemble 300,000 to 400,000 iPhone SE handsets in India. However, the numbers might differ and be lower than the said number reports Reuters. However, analyzing Apple's move to start assembling iPhone SE initially it might be because the company aims to boost its share in the world's fastest growing major mobile market, where handsets far cheaper than Apple's iPhones dominate. It can also because Apple has seen smartphone sales growth coming down in Asia and most prominently in China. SEE ALSO: Official: Apple to manufacture iPhones in Bengaluru, Karnataka While we have heard about the iPhone SE, nothing more has been disclosed as to what other phone models would be assembled by Apple at the Bengaluru plant. Besides, currently the entry level iPhone SE model sells on Amazon India for 28,433 rupees ($424).

Ltd, the local arm of Cupertino-based Apple Inc., will soon start assembling iPhones in India at a plant in Bangalore being set up by its Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp, a financial daily reported on Friday. Wistron will assemble units of the iPhone SE starting April this year, a report in The Economic Times said, citing sources. Apple is likely to set up the plant without waiting for the government’s approval on the tax concessions that it had sought in December. It may also shift some of its Chinese manufacturing units to India due to rising labour costs, the report added. An email query sent to Apple India did not elicit a response at the time of filing this report. Apple unveiled the iPhone SE in March last year. The four-inch smartphone was launched with a price tag of Rs 39,000 for the 16GB version. Currently, the phone is retailing under Rs 30,000 at e-commerce portals. Local manufacturing could help Apple further reduce the cost of the devices. Apple’s move to start manufacturing in India comes at a time when its sales in China, the company’s second-biggest market, are slowing. Meanwhile, India’s smartphone market is rapidly expanding and is likely to overtake the US to become the second-largest in the world, as per a report by market research firm IDC. Last month, it was reported that Wistron Corp was seeking permission from the Karnataka government to expand its Bengaluru plant. Earlier this month, several media reports said that Apple was likely to assemble iPhones at a plant being set up by Wistron Corp in the Peenya industrial area near Bengaluru. In December 2016, Apple had shared a list of demands with the Indian government seeking tax concessions, including lower import and manufacturing duties, and certain policy exemptions as prerequisites for setting up manufacturing operations in the country. Currently, most of Apple’s products are assembled in China, primarily by Foxconn Technology Group, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Like this report?

First noticed by MacRumours, the report derives from JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall. He says that Apple's next iPhone will integrate a front-facing 3D laser scanner for security purposes, replacing the existing Touch ID fingerprint scanner built in to the Home button. Hall adds in his research note that the conclusion is based on the increasing number of laser scanning modules popping up in Apple's supply chain. It's believed that such an addition would cost Apple $10-15 per part (between £8-12), but combined with other improvements on the iPhone 8 (or should that be the iPhone 7S?), see up to $100 (about £80) added to the final retail price of the phone, which could exceed $1,000 (£800) according to further chit-chat. All of which is roughly in line with other recent iPhone gossip, which has suggested Apple might be preparing to scrap the Home button in favour of a multi-purpose 'function area' at the bottom of the new device's (rumoured) edge-to-edge OLED display – think the Touch Bar on a phone and you get the idea. Check out our video guide below to catch up on even more iPhone 8 rumours. WATCH: iPhone 8 news and rumours Would you prefer face scanning over Touch ID? And are you excited for the iPhone 8?

By: Prajith Sabbani Published: Friday, February 17, 2017, 12:30 [IST] Apple, the Cupertino-based tech giant, has been named the most admired company once again in Fortune's annual list of World's Most Admired Companies. This is the 10th consecutive time that Apple has been awarded the first spot in Fortune's ranking. Fortune had reportedly collected opinions from "3,800 executives, analysts, directors, and industry experts," to bestow the honor to the company. Fortune highlights that these rankings are allocated to the companies based on "key attributes of reputation," which include "innovation, quality of management and products, and social responsibility." Also Read: Apple to jettison home button on iPhone 8 in favor of a "function area" Other companies that made it Fortune's "World's Most Admired Companies" ranking include Amazon.com, Starbucks, Berkshire Hathaway, Disney, Alphabet, General Electric, Southwest Airlines, Facebook, and Microsoft in the same order after Apple. It is worth noting that, Alphabet, Apple's arch-rival has slithered to 6th position from 2nd in 2017 ranking. As is the case with every year, Fortune ranking took into consideration the 1,000 largest companies in the US in terms of revenue. Also, 500 international firms with revenue over USD 10 billion were considered. Finally, the list was narrowed down to 680 companies located in 28 countries.

(Source: Reuters) Apple Inc will in the coming months start assembling its lower-priced iPhone SE models at a contract manufacturer’s plant in the southern Indian technology hub of Bengaluru, an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday. Apple’s Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp is setting up a plant in Bengaluru to focus solely on assembling iPhones, a separate source told Reuters earlier this month. Apple’s move comes as it seeks to boost its share in the world’s fastest growing major mobile market, where handsets far cheaper than Apple’s iPhones dominate. It also comes as smartphone sales growth is slowing in Asia’s other massive market, China. Watch all our videos from Express Technology To lower prices, Apple has been seeking to set up local production and has been in talks with the Indian federal government regarding issues such as tax concessions. The industry source told Reuters the initial manufacturing of the iPhone SE model was not contingent on those concessions. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The industry source told Reuters the numbers would be substantially lower to begin with. The source also said it was too early to say what other phone models Apple would assemble at the Bengaluru plant. Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to India last year, with a third coming in the December quarter, according to market researcher Counterpoint, which estimates that three-quarters of smartphones sold in India were made locally. In the fourth quarter, Apple ranked 10th in India’s smartphone market but led the premium segment with a 62 percent market share, Counterpoint said. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and a host of Chinese players including Xiaomi and Vivo dominate India’s smartphone market where the vast majority of phones sold are priced below 15,000 rupees ($225). In comparison, the entry level iPhone SE model sells on Amazon.com’s India site for 28,433 rupees ($424).

WWDC 2017 will take place in San Jose at the McEnery Convention Center. It will begin on June 5. It will let developers meet and talk to more than 1000 Apple engineers while the conference is located very close to Apple’s new headquarters in Cupertino. WWDC 2017 will have Apple showcasing the future of iOS, watchOS, and macOS. I hope they have a good showcase for gaming on iOS because that aspect has been a bit lacking over the last few years. The focus on MFI controllers feels less and less and years go by. Registration for tickets will open on March 27 at 10 AM PDT. This will be open to members of Apple’s Developer Program or Developer Enterprise Program only.

By: Abhinaya Prabhu Published: Friday, February 17, 2017, 11:45 [IST] While the entire tech world is focused on the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2017 slated to debut on February 27 at Barcelona, Apple has come up with an announcement. The company has confirmed that the WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) will happen on June 5, 2017 in San Jose. It is a four-day event slated to happen between June 5 and June 9. Usually, Apple's WWDC happens in the middle of the year. While we know that it will be an early-June affair every year, the confirmation from Apple gives us a clear date. Basically, at the WWDC, Apple will meet the developers in order to discuss its upcoming products. This year, the event is likely to be mainly focused on the firmware and software aspects, tipping that we can expect the next version of iOS to be a key aspect. The alleged iOS 11 will be rolled out sometime in September along with the latest iPhones. Still, we can see a preview or beta version of the same rolling out soon after the WWDC.

By: Prajith Sabbani Published: Friday, February 17, 2017, 12:30 [IST] Apple, the Cupertino-based tech giant, has been named the most admired company once again in Fortune's annual list of World's Most Admired Companies. This is the 10th consecutive time that Apple has been awarded the first spot in Fortune's ranking. Fortune had reportedly collected opinions from "3,800 executives, analysts, directors, and industry experts," to bestow the honor to the company. Fortune highlights that these rankings are allocated to the companies based on "key attributes of reputation," which include "innovation, quality of management and products, and social responsibility." Also Read: Apple to jettison home button on iPhone 8 in favor of a "function area" Other companies that made it Fortune's "World's Most Admired Companies" ranking include Amazon.com, Starbucks, Berkshire Hathaway, Disney, Alphabet, General Electric, Southwest Airlines, Facebook, and Microsoft in the same order after Apple. It is worth noting that, Alphabet, Apple's arch-rival has slithered to 6th position from 2nd in 2017 ranking. As is the case with every year, Fortune ranking took into consideration the 1,000 largest companies in the US in terms of revenue. Also, 500 international firms with revenue over USD 10 billion were considered. Finally, the list was narrowed down to 680 companies located in 28 countries.

Most people are aware of “The Grapes of Wrath,” which won a Pulitzer Prize and was made into a film starring Henry Fonda. The lesser known novel, written in between “Tortilla Flat” and “Of Mice and Men” (Jesus, this guy had some talent) was titled “In Dubious Battle.” The year is 1934. We find ourselves in the Bolton Apple Orchards of California. Many people have picked up back east and headed west with the promise of available work and great wages. However, the influx of laborers has driven wages down, much to the chagrin of the apple pickers. A burly man named London (Vincent D’Onofrio) confronts old man Bolton (Robert Duvall). Having been promised three dollars a day for their work, the workers have only received one dollar a day and are, justifiably, unhappy. They want to fight for what they have owed them. They only need a little nudge. Some of you reading this may be saying to yourself, “I didn’t know James Franco directed.” I am a fan of his film “SAL,” but I was shocked to learn that, if the Internet Movie Data Base is to be believed, he has no less than SEVEN films coming out this year that he directed. He really is a renaissance man! Franco also stars here as Mac, an organizer for a group that is trying to unionize the apple pickers. He had taken under his wing a young man named Jim (Nat Wolff). His eyes not truly open, Jim is drawn to the movement by the fiery rhetoric of Mac. Together they apply for work at Bolton’s orchards and try to blend in. They begin to make small talk with the other workers, trying to feel out who can be a leader and discover London. They discover that most of the workers have had their spirits crushed. When Jim makes an optimistic comment he is met with a frown. “That sounds like hope,” he’s told. But hope may be all these people need. Perfectly paced and skillfully cast, “In Dubious Battle” is one of those small films that occasionally see the light of day. With a perfect period background and an accompanying musical score by Volker Bertelmann, whose score for this year’s “Lion” has been nominated for an Academy Award, the film takes you back in time to a period when life seemed easier but surely wasn’t. And Franco seems to be the new Woody Allen in that everyone wants to work with him. He has filled his cast with some of the best (and in my case, favorite) character actors, including Ed Harris, Bryan Cranston and John Savage. As London, D’Onofrio adds another great character to his resume. Wolff begins the film clad in innocence, growing more defiant as the story progresses. Franco’s Mac is almost a step-brother to “The Grapes of Wrath”s Tom Joad, pushing forward and giving the occasional inspirational speech. I’ll admit here that I am a member of a labor union. My current home-state, Missiouri, recently voted to be a “Right to Work” state. I found this film inspirational, both in content and in the commemoration of those that came before us.

Shares Fans of Apple's Touch ID feature may have to adapt, as the next iPhone could replace the biometric security measure with something a little more in-your-face. JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall says in a research note that Apple's iPhone 8 will forgo Touch ID sensors for a 3D laser face scanner, as reported by MacRumors. While speculative, Hall's statement matches up previous reports that Apple is considering a new facial recognition feature for its phones that will either replace or work alongside the fingerprint-guided Touch ID. From a design perspective, a face scanner would potentially fall in line with other rumors that Apple is doing away with the home button (which doubles as the Touch ID sensor on applicable iOS devices) for the upcoming phone, going instead with a screen that could take up the entire front of the handset. Of course, rumors commenting on rumors (while other rumors run counter to them) are all something to take individually with a grain of salt.  However, as Apple confirms June 5 will be the opening day for this year's annual WWDC showing, we may just learn for sure what the iPhone maker has in store sooner than later.

The iPhone 7 has a 4.7 inch display with an IPS LCD panel along with the home button below the display. The iPhone 8 however will feature a 5.15 inch OLED panel according to the information in the image and will hide the home button behind a bar of fiction keys, much like the touch bar on the latest MacBook. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo states that the real size of the display will be around 5.8 inches however the display area will be only 5.15 inches while retaining the iPhone 7 form factor. The next iPhone much like previous leaks suggest will hide the home button and fingerprint scanner in all entirety being the OLED panel allowing for a larger appearing display. The reports also mention Apple may also completely do away with touch ID for an alternative form of verification like facial or iris recognition, which was seen on the Galaxy Note 7 ( oh, the Galaxy Note 7, how you are missed !) . It seems unlikely that apple will kill possibly the most used thing on iPhones, i.e the touch ID. However, this will not be the only iPhone launched in 2017, but, one of the 3 phones that launch this year. The other two will be identical in design and screen dimensions like the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus, possibly with improved specifications.   likethis What's your reaction?

With that mind, we want to show you how to fix common iOS 9 problems on all versions of the Apple’s aging operating system. Advertisement Last year, Apple replaced iOS 9 with its iOS 10 operating system. And while most iOS 9-powered devices got bumped up to iOS 10, some devices, like the popular iPhone 4s, got left behind on the iOS 9.3.5 update. If you’re stuck on iOS 9.3.5, you can’t download iOS 10 in an effort to fix problems. You must find a fix yourself. Those of you on iOS 9 by choice should consider upgrading to iOS 10 if trouble strikes. If you can’t get off iOS 9 or don’t want to upgrade to iOS 10, here’s list of potential fixes for your iOS 9 problems. Advertisement These will work if you’re on iOS 9.0, iOS 9.0.1, iOS 9.0.2, iOS 9.1, iOS 9.2, iOS 9.2.1, iOS 9.3, iOS 9.3.1, iOS 9.3.2, iOS 9.3.3, iOS 9.3.4, or the iOS 9.3.5 update. How to Fix iOS 9 Touchscreen Problems If your device’s screen stops responding after upgrading to a new version of iOS 9 update, there’s no need to panic. At least not right off the bat. We ran into this problem right after we installed the update on the iPhone 6. The problem prevented us from accessing any apps and it also prevented us from turning the phone off. Fortunately, we were able to fix it very quickly with a simple solution. If your screen stops responding to touches and swipes, you’ll want to hold down the power button and home button at the same time. Wait for the phone to reboot and then try to use your screen like you normally do. Advertisement If it doesn’t work the first time, try it again until it works. It took three resets for our screen to start working again. How to Fix iOS 9 Battery Life Problems The iOS 9 update brings a tangible battery life boost to the iPhone. Some users might get up to an extra hour of battery life. While some users are seeing an increase, others are noticing abnormal battery drain on their device. Battery issues are common, particularly right after a major system update like iOS 9. If your iOS 9 battery life isn’t what you think it should be after installing iOS 9.3.2, wait a couple of days for the update to settle. Things tend to improve after two days or so. If they don’t, take a look at our list of iOS 9 battery life fixes and tips that will help you fix bad iOS 9.0, iOS iOS 9.1, iOS 9.2, or iOS 9.3 battery life. They’ll also help if you’re dealing with Pokemon Go battery life problems. The augmented reality game is causing tons of battery issues for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. How to Fix iOS 9 Wi-Fi Problems We’re already seeing complaints about broken Wi-Fi in iOS 9. This isn’t at all surprising given that Wi-Fi problems are among the most common iOS problems. Fortunately, there are some proven fixes that could help you alleviate your iOS 9 Wi-Fi issues. If you run into Wi-Fi problems on iOS 9, you’ll want to reset your Network Settings. To do this, head into Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. This process can take a few minutes to complete and after it’s done, your device will have forgotten known Wi-Fi passwords so make sure you have your password handy. If that doesn’t solve your issue, forget your Wi-Fi networks and reconnect to them. To get that done, go into your Settings > Wi-Fi > Select your connection > Tap Forget this Network at the top of the screen. Reconnect if you can. If those fixes don’t work, take a close look at your router. We recommend unplugging it for a good minute or so then plugging it back in. If that doesn’t help, see if there is a firmware update for your router. Each router is different so you’ll need to consult your manual on how to do this. If none of these fixes work for you, you can head here for some other potential fixes. Apple’s also got its own guide available as well. How to Fix Touch ID Problems Many iOS 9 users are complaining about issues with Touch ID. Some are saying that the update has caused problems with accuracy while others are saying that their fingerprints no longer work to open up their device. These issues might require a direct fix from Apple but there are some things you can try if Touch ID starts acting up. How to Fix Touch ID Failures If Touch ID suddenly stops working, try re-training your fingerprints. Before doing this you’ll want to make sure you that dirt and sweat are removed from the Touch ID sensor and that oil is removed from your hands. Next. go to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > Enter your Passcode. On the next screen swipe from right to left on each fingerprint to delete them. When this is complete you can tap on Add a Fingerprint… to re-train Touch ID. How to Fix Touch ID Problems in App Store If you’re unable to use Touch ID in the App Store, try this fix. First go to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > Enter your Passcode. Then turn off iTunes & App Store. Reboot your iPhone or iPad. Go back to Touch ID & Passcode in Settings and turn iTunes & App Store back on. How to Fix Touch ID If It’s Not Working at All If it stops working, try resetting the phone by holding down the home button and the power button for 10 seconds or until the phone restarts. If that doesn’t work, you might want to try a factory reset as this has been known to dislodge major Touch ID problems. The instructions can be found at the bottom of this page. How to Fix iOS 9 Cellular Data Problems We’re also seeing iOS 9 users complain about issues with cellular data. We’ve seen the list of complaints grow in the months since the iOS 9 release. This is another common iOS problem and one that should affect various iOS 9 users in the weeks to come. Cellular data issues can be tricky but there are a few known fixes for them. If you’re sure that these issues don’t have anything to do with an outage, either at Apple or device’s service provider, you’ll want to first try restarting your device. Power it down, slide to turn it off, and reboot it. It’s simple but it has squashed cellular issues in the past. If that restart doesn’t help, try toggling Cellular Data off and on in your device’s Settings. To do that go into Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data > Toggle Off. After you toggle it off, toggle it back on and see if that doesn’t help. If that doesn’t work, try flipping Airplane Mode on for 30 seconds before turning it back off again. Airplane Mode kills all connections on your device. The Airplane Mode function can be found at the top of your Settings If the problem is with LTE, try shutting LTE off for a few minutes. To shut it down, go into Settings > Cellular > Enable LTE > Off. Flip it back on when ready. How to Fix iOS 9 Bluetooth Problems Bluetooth issues are among the most common iOS problems and we’re not surprised to see them affecting iOS 9 users after the iOS 9.3.2 release. Like cellular data problems, these can be a little tricky to fix because of the sheer number of Bluetooth devices out there. Here are a few things to try. The first thing you’ll want to do is reset your device’s Network Settings. To get that done go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. Your device will forget the Bluetooth device and you’ll now have to reconnect. If that doesn’t dislodge your problem, you’ll want to try forgetting the Bluetooth connection. To do that go to Settings > Bluetooth > Select your connection using the circular blue i tab > Tap Forget this Device. Try reconnecting. You can also try resetting all of your settings. This has worked for us in the past and there’s a chance it will work for you. To reset all of your settings go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings. This process could take a few minutes and after it’s done, your device’s settings will be restored to factory defaults. In other words, have your Wi-Fi passwords handy. If you are seeing Bluetooth problems in the car, you’ll want to consult your car’s manual so that you can restart the connection. This could be a little time consuming for some of you so make sure you set aside some quiet time to do it. Forget the connection and then try reconnecting to the car. If that doesn’t help, you might want to try bringing it into a dealer or car specialist to take a look. How to Fix iOS 9 App Problems If you’re running into issues with third-party applications after installing an iOS 9 update, you’ll want to try a few things before throwing your phone against a wall or deleting the app entirely. First, see if there is a recent update for your app. Developers have been rolling out iOS 9 support updates that could help. For instance, Google recommends iOS 9.3.2 to those encountering connection issues with its Google app. We’ve downloaded a number of these updates and we haven’t run into any major problems with our apps. Make sure you read reviews from users on the App Store first though. If that doesn’t work, try reinstalling the application. This has worked for us and many others in the past and it’s worth a shot. Make sure your data is backed up before you do this. If that doesn’t work, contact the developer and tell them about your problem so that they can address it in a future update. And finally, if you’re running into a Pokemon Go problem on iOS 9, you’ll want to take a look at our list of fixes for common Pokemon Go problems. How to Fix iOS 9 App Store Problems We’ve been seeing complaints about problems with the App Store and downloading updates. This is obviously a big problem and it’s one that appears to be affecting iOS 9.0, iOS 9.1, iOS 9.2, and iOS 9.3 users as well. There are two known fixes for the problem though they aren’t guaranteed to work for you. The first requires a reset. To do this, hold down the power button and home button. Users are saying that got rid of the issue. Others are saying that they’ve been able to rapidly tap “Update” on an app before the “Open” symbol appears. Some have said that they’ve had to tap upwards of 10 times for it to work but that it worked in the long run. We’ve also seen this issue on older iOS updates and the issue simply went away after a short period of time. So if nothing works, be patient. How to Improve iOS 9 Performance If you are dealing with performance issues like lag, you’ll want to consult our list of tips to improve the fluidity of iOS. How to Fix iOS 9 iMessage Problems We’re also seeing problems with iMessage after the iOS 9.3.2 update. These are extremely common and we will almost certainly see iMessage problems continue well into iOS 9’s lifespan. If you’re seeing problems with Messages, the first thing you’ll want to do is toggle the feature off and on again. Go into your Settings > Messages > Toggle iMessage off then back on. This fix has worked for us in the past and it’s the first thing you’ll want to try out. If that quick fix doesn’t work, reboot your device. And if a reboot doesn’t work, head into your settings and reset Network Settings. Head into Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. This will cause your device to forget your connections so make sure you have your Wi-Fi passwords handy. How to Fix iOS 9 Problems If Nothing Here Works If you’re dealing with an iOS 9 problem that’s not listed here, you’ll want to head to Apple’s discussion forums and look around. Users there are typically very helpful, and knowledgeable, and that’s a great place to start. If you’re still experiencing Apple Music problems on iOS 9, you’ll want to head to the Apple Music discussion forum. If you can’t fix the problem with any of those, take your device into an Apple Store. Schedule an appointment at the Genius Bar and see if the geniuses there can’t diagnose your problem. If you don’t want to do that, get in contact with Apple Support via Twitter to see if they have a remedy for your issue. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.2.1 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.2.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.2.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.2 update brings 13 known patches for potential exploits. That's one more than its predecessor (iOS 10.2). These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2 update and/or the iOS 10.1.1 update, know that iOS 10.2.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2 update had 12 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.2.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.2.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 10 496 Responses 09/17/2015 harlan Reply Why no mention of frustrating sceeen dimming and brightening for no apparant reason? 09/22/2015 matt Reply I have same thing have you fixed this yet? email me and let me know matthew.conboy@bnymellon.com 09/24/2015 Steve Reply Thats an easy fix.

As my phone is an expensive paperweight at the moment. 09/23/2015 Janet Reply Okay – So I am happy to say that I fixed my phone. Thanks to my 16 yr old. lol My phone would keep going back to “Swipe to upgrade” and wouldn’t do anything else. Spoke with Tech support at Apple and after the lady trying to help me and nothing worked she said I would have to restore the phone.(and lose everything) I decided to wait till my kids got home from school to see if they had any idea’s and all we did was repeated the process that the tech lady had me do and it worked the second time. So I connected my phone to the computer and logged into Itunes. Then I held down the home and power button for about 20 seconds until the Itunes icon appeared on my phone screen. Then you click the update software button on the computer and wait for it to download new software for your phone. (Do not click Restore) it didn’t work for me the first time but was a success the second try. 09/27/2015 Andrew Reply I’m so mad can you help me because my phone won’t unlock, it won’t slide to unlock 09/18/2015 Charles Reply @ Debra…”Slide to update stuck”…..same with me, nothing seems to help, multiple combined pressing “home” and “power”….ending up at the same point..again stuck at sliding 09/18/2015 Mary Reply Charles, I am having the same problem. I keep getting the side to upgrade screen and then can’t get in. This article doesn’t really help and what makes it annoying is that he keeps saying go to your settings. I can’t get to my settings because I can’t get the phone to work. I get as far as the WiFi and then it takes me back to the upgrade screen and I can’t get in. HELP PLEASE 09/18/2015 carys Reply Same issue on my iphone 4s, tried rebooting it three times with the lock and home button and it takes me through two steps: it tells me to press ‘continue’ which i do and then tells to connect to wifi which do and works perfectly but then…. it gets stuck on ‘slide to upgrade’ and there isn’t anyway i am able to slide it as it just freezes. Although the ‘slide to upgrade’ is shining like it does normally on an iphone when you go to unlock it. I have no idea what to do as the only way i can get it to work it to factory restore but it says i have find my iphone on which i didn’t know about, but the only way on turning that off is to go to my phones settings and turn it off, which i obviously can’t as i can’t get onto my phone!!! Really do not know what to do and i’m not paying to talk to an apple support person as it will cost me £25 for them to tell me what i’ve already tried! 09/18/2015 Mary Reply So sorry to hear this Carys. I went to Apple and they told me I would have to have the phone reset back to original settings. I checked with a guy I know that works on Apple phones and he said the same thing. I read what Charles read and am going to try to do that if I can find someone with a mac computer (mine is not working, it was over heating earlier this week). It is worth a shot at this point so i don’t lose everything on my phone..

We started all over by powering down the Iphone thru pressing both pwr and home button for a long time and simultaneously aonnected to the Imac. When you do so the Apple logo will appear and when you still keep pressing pwr and home, the logo will disappear and then a complete new logo appears: Itunes combined the an immage of the apple connector-cable. In Itunes on your Mac, there is now a possibility to choose for update or restore. From here on, the Mac will help you on. MIND YOU (!): it didn’t work for me (same problem turning up…stucl at the” slide to update”, but that might be due to my backups (?)…hope it will work for you..

I am BEYOND pissed about this. I keep SLIDING TO UPGRADE and it shows the apple logo and loads and then goes right back to > slide to upgrade. I have a 4s 8GB and I wasn’t able to update at all to ios 8 because of storage reasons. I was fine with that. Today I deleted something that gave me enough space to be able to install ios 9. I was so excited that I could finally update. WELL I should’ve just stayed with ios 7. I can’t use my freaking phone! Even if they come up with a solution, how do we get it fixed if we can’t get into our phones??? I am not paying for anything. Multiple people are having the same issue. 09/18/2015 Mary Reply Autry, I can relate so much to your problem. I also have a 4s with 8gb and couldn’t do a ios8 upgrade because of storage that when I saw the ios 9 I was excited and when it started downloading I thought, oh how nice. Yeah how nice that Apple just screwed up my phone and the only solution they can give me is that I will have to lose everything on my phone. The guy at Apple says did you back it up. No sir I can’t because my Apple computer isn’t working due to over heating problems. He says oh you should back up the stuff on your computer before they use it. Duhhhhh, I can’t back up because can’t turn it on, I don’t want it crashing. It has been two days and they still haven’t called me back. I am so disheartened. 09/23/2015 Judy Reply Mary, I talked to Apple and was told they are getting rid of the older phones. They want people to get new ones. My mother had the same phone you have, I ended up getting her the 6 because without the updates there were things she couldn’t do. You might have to get a new model. Sorry to hear everyone is still having problems. Good luck 09/23/2015 R Brown Reply Apple has NO RIGHT to get rid of the older phones. It should be the consumer’s decision when to purchase a new phone not be forced into upgrading because of the malicious attempts by a company to sell more of their (newer) product. This is NOT right. We bought our phones with the impression that we would get support from Apple, not that they would sabotage it with a destructive upgrade. My next phone is not going to be an Apple and my next computer will not be a MAC! Just lost a great deal of respect for this company!!! 05/20/2016 David They can not support old hardware forever 09/18/2015 mark Reply i have a 5s and ios9 messed up mine too… the typing sound was always on even when i turned off in settings, after every reboot in app swticher there were the same 6-7 apps open which i didnt open but still stuck in memory, the whole os was a mess, laggy, sluggish, so i went back to 8.4.1 asap, now everything alright… sorry guys i totally get your frustrations, shame on you apple, better fix it cause that is really embarassing 10/01/2015 Debi Reply Mark can you help me?

Then go to your phone dialing pad and dial ##873283# then hit the dial button 3. You will get a screen that pops up sorry I don’t recall what it said then hit ok, you should get a second screen that pops up and hit ok, if you get a fail then you are not connected to a wifi 4. then try making a call if it doesn’t go through then go to the settings>celluar>turn cellular data off and back on (I had to do this step and it worked for me) then try to make a call The explanation I got was I had to reconnect my calling connection with a tower, hope this helps 09/20/2015 Monika Reply Thank you Tina!

And don’t give me that crap about adjusting the volume because I have done that, in fact that was the first thing that I did and Siri still remain silent! 09/21/2015 Saman Reply I have exactly the same problem as you. Siri was working fine. I updated to iOS 9, still worked fine. After a couple of hours, bang! Siri only responds with text. It works perfectly fine, but it just doesn’t speak. Also, I should mention that I hear the “ding” sound, so the problem isn’t with volume or something like that (in iOS 9, when you press and hold the home button, Siri doesn’t make that “ding” sound, and nor does it for me. But when you ask it to call some one, for instance, it then makes the “ding” sound (which it always did). I can hear that well! But Siri doesn’t say a word. I tried all of these: Turning volume up while Siri is supposed to be talking. Trying it with headsets. No difference. Turning phone on and off several times. Turning Wi-Fi on and off. The problem persists with both Wi-Fi and LTE. Turning my wireless modem on and off. Turning Siri on and off several times. Changing Siri’s voice to Male/British accent/ … . Didn’t help. When you change the voice, the preview can be heard perfectly fine. But Siri won’t talk. Switching “Hey Siri|” on and off. Trying it while charging the phone. The only thing I didn’t try is resetting my phone (reset all settings, etc.), which I’m not planning to do just yet. I found that some other people have this problem, too. Seems like the problem occured in the beta versions of iOS 9: https://www.reddit.com/r/ios9/comments/3kpk34/siri_not_talking_to_me/ 09/19/2015 Deb Potter Reply D Read all the comments and I think I’ll not update my i pad with IOS 9 – sounds too problematic right now.

It is registering when I plug it in to my computer, but not coming up on iTunes? 09/19/2015 Denise Reply I spent 4 hours this morning trying to correct the damage done to my phone by the IOS 9 update, then an additional 5 hours resetting and re-configuring with no luck. My entire Saturday spend on a phone calls. I was told that due to the high volume of people trying to update that their server crashed.I was also told that there was a glitch in IOS9 that caused many problems. I got through the entire process only to have the screen freeze up on the final step. It says, “slid to upgrade”. My iPhone 5s will not allow me to slide the screen. It’s stuck. It is INCREDIBLY frustrating!! All my work contacts, and daily communications are completely unavailable. I am so stressed out! I’ll be seeking reimbursement for the days that I am without service. The 4 people i spoke with at Apple were very kind but couldn’t accomplish anything! THIS is ridiculous! 09/19/2015 Dennise Reply Frustrated and heart broken,I lost all my pictures of family who are no longer alive. Notes that were only on my phone and numbers of friends who have moved on to new jobs. Angry because they are using us to fix their issues at our personal expense. I spent over 3 hours on this issue along with the lose of communication for a day and all my work e- mails. I will now be hours behind on Monday since that is the soonest I can arrange to have my phone set up to receive work emails. I lost precious memories because I did their update that acted like a virus, very unhappy with Apple 09/22/2015 Kendall Reply I have had my phone for almost a year and now I’ve lost all my pictures from before July 9.

They were there one day and gone the next. Not happy. Have never had to back up before upgrade before and didnt this time And to make it worst it was just this day why could it not have been the next. I didn’t upgrade on the of the hospital visit and my keyboard is slow I press the letters and it is slow to appear. Hence more mistakes and longer to type 09/19/2015 Craig Reply I had issues with IOS 9 on my iphone 5c and Ipad mini. I could not get mail from work on my devices. I tried reinstalling 8.4.1 on my own but had trouble with that. I contacted apple and I spoke to very nice and helpful techies. I scheduled a callback and the supervisor who called me back took the time to walk me through the process of reinstalling 8.4.1 from scratch on my devices, It took a while but now I can get back to getting my work emails on lotus notes. I suggest that anyone using corporate mail accounts check with their IT department a work before upgrading their devices to make sure the ios is compatible with the network. 09/20/2015 Ayla Reply HELP I updated my phone and it went to the ‘slide to upgrade’ screen but it wouldn’t let me slide so I restarted the phone and now it will let me upgrade but it keeps going straight back to ‘slide to upgrade’ I only just got the phone and I need help urgently!!

I have exactly the same problem and it is driving me nuts!!!! 09/28/2015 Avi2015 Reply Did you ever find a solution for the voice box that covers the text input?? Mine is doing the same thing. The only way to avoid it is to go to write a new text and start typing the name in and enter the text that way. Anytime I just click a conversation it shows up and I can’t see the text til I send it. 09/29/2015 Deb Norton Reply You get the counter in the text box when respond to a text from someone. If you create a new text, put in their name, you won’t get it. 10/10/2015 Jane Christie Reply I managed to fix this temporarily by resetting network settings… But it comes back.

What do I do? 09/20/2015 Peter Reply I’m an unhappy iPad owner whose 1-year-old iPad Air now fails to connect to the Internet following the iOS 9 update. I reset all wireless connections, rebooted my router, etc. The fact is, now the iPad can’t communicate with any wireless networks, not even the network in the Apple Store. This renders it useless. I expect careless updates from Microsoft, but it now appears Apple is guilty of the very same thing. What was so urgent that Apple had to push out such a massive and destructive update? 09/20/2015 Rosalyn Reply I have the same issue – itunes combined the an immage of the apple connector-cable.

Is Apple that dumb, that they think I trust them after what has happened to my IPhone. Just a joke, and an expensive one for me considering what I have lost on my phone. My phone has never improved for any update I have down loaded. All they want to do is track what I and you do and send and receive and look at. They have gone to far. How could they not test something before they put it to market!!! Is any one thinking of running a class action against them? 09/23/2015 VG Reply My iphone 5 worked quite well prior to IOS 9. Now the email lags and email history vanished. Screen flickers from low to bright. Extreme lag. One has to question whether the stratagem employed is to obliterate older products. Therefore, the necessity to purchase new products. Eps will certainly benefit. This is very reminiscent of what happened with my iphone 3 when the iphone 4s arrived and another IOS system upgrade. 09/23/2015 Veronique FP (@FromParis14) Reply It is a known problem to Apple. Their IT is working on it to solve the problem. I can’t install IOS 9, can’t restart, can’t reset or switch off my phone…First time, it is happening but how long it will take to solve the problem and have our phone work…good question. Must contact Apple Assistance to let them know you have a problem. They know it doesn’t come from the phone itself but from the IOS 9. 09/23/2015 Scotty Reply GPS worked for 10 minutes after the upgrade. Now it’s dead.

I just select the notes I want from my Notes and paste into a new folder on Evernotes and it works perfectly now – they have a great search feature that’s brilliant. Plus Evernotes syncs on your phone, ipad, desktop, whatever. Its a pain to have to move everything from iphone Notes because I’ve built those notes for many many years now so I’m just moving one at a time as and when needed.

Pleaseee :( 09/25/2015 J Reply Let’s see… iOs9 made my iPhone 6 act crappy so I attempted to reinstall and the phone stayed on the apple screen (the progress bar stopped at 13%) and didn’t move for 5 hours. So I attempted an iTunes factory reset and the download timed out at 80% after 3 hours. Then my iPhone 6 started to get hot, so hot I burned my hand. I called Apple and the safety complaint team arranged for me to go to the Apple store in the morning to get a new iPhone 6 and new $120 protective case for free. Good job Apple development team!

I asked her what her mother language was: “I could tell you the name of it but you would not be able to understand it” just in case you are wondering if I am insane I was ready this second time and used my phone to record it.I speak english, swedish and german and tried the german version of siri a couple of times for fun. i thought this is impossible.

The guys at AppleCare have been great but honestly, no word from the Apple on this “update” which has caused so many problems! This is just really bad customer/consumer relations.

Has a gray bar where you type with 0.00 in it. Can’t get rid of it. The phone no longer works in my Prius which is even more annoying. This is a terrible upgrade.

One of the only companies that has multiple bugs on every damn product they release. If my company didn’t use these I would throw mine out the window. Really have no idea why everyone flocks to these horrible phones – I guess just another example of our highly suggestible world. 10/05/2015 James Reply About 50% of the time that I pick up the phone in a locked state and then push the home button to turn the screen on , Siri will come up on the screen instead of my usual pin code pad. It’s really annoying. Maybe it thinks I’m pressing home twice or if it has some sort of motion gesture from me picking it up a certain way? Also the phone is incredibly laggy and slow now. It’s a 4S 8gv. Hopefully another update will solve this as the first iOS 8 was laggy but one of the updates managed to make it more fluid again. As for Siri I may just doable it for now as I rarely use it. 10/06/2015 Gary Reply I can’t hear the other person when receiving a call on my sprint iPhone 4s since 9 update. 10/06/2015 Sergio Reply OMG Tina you are the best 10/06/2015 Tapan Patel Reply Recently my iPhone 6 is showing different magic tricks…. even if sitting 5 feet from the router it shows only one bar for wifi in the phone and as soon as i move away it transfers itself to cellular data. Also, during the call even with full network, the voice cracks a lot which eventually leads to call drop. I am Frustrated about these issues. I tried all the fixes: 1) Restart the phone 2) Hard Restarting the phone 3) Reset Network Settings 4) Reset all settings… After all this it would work fine for say 15 mins. max and then again the Problems immense.

I sounds reminiscent of malware (virus/hack). If ever someone needed to wipe a phone and do a restore from backup it’s you. If no backup then a complete reset to factory settings and start from scratch. 10/09/2015 Johnnie Reply I’m totally pissed!!!

It’s constantly skipping, fastforwarding, not making sound, pausing, playing, and scratchy. Plus, on top of that Siri keeps popping up even though I haven’t did anything to bring her up. 10/10/2015 Rebecca Reply This update literally eats emails in my folders.

It obscures the message I’m typing so I can’t see what I just did. How do you get rid of this? It’s really irritating. 10/20/2015 Susan Reply I got the same thing and once I did a shutdown and startup, it cleared. Hopefully you found the same fix. I also have a problem where when I mute my phone, or use the Air Drop feature, that my phone no longer ringers when I get an incoming text or phone call. All other sound featuers work except that. So of course, I have to turn off my phone and turn it back on everyday, since I mute my phone at work. Ugh…I will no longer push new software until 1 month later and hopefully the bugs will be fixed by then. 10/14/2015 Jayabee Reply Since the 9.0.2 update my iPad is slow, sticks, shuts down the Internet or just cant access sites and says I have to use safari for Internet. I used to think Apple was the best but i am so frustrated. Tried going onto customer support but couldn’t get support, said I wasn’t eligible. It’s their fault it was all fine before the last update.

Apple expects me to reboot the phone every time it gets like this? I sure hope there is a REAL fix coming for this. This might be the thing that moves me from Apple to an Android.

They had previously backed up their phone to iCloud so when we restored it everything was back!! We were referred to http://discussions.apple.com/thread/5607763?tstart=0 Basically…. Connect to iTunes through a computer. It asked to connect to the phone and do something on the phone which of course we couldn’t do cos everything was locked up! So we held the power button down and kept holding even when we saw slide for off. We didn’t slide, we then held the home button down at the same time. iTunes symbol and cord symbol came up on screen so we let go. On the computer it asked a few prompts, followed the prompts and clicked restore, then restore and update. Took a while but we saw that the computer was downloading 9.1 and then the phone started going through the restore. ALL GOOD FOR NOW!! 10/29/2015 plazagirl Reply Not able to search contacts by keywords anymore. For example, if I am looking for “plumber” that I put as generic name in company so I can keep a list of all of them, It will not search them and the screen remains “No Results” This stinks because now I have to scroll thru all the contacts to remember them. Try typing “mom” in your contact search, you know you have her in your phone. She is not found. Any thoughts? Hope someone from Apple sees this. 10/29/2015 Derrick Reply Apple, you have truly lost your way…. Things worked very well in 8.2, but you come out with 9. Did you start over with the code? From SCRATCH!? ios9.2 is a POS. I have seen SOOOOOOO many defects in this version on iPad Air and iPhone 5S. App issues. Wifi. Hotspot. Mail. Battery life. etc, etc, etc. Apple has lost its passion for innovation. It is now a follower, TRYING to copy Samsung, but failing miserably (or perhaps successfully, by having a race to the bottom). The dev team at Apple iOS should ALL be fired, or at least severely reprimanded and have their luxury perks taken from them UNTIL THESE DEFECTS ARE FIXED!!! If Steve Jobs was alive, this BS in poor iOS and software would NEVER EVER have left the dev rooms at Apple!!! There was a reason Jobs was a hard a$$—because he gave a good GD about making sure things were RIGHT before they left to the public. Now, Apple is just like any other tech company—push the garbage out and fix it later, somehow, if possible. 10/30/2015 C Payne Reply I am having a problem with the 9.1 download that my iPad Air every time I turn it on it keeps asking me for my Apple ID Password.

I’m having issues enough without installing more with 9.1! Text messaging is the worst for me. I get some text messages on my ipad but not on my phone. Then, the message box greys out with a 0.0 in the corner. I cannot get rid of this. I cannot see what I am texting to people and the only way it seems to fix is if I switch off my phone and then back on. What a pain! 11/03/2015 Mike Reply Rest assured 9.1 has its share of problems, things getting very slow, increased crashes as well. Tried some of the fixes above, more band aids, IMHO adds to sluggishness. It might be time to step away from the bad apple. 11/03/2015 Jovan Reply hi there! please help me. Everytime I turned on my cp, after a few seconds it will turn off, then suddenly it will turn on again , then it will turn off again… 11/04/2015 Greg Rose Reply I don’t have time to waste nor interest in devoting a lot of energy to Apples screw up. They need to issue a recall and have everyone turn in the phones they messed up with this update for new, free replacements. My phone used to work. Now it’s crap and I’m supposed to stop my life and TRY to fix their screw up? It’s the same as if they sent all their millions of users a virus and now they turn their backs on us and expect us to search online for solutions. WOuld Steve Jobs have allowed this? 11/04/2015 P Reply What gets me is that they admit to having problems, even before the new up date “iOS 9 betas wiped out a ton of potential bugs” They already had a ton of bugs before they sent out iOS 9, and now after fixing a ton of bugs they already had!!! They just make it worse and worse and worse. Thank heavens I had not bought a apple computer, and now never will. 11/04/2015 Russ Stanton Reply The only real complaint I’m having with my iPad it that a screen will pop up from the bottom causing everything to stop until I close the window. Very aggravating to me. Russ 11/04/2015 Greg Rose Reply Has anyone considered that this 9.1 mess is an intentional virus planted by Apple to boost their sales? Millions of loyal users will just trash their iphones and go just buy a new iphone? Brilliant scheme. They won’t help us. They just raise their hands and say they don’t know what to do. “Good luck, search the Apple blog for answers or buy a new iphone.” 11/04/2015 P Reply Must admit when I saw the new iPhone being released, the thought did cross my mind. 11/06/2015 Greg Rose Reply I think it’s a planned attack by Apple. I have all of the problems described as bugs in this blog and it would take me a devoted couple of 8 hour days to “try” to resolve them. It’ really as if I have a vicious virus. I need a complete new install but it can’t be done and techs tell me I can not step back now. So that is that? Apple is well aware there are millions of us with the same problem. Are they announcing apologies and offerings of a mass replacement or help in some. Not that I see. Please correct me if I am wrong but from my attempts with techs and online they are not addressing the problem from the head office. They seem to enjoy watching all their users squirm. I think it was a planned attack to boost their sales. There is no way I can hope to make this a functioning device again. If I am nuts please tell me. 11/06/2015 Cheryl C. Reply I have a brand new iPhone 6 with iOS 9.1 on it. Now, the darned thing acts possessed. Yesterday, it was randomly going through apps, contacts, scrolling through screens, and doing all sorts of weird things. It would overreact if I tried to click on something. Went into App Store to see if there was an anti-virus app available, and the thing started selecting all sorts of apps, going into their descriptions, trying to download, etc. Facebook was going nuts. My phone was seriously acting like six people were all trying to use it at the same time. Nothing would stop this behavior until I turned it off. First shut down and power up (after waiting just a few minutes) did nothing. Second power down — left phone off for a couple hours — and the phone appears to be back to normal. I don’t know if there’s a virus, spy software, or if I have been hacked. Scary! And, when I tried to post a question in the Apple Community for Support, I was “not allowed.” No explanation of why. Tried changing topic, question, comments, etc. Nothing would get my post through. And, Apple’s so-called “sandbox” idea is not fool-proof, either. Apple has proven that they can be hacked, so why are they taking away anti-virus apps by known manufacturers? I don’t get it. This is frustrating. And, even more so that I cannot rollback to 9.0.2. Although it too had issues, none were quite as scary as what my phone did yesterday. I’m doing a backup into the Cloud right now, just in case I need to reset this bad boy! 11/06/2015 Mike Reply Press the seller Apple is excepting returns, not the answer I wanted, but I need a good phone, this was not it. 11/06/2015 The Ouran Potato Reply I always put my iPhone 5 to charge at night, and it was fine. But three days ago (after updating to iOS 9),when I woke up, my phone wouldn’t turn on! I tried unplugging and plugging it in, but it still wouldn’t work. It finally turned on, but yesterday morning, it wouldn’t turn on! This morning, I plugged it in and I heard the noise it makes when you plug in an iPhone. When I came back to it later, I touched the bottom left corner of the screen and it turned on the flashlight. I could turn it on and off (the flashlight), but the screen was completely black. I know the iPhone was on. Has this happened to anyone else? 11/07/2015 Greg Rose Reply Reading all of these unending list of symptoms tells me that Apple just isn’t listening and really doesn’t give a hoot. Where is the big official apology? Where is the announcement to help their millions of users they pushed this inferior update on that is messing with everyone’s head? Why must we devote any energy at all to fixing this virus they pushed on us? 11/07/2015 Dave Reply My clock time slows down, when I change to correct time 5 mins later it will be an hour behind? 11/07/2015 Leo Bohler Reply I 11/08/2015 andymaturi0298 Reply after updating to freaking iOS 9.1.1 my iphone 5 started acting crazy. ATM, its been charging for 2 days straight and the battery is still at 3%. Then i thought it might be the battery percentage not working properly. So i did a hard reset (with the home button and power button ) after that it showed me the correct battery 100%. then after like 4 days it started acting up again so i tried the hard reset again and ever since then my phone has been dying continuously if i unplug it from the charger. I don’t even know why. if i pull the charger out, it dies. Then it switches on and dies again after exactly a minute of it being on. then switches off again, and turns on. Finally it stays on but only if it is charging. ARGHHH!!! THE 11/08/2015 andymaturi0298 Reply WORST UPDATE EVER! I WANT TO GO Back to iOS 8. My phone was smooth, fast and didn’t act up on it.

Without doing a complete reset… Thank you… 11/10/2015 Thomas Lee Reply Dump apple, upgrade to IOS 9 and forced me to try to restore to factory defaults. Then the restore failed with error message 9, called apple, support person said he has seen this happen on multiple versions of Iphones that upgraded. Said to go to store and that was a second disaster, they denied any correlation to IOS 9 and said that will be $300 to fix an Iphone 5s 16G. Show them the multiple links to this problem online and they read a scripted bull response. They are making extreme amounts of money and they won’t stand behind there work. 20 months ago bought 4 iphone 5s phones and battery was draining in 2 hours according to there built in app in IOS. Phone under warranty and took 3 trips to the apple store and raised a big stink before they replace. This time they said they are very proactive in admitting, resolving and communicated their mistakes. I had 4 phones in the lot that ATT said there was a known battery issue. We were NOT contacted. One phone was replace after 3 visits and I forked out the cost of replacing the battery on the other 3 because my time is more valuable then fighting with apple. I have 17 active apple products in my home. It is coming up on time to upgrade laptops, network, backup and other media products. Apple is out!! They got the last penny out of me. The whole point of a pure apple system is there support and inseparability. I hold a masters degree in electrical engineering and work as a principle engineer designing the RF LTE chips that allow the phone to talk to the towers wirelessly.

It makes calls, facetimes, opens apps and maps, texts all on it’s own and the battery dies out frequently at about 30%. I have to close the screen to lock it and make it stop and many times I even have to reboot. It used to work fine for weeks at a time, but now it acts up every single day. Sometimes a have to smack it around a little on the back and it works fine for a while after that. There is no way I’m updating to the latest iOS or upgrading to a 5 or 6 with all the problems i’m hearing about. At least I know how to deal with it and it has not given me problems on outgoing or incoming calls I make and receive. I back it up frequently just in case it decides to die out on me one day after one of my smacking episodes. Any suggestions, feel free to comment. Thank you 12/11/2015 MC Reply Yes, these problems are very frustrating. I contacted an apple agent online and his response was that we are “to expect our phones and iPads to slow down with updates”. Really? We aresuppised to expect our expensive equipment to slow down? – to stop working right? Can someone please explain to me what the benefit of the updates are for then? This is what we are to expect from apple from now on? Wow… Way to go apple. What is the purpose of buying their products? These 9+ updates have made my iPad so slow that it’s not worth using it anymore. But, I’m supposed to expect it to slow down and work right because of their updates? Really, well, we’ll see if I ever buy another apple product. I already went back to Samsung for the phone. I guess a Samsung tablet will be next. -Steve, we miss you man. I am not bashing the company, it’s just that none of this makes sense! They have made our equipment slow and almost useless. Cannot believe apple has done this and they don’t really seem to think it’s a problem. I have not heard of any plans from them on fixing this. They want us to update so that our expensive equipment becomes worthless and non-functional. Where is this good for us??? Bad way to treat your loyal customers, apple! -Bad business, bad business. They have to fix this problem. 03/17/2016 M Ivanov Reply Listen, all those lines of code are initially meant to do a certain job… So updates are meant to fix new issues, or solve existing ones… Supposedly you’d want to first fix an existing issue, some other critical issue. Yet, the more lines of code that are added, the slower your device becomes. Thus, if you can deal with the initially buggy app, you need to understand it is lighter than what follows, (before they do a redesign.) Yet, the issue is that there is a good chance better hardware is added. My device is the iPad Air 2, One of the issues is that it checks if there is any contact with the screen, if there isn’t then it sort of sleeps the screen… Hence my Wacom Blue-Tooth Stylus works worse than with the Original iPad Air. However, that sleeping of the screen means only 20% of the battery is used, in comparison to the original’s 50%, for the same time frame. 12/15/2015 Wyc Reply After upgrading to the IOS 9.2.the rear camera for the Iphone 5s stopped working completely.You only get a black screen on accessing the app.and the flash dispays a message that the phone needs to cool down 12/15/2015 mumonthefarm Reply Since the last update I can no longer get or send iMessages over cellular data. I’ve tried all the apple suggested fixes and nothing works. Can only get messages on wifi or via text, and once a contact has communicated by text all the iMessage to them can’t even be sent by wifi, just sms. 12/17/2015 gusbustar Reply I rely on my phone and I shouldn’t as since the update no one can call me and I am not getting voicemail messages, I do receive text messages although I can’t message anyone back unless I am at home as that’s the only place my wifi works now. Very frustrated as not a cheap phone. Currently I could buy a $8 (aus) at target that would offer far superior functionality to what this $1229 retarded ois hot rock. Maybe it’s transforming into an iron. Nearly as disappointing as the Sony Z3 Compact I had previously that cooked itself and cracked its own screen. Oh well maybe I should go for a simpler phone as the more they can do the more they are likely too have problems. Hold on a second!!! I can ring people but they can’t ring me, that’s a good thing. That’s brilliant and I hate text messaging, again brilliant. This is not frustrating it sheer brilliance. Apple you are saving me time with texting and giving me total control of who I talk to. And I am not the bad guy cause I didn’t know they were trying to contact me, unless they text in which case I can’t text back and they would never guess that I could still call. These conditions are perfect for me as I have a beautiful wife who is incredibly bossy and I often have to do my bosses job as she doesn’t answer her phone when the office need her. No more listening to the problems of friends that see the glass as half empty. All the time this will save me I will spend with my son. Awesome. thanyou apple 12/20/2015 Robert Gregg Reply well seems ios 9.2 is full of challengers – upgraded to 9.2 and ever since could not find any new photos I took – they just disappeared – after search for a solution I decided to dump the phones memory (home and power button for 5 seconds) – then rebooted the phone – whamo all the lost photos appeared – everything else seems to be working fine – so if you are having similar problems give it a try. 12/28/2015 J.r. Jabl Reply All about iPhones — try iPads. Since the update my iPad has become useless. There are NO fixes. …. I complained. Apple not only threw me off their customer “support” blog – they threatened me if I continued to complain. There were many, many people with the same problems. Some were advised to visit the Apple stores in their area and when they did, they were told there was no fix and they would need to buy the new iPad. Nice marketing scam Tim Cook —– this is the begin of another fall for Apple. This time there is no Steve Jobs to step back in and make it a truly creative company again. Their “support” non-existent.

I’m a geezer having retired recently. We bought our first Gateway in early 1995 except my Wife has been using them back to the 286 years. I’m not a Luddite, I’ve found corrupted files, old files fixed, removed virus’ and other things but I have NEVER BEEN INTERESTED IN THE TECH WORLD. I’m a user of what passes for high tech delivered to the public. I’ll just tell a story I heard given by a man in his 80’s while driving in the Bay Area. This man has been involved with computers since WW2. I don’t remember his name, this was around 2000 I think. He basically lambasted the tech industry for being half baked, greedy, unprofessional and delusional (the dot com “this is a new world! The old business rules don’t apply anymore! Except they did making Silicon Valley look like fools). So obviously this man could do anything with hardware and software but, as with me, he looked at the all this stuff and compared in to earlier time when new tech. wasn’t released with update after update, crap like ios9.2 and a bunch of endless hardware problems. He was saying how the root cause of this was the tech people who work in the industry assume we share the hysterical braying about new products that barely work with them, it’s just so exciting if your a geek. But we DO NOT SHARE YOUR EXCITMENT with this stuff, form follows function, remember that? IT STILL APPLYS. To get back to our gentlemen he said “I have a really nice car, it’s a Buick and it’s a technological marvel. But when I go to the store to get milk do I care about the latest fuel injectors it has, how the new performance gas saving transmission works? I DO NOT! I just want to get into my car, go to the store and back, turn it off knowing that for a number of years it will start the first time and the technology will work”. Now think of the release of so much buck that comes out of Silicon Valley. Endless updates, incompatibility, it’s endless. If this were 1972 this industry, especially software, would be the laughing stock of Wall St. and the business world. So know this Geeks; we do not share your interest in tinkering, and we find many of your products rather absurd. So here we have a new system for our iPhones. I forgot my rule of never updating to latest shabby operating system and as a result instead on saving me time (remember that quaint idea geeks?) I have to spend a few hours probably fixing my piece of crap 5s iPhone. I’d rather be hiking or visiting my kids anything but working on some tech problem that I have no interest in, remember I’m a user of technology, for the 200th time. Learn to paint or read a book techies, it’s a big wide interesting world out there just waiting for you to come up, show your pasty face to the sun and learn many fun things AWAY from computers and half baked software. 01/14/2016 J.r. Jabl Reply Great story, excellent moral. Too bad Apple isn’t listening. Having worked in the software industry for 20 years, and many years of computer experience before —- I don’t want to spend my time having to correct the problems that bad developers created – perhaps as a new SV marketing technique to force a new purchase. Apple tossed me off their “support blog” after I complained about iOS 9.2 destroying the functionality of my iPad. They are doing nothing to support or fix the problems they created. One person, advised to go to the Apple store, was told by staff that he needed to purchase a new iPhone. Not a unique event from what I am hearing. Progress in the SV is no longer significant, it’s adding gimmicks, gadgets and shiny new objects to the mix for the morons who have to have the latest. No positive advances in operating systems, no speed gains such as those experienced in the last decade. More ways for software companies and hardware companies to increase their income — and tied to that is a greater and greater loss of privacy as these people have realized the massive income potential from collecting personal data – what you do, when you do it, how often, how you do it, where you are and much more. This is shared with “partners and affiliates” who combine it with other information they get to create a “profile.” The profile is not just used by advertisers, but by banks, credit card companies, insurance companies and others that flag changes in activity that can impact your credit, borrowing power, insurance availability and premiums and much more. But back to Apple. In closing, it is clear that Apple is not Steve Job’s Apple any more. Innovation is gone (d Dick Tracy watch????) Support is gone. Quality and dependability of the OS gone. A slippery slope for Apple. Sell your stock while it still has value. Steve is not coming back this time. 01/14/2016 mumonthefarm Reply Rob, I love this so much! Reading it has made my morning. It’s so very true. Thank you :) 01/16/2016 Seth Reply I updated to ios 9.2 on my Iphone 5c. Immediately I started having problems. The screen didn’t want to respond, it kept making me sign into Itunes, but wouldn’t accept my information (it just kept popping up again and again saying “sign into Itunes,” and wouldn’t let me navigate at all. I had to power down to get away from that). It won’t let me get into ITunes and App Store in settings. My music app opens, but all I can see is a blank screen (with the exception of the words my music and playlists on the bottom of the screen). Ios 9.2 does look and feel wonderful in all other ways, but I would highly suggest waiting to update until Apple comes out with a fix for the problems I have mentioned. The great, just doesn’t outweigh the major inconvenience. 01/17/2016 William Burke Reply My problem started when I updated to iOS 9.2. When using apps wholly unrelated to the calendar, such as playing a guitar or other musical app, the calendar pops onto the screen from the right side and intrudes into the play surface of the app. I have to interrupt what I’m doing (hopefully not onstage) and put the calendar away. I have not been able to find a fix for this because search engines cannot understand concepts, just words and simple phrases. There should be online sites regarding how to bypass the inherent “stupidity” of search engines. I can hardly ever find an answer to the question I’m actually asking, just answers to ones I didn’t ask and have no earthly reason to ask! 01/18/2016 Susanjshaw Reply 0=16my co-worker’s sister makes $74 /hour on the laptop .

I updated my phone last night to IOS 9.2.1, and this afternoon I found out I only had 80 pictures left. So I pressed home button and on off button. Then I had like 660 photos, but still not all. After a while I had 770 or so, which still weren’t all. So I was just waiting for the rest to “show up” but that didn’t happen. Does anyone know what to do? 01/21/2016 Blake Reply Try this program. I own several repair stores (iFix Galaxy) and I use it often for data recovery and getting iPhones out of Boot Loops or Error Codes. It doesnt work for all errors but I got and Error 4005 while trying to do a restore on a customers phone and this fixed it. It didnt correct the original issue (Bluetooth/Wifi Greyed out) but it did get the phone booting normally. http://www.wondershare.net/data-recovery-mac/mac-iphone-data-recovery.html 01/22/2016 BRITT Reply OK SOMEONE HELP ME PLEASE! I ran the most recent IOS Update 9.2 on my IPhone 6Plus this morning, and when it was finished, I went in to change my password. After I changed it, it’s not allowing me to log onto my phone now. I contacted Verizon and they contacted Apple. Apple told Verizon that there have been some issues with the most recent update and more than likely, my new password to unlock my phone is non-existent. I am at work, bored as hell and locked out of my phone :( It won’t even accept my thumbprint. They said that the only way to do it is to download iTunes, but seeing that I work in the medical field, we have tight security on our computer network. 01/22/2016 Janna Reply My daughter has an iPhone 4. She did an update on it Wednesday evening. Since then, she cannot open and view snap chat videos and things like that. The biggest problem though is that it will not make or receive phone calls. She called me this morning, my phone rang but she said she could not tell through her phone that it started ringing. I then tried calling her back, she heard it ring, but could not hear me through it. What can be done to correct the problem without having to get a new phone? 01/22/2016 mackabieviper42 Reply Only problem with these articles they don’t tell you how too fix people problems on their iPhones 4 5 & 6 they just tell you what iOS not to put on your phones these people that write these articles need get hold the Apple Company tell them what problems people are really having with their phones or maybe these people just st like write articles just for the hell of it and they probably don’t even use iPhone at all 01/25/2016 Kayleigh Lowrie Reply IPhone 6s plus. What a piece of crap. Sold and went back to Samsung. Best thing I’ve ever done. No issues with functionality whatsoever. Everything is better. 01/25/2016 iReason Reply Just updated to the most recent iOS 9 ….. fixes nothing. iPad 2 has become useless. Apple’s new marketing to force purchase of a new tablet since their sales are faltering. Won’t work. I use it only for nonsense. Next tablet won’t be from Apple. iPad Pro is a joke. Increase screen size to make it less easy to handle. Add some nonsense that few will use, including the new (i lost it already) “pen.” Has no more power or ability to handle real software just simple apps and sever based stuff – the latter because Apple has found a major new income stream in “sharing” their monitoring of anything and everything you do with people who profile and monitor your activities including your banks, insurance companies and others. Read their entire privacy statement – the don’t sell, they “share” data with affiliates and partners……….. 01/29/2016 Johnny A Brewer Reply I’m having the issue with my Touch ID (home button) not working. It happen immediately after it restarted from being upgraded to 9.2. I read the comment above stating to hold the power & home buttons for 10 seconds to reset the phone. I’m pretty sure that the home button wouldn’t work for that either if the home button is not working at all. 01/29/2016 James Reply Several months ago, I spoke with business that fixes iphones. They said, ” Do NOT upgrade to the latest OS because it’s actually breaking peoples phones.” I didn’t take it too seriously, because I thought – how could software break the hardware??? So I didn’t upgrade at that point because their comments made me nervous. So the 9.2.1 came out recently and I figured – Oh well, Things must be worked out with this upgrade… So I upgraded. Big mistake. So far, my front camera doesn’t work. Neither does my flashlight. Due to my line of work, I use these things every single day. The Apple tech at the hot line ( of course) said he has never heard of such a thing. -Even though it took me all of 2 minutes on Google for me to find dozens of people with the same issues and more. His comment was, Well, everyone online has a problem.” Like we’re all one big pain in the ass. He told me to reset back to the factory settings. Which I did. and if that doesn’t work, then I need a hardware repair ( he said) at my expense. And told me it’s my phone and there are really no problems with the latest update. I’ve been buying apple product religiously for 21 years. Every device I have is Apple. To call them for help in an effort to solve a problem on their product, caused by their software, and be treated like i’m the only one – so clearly I’m making it up- is absolutely outrageous.This post is merely a short version of the time I’ve spent on dealing with this problem. And obviously I am NOT the “only one” with this issue. If there is a class action lawsuit, count me in. And If I have to buy a new phone, it won’t be Apple. And I will spent hours posting this everywhere I can possibly post. Thanks Apple for rewarding loyalty with a kick in the teeth. 01/29/2016 M Reply These problems are exactly why I no longer own an iPhone. And the problems also exist with the iPads. And apple wonders why their sales are going down? Who would want to buy a device that will be useless? Their updates have ruined just about every device no matter how new they are. They really should be held responsible for this. Thus us not just a few people having problems; just about everyone that owns one has problems BIG PROBLEMS with their Very Expensive Devices and apple refuses to acknowledge that they created and caused them. I say, just stop buying their products. That may make them see we are serious! Bad products = No Sales! The rep I cjphatted with online told me “these problems are to be expected”. Really? Well expect this apple… I will not buy another rotten apple device. I already switched phone to Samsung and live it. Tablet will follow… Note: I intentionally no longer capitalize the “a” in apple. -They don’t deserve it! 01/31/2016 iReason Reply What people need to do is begin filing complaints with the FTC. This does bring action and if enough are filed the action against apple will be swift. This information will also be picked up by those nasty lawyers who set up Class Action Suits. This is not the first time apple has done something like this, but with action we can make it the last.

Battery is draining for no reason, the phone is crazy slow, and my camera now only takes Blurry Photos no matter what I do! Apple clearly does not give a damn about dumping these updates onto older phones, and just hoping it drives people to buy a new iPhone. Well that will backfire when people decide to tell Apple to go $%#& themselves, and switch to a competitor!

Look Into Your Apps If you’re noticing strange battery drain on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, the first thing you’ll want to do is take a long hard look at your applications, especially if you’re playing Pokemon Go. Advertisement It’s easy to blame Apple for your problems but there’s a good chance that it’s a third-party application hogging your resources. To start digging into your app performance, you’ll want to go into Settings > Battery and get familiar with the Battery Usage tool and the changes that Apple’s made in iOS 9. The tool will show you which apps are eating up the most battery but it will now show you when they’re eating up the most battery. It will also show you what apps have been using the most power over a 24 hour span and what’s been eating your phone or tablets battery life over a longer span of time. If you tap on the little clock there, you’ll also be able to pull up a breakdown that shows you exactly when they’re eating up the most battery. Some apps will drain battery the most when the screen is on and some might zap your power when the screen is off. If you see something odd, you’ll want to first try updating the application (assuming it has good reviews). Developers have been rolling out iOS 9 support updates in recent days and there’s a good chance your apps have updates. If that doesn’t help, try reinstalling it or uninstalling it completely to see if your overall iPhone or iPad battery life improves some. Uninstall Facebook Facebook’s app is under fire again for causing battery life troubles on the iPhone. A recent piece from The Guardian suggests that the app is still chewing up a substantial amount of battery life. The author claims that, on average, he has 15% more battery life each day without Facebook installed. If you have the Facebook app on your phone, it might be worth an uninstall (permanent or temporary is up to you) to see if it has a positive effect on your iPhone’s charge. Pokemon Go If you’re playing Pokemon Go on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch for long periods of time, there’s a good chance it’s draining your battery. Pokemon Go relies on GPS to track your movement. GPS kills battery life. Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to combat Pokemon Go battery drain on iOS 9: Lower your screen brightness. Use an external battery pack. Kill Bluetooth and Wi-Fi while you’re roaming around playing the game. Disable volume. For more on Pokemon Go problems and fixes, take a look at our rundown. Start Using Low Power Mode iOS 9 comes with a brand new feature that will help you conserve iPhone battery life when you need it most. The new Low Power Mode in iOS 9 allows users to stretch out the last 10-20% of battery life significantly longer without flipping a bunch of switches manually. Simply go to Settings > Battery > Low Power Mode > On and the iPhone will limit many items you used to need to control manually. This can add several hours of actual use to your iPhone. With iOS 9.3.5 on board, you’ll be able to use Low Power Mode with iOS 9.3’s Night Shift feature. Turn On Airplane Mode If you’re noticing battery drain, it might be because you’re in an area with spotty cellular service. If you are, your device will work extra hard to try and find a signal and that could cause your battery life to start draining rapidly. To combat this, flip your device into Low Power Mode or Airplane Mode. Airplane Mode can be found at the top of Settings and it will kill all of your connections. If you’ve flown any time in the past five years, you’ve probably used it. With Airplane Mode turned on, your phone won’t be searching for a better signal or any nearby connections. Just make sure to flip it off when you’re back in an area with better service. Disable iCloud Keychain This is a potential fix that’s been passed down over the years and there’s a chance it might work for you after installing iOS 9. Try disabling iCloud Keychain if you don’t use it. iPhone and iPad users have reported a bump to battery life after turning it off and there’s a chance you could see some improvements. To disable iCloud Keychain on your device, you’ll need to go into Settings > iCloud > Keychain > Toggle iCloud Keychain off. You can always flip the feature back on if you determine that there’s no connection between it and the battery drain on your device. Limit Background App Refresh If you don’t need your apps to automatically refresh in the background, you might want to try disabling the Background App Refresh feature that comes standard with iOS. Background app refresh is handy is you want your applications to show the latest data whenever you open them but in our experience its proven to be a resource hog. If you have it on, apps will work in the background and that can be a catalyst for bad battery life. Go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh > Turn it off for each app that is using too much power. It’s a tedious process but it could help. You can also turn the feature off completely if you don’t want to go through your list of applications one by one. Manage Your Display Get a handle on your display. Apple’s iPhone, iPad and iPod touch use an array of sensors and one of those sensors adjusts the screen automatically in certain lighting environments. Sometimes the sensor works to perfection. Sometimes it doesn’t. If you’re noticing strange iOS 9 battery drain, try shutting auto brightness off. To make this happen, go into Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Brightness > Off. Once it’s shut off, you’ll have to adjust the screen brightness manually. iOS 9’s Control Center offers quick access to an auto brightness toggle. To pull it up, swipe up from the bottom of your screen. Restart Your iPhone or iPad You should also try restarting your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. If you don’t know how to do this, hold down the power button for a few seconds and swipe to shut the device down. Hold down the power button again to boot the device back up. If that doesn’t help, you can also try a hard reset. To do that, hold down the home button and the power button for about 10 seconds. The device will restart it self. As a reminder, this will not remove any of your data. Reset All Settings The above fixes include changes to your habits and some smaller tweaks. The fixes listed below are more drastic measures. The first step to take is a reset on all of your device’s settings. To do this, go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings and then enter your passcode when the prompt appears. The reset process could take five minutes or so and once it’s done, it will restore your settings to their factory defaults. You’ll also want to have your various Wi-Fi passwords handy. Once this process completes, your phone or tablet will have forgotten those passwords. Take Your Device In If nothing here works, it’s time to take your iPhone or iPad into an Apple Store to have a Genius run some diagnostics. You could have a bloated battery, you could have something else. If your device is still under warranty, they might even offer you a replacement. Talk to Apple Support Online If none of these fixes work and you don’t want to move from your desk chair, you can ask Apple for help online. If you’re struggling with iOS 9 battery life, try reaching out to Apple’s Twitter support line for assistance. It’s possible that they will have a fix or two that fall outside of this list. Download iOS 10 If nothing is working, you might try upgrading to the iOS 10 update if your device is eligible. iOS 10 users are also complaining about battery drain issues but there’s a chance it could improve your device’s performance. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.2.1 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.2.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.2.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.2 update brings 13 known patches for potential exploits. That's one more than its predecessor (iOS 10.2). These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2 update and/or the iOS 10.1.1 update, know that iOS 10.2.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2 update had 12 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.2.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.2.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 10 72 Responses 09/17/2015 Adrianhfrierson Reply 0=0011my buddy’s sister-in-law makes $63 an hour on the laptop .

When I checked the battery usage screen it says the home & lock screen used 88%. Anyone else experience this? My iPad Air was also updated yesterday and it is still sitting at 100% overnight I tried restoring my phone to the last backup, hopefully to go back to 9.0 but to only option was to go back to the last 9.01 backup, the restore went back to 9.01. Is there a way to go back from 9.01 to 9.00? iPhone 6, iOS 9 09/25/2015 Jack Reply I did a clean install of iOS9 and am having similar problem. My iMessage says it uses 75% in last 24 hrs of barely using it. Next closet app used 5% ..crazy 09/26/2015 Steven A. Schwaber Reply Ok, so let me see if I understand this correctly. Some jerk’s ego at Apple wanted to “upgrade” iOS and seemingly doesn’t give a d@mn about how it affects the user (my typical battery life the day before the upgrade was 3+/- days; the same day as I upgraded my 4s, battery life is a maximum 4-5 hours total, and that is with the phone just standing by without being used at all; when I say this, I specifically mean 99% battery to literally <1%). So because of this, the ONLY fix is to change entirely the way I use my phone. In other words, I have to change rather Apple providing what the customer needs. This sounds a bit like the old days in Detroit, where GM's famous comment was "Give them any color they want, as long as it's black." Apple made its bones providing a simple, seamless computing experience for its users, especially compared to Windows; I'll bet Bill Gates goes to bed each night chuckling to himself and thanking his god for the stupidity of his competitors.

Basically every iphone is good for only 3 years. Not 3 years from the day you buy it but 3 years from the day it first went on sale :( 06/23/2016 stoned again Reply Sheela Vapestein you are Muy caliente and so true in your answer……caliente 10/03/2015 Dan Reply iOS 9.0.2 Battery life fix #iOS9batterylife I found an iPhone battery eater problem. I have background app refresh off which should lengthen battery life as per many websites. I also looked in to my apps by Settings–>Battery and looking what apps were using the most battery life and Facebook by far is the highest. If you click the little clock symbol I saw Facebook as running in the background way more hours than using it, hmmm. So I went to Settings–>Facebook and u see a background app refresh setting that’s greyed out and locked on if you already have background app refresh turned off in general settings. No wonder my battery is being eaten up. So what you need to do is go to Settings–>general–>background app refresh and turn in back on. Then go to Settings–>Facebook and turn background app refresh off. Then back to Settings–>general–>background app refresh and turn in back off. I figured this out by accident. This was not on any web tutorial like http://www.gottabemobile.com/2015/09/24/how-to-fix-bad-ios-9-battery-life-2/ 10/08/2015 Scr-U-gle Reply I went to a Genius Bar and got the solution, it is third party apps. This works on all iPhone and all updates (caution, do not avoid updates, they are crucial to security and keeping your data and device safe. 1. Take a screen grab of all your apps. 2. Back up all your data, but DO NOT back up the apps (if like me you already have backed up the apps, just create a new client and make a fresh backup.). 3. Factory reset the device, reinstall iOS, update to latest version then reinstate your backed up data. 4.go to the App Store and manually down load your Apps (you can use your previously purchased list to expedite the process). WHY? Third Party Devs are often late with updates, when they do arrive, when updating the app they can leave dross from the previous build behind. This can cause apps to hog resources, especially memory. Often these problem apps remain open in memory even after a restart. It’s a pain in the behind, but does solve the issue. 10/23/2015 Janiice Reply I loved my iPhone 5 c , but with it lasting only 2 years and apple wanting to charge me $275 to fix it,good bye Apple, hello Samsung 10/30/2015 Katalina J Reply I agree that APPLE is using “3-year buy a new one” strategy. I used to have a cheap $25 Motorola Go phone for 9 years and never ever had a problem. I moved to Iphone 5s to catch up with the world, found myself spending hrs fixing the upload, learning things that I never used, looking totally stupid at Apple store to let the so called Genius reboot and reset my phone. I would like to have their jobs. If we need to spent over $500 a phone every 3 years, I think I will go back to Gophone and carry a camera with me! Money is one thing, TIME is way too precious to be fooled around with. 11/19/2015 Geenah Reply This have been the worst update by far. The battery drainage is horrible. This is my 4th iPad in about 4, years. I’m glad I put insurance on them. This way I just switch it out when problems arise. This was the last time with an iPad. Time to upgrade to a Samsung tablet. This way it will match all my Samsung products. I will never again look at any Apple products. 11/22/2015 Mark Taylor Reply i0S 9 has rendered my iPad 2 almost useless despite all the recommended tweaks the Apple forum recommends. Despite all those tweaks, it’s still outperformed by a cheapo supermarket tablet. Apple certainly know how to pi$$ off their customers by almost forcing them into upgrading. Trouble is, in this case it will be to an Andriod device!. 06/23/2016 ryan (@ThatDudeRT) Reply It’s a 5 year old tablet what do you expect? Try using a 5 year old Android tablet and let me know how that works out for you. 11/24/2015 surendra rawal Reply I have tried all options but still my iphone6 battery goes to zero level within 6 hours even its was not used so anybody can help me? 11/28/2015 JWG Reply Now I have deinstalled nearly all apps that are drivers to use an iPhone and not an Android, just feeling stupid to carry around a really expensive cell for phone calls only and still bad battery.

Time for change – hello Xperia 12/17/2015 Navin Reply After resetting process it’s get to the normal 12/22/2015 Robert Reply Lets Face it. The new IOS is the problem. We can come up with all sorts of ways to turn everything off to save battery life but I am a light user and the only change I made was upgrading from IOS 8 to 9 or 9.1 My battery life dropped from 72 hrs to 8 then when I turn everything off I can get 12 hrs. It sucks big time. It’s about time Apple fess up and fix it or allow us to down grade. I started with an iphone 4 and now after all this time I am reluctantly ready to give on my iphone 6 and on up on Apple and move on. 12/22/2015 Tejasav Reply My iPhone 5 is rebooting automatically and when I make it to charge it remains same as urlier but when I reboot it it shows the charged one 12/22/2015 Vesy Reply did anyone experience an “instant drowning” for an example 18% charged battery hd a sudden shut down( <1% ) while u r using the device ? it happens every time on my Ipad 3 . 12/23/2015 Louiserchiesa Reply 0=2my best friend’s half-sister makes $87 /hr on the laptop .

Coincidentally the same length of time that most people get hardware upgrades from their carriers. I foresee a lot of backlash and an apple revolt when people start to realize this. If it wasn’t deliberate they would allow us to downgrade to 8.4.1. The good old days when I got what I paid for. Also it was Henry Ford that said you can get any colour you want as long as it’s black. 01/19/2016 Samuelvwashington Reply 0=4my best friend’s half-sister makes $87 /hr on the laptop .

Weather app…The Culprit? I’ve encountered severe battery drain on my iPhone 4s and iPad Air 2 running iOS 9.2.1 . I was suspecting the iOS update, but I noticed the location indicator showing up more than usual. In fact unusually more. After disabling numerous location services for various apps under the privacy settings -it was not until I changed location services on Yahoo! Weather from ‘Always’ to ‘While Using’ that my outrageous battery drainage stopped. I thought I should pass on the info.. 02/21/2016 Andrew Reply Same problem here with my iPad Air 2. Was working fine until a couple of weeks ago after I downloaded the 9.2.1 upgrade. My iPad mini is still on 9.2 and is working fine. My Air 2 takes right about 22 hours to fully charge after buying a new 12 amp charger. I thought there was a problem with the original 10 amp charger. It discharges while on standby and light usage in less than 10 hours. That’s not the best ratio. 02/29/2016 Scottyji Reply A very easy and quick solution: Turn your iPhone off to conserve power.

Apple advertises “up to” 10 hours on their website. Where’s the other 40% of my phone, and does iOS 9.2.1’s terrible power drain constitute false advertising? 04/05/2016 CJ Reply I was a Beta tester of iOS 9.3 and it was great in Beta, but as soon as it asked me to go to the mainstream 9.3 I went from 2+ days of battery to <12 hrs.

I know it’s upgrades but I’ll stick with my terminology thanks, it’s more appropriate. Last time I was messed about was by Sky satellite / cable. Kept putting prices up at an alarming rate. I kept telling them if they continued I’d cancel. They kept putting the prices up and I cancelled. I’ll never go back to them. Same thing is going to happen to Apple. These devices cost a lot of money and I don’t expect a marked detioration in such a short timespan, nor be expected to have to continue messing with settings to find improvements for a fault I didn’t have before downgrading. Bye Apple, hello Samsung Galaxy. I’ll never be back. 04/22/2016 Les Zapata Reply I have the same issue with a iPhone 5-64. The battery is not the problem, it’s panned obsolescence. If you don’t need a new device, Apple doesn’t make money. It’s sneaky, dirty, and effective for them and many other hardware companies. It’s why downgrading is STRONGLY discouraged. My phone worked beautifully before I fell for the iOS 9.x hype, and that’s what Apple banks on. It’s a consumer trap. 04/22/2016 scott Reply Wow, I’m going to android. I can’t believe how bad apple has become. You have to turn off and on your settings to save battery life after an update they send? In 2016? What a POS. My 6 went from slightly passable to dead by noon phone. What a joke apple. Android has had 4 updates to apple 10! I’m done. As soon as I can, goodbye Iphone….. 04/22/2016 scott Reply It is NOT 3rd party apps. I don’t have any running on my phone. I don’t think I have any! My phone is almost empty. My number 1 use is texting at 41% in the last 24 hours. My phone charged over night and it says the last time it has had a full charge was over 24 hours ago. The update is a complete wreck. Don’t let the geeks at the OS store feed you lines. I’ve been an apple fan boy for the last 10 years, ipad, apple tv and all phones. My wife and son just bought new G 7s. They are amazing. It’s like they are from another planet. I feel cheated that I have been sticking to this one legged lying company for so long. They don’t even care about us passing off screw ups as 3rd party problems and we eat it with a smile. What a joke! I’m so made at them and that I bought this for so long.

Come on Apple what has happened to you!! your were amazing and now somethings a miss!!!!! 06/09/2016 gmsutton Reply Since 9.3.2 phone shuts down as if the battery were dead. Plugging it in indicates around 60% battery left. Erasing the entire phone and restoring only critical data does nothing. The “Genius” bar acts surprised. After going thru this a couple of times, the problem got worse, with the phone chugging down around 90%. In the last 24 hours where I got only a few messages, that function has used 74% of the battery. Online diagnosis with Apple Chat indicated the batter is OK and I’m told it’s a “software problem”. I agree, it’s clearly there upgrade that has caused this, If that is’t it, then there is something corrupt about my iTunes backup, but I’m clothing at straws here, 07/07/2016 Jay Reply Well glad I am not going mad!!!! Upgraded wifes 5S to 9.3.2 and the battery life is horrible, what gives APPLE!!!!!!! Think you really need to get your act together or I feel you will seriously start to lose market share, lot of angry consumers out here about APPLE….love the phones beena user since 3GS days and in many ways wish I still had 3GS has been one of the toughest phones I have had.. Fix this power issue ASAP or we really have no choice but to be changing manafacturer of phone… I use a 6S at thius stage allis fine but I have refused to update to 9.3.2 software….. 07/09/2016 onebigbite Reply I hate saying this but I have the same problem. 60% and it dies!

The old screw the customer concept is getting old and if Apple continues to do it I will be switching to Android to by pass getting screwed even though Android is inferior they treat people with more respect. Jobs knew this about customer support and spent his life keeping the others at Apple in line, but now there is no one to step up to the plate to do this and Apple is loosing credibility because of it. 07/14/2016 Zachary Reply If anyone is looking for a great portable charger that also can be used as a compact mirror and an LED light, I just bought one for my girlfriend that she loves, you can find it at fifthandninth.com 07/29/2016 David Christensen Reply I get up and do the same thing every morning with my iPad. After this update. I check email and read some news while drink coffe every am. 2 hours. Before iPad would go from 100 to 85 to 80 % now after this update the power level is 70%. This s iPad Air 2. I have had Bluetooth on since I bought this iPad. I turned Bluetooth off. This had little to no effect. Very confusing. 08/10/2016 balapobiBala Reply Almost tried all the possibilities, my battery is getting drain fast with factory reset.. and no additional apps are installed. Sometimes getting shutdown immediate even 20% battery, when i insert charger it shows 35% battery there… 08/11/2016 Greg Reply I’ve had this problem multiple times in the life of my iPhone 6 after an IOS upgrade. The “Reset All Settings” command has been the only thing that fixed it every time. My theory is that for each major upgrade there may be settings added or a different set of recommended default settings that Apple validated with. Reset to the new OS default settings and then re-customize the ones you care about. 09/09/2016 Leigh_K Reply Doesn’t sound like anyone is finding any solutions. I can do a factory reset – and change NOTHING. Power phone off. Wait 20 minutes. Battery is down to 94%. If you do that math, that’s 6 hours of battery **when off**. My phone battery was lasting 2 days with “regular” usage until early-to-mid June when I upgraded to IOS 9.3.2. Now, it’s pretty much a brick. 09/12/2016 Kevin Reply The battery will drain if you have your wifi on period. Turn wifi off and your battery be as good or better than before. I guess this is a bug with the new 9.3.5 upgrade and sure hope it is not apple working with providers to discourage wifi and get more $ out of us from data…so hope that is not true. Not sure if any wifi fixes for this have been discussed but if anyone knows some setting please share. 09/13/2016 Tom P Reply I’ve been stuck with iPhone for years because it’s been reliable and convenient, now it’s not. Good bye Apple! If you don’t fix this soon I’m leaving you. 10/06/2016 nunyabiziness Reply None of the recommendations here worked. As all of you people find what caused your phonbe’s demise, others do not experience success by doing the things you all have done. Too many people are thinking 3rd party apps, get to know your battery usage, pokenmon. Please. Get real. Everyone is not the same with how they use their phone but one thing is for sure, if you all allow Apple or any other platform for smartphones, to track you, to push email, to monitor everything every time you use your browser, apps etc, then you’ve been burning more battery life than you realize and might just see even more increased life once you figure out that the inherent problem is iOS itself and how APPLE configures it to run. Yes, they want you to feel your phone is ready for the graveyard since nobody wants to put up another $600+ for a new phone and that is their goal. Smalrt phone sales, especially APPLE, have declined so much in the past few years and unless there is some big revival in sales, they will lose any incentive to mass produce them with huge profits in mind. The best way to promote a successful plan is to to take all older models, push an update, and hope most everyone takes it and then, suddenly, they see their phone is running so poorly that the first thing people at APPLE stores will tell them is it’s an old phone, you need a new one, it cannot handle the iOS anymore, it’s reached it’s EOL and served it’s purpose, it’s time to go, etc, etc, etc. Get real. It’s APPLE. NOTY 3rd art APPS causing the IMMEDIATE problem and 3rd party apps are also part of the problem because they all track and monitor all your actions and activities as this world is all about exploiting each and every one of us for the finanical gain of others. They get inside our heads, find out what makes us tick, then advertise us to death with items that suit that. SO wake up everyone. We are being manipulated and our minds are targets so the less we allow our phones to know about us, the better off we are. These phones need to be used carefully to protect your privacy so read up on how to take control of your phones before they take complete control of YOU! E.O.R.

Apple's Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp is setting up a plant in Bengaluru to focus solely on assembling iPhones, a separate source told Reuters earlier this month. Apple's move comes as it seeks to boost its share in the world's fastest growing major mobile market, where handsets far cheaper than Apple's iPhones dominate. It also comes as smartphone sales growth is slowing in Asia's other massive market, China. To lower prices, Apple has been seeking to set up local production and has been in talks with the Indian government regarding issues such as tax concessions. The industry source told Reuters the initial manufacturing of the iPhone SE model was not contingent on those concessions. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Economic Times newspaper earlier on Friday reported Apple planned to initially assemble 300,000 to 400,000 iPhone SE handsets in India. The industry source told Reuters the numbers would be substantially lower to begin with. The source also said it was too early to say what other phone models Apple would assemble at the Bengaluru plant. Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to India last year, with a third coming in the December quarter, according to market researcher Counterpoint, which estimates that three-quarters of smartphones sold in India were made locally. In the fourth quarter, Apple ranked 10th in India's smartphone market but led the premium segment with a 62 percent market share, Counterpoint said. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and a host of Chinese players including Xiaomi and Vivo dominate India's smartphone market where the vast majority of phones sold are priced below 15,000 rupees ($225). In comparison, the entry level iPhone SE model sells on Amazon.com's India site for 28,433 rupees ($424).

By: Abhinaya Prabhu Published: Friday, February 17, 2017, 11:45 [IST] While the entire tech world is focused on the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2017 slated to debut on February 27 at Barcelona, Apple has come up with an announcement. The company has confirmed that the WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) will happen on June 5, 2017 in San Jose. It is a four-day event slated to happen between June 5 and June 9. Usually, Apple's WWDC happens in the middle of the year. While we know that it will be an early-June affair every year, the confirmation from Apple gives us a clear date. Basically, at the WWDC, Apple will meet the developers in order to discuss its upcoming products. This year, the event is likely to be mainly focused on the firmware and software aspects, tipping that we can expect the next version of iOS to be a key aspect. The alleged iOS 11 will be rolled out sometime in September along with the latest iPhones. Still, we can see a preview or beta version of the same rolling out soon after the WWDC. We can also expect to see the launch of the iOS 11, next iteration of OS X10.13, tvOS and watch OS. Also read: Tips and Tricks to get the most out of Google Drive Notably, the registrations for the WWDC 2017 will start from March 27 at 10 AM PDT. Also, a lottery will take place as the WWDC tickets usually disappear in just a few minutes. The cost of one ticket is $1,599 (approx. Rs. 1,07,000) similar to that of the previous years.

Follow @UPROXX Member Sign Up Sign In The Best Netflix Original Shows Of All Time What To Expect, And What We Won’t See Yet, From The 4K Apple TV Dan Seitz 02.16.17 18 hours ago Facebook Twitter EMAIL Apple The Apple TV hasn’t exactly thrilled consumers over its long history. Oh, they’ve bought it, they like it, it’s just not the iPhone, or really the Roku for that matter. And Apple doesn’t seem interested in trying to change that just yet, if the new 4K Apple TV is any indication. Bloomberg has an article that more or less notes the two big new features will be higher resolution and high dynamic range, also known as HDR. HDR’s interesting because it improves the luminosity of an image, or how much light seems to be reflected, making it feel more like a natural image instead of something filmed. The really interesting part, though, is looking at all the stuff Apple managed to dodge a bullet by not doing. See if anything in this paragraph feels familiar: Early on, the Apple TV was going to replace the clunky set-top boxes from the cable companies and stream live television. It never happened. The team debated bundling a gaming controller with the current model to better compete with Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox and Sony Corp.’s PlayStation. That didn’t happen either. Originally, viewers were going to be able to shout commands from the couch to the Apple TV. Instead they must talk to the remote control. Considering the fate of the Xbox One’s shouted voice commands, Amazon’s struggle to make a notch in console gaming after its ambitious bid a few years ago, and the struggles of pretty much any service to get cord-cutters to embrace cable, it’s hard not to see Apple has having dodged several bullets. And it appears in the future, Apple is hoping to be the middleman between you and your cable provider, letting you hook up your Apple TV to your cable connection to make for a unified experience. Or, if Apple can’t pull that off, something they’ve been trying for years, then at least get involved in the skinny bundle wars, where you pay a fixed price for a handful of streaming channels.

Honestly it is more about completing the iOS environment anyway. Having it be a small box that you can use iTunes through is really what it was all about. Now granted an Apple TV service would be icing on the cake, but the little box is pretty slick. Of course the major issue is that your paying for Apple. Roku is cheaper and does almost everything the same, as well as a bit more since Apple has its issues with Amazon. So unless you wanted to be or where already in the Apple ecosystem, it doesnt really make sense to go with Apple over their competition.

Widely dubbed as iPhone 8, the models to be released in 2017 will be the company's tenth anniversary editions. In the new note, Kuo has made predictions about the smartphone's pricing and design. According to Kuo's estimate, the iPhone 8 will have a starting price of $1000 (Rs 70,000 approximately). The increase in the starting price is said to be due to the jump in production costs by up to 50-60%. The starting price is in sync with an earlier report that came this month from Fast Company. The news report too claimed the price of the smartphone to be above $1000. The increase in cost is largely said to be due to the devices coming with an OLED display. As for the design, corroborating with recent reports, Kuo says in the note that the 'iPhone 8' will ditch the Touch ID-integrated Home button. Instead, the company will use something called a 'function' area, which will include an integrated fingerprint sensor. The prediction goes in line with a patent recently granted to Apple , cementing speculations that the next iPhone may ditch its circular Touch ID sensor and have one integrated directly into the display. In the note by Kuo, shared by Apple Insider website, the iPhone 8 is mentioned as having a 5.8-inch OLED panel in a form factor similar to the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. Furthermore, it has been mentioned that the actual active display area will be around 5.15-inch (diagonal).

It was almost 10 years ago, on January 9 2007, that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs introduced the very first iPhone to the world. Jobs showcased the smartphone at an event in San Francisco, US. At the launch, Apple said that iPhone combines three products -— a revolutionary mobile phone, a widescreen iPod with touch controls, and a breakthrough internet communications device with desktop-class email, web browsing, searching and maps—into one small and lightweight handheld device. Over the years Apple smartphones have become almost a 'cult device' with a loyal fan following across the globe. The euphoria that the launch of iPhones sees in the US and some other countries year-after-year continues to be unmatched. Here are some little-known facts about one of the world's 'favourite' smartphone. ​First iPhone never launched in India Apple's very-first iPhone was never launched in India. The first-generation iPhone was first launched in the US only. In November 2007, the iPhone went on sale in UK, Germany and France. The first iPhone to launch in India was iPhone 3G in August 2008. Initially, iPhone 3G came bundled with Vodafone and Airtel network in the country. Vodafone sold smartphone at Rs 31,000 for 8GB model, and Rs 36,100 for 16GB model. There was no App Store when the iPhone launched Love Apple's App Store? However, the famed App Store was not there when the first iPhone launched in 2007. Also, App Store was the first place to legally download an app. ​Apple was sued for calling its smartphone iPhone Cisco sued Apple soon after Steve Jobs introduced the smartphone in January 2007 at MacWorld. The networking giant filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court for Northern California seeking an injunction against Apple for using the name iPhone. iPhone topped Time magazine's list of most-influential gadgets of all time In 2016, TIME Magazine released its list of the 50 most influential gadgets of all time. At the top of the list is iPhone. According to TIME, iPhone is the most influential gadget as it "fundamentally changed our relationship to computing and information." Apple has sold over 1 billion iPhones In June 2016, Apple iPhone sales hit 1-billion mark -- a figure roughly equivalent to seventh of the world's population. CEO Tim Cook announced the company achieving this milestone at an employee meeting in Cupertino. "iPhone has become one of the most important, world-changing and successful products in history. It's become more than a constant companion. iPhone is truly an essential part of our daily life and enables much of what we do throughout the day," said Cook. Retina screens are said to be the most expensive part of iPhones Retina screen is said to be the most expensive part of iPhone as per numerous teardowns. The teardown of the Apple's latest flagship iPhone, iPhone 7, by IHS too reveals it as the most-expensive component. As per BoM (bill of materials) cost estimated by IHS, it costs $43. iPhone contributes to almost 60% of the company's revenue iPhone has been one of the biggest contributors to the company's revenue since it went on sale in June 2007. In the last quarter (Q4 2016), iPhone sales contributed 60% of the company's revenue. This was followed by services, whose contribution stood at 14%. The remaining bottom portion will be used for virtual buttons. Apple may also use always-on, static system controls into iOS. Since there won't be a Touch ID in the iPhone 8, Apple might use other security features as well. One of the features is said to be facial recognition technology using 3D laser scanning.

Apple's Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp is setting up a plant in Bengaluru to focus solely on assembling iPhones, a separate source told Reuters earlier this month. Apple's move comes as it seeks to boost its share in the world's fastest growing major mobile market, where handsets far cheaper than Apple's iPhones dominate. It also comes as smartphone sales growth is slowing in Asia's other massive market, China. To lower prices, Apple has been seeking to set up local production and has been in talks with the Indian government regarding issues such as tax concessions. The industry source told Reuters the initial manufacturing of the iPhone SE model was not contingent on those concessions. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Economic Times newspaper earlier on Friday reported Apple planned to initially assemble 300,000 to 400,000 iPhone SE handsets in India. The industry source told Reuters the numbers would be substantially lower to begin with. The source also said it was too early to say what other phone models Apple would assemble at the Bengaluru plant. Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to India last year, with a third coming in the December quarter, according to market researcher Counterpoint, which estimates that three-quarters of smartphones sold in India were made locally. In the fourth quarter, Apple ranked 10th in India's smartphone market but led the premium segment with a 62 percent market share, Counterpoint said. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and a host of Chinese players including Xiaomi and Vivo dominate India's smartphone market where the vast majority of phones sold are priced below 15,000 rupees ($225). In comparison, the entry level iPhone SE model sells on Amazon.com's India site for 28,433 rupees ($424).

A few days after the news broke that Samsung was releasing the Galaxy S8 and that they had a possible deal with Apple to boot, Reuters reported on February 15 that South Korean officials were approved to arrest the vice chair of Samsung. Samsung’s Jay Y. Lee is being charged with being a part of a South Korean corruption scandal and is currently being held overnight at the Seoul Detention Center. The charges are not related to smartphones, Apple, or the Galaxy S8 launch. Instead, Jay Y. Lee is being charged as a suspect in an “influence-peddling scandal that led parliament to impeach President Park Geun-hye in December.” Just as Samsung announces the Galaxy 8 to be released in 2017, Vice Chair Jay Lee is arrested. [Image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images] The incident was significant because it is South Korea’s first impeachment. The impeachment of President Park Geun-hye is still waiting for the Constitutional Court to make a final decision. The incident with Samsung’s leader will give the South Korean government 10 days to indict, but extensions are often requested to include an additional 10 days. After the indictment, the courts in South Korea will have to rule within three calendar months. Samsung and Jay Y. Lee report that they are not involved with the crimes associated with President Park Geun-hye getting impeached. Samsung employs over 250,000 people in South Korea and have reassured the public that they will continue operations as usual while Jay Y. Lee is embroiled in the legal scandal. Samsung had time to prepare for this type of incident because the courts denied a month earlier to have Jay Y. Lee arrested. About the charges being brought against Samsung’s Jay Y. Lee, it has been claimed that in addition to giving bribes of up to $36 million to President Park Geun-hye, Lee is also being investigated for embezzlement of Samsung assets. Regardless, Samsung’s vice chair might not go to jail even if he is convicted. Samsung’s Jay Y. Lee inherited his part of the business from his father in 2014, and the elder Lee was convicted of “embezzlement, tax evasion and breach of trust but was never imprisoned.” Although Jay Lee was arrested and might be convicted, it is unlikely he will serve jail time for very long — if at all. [Image by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images] In exchange for hosting South Korea’s 2018 Winter Olympics, the former Samsung leader was pardoned for his 2008 convictions by the president. NY Times reported at the end of 2009 that the reason South Korea courts give light sentences to corrupt corporate leaders like the ones at Samsung is attributed to the assumption that “incarcerating them would disrupt the economy.” Outside of Samsung, Reuters reported in August 2016 that pardoning convicted corporate leaders is an annual tradition for the president of South Korea. For example, President Park Geun-hye granted a pardon to the chairman of the large CJ Group corporation — along with 4,876 others — to celebrate the Liberation Day holiday. About the practice, South Korea’s Justice Ministry stated the following. “In the case of businessmen, we selected a limited number of people… after gathering diverse opinions to unite our people and overcome an economic crisis.” In other words, do not expect the arrest or possible conviction of the Samsung leader Jay Y. Lee to interfere with any upcoming Galaxy S8 Plus release dates.

The report also shows that Apple has taken the number one spot for smartphone vendors during the holiday season, managing to outsell Samsung for the first time since 2014. Looking at the actual numbers, Gartner estimates Apple to have sold 77.03 million smartphones over the last quarter, equating to 17.9% of the overall market. Contrasting that, Samsung, which had to deal with the Galaxy Note7 disaster, sold only 76.78 million units, a 3% decline compared to the same time in 2015, and equating to 17.8% of the overall sales for the quarter. The quarter was painful for Samsung, not only due to Apple’s resurgence and the Note7 issues, but also because the company is seeing ever-increasing pressure in its low and mid-range markets. Chinese vendors are continuing to expand heavily outside of Asia, and three out of the top seller come from this region. They are Huawei, which sold 40.8 million units, Oppo coming in at 26.7 million units and BBK with 24.28 million units. Together these three companies accounted for 21.03% of the worldwide market, up from 14% just one year previously. In terms of operating systems on the devices sold, Android is still the absolute, unchallenged ruler, further expanding its market share by another one percentage point year over year. This means Android ran on 81.7% or 352.66 million devices sold over Q4 of 2016. Over the entirety of 2016 Android gained 3.2 percentage points and was the only OS to gain market share during the year. Apple’s iOS saw very modest market share growth of 0.2% year over year, standing at 17.9% of devices sold over Q4 2016. Perhaps the biggest losers of the year are, no surprise, Blackberry and Microsoft’s Windows 10 Mobile. First off, Microsoft’s platform only accounted for a measly 0.3% of the devices sold during last year’s final quarter, down from 1.1% a year earlier. This echoes other findings from market research companies like Kantar Worldpanel which saw vast declines in sales of Windows 10 Mobile devices, and IDC which predicted Microsoft’s OS will only account for 0.1% of the market by 2020. Judging by these latest results, it will only take one more quarter for the Windows-maker to reach that number. Can you go lower than 0.3% of the market? The answer is an emphatic yes, coming from the company that was once the absolute ruler of the smartphone world: Blackberry. The company’s operating system and products accounted for 0.0% of the devices sold during Q4 of 2016, with Gartner estimating sales of only 200k units. Perhaps there’s no better story illustrating the ever-changing nature of technology and innovation than Blackberry’s rise and fall. No doubt, current market leaders would do well to take that lesson to heart. Update: Blackberry reached out to us with an official response to these sales estimates, saying that the company has shifted focus towards a licensing model. The statement reads: As has been widely communicated, our current strategy focuses on providing state-of-the-art software and security for enterprise and devices. As part of this aggressive pivot to software, we have shifted away from hardware and toward a licensing model where partners develop hardware and distribute and market the BlackBerry brand. We are very excited about the new BlackBerry branded smartphones that our licensing partners - TCL Communication, PT BlackBerry Merah Putih and Optiemus Infracom Ltd - will soon be introducing.

REUTERS/Anindito Mukherjee By Sankalp Phartiyal | MUMBAI MUMBAI Apple Inc will in the coming months start assembling its lower-priced iPhone SE models at a contract manufacturer's plant in the southern Indian technology hub of Bengaluru, an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday. Apple's Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp is setting up a plant in Bengaluru to focus solely on assembling iPhones, a separate source told Reuters earlier this month. Apple's move comes as it seeks to boost its share in the world's fastest growing major mobile market, where handsets far cheaper than Apple's iPhones dominate. It also comes as smartphone sales growth is slowing in Asia's other massive market, China. To lower prices, Apple has been seeking to set up local production and has been in talks with the Indian federal government regarding issues such as tax concessions. The industry source told Reuters the initial manufacturing of the iPhone SE model was not contingent on those concessions. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Economic Times newspaper earlier on Friday reported Apple planned to initially assemble 300,000 to 400,000 iPhone SE handsets in India. The industry source told Reuters the numbers would be substantially lower to begin with. The source also said it was too early to say what other phone models Apple would assemble at the Bengaluru plant. Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to India last year, with a third coming in the December quarter, according to market researcher Counterpoint, which estimates that three-quarters of smartphones sold in India were made locally. In the fourth quarter, Apple ranked 10th in India's smartphone market but led the premium segment with a 62 percent market share, Counterpoint said. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and a host of Chinese players including Xiaomi and Vivo dominate India's smartphone market where the vast majority of phones sold are priced below 15,000 rupees ($225). In comparison, the entry level iPhone SE model sells on Amazon.com's India site for 28,433 rupees ($424).

This year's event won't be held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco as in previous years; instead, the company will be hosting WWDC at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. Apple will showcase the latest updates to its various operating systems - iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS - at the conference. If you're hoping to see the next iPhone make its debut there, you'll probably be disappointed; Apple tends to unveil its flagship handsets towards the end of the year, rather than at its developer-focused event. The theme for this year's conference seems to be based around the idea of technology as a driving force for creativity and positive change, as Apple's WWDC website explains: Technology alone is not enough. Technology must intersect with the liberal arts and the humanities, to create new ideas and experiences that push society forward. This summer we bring together thousands of brilliant minds representing many diverse perspectives, passions, and talents to help us change the world. Registration for the event opens on March 27, and will be available to existing members of the Apple Developer Program or Apple Developer Enterprise Program. The company says that "the opportunity to buy tickets to WWDC17 will be offered by random selection."

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 17 February 2017 | MYT 11:30 AM Apple vowed to revolutionise TV – why hasn’t it? by mark gurman One of many factors: To a certain extent, the Apple TV is handcuffed by its parent's addiction to fat margins. Apple is constitutionally allergic to losing money on a product – even if it can make up the difference by selling content. — Apple Earlier this month, Apple Inc poached the chief of Amazon's Fire TV unit to run its television operations. Timothy D. Twerdhal brings hardware and content experience to his new gig, and his hiring suggests a renewed focus on the Apple TV set-top box.  Twerdhal's arrival comes as the company tests a new, fifth-generation Apple TV that it may release as soon as this year. Internally codenamed “J105,” the new box will be capable of streaming ultra-high-definition 4K and more vivid colors, according to people familiar with the plans.  The features will probably boost Apple TV sales as consumers increasingly upgrade to 4K television sets, but those enhancements alone probably aren't enough to turn the gadget into a groundbreaking, iPhone-caliber product. Time and again, the people say, Apple engineers have been forced to compromise on Apple's vision of revolutionising the living room.  Early on, the Apple TV was going to replace the clunky set-top boxes from the cable companies and stream live television. It never happened. The team debated bundling a gaming controller with the current model to better compete with Microsoft Corp's Xbox and Sony Corp's PlayStation. That didn't happen either.  Originally, viewers were going to be able to shout commands from the couch to the Apple TV. Instead they must talk to the remote control.  Apple has essentially settled for turning the television set into a giant iPhone: a cluster of apps with a store. “That's not what I signed up for,” says one of the people, who requested anonymity to talk freely about internal company matters. “I signed up for revolutionary. We got evolutionary.”  Gene Munster, who covered Apple for more than a decade as a Piper Jaffray analyst and now runs Loup Ventures, echoes the criticism. “Apple TV begs the question: Why does Apple do hobbies?” he says. “Either do it right or don't do it at all.”  Apple doesn't disclose how many Apple TVs it sells, but chief financial officer Luca Maestri acknowledged in a recent interview that sales decreased year-over-year from the 2015 holiday season to this past 2016 holiday period.  The research firm eMarketer says the fourth-generation Apple TV has steadily lost market share since its release in the fall of 2015; in January just 11.9% of connected television customers were using it, the research firm says, down from 12.5% in September. In part, the slide reflects competition from Amazon and Roku, whose boxes do the same and more for less money.  While the Apple TV itself isn't critical to Apple's bottom line, it's central to the company's services business because increasingly the living room is where consumers buy, rent and consume media. Services represented almost US$25bil (RM111.33bil) in revenue for Apple in the last fiscal year, making it the company's second biggest category after the iPhone.  Apple declined to comment or make Twerdhal available for an interview.  The Apple TV's history is study in gradualism. Previewed by Steve Jobs in 2006, the first box was designed simply to stream iTunes video from a Mac to a TV set. The next version, launched in the fall of 2010, let users stream content from the Internet.  The latest box was announced in September 2015, a few months later than originally scheduled. Widely considered an improvement by consumers and product reviewers, the Apple TV features the App Store, voice control and a glass remote that enables motion-controlled gaming, which for example lets players use the remote like a steering wheel for a car-racing title.  But the latest Apple TV sells for US$149, more than twice as much as its predecessor, US$60 more than Amazon's Fire TV and US$20 more than the priciest Roku. What's more, little about the viewing experience has changed – Apple TV users still have to buy an individual episode via the iTunes Store, pay extra for services like Hulu, or download an app tied to a particular channel and log in with an existing cable subscription.  The current model was originally supposed to replace the cable box altogether. Early prototypes had connectors for a coaxial port, which sends the live cable TV signal to televisions. Under this plan, Apple was to control the interface, collect fees from viewers and then share most of the revenue with the cable and media companies.  A new TV app was to be the main interface for accessing live shows and sports. But when the app was finally launched in December, it merely let viewers access their iTunes video library and the iTunes Store, functions that already existed on the Apple TV. The key new element is a “Watch Now” panel, a Netflix-style repository of favourite movies or shows and recommendations for new ones.  Some Apple engineers now regret not making it possible to tailor the opening screen to viewer preferences – classic movies for the family film buff, say, or food shows for the budding teenage chef. The idea never made it onto the engineering roadmap, and adding it now would require a lot of resources.   Apple had a backup plan if it wasn't able to replace the existing cable box-the much-ballyhooed "skinny bundle,” a stripped down web service that would let viewers choose channels rather than paying for ones they don't watch. Apple proposed bundling the four main broadcast networks and a handful of cable channels as well as on-demand TV shows and movies for US$30 (RM133) to US$40 (RM179) a month. The media companies were willing to engage with Apple due to concerns about the rise of online services like Netflix and the cord-cutting phenomenon.  But the two sides stumbled over cost, the composition of the bundles and negotiating tactics. The media companies blamed Apple's arrogance; Apple blamed the media companies' inflexibility. In the end, the talks fell apart, leaving Apple to tout stripped-down bundles from Sony PlayStation and DirecTV. After the negotiations foundered, Apple's hardware team ditched the coaxial port.  The Apple TV's software is also less ambitious than originally envisioned. The current model features an iPhone-like app grid, but designers had prototyped more novel interfaces. One idea, dubbed “Intentions” internally, put the four tabs in the centre of the screen: three for the Apple TV's main content types (video, music, and gaming) and one for everything else. Another idea: letting viewers pull up previews of content by hovering on each icon (a feature currently reserved for only a few of Apple's bundled apps).  To a certain extent, the Apple TV is handcuffed by its parent's addiction to fat margins. Apple is constitutionally allergic to losing money on a product – even if it can make up the difference by selling content. Some engineers initially believed the current set-top box should be capable of streaming 4K video, which offers about twice the resolution as the previous generation of high-definition TV. But 4K requires a faster processor, which would have pushed up manufacturing costs.  That would have forced Apple to accept a lower margin or charge more than the market would bear. Apple settled for a lesser chip that debuted back in 2014-and no 4K. Likewise, not bundling a gaming controller was partially a cost-driven decision.  The arrival of Twerdhal, the former Amazon Fire TV chief, will free up his predecessor, Pete Distad, to try and hammer out content deals and potentially revive the skinny bundle. Distad joined Apple in 2013 after serving as a senior vice president of content distribution at video streaming service Hulu.  For his part, Twerdhal worked at Netflix and Roku, before joining Amazon. “The Amazon hire shows Apple is mixing things up, looking to make improvements,'” Munster says. “I think they realise it is drifting sideways at this point.”  Unless the company fixes the Apple TV, he says, it risks “losing the living room.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Study links working remotely to more stress, insomnia Focus on LeEco, China’s most ambitious electronics group Cyber warriors see politics muddying security efforts Facebook CEO warns against reversal of global thinking European parliament calls for robot law, rejects robot tax Apple vowed to revolutionise TV – why hasn’t it?

The 4K Ultra HD resolution will allow the device to stream videos available from Netflix and YouTube to compatible 4K TVs. Along with 4K, the Apple TV is also said to feature “more vivid colors” which could mean addition of High Dynamic Range (HDR). Sales of the current generation of Apple TV which offers a 1080p resolution has failed to pick up. A number of 4K streaming devices like Amazon Fire TV, Roku, Chromecast Ultra with 4K and more. The report goes on saying that except the improved resolution, the fifth-generation Apple TV will not bring any other major changes. Earlier this month, Apple hired Timothy Twerdahl, former director and general manager of Amazon’s Fire.

Since then, the company has promised to revolutionize home entertainment. Unfortunately, the tiny set-top box has been behind in comparison to its competitions of late. However, that is all going to change with the release of the fifth-generation Apple TV. According to Bloomberg, the company is now in the process of testing out the prototype for its fifth-generation set-top box. The report also mentioned that the next Apple TV will support ultra-high definition 4K video streaming. In addition to 4K video streaming, the Apple TV is also rumored to have support for MFI gaming controllers. This is in order to allow consumers to add desktop gaming to the set-top box. Unfortunately, the controllers will have to be purchased separately as they do not come with the package. Fourth generation Apple TV (via apple.com) At the moment, Apple is hoping the new features will boost sales. For a few years now, the company has been suffering from slowly declining product sales figures for the Apple TV. By including the 4K video streaming feature, Apple is expecting to attract more consumers to buy its product. Unfortunately, as it stands, the Apple video streamer is not really the most affordable set-top box in the market. The Amazon Fire TV is priced at around $130. The Apple TV, on the other hand, is currently sold for approximately $150, a $20 difference in comparison to the Amazon Fire TV. In order to get ahead of the competition, Apple would need to do more. Perhaps by offering some sort of gaming option will be enough to get more of the needed attention for the Apple set-top box. However, this is not exactly something revolutionary. There are a number of set-top box devices out there that offer the same features. Case in point is the current NVIDIA Shield TV. Apple has been quite mum about its next generation set-top box. Right now, nobody knows when the set-top box will become available in the market. However, the fact that the next Worldwide Developers Convention is happening pretty soon, it might get announced along with the event. That said, the Apple TV might be released within the year.

The Worldwide Developers Convention (WWDC) is where Apple makes its biggest announcements for the year. The company just announced that the said event will take place in San Jose, CA from the 5th to the 9th of June. The announcement brings up rumours that Apple might release new products during the said event. Normally, WWDC is held in San Francisco. However, this year, Apple is going back to its roots by celebrating the event in San Jose, the place where the first WWDC took place. The company could be paying homage to Steve Jobs as the company celebrates the iPhone’s 10th anniversary. According to The Loop, this year’s WWDC will take place at the McEnery Convention Centre in San Jose. The event venue will be able to host around 5,000 developers and 1,000 Apple engineers. Perhaps the most interesting part of the event is the possibility of introducing upcoming products that might get released within the year. iMac 2015 (via apple.com) On top of the list of these products is the long overdue refresh for Apple’s all-in-one computer. Rumor has it that the Cupertino tech giant will be releasing the much awaited iMac 2017 sometime this year. Many of those rumors pertain to a release date even before the end of the first half of 2017. That being said, with the event looming ever so near, there is a slight chance that Apple will announce the iMac 2017 during the said event. Along with the iMac 2017, Apple could also be announcing its next state-of-the-art desktop operating system, the macOS Sierra 10.13. It could also be that the new OS will be announced as part of the upcoming desktop from Apple. To make matters even more interesting, it is also possible that Apple will announce the next generation iPhone devices. This is mainly because the event may serve as a homage to the iPhone’s 10th anniversary as well. Moreoever, the new iPhone announcement could be accompanied by updates of Apple’s iOS 11. At the moment, Apple did not imply that it will be announcing new products during the said event. However, going by programs from the previous events, the likelihood of getting a product update or two is very high. For more updates on the WWDC 2017, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Read More NEW DELHI: Apple will kick off its India manufacturing plans by initially assembling 3-4 lakh units of its iPhone SE model at the Karnataka plant being set up by contract manufacturer Wistron, as the maker of the iconic iPhones looks to take a deeper bite of a key market amid slowing global smartphone growth. The Cupertino-based tech giant is likely to go ahead with the Bengaluru assembly plan without waiting for the government's nod for the list of tax concessions that it had sought along with other demands. The company wants to "experience manufacturing in India", a person familiar with the company's plans told ET. View As Photolist » iPhone SE: Apple's return to 4-inch smartphone market 16 iPhone SE: Apple's return to 4-inch smartphone market Apple launched its 4-inch smartphone iPhone SE in India in March this year. The company called iPhone SE 'its cheapest iPhone' model to date. In India, the smartphone launched at a starting price tag of Rs 39,000. iPhone SE's price was widely speculated to bring down the price of Apple's iPhone 5S, however, the company did not officially reduce the smartphone's price post SE's launch. ​Looks identical to iPhone 5S iPhone SE looks almost identical to iPhone 5S. It's measurements too are virtually same. Changes include matte-chamfered edges. The smartphone also comes in new colours including Rose Gold. ​Shares innards with iPhone 6 iPhone SE comes in two storage variants: 16GB and 64GB. The smartphone has much of the same specifications as the iPhone 6s, which Apple launched last year. These include Apple's A9 SoC and M9 motion coprocessor, 12-megapixel iSight (rear) camera, Bluetooth 4.2, Apple Pay support and Touch ID fingerprint sensor. Current price iPhone SE's is currently available online at a starting price of Rs 27,999, while iPhone 5S' best available price is Rs 17,999. ​iPhone SE's successor Though Apple has officially not said anything about iPhone SE's successor so far, rumours claim that the company may launch a new 5-inch iPhone next year. The report cites sources in Taiwan's supply chain. ​iPhone 5S among 'top selling' Apple devices in India The three-year-old iPhone 5S continues to be among the Apple's best-selling devices in India. In the year 2016 too, iPhone 5S, along with Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 6, helped the Cupertino giant guard its smartphone sales share in India. "It is Apple's first such venture in India... The demands they have made are for the larger plans of the company to really scale up manufacturing in India," a senior government official told ET, requesting anonymity. A person in the contract manufacturing industry said Wistron is ready to start assembling the phones. "The duty concessions are not connected to the plant," the person added. Wistron's facility is set to begin assembling locally from April. Apple and Wistron didn't comment on queries seeking confirmation of production plans. The biggest hurdle preventing Apple from cornering a larger slice of the Indian smartphone pie is its price points which, typically, for a new model start at over Rs 50,000 in a market where 70-80% of the devices are sold in the under-Rs 10,000 segment. This has led to Apple falling way short of its target of selling 10 million mobile phones in India by 2016-17. Starting local assembly and scaling it up to full manufacturing will help the company price its products competitively and corner a bigger portion of the market where nearly 700 million mobile phone users still use feature phones. The iPhone SE, launched amidst much fanfare in April 2016, was widely anticipated to be aimed at emerging markets, including India, as it was priced lower than all other iPhone models. But even the lower price tag of Rs 39,000 for a basic model of SE was too much for the mass market. The handset is currently retailing at less than Rs 30,000 in India and would become cheaper still if produced here. "While the immediate advantage would be the tax benefit of 10-12% if it is manufactured (here) compared with imports, it will also give Apple an edge in India, which is the fastest-growing large market, as opposed to slow growth in China," said Navkendar Singh, senior research manager, client devices, at IDC India. Apple may put iPhone SE successor on hold: Analyst Apple may put the successor of its 4-inch smartphone iPhone SE on hold, says noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities. If Apple manages to capture even a "sliver of this large potential consumer base which considers Apple an aspirational brand, it can benefit hugely", Singh said. The company can spend the savings from local manufacturing to strengthen its retail and distribution channels in India, just like Chinese players Oppo and Vivo, Singh said. "So in a way, Apple and India need each other." Industry insiders said Apple could have started by making the iPhone 5S — its top-selling model — locally, but has chosen the iPhone SE as it is the lowest-priced offering in Apple's stable and also amongst the most recent, which would support future iOS upgrades. Industry executives said Apple may phase out iPhone 5S in India in a couple of quarters, and pointed out that the handset has been discontinued in many other markets and is at the end of its life cycle. One of the persons aware of Apple's plans said the company was open to relocating some of its manufacturing units from China to India due to rising labour costs in that country. The plant in Peenya district, on the outskirts of Bengaluru, could help Apple better understand local manufacturing and the challenges involved, said this person. List of concessions The iPhone maker has sought a string of concessions to manufacture in India, including a 15-year exemption from customs duty, assurance on continuing countervailing duty exemptions on electronic components for the same time period, besides clarity in policy for selling refurbished goods here. It has also sought additional benefits under the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS). An inter-ministerial group including senior officials of the industry department, and the environment and IT ministries along with revenue department officials had met Apple's representatives in January to discuss the wish list. A final decision is yet to be taken. The government, however, might find it difficult to meet the demands amid the roll-out of goods and services tax (GST) in the coming financial year, which subsumes all indirect taxes and leaves little space for offering incentives for particular sectors. iPhone SE: Apple's return to 4-inch smartphone market Different sections of the central government though have indicated their eagerness to bring Apple to India, which would signify a huge leg up for the 'Make in India' initiative. State governments too are competing with each other to host Apple's manufacturing business. "Apple wants to make India its third home (in addition to the US and China) and they want to manufacture in Karnataka. We want to support them," Karnataka industries minister RV Deshpande told ET. He said he had met the Union ministers concerned over past three days to push the state's case. "They (Apple) would first like to start with assembly and then go for manufacturing. There are some issues which are pending with the Centre... We have requested the Centre to look at it favourably," Deshpande said. Maharashtra, too, has gotten into the act. On Tuesday, state chief minister Devendra Fadnavis met senior officials from Foxconn, Apple's biggest contract manufacturer, and offered to compensate for the 11.5% import duty in case talks with the Centre did not yield a positive result.

I’ve upgraded and the system runs smooth. I like the new features of iPhone photos, especially use Siri to retrieve the photos.

WWDC 2017 is set to start at 5 June and will go on till 9 June 2017 at McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. WWDC or World Wide Developers conference 2017 is its 28th annual conference where Apple will announce future Apple devices and software updates powering Apple products. The main aim of the conference is to celebrate and host developers while releasing new and updated tools for the community to take leverage from while inspiring them to unleash their creativity in code. One interesting thing to note is that the new Apple headquarters in Cupertino is located just minutes away from WWDC 2017 venue thereby enabling developers easier access to about 1000 Apple engineers to interact with, share ideas or better understand the nuances in programming for Apple products. Image Credit: Apple The company will hold keynote address, get-togethers, sessions and labs for developers. Another significant thing the company is doing is to work with local businesses in San Jose to celebrate the return of WWDC. People who want to attend the conference can apply for tickets in coming weeks around Spring. The entire event will be live-streamed through Apple Developer website and the WWDC app for Apple TV, iPhone and iPad. We can expect details around the next major iPhone launch, the iPhone 8 or iPhone X or whatever Apple will choose to call its 10-year anniversary device, next big update to iOS and something regarding the Apple streaming service.

The company has signed a contract with manufacturer Wistron to set the factory and assemble the smartphones. According to senior officials in the company, Apple will not wait for the demands of tax concessions to be accepted as they pertain to a larger picture and future plans of the company in India. According to a report by The Economic Times, Apple wants to ‘experience manufacturing in India”. The affordable iPhone One thing to note is that the plant is all set to start assembling the smartphones by April 2017 and the tax demands are not connected to the plant being set up by Wistron. Both Apple and Wistron have not released any official statement regarding this information or any other information. The reason the company is assembling iPhone SE is because it wants to compete with other players in the market in a country where 70-80 percent of the smartphones sold are under Rs 10,000. Currently, the basic model of iPhone SE smartphone is priced at Rs 39,000 and still retails around the Rs 30,000 mark. The main reason why iPhone SE was introduced was to offer a cheaper alternative to the people who can’t afford Apple’s flagship lineup but still want to get an iPhone. It also addresses the market which still prefers the smaller 4-inch display size. By assembling iPhone SE, the most economical product by Apple in its iPhone series, the company can price the smartphone at a lower price point to lure more customers. As has been reported in the past, when a smartphone maker makes phones in India, there is an immediate 10-12 percent savings, as the import duty is cut. Apple has miles to go in terms of iPhone volumes sold in India Apple may be the most popular smartphone maker in the world, and quite a popular brand in India. It has earned record revenue in India last year, despite demonetisation. But in terms of sales, there were only 2.5mn iPhones sold last year, as compared to over 70mn phones sold by Samsung. Yes, it is unfair to compare the two as Samsung has a much wider portfolio across form factors and price points. But if Apple really wants to make waves in numbers of smartphones sold, it has to address the popular price segments. The iPhone SE could be a good phone to start that off. According to the latest IDC numbers, the Indian market has been dominated by Chinese smartphone players. There isn’t a single Indian player in the top 5. Apple, in comparison has sold less volumes. The iPhone SE then is an important phone for Apple from the Indian smartphone buyer perspective. It makes the entry barrier for entering into the Apple ecosystem, relatively economical. The report further points out that even though iPhone 5S is the most selling smartphone in India, the company has decided to sell iPhone SE because SE is the most recent smartphone that will get future iOS updates while 5S is set to be discontinued in near future. There are unverified rumours that the company is shifting some of its manufacturing plants to India because of the rise in labour costs in China. We have detailed all the things that the company has demanded from Government of India and they seem to be part of the second phase of Apple’s plan in India.

Shares21 DNA Web Team | Fri, 17 Feb 2017-10:11am , Mumbai , DNA webdesk For the first time in years, Apple’s famous developers conference is moving away from San Francisco This year, Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is happening in San Francisco between 5-9 June after years of it being at the famous Moscone Center in San Francisco. Registrations for the evening will be opening on 27 March. The reason why this key event has moved cities is largely attributed to the high cost of attending it in a city like San Francisco, where attending developers often need to shell out several thousand dollars during the week of the event. This year it is being held in the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, a relatively smaller and more affordable city, which happens to be much closer to Apple’s Cupertino campus. This would make it easier for Apple employees to connect with the attendees. Apple’s SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller confirmed that the conference this year will be approximately the same size as the previous, where about 5,000 developers are expected to attend. Each ticket being priced at $1,599 (approximated Rs 1,07,285.) As in previous years, there will be a lottery system to select the final attendees, as there is typically a huge demand for entries. WWDC typically sees much being unveiled by way of Apple’s software and services, including iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS. This year, iOS 11 will be taking centerstage. Of course, we will be covering the event live during the time.

Trump seems keen on bullying Tim Cook to open a factory in the USA without actually detailing specifics, and while Apple has stayed out of the fray so far, new comments from Apple CFO Luca Maestri indicate that Apple won’t be shutting up shop in China any time soon. Don't Miss: T-Mobile just fixed the worst problem with its unlimited plans As The Verge spotted, Maestri was speaking to a Goldman Sachs conference yesterday when he answered a question about overseas manufacturing: “One of the points that we are making in Washington is the fact that we have been a very large contributor to the US economy during the last decade,” Maestri said. “We made billions of investments in the United States. In the last 10 years, we created about 2 million jobs in this country — in the developer community in our retail stores in our call centers and through the supplier chain.” Maestri went on to talk more about Apple’s US-located call centers, and how it is “very, very difficult to speculate” on Apple’s manufacturing plans given that Trump has outlined no specific policies yet. He did, however, point out that a border tax on imported goods “would end up burdening the end consumer.” Reading between the lines, it looks like another attempt by Apple to take iPhone manufacturing off the table for discussions with Trump. Apple seems willing to move ancillary services, like support centers, back to the US, but moving the entire iPhone supply chain would be orders of magnitude more difficult. This is far from the first time that iPhone manufacturing has been in the news. Shortly after Trump’s electoral victory, Apple reportedly asked its subsidiaries to examine the feasibility of iPhone manufacturing — which caused Breitbart to run with the (untrue) story “Silicon Valley Bows to Trump: Apple to Build iPhones in America.” Trending right now: Pioneer’s new headphones solve the iPhone 7’s dumbest problem The biggest caveats in Verizon’s new ‘unlimited’ plan This tiny box lets Alexa control anything that plugs into a wall See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next There’s a broken iPhone on eBay right now for $149,999, and here’s why BGR News Drive a rental and earn when you need it, 24/7 UberSponsored Wristband monitors your blood alcohol content while you drink Yahoo Tech If you have an iPhone 7, you got the wrong iPhone BGR News Huge leak reveals iPhone 8 form factor and exactly how Apple will eliminate the home button BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo Finance

Apple, and other consumer electronics companies, maintain a tight control over their repair services, restricting services to authorised repairers only. If implemented, the bills will force companies like Apple to grant access to repair manuals, tools, error codes and even software updates, without which independent repair of these highly sophisticated products is very difficult. This is expected to remove the monopoly of these companies, giving consumers access to competitive and better priced repair services from third parties. Until these bills are enacted, however, any customer who attempts to repair an Apple product on his own or through a third party, stands to lose his warranty, and depending on the repair, may be infringing Apple’s copyrights. This is also the current situation on the subject under Indian laws. Origin of the ‘right to repair’ for automobiles The right to repair first originated in the automobile industry. This industry had created a similar monopoly in the ‘aftermarket’ or repair market, restricting access to genuine spare parts and repair manuals to authorised repairers only. This was seen as highly anti-competitive, which subjected customers to the high repair rates charged by these companies with no alternative service providers. Image: Reuters This was remedied through a series of bills introduced in the US, collectively also known as the Motor Vehicle Owner’s Right to Repair Act. An example of this is the Digital Right to Repair Act, enacted in 2012 in Massachusetts. This act led to a national agreement in the auto industry, agreeing to allow standardised access to repair and diagnostic information and tools, thus enabling even third parties to freely provide services. The monopolistic practices Companies like Apple often cite reasons like lack of safety in third party repair, effect on brand image due to faulty/ inadequate third party repair, and the dangers of a fake or spurious spare parts entering the market. For instance, these companies are said to have suggested that consumers who repair their phones on their own risk the lithium batteries catching fire. The burnt Samsung Galaxy Note 7 in an aircraft Companies have also used methods like ‘anti-warranty’ stickers, or stickers which, if removed, void the warranty on the product, soldering of the products (like Apple’s MacBook’s processor, RAM and flash memory are soldered on), using customised hardware (such as Apple’s customised ’pentalobular’ screws), and such other features to make third party repair impossible. These companies also make full use of their protection under copyright law, claiming copyrights over the repair manuals and installing software locks. The copyright law prevents any third party from publishing the repair manuals, while tampering with the software locks will amount to modification of software, or infringing the company’s software copyrights. What happens if you repair your iPhone? Despite all these factors discouraging third party repair, the high costs push consumers to look for alternatives. For example, though the actual cost of a screen is about Rs 10,000, Apple charges Rs 25,000 for a screen replacement in a current generation iPhone. So what happens if you attempt to repair your iPhone on your own, or through a third party: i) Loss of Warranty The primary effect is that the third party/self repair will void Apple’s warranty for the product.  When you buy an iPhone, you accept the license terms. This constitutes a legal, binding contract between you and Apple. This includes its warranty agreement, which states that the warranty does not apply: “(f) to damage caused by service (including upgrades and expansions) performed by anyone who is not a representative of Apple or an Apple Authorised Service Provider (“AASP”); (g) to an Apple Product that has been modified to alter functionality or capability without the written permission of Apple;…” Thus, all users have expressly agreed that if they have their iPhone serviced by a non-Apple authorised service provider, they lose their warranty on the product. In fact, in 2016, Apple had installed an ‘Error 53’ security measure,  which ‘killed’ iPhones after they were repaired by third parties. A massive class action lawsuit against Apple forced it to withdraw the measure and restore the iPhones. Exploded Apple iPhone 7 view. Source: IHS Markit. ii) Copyright Infringement The second risk is of copyright infringement. The increasing integration of software with hardware in new age electronics leads to this issue even with repairs. Certain repairs, like replacing a screen, battery, speaker, etc., which do not involve any interference with the software, can be done without violating copyright law. But repairs of the fingerprint sensor, home button and mainboard, which do interfere with the software, do violate copyright laws. This could open you and third party repairers to a copyright infringement suit from Apple. The Indian Copyright Act, 1957 does grant rights to fair use under Section 52, such as the right to modify software for a personal, non-commercial use. However, this right does not apply to modification for ‘repair’. Particularly, all such modifications are completely prohibited by Apple’s license agreement. The conflict seen here between the Copyright Act and software license agreements is yet to be resolved by Indian Courts. Until then, consumers will be risking copyright infringement by tampering with the software for any reason, including repair. Right to repair introduced in India The right to repair in the automobile industry, for the same reasons as in the US, was introduced recently in India. In 2014, in Shamsher Kataria v. Honda, Volkswagen, BMW, etc. , the Competition Commission of India prohibited the monopolistic repair practices of 14 top automobile companies, as they were anti-competitive and in violation of the Competition Act, 2002. While this decision is restricted to automobiles, it is conceivable that the practices of companies like Apple will also be considered anti-competitive. Until then, consumers and third party repairers must remember that they don’t (yet) have a right to repair under Indian laws.

Works with HomeKit. Supports Siri and Alexa voice commands. Well-designed app. Cons Pricey. Quirky installation. No support for IFTTT. Bottom Line The iDevices Smart Home Essentials Kit contains everything you need to control lights and plug-in appliances using your voice and your smartphone. It supports Apple's HomeKit and doesn't require a hub, but it's fairly expensive and can be tricky to install. By John R. Delaney If you're looking to turn your existing home appliances into smart home appliances, the iDevices Smart Home Essentials Kit has pretty much everything you need. It comes with three light sockets and seven plug-in switches that are Wi-Fi enabled and can be controlled from a smartphone without the need for a home automation hub. Each component can be managed individually or in a group, and they all work with Apple's HomeKit platform and respond to Siri and Amazon Alexa voice commands. That said, installation was problematic in our tests, and the kit's $499.95 price is more than what you'll pay for competing smart home components. //Compare Similar Products Compare Belkin WeMo Insight Switch   %displayPrice%%seller% Zuli Smartplug Presence 3-Pack   %displayPrice%%seller% Belkin WeMo Light Switch   %displayPrice%%seller% D-Link mydlink Wi-Fi Smart Plug (DSP-W215)   %displayPrice%%seller% Nyrius Smart Outlet   %displayPrice%%seller% Belkin WeMo Switch + Motion   %displayPrice%%seller% Components The Essentials Kit comes with three sockets, five wall switches, and two outdoor switches, all of which contain radios that support 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi and WPA/WPA2 security. If purchased separately, the sockets are $59.95 each, the switches are $49.95 each, and the outdoor switches are $79.95 each. Purchasing them in the Essentials Kit represents a $90 savings. View All 5 Photos in Gallery The socket is a light bulb adapter that is 2.9 inches long and 2.4 inches in diameter. It has an E26 base that screws into any lamp and a socket that accepts standard E26 bulbs. You can use incandescent, CFL, LED, or halogen bulbs, but in order to use the dimming feature they must be dimmable. At the top of the socket is an LED light ring that changes colors during installation and serves as a multi-color nightlight, and there's a button on the side that is used to manually turn the socket off. Pressing and holding the button until it blinks red will reset the device. The indoor wall switch is white and tan and measures 1.5 by 2.7 by 1.6 inches (HWD). It plugs into any three pronged outlet and has a multi-colored LED nightlight strip on the front, a single three-pronged outlet on the left side, and an on/off button of the right that also resets the switch when pressed until the LED strip blinks red. As with the Belkin WeMo Insight Switch and Zuli Smartplug, the iDevices switch has a built-in power meter that measures average power consumption and average energy costs. It also tells you the average time of use. The outdoor switch is housed in a black weather-resistant casing that measures 6.0 by 2.8 by 1.9 inches (HWD) and weighs 1 pound. It has two three-pronge outlets on the bottom, a thin 2.2-inch-long LED strip on the front, and a three-pronge power cord on top that is 7.5 inches long. The left side has a button for resetting the switch and manually turning it on and off, and the back has a mounting hole for hanging the switch on a wall or a fence post. While it's nice to have dual outlets, it would be even nicer if they were independent of one another, which would allow you to separately control two devices. As with the wall switch, the outdoor switch monitors energy usage and costs. iDevices also sells a smart wall outlet ($299.85 for a three-pack) and a smart thermostat ($129.95), both of which can be controlled using the well-designed Android or iOS app. App and Features The iDevices Connected app is free and uses photo icons for easy navigation. It opens to a My Home page that displays rooms and a list of each connected device in each room. To the left of the device name is a photo of the device, and to the right are an on/off button and a brightness indicator (for sockets). Tapping on any device opens a page with controls and detailed information; the socket page has an on/off button for the light, a brightness slider, and an on/off button for the nightlight. Here you can also select a color for the nightlight as well as brightness and saturation levels. The indoor and outdoor switch pages are nearly identical; they both have on/off buttons and display average energy consumption, average time used, and average estimated power cost. The outdoor switch doesn't have nightlight settings but the wall switch does. Each device also has a Scenes/Schedules option that allows you to schedule on/off times or include the device in a Scene that allows you to control multiple devices simultaneously. For example, you can create a Movie Night Scene that has your living room or den lights dim to a preset brightness level. In the upper right corner there are three bars; tap them to assign devices to Zones and Rooms. Zones consist of one or more Rooms that you want to control all at once, such as upstairs or downstairs. You can assign devices to specific Rooms in the house, such as the den or the kitchen. Tap the Products icon to control sockets, switches, and nightlights all at once. For example, when you hit the off button for switches, every switch in the house will turn off. Here you can also create Scenes and Schedules, use the Add Products button to pair new components, and view energy reports for each switch. The Settings page is where you go to enter values for the energy cost monitor and set up Alexa voice commands. In addition to the app, you can use Alexa and Siri voice commands to control iDevices components. Simple voice commands will turn components on and off and you can enable a Scene whenever you like by simply saying "Siri, movie night," or "Alexa, turn off den." However, you can't trigger components with If This Then That (IFTTT) recipes like you can with the Belkin WeMo Insight Switch and various lighting systems from LIFX, Philips, and Stack Labs. Installation and Performance I ran into a couple of roadblocks while installing the components. I used a web browser to log in to the iDevices site to activate the kit. You can choose the Concierge-Guided or Self-Guided setup method; if you choose Concierge-Guided, you'll be asked to schedule a call with a technician who will walk you through the installation procedure and provide tips on how to best use each component. I chose the Self-Guided option in which you use the printed install guide and in-app instructions to set up the system, but you can always call tech support if you have trouble along the way. Once activated, I downloaded the app and began adding devices. Each device comes with a Quick Start Guide that offers illustrated instructions for connecting it to your home Wi-Fi and adding it as a HomeKit device. I started by screwing a socket into a desktop lamp. It began blinking blue and immediately showed up in the app. I clicked the plus icon next to the socket name, selected my network SSID, and waited around 10 seconds for the socket to join my network, at which time the light ring went solid blue. The app then did a quick search and found the socket, but when I tapped it to add it to HomeKit, I received an Error 77 message stating that the identity attempt failed due to a cloud data sync in progress. A quick Google search confirmed that this is a common error that could be resolved by resetting the Apple Home app and resetting the socket. Once reset, the iDevices app found the socket, prompted me to scan the HomeKit code, and added the socket to the My Home menu. When I went to install the second socket, I received an Error 52 message that required me to reset the Wi-Fi on my phone, reset the socket, close the iDevices app, reopen it, and reinstall the socket. This time around I was able to scan the HomeKit code and add the socket to My Home. I had the same problem with the third socket. The procedure for installing the indoor and outdoor switches was identical, and I encountered the Error 52 message with each installation. However, I didn't have to go through the Wi-Fi and switch reset process; I simply clicked OK on the error message and proceeded to the HomeKit pairing screen. Once all of the sockets and switches were installed the system worked perfectly. Each switch responded instantly to on and off commands made using the app and followed all of my Schedules. I grouped my components according to the rooms in which they were installed, and they all reacted immediately when I used voice commands to turn off a room or an entire zone. Voice commands to raise and lower the brightness level of lights installed in the sockets also worked wonderfully. Conclusions The iDevices Smart Home Essentials Kit is a good choice for anyone who wants to smarten up their home with controlled lighting and smart switches that they can control from one app, without the need for a hub. Once I got past the annoying error messages during installation, each component worked wonderfully, whether managed via the app or by Alexa and Siri voice commands. The app is easy to use, and allows you to control devices individually, by group, or with scenes and Schedules. That said, you'll save a good chunk of change and gain functionality by purchasing various other smart home devices a la carte. Philips Hue White bulbs, for instance, cost $15 each, which is well under the $40 or so you're paying here, even when you factor in the price of a hub across multiple bulbs. The Belkin WeMo Insight Switch costs the same as the iDevices switch, meanwhile, and works with the Nest Thermostat, IFTTT recipes, and is a lot easier to install.

Now We Know the Story John Martellaro @jmartellaro Feb 16th, 2017 6:17 PM EST | Editorial An aspirational product is one that the customer aspires to own. The combination of design, utility and forward looking concepts are so alluring that the customer says, “I appreciate that product. I aspire to it. I want it.” I can’t say that I’ve ever seen the Apple TV as aspirational. Unlike our Jeff Gamet, I’ve always viewed the black brick as ugly. I write about Apple, and I love TV technology, so I’ve bought a series of them over the years. And yet, I was never truly inspired by the hardware. Today, I’m using a 4th gen model that I bought right after it shipped in late 2015. The 4th generation Apple TV with Siri Remote. My surmise is that the current model was designed in late 2014 and was ready to ship in the summer of 2015. That’s when Apple was trying to work a TV subscription deal. The plan, from what I’ve read, was to announce a glorious Apple TV subscription deal in the summer of 2015 and simultaneously release the 4th gen Apple TV. Alas, the TV subscription deals fell through. See: “3 Reasons Apple’s TV Subscription Service Failed.” And so Apple relented and released the 4th gen Apple TV in September, 2015 without a lot of fanfare. Without 4K/UHD support. Now one could argue that this was no great sin. 4K content was sparse back then. Many customers were still delighted with their 2K/1080p TVs. The era of apps on tvOS had arrived. And yet. And yet. Time moves fast. While Apple fiddled with negotiations, a problematic Siri remote, single sign-on, getting Amazon on board with a Prime TV app, and a new Apple TV app that didn’t really do a lot for starters, time passed Apple by. The 4K/UHD TV business was sparking with a new technology called HDR. Many of the new TVs during the 2016 holidays had it, and now its pretty much a given for 4K/UHD TVs in 2017. If Apple had been a technology leader, as Roku was last fall, it would have released a 5th gen Apple TV with 4K and HDR10 support in late 2016. But because the 4th gen model was late and because Apple executives didn’t see an Apple TV as an aspirational product, something to be kept up to date, it didn’t happen. During Apple’s Q1 2017 Earnings Report, CFO Luca Maestri reported that Apple TV sales were down, year over year. I wasn’t surprised. While Roku and Netflix got on the 4K bandwagon in 2016, Apple fiddled and failed to keep up. Today, Roku, Chromecast and Amazon Fire TV dominate. Apple is 4th, according to ComScore. Apple TV market share in early 2016. (ComScore) Now We Know Why On February 16th, Mark Gurman, writing for Bloomberg, revealed what has been happening. See: “Apple Vowed to Revolutionize Television. An Inside Look at Why It Hasn’t.” Author Gurman goes into some detail about how Apple got distracted. The product itself became secondary. Infighting slowed Apple down. Gurman’s stinging indictment stood out for me. Apple has essentially settled for turning the television set into a giant iPhone: a cluster of apps with a store. ‘That’s not what I signed up for,’ says one of the people, who requested anonymity to talk freely about internal company matters. ‘I signed up for revolutionary. We got evolutionary.’ Gene Munster, who covered Apple for more than a decade as a Piper Jaffray analyst and now runs Loup Ventures, echoes the criticism. ‘Apple TV begs the question: Why does Apple do hobbies?’ he says. ‘Either do it right or don’t do it at all.’ Apple dawdled with the Apple TV and let it slide, even though Tim Cook’s previous remarks all along made it sound like Apple was planning something wonderful. Gurman’s article suggests that with the hiring of Amazon’s former chief of the Fire TV unit, Timothy Twerdhal, there is renewed focus. Finally. I can’t wait. I can’t wait for Apple to build a beautiful, capable, 4K/UHD/HDR 5th gen Apple TV that goes toe-to-toe with the competition. And wins. Hey Apple. You remember what winning was like, right?

The big change coming to the next Apple TV is 4K video support, and not much else. Apple ready to bring 4K video support to Apple TV Insider sources speaking with Bloomberg said the new Apple TV will support 4K video and “more vivid colors,” which hints at high dynamic range (HDR) support, too. That’ll help bring Apple TV on par with devices like Amazon’s Fire TV and Google’s Chromecast, but it doesn’t do much to set it apart. Despite the new TV app, Apple TV doesn’t do much to improve the content viewing experience. Apple TV is still too app-centric, forcing users to jump from app to app to watch the shows they like instead of offering a unified viewing interface. The TV app attempts to address that, but only in the feeblest of terms. The app lists upcoming episodes for shows you’re watching, but only for services that have signed on to work with TV. Right now, that includes Apple’s own services, and several networks including HBO—no Amazon Prime support, and Netflix limited its support to searching through its library of old TV shows. Selecting a show jumps you out of the TV app and to the app for the network, studio, or service that’s streaming what you want to watch. In essence, TV is a content searching app. Apple TV: 4K, and Maybe More Right now all we’re hearing about is 4K support, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other changes coming to the next Apple TV. Apple could make some big interface changes in tvOS 11 that focus more on content than apps, and now that developers can make bigger Apple TV apps we could see more interesting games come to the platform, too. Apple also recently hired Timothy Twerdahl as vice president of product marketing for Apple TV. He previously served as the product marketing vice president for Amazon’s Fire TV product line, and worked for Roku and Netflix, too. His presence may be a sign Apple is ready to get serious about competing in the set top box market. Eddy Cue may have hinted at the Apple TV’s importance in Apple’s entertainment master plan. Apple is on the hunt for compelling original scripted shows for Apple Music, and subscribers will need a convenient way to stream them to their televisions. Apple TV fits that bill nicely, and is far more elegant than making users stream from their computer, iPhone, or iPad. Still, if Apple’s big plan for the fifth generation Apple TV is 4K video, maybe it’s time to look for a new product manager.

By Tom Foremski | February 17, 2017 -- 02:30 GMT (18:30 PST) | Topic: Innovation We are in an era of "Hyperscale companies" such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Apple with limited opportunities for startups warns Sam Altman, head of Y Combinator, Silicon Valley's influential investment group and educator. In his 2017 YC Annual Letter Altman wrote: "We're now in the era of hyperscale technology companies...Companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple, and Microsoft have powerful advantages " "I expect that they will continue to do a lot of things well, have significant data and computation advantages, be able to attract a large percentage of the most talented engineers, and aggressively buy companies that get off to promising starts." This situation "is unlikely to reverse without antitrust action." His warning was carefully worded because Altman knows that advocating for government intervention is unpopular in Silicon Valley. He adds some balance and points to opportunities for startups where these hyperscale companies "are naturally weaker." He says that most startup founders and investors do not fully understand hyperscale's "powerful advantage." Foremski's Take: [I'm a big fan of Sam Altman, the 31-year old head of Y Combinator group after moderating his presentation at the excellent Startup Voodoo in St Louis.] It's good to see someone as influential as Sam Altman raising this issue because it is a topic I've been writing about for nearly three years: Scale versus innovation: The peril to Silicon Valley's future | ZDNet. We continue to see massive late stage VC deals where the race to scale fastest and become the largest is the primary goal over any consideration of other values. It's because in digital economies the first company to scale has the potential to push nearly everyone else into the margins very quickly. In traditional markets a company would expand by establishing offices or stores in new regions and countries - a multi-year process that gives competitors time to respond. But in digital markets a well-funded competitor can quickly scale to a dominant global position in weeks. Scaling is not very interesting but it's how you win in digital markets. However, scaling even at hyperscale levels is not illegal. Anti-trust punishes illegal business practices. Silicon Valley used to celebrate great ideas and extraordinary achievements rather than scale. Fortunately, Sam Altman is still motivated by great ideas and the potential benefits to humanity of "the most significant technology revolution in human history." "It's an exciting time to do what we do."

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website 9  −  5  =  Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Most of the "Warren Buffett buys Apple stock" stories this week have reflected a sense of surprise that the world's most famous value investor nearly quadrupled his holdings in the tech icon in the last three months of 2016. But the answer is actually simple. Apple is a household name, a well-run company, a company he understands, and the stock is trading at a reasonable price. Still, Wall Street is skeptical… "I'm stunned to see the size of that Apple position," Thomas Russo, a partner at investment firm Gardner Russo & Gardner, told Reuters. As of Dec. 31, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.A, BRK.B), the holding company Buffett has controlled since 1964, owned 57.4 million shares of Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL). At the end of the previous quarter, Berkshire owned just 15.2 million shares. With the Apple stock price at about $135, Berkshire's stake is worth nearly $7.75 billion. Berkshire is now among AAPL's 10 largest investors. Wall Street was taken aback at first because Buffett historically has shunned large stakes in companies that disrupt industries, and tech companies in particular. Buffett's core holdings tend toward such tried-and-true companies as Coca-Cola Inc. (NYSE: KO) and Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC). Apple just doesn't fit the profile for a Warren Buffett stock pick. Or does it? When you take a closer look at Apple, you realize that it's evolved into a company that fulfills virtually all of Buffett's investing criteria… Warren Buffett Buys Apple Stock Because It's a Perfect Fit Five years ago, Apple was still a high-flying growth stock. But the company's tremendous size – it has the largest market capitalization in the world, more than $700 billion – and the maturation of its key business, the iPhone, have transformed AAPL into more of a value stock. And when you consider the things Warren Buffett looks for in a target stock, Apple is a surprisingly good match. Take a look… Warren Buffett Principle No. 1: Buy Household Names Even non-investors recognize the companies in Buffett's portfolio – and that's the point. He knows that a powerful brand name helps a company retain market share and future earnings. Apple has one of the most recognized brands in the world, often ranking first in lists of brand value. Everywhere you go, you see people holding their iPhones. In fact, Apple products are as common as the products by such Berkshire holdings such as The Kraft Heinz Co. (NYSE: KHC) or General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM). Warren Buffett Principle No. 2: Buy What You Understand This rule is why Buffett has for the most part avoided tech stocks. But Apple products are used by almost everyone now, from children to senior citizens. It's not just Apple, of course. It's hard to find an American that doesn't own some sort of smartphone or PC. Apple, in many respects, is now a consumer staple stock. New Report: Grow Your Wealth Effortlessly with These Five High-Yield Stocks Think about it. At one time, autos and air travel both could have been considered "tech stocks" – a notion that seems absurd today. (Buffett likes them as well, having stakes in one automaker and four airlines.) Warren Buffett Principle No. 3: Buy Well-Run Companies The actual wording of this Buffett rule says a target company should be "operated by honest and competent people." Apple has a great track record in that regard. Most of the top management team has been on board since the early days of Apple's revival in the late 1990s. It's a very stable, talented group that does its best to carry on in the tradition of its late great visionary, Steve Jobs. Warren Buffett Investing Principle No. 4: Pay a Reasonable Price Apple stock is trading near an all-time high now, but back in October and November when Buffett was buying, AAPL was trading between $106 and $118. Its price/earnings ratio was under 14, well under the Standard & Poor 500 average of just over 20. With sales of the iPhone 6s models disappointing Wall Street, sentiment on AAPL was decidedly negative. Apple stock wasn't going to crash, but last fall it could be had at something of a discount. But here's why we think Warren Buffett decided to back up the truck… Join the conversation.

While the Cupertino giant is currently prepping for the launch of its 10th anniversary iPhones this September, it is also contemplating on signing a deal with China’s biggest LCD manufacturer BOE Technology Group Co. for the displays of its next-generation iPhones slated to launch in 2018 or later.  On Wednesday, Bloomberg learned from unnamed sources that Tim Cook’s company is looking into BOE as it plans for its future iPhones. Apple is even testing the Beijing-based firm’s active-matrix organic light-emitting diode screens while private negotiations are taking place.  Should Apple sign a deal with BOE, it would be the first time that the Cupertino tech giant is outsourcing its iPhone displays from a manufacturer that’s not based in Japan and South Korea. This would also help BOE cement its name in the global scene from being one of China’s leading computer and TV display makers.  In preparation for the possible deal with Apple, BOE is reportedly spending 100 billion yuan or $14.5 billion to build two AMOLED plants in Sichuan. These plants will not only ensure that the company could meet Apple’s demand, but also prepare it for bigger projects in the future.  Bloomberg’s sources said that it’s impossible for BOE to be part of the roster of OLED suppliers for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus at this point. Thus, the Chinese company is hoping to be part of firms that will be supplying displays for what’s next after this year’s iPhones. BOE declined to comment about this new revelation; Apple also refused to confirm the rumored negotiations.  This new information on the next-generation iPhones comes days after Apple and Samsung signed a $4.3 billion deal for the 60 million 5-inch OLED displays the latter is supplying the former. Previously, the two companies sealed the deal for the 100 million 5.5-inch OLED screens Samsung is providing for the upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone, as per Apple Insider.  Apple is expected to keep its usual timetable for its new releases. Hence, it is very likely for the company to introduce its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus successors in the month of September. Previous leaks revealed that Apple is going to name its next flagship “iPhone 8” and it is speculated to cost more than the current models.  Related Articles Apple Planning To Fight ‘Right To Repair’ Bill Facebook To Launch Video Streaming App For Home TVs Apple CEO Tim Cook: Augmented Reality Can Be "A Core Technology" Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next There’s a broken iPhone on eBay right now for $149,999, and here’s why BGR News Drive a rental and earn when you need it, 24/7 UberSponsored Wristband monitors your blood alcohol content while you drink Yahoo Tech If you have an iPhone 7, you got the wrong iPhone BGR News Huge leak reveals iPhone 8 form factor and exactly how Apple will eliminate the home button BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo Finance

It was as a math teacher at the high school, Apple Valley, where he now serves as wrestling coach. His classroom debut in 1982-83 just happened to coincide with the start of the Eagles’ supremacy on the mat. Apple Valley has appeared in every wrestling state tournament as a team during his tenure at the school. That’s right, 34 consecutive trips. For that streak to continue, though,the Eagles must likely prevail against their toughest section challenge to date — Shakopee. The two schools are both ranked nationally and are 1-2 in the state in Class 3A. The Section 2 meet begins at 4 p.m. Friday at Rosemount, with both schools expected to advance to the championship in the evening. “It’s definitely going to be a challenge for us,” Wasmund said. Apple Valley has won 24 Class 2A or Class 3A state championships during its run. The Eagles defeated Shakopee 40-14 for their initial title. They have won 11 consecutive Class 3A championships. “We had a favorable situation because we had a lot of great coaches in the school, but it’s still hard to imagine,” Wasmund said. “I don’t think anybody could have foreseen this happening.” Shakopee edged Apple Valley 29-28 earlier this season in a South Suburban Conference matchup. It was the Eagles’ first setback to a Minnesota team in a dual meet since falling to Wayzata in 2006. “We’ll have a little more incentive,” Wasmund said. “We have to turn some things around. We’re going to have to be almost perfect to beat them. We have very little room for error.” Jim Jackson is in his second season leading Shakopee after coaching at Apple Valley for 17 seasons before stepping aside in 2012. “These are two of the top teams nationally that could be going against each other,” Wasmund said. “People will want to come out and watch this for sure.” Shakopee has four wrestlers ranked No. 1 by The Guillotine while Apple Valley has only one — Gable Steveson (285 pounds). The top-rated Sabers are Aaron Cashman (113 pounds), Carson Manville (126), Brent Jones (132) and Alex Lloyd (152). “They can make a lot of different moves with their lineup. I expect it to be better than the first time we met,” Wasmund said. “We don’t have as many choices.” And for the winner, Wasmund says: “Whoever it is will have a good shot at the state title.” rchaggstrom@startribune.com 612-673-4498 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Minyanville Trade Alert: Why I'm selling some Apple now By Scutify Feb 15, 2017 1:20 pm PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Remember back in late 2015 and early 2016 when the stock markets were crashing, fears were high and Apple was near $100/share? That's when Apple was a relatively "safe" stock to buy and that's exactly what Trading With Cody subscribers and I were doing. Read these Trade Alerts from back then and try to remember how scared you were and how hard it was to actually buy stocks in the midst of all that fear and panic that surrounded you and the stock market. Trade Alert: In search of new names and an Apple round trip December 28, 2015 By Cody Willard Most hedge funds and lots of other money managers and most retail investors have had a down year this year, as small caps and energy and the average stock is down too. Robert Marcin, a good friend, stock mentor and the best value stock picker I've ever known rightly noted this morning that: "The median stock in the more comprehensive universe measured by the Russell 2000 is down 9% ytd. With today its probably closer to 10%. That is rather indicative of the average stock and portfolio, I would bet. 1/3 of the index is down around 20% or more. Just goes to show how difficult a year 2015 has been, especially for small/mid caps." I learned long ago that we can get an edge on our career and on our portfolios by doing the homework that others won't and working when others rest. This week, I'm working and rummaging through all the carnage away in the individual stocks in this market to see if we can find a few nuggets to nibble at. I'm nibbling some Apple common stock this morning, adding back the small tranche I'd sold back when it was near $130 per share earlier in the year. As I wrote at the time: "Not the best of set-ups right now: AAPL - I think it's time to trim a little bit more of my own. The stock's up about 30% in a straight line and the hype around the coming Apple Watch is growing exponentially too. So, discipline over conviction. Following the playbook. Making the hardest trade. I personally am trimming a bit of it today, about 10% of my position." Selling Apple at that point was tough in large part because the chart was straight up and felt like it would go on forever. Buying those shares back with the stock acting like it's in a funk and with fear rising about the stock and the iPhone and the consumer and China and so on. We sold some when others were euphoric, now we buy some back with others are fearful. I don't know if the stock bottoms here or not, but I'd likely buy another tranche if it goes below $100. Trade Alert: Nibbling two names as fear rises January 4, 2016 By Cody Willard Stocks getting hit hard early after a 7% sell-off in China stocks and a broad sell-off throughout Europe and Asia. Any fear out there? With the DJIA down -400 and the trading year not even 0.001% over, I think it's a great time to do our poll. Who's more scared right now, the bulls or the bears? I think the answer will likely be rather unanimous right now that it's the bulls. And that is likely a good indication that we should be trying to take advantage of others' fear and buy into the panicky sell-off here this morning. We don't have to be heroes, we don't have to draw a line in the sand. But we have been following our playbook of buying weakness and fear; selling euphoria and all-time highs; taking profits and cutting losses; reducing the total number of positions and overall long exposure when stock markets were at all-time highs; etc. This is one of the steps we take on our marathon race of maximizing our upside and minimizing risk for our portfolios over the next 10,000 or so days of our lives. So I'm going to go ahead and put some money to work this morning, nibbling on some of our existing portfolio names and in most cases buying back some of the stock we had trimmed at higher levels. I'm nibbling another 1/10th-sized smallish tranche here in Apple at around $103, a second recent tranche adding to the shares I'd nibbled on last week and the much larger core position I've owned for many years. Trade Alert: AAPL options and reviewing the playbook January 6, 2016 By Cody Willard Well, many stocks, including (especially?) technology stocks have been smashed in the last few days. Let's look at some charts for some perspective. Looking back over the last, say, three months, you can see that some of our biggest long positions have been up nicely, while I've also unfortunately ridden some losers lower: Let's review our playbook. We seek to own companies with very strong balance sheets that are revolutionizing and/or outright creating their industries. We try to buy those companies cheaply/early like we did with Apple in 2003, Google on its IPO, FB near $20 after its crashed IPO, First Solar after letting it crash in the alternative energy bubble pop, and hold onto them for many years. We start small and slowly in each position, recognizing that there will be many ups and downs in each stock in the years ahead. Since we believe in these companies ability to grow as they revolutionize their industries over many years, we scale into our long positions when the stocks are getting hit and we trim them when stocks rally hard. We get aggressively long after stock markets crash and we whittle down our long exposure when markets bubble. Long-term subscribers know that we've trimmed our remaining longs, and outright reduced the total number of longs in the portfolio and added shorts in the last few months. All that said, I don't think we've seen the last of this Bubble Blowing Bull Market. I am planning on adding couple new names to the portfolio in the next day or two as there are some opportunities to buy some very good companies with great balance sheets at big discounts to their recent highs. In the meantime, today, I'm going to go ahead and make two buys today, increasing my net long exposure a little bit more into this sell-off. First, I'm going to nibble on some Apple call options here. I'm buying a small batch of AAPL call options that expire in March with strike prices around $105 for about $3.50 each. These options, along with my existing long-term core position in Apple common stock when I'd bought more of last week, will essentially make Apple my largest position once again, as it has been many times in years past. Okay, Cody back in real-time here February 15, 2017. I think it's time to trim a little bit of my Apple common stock, in large part because I had increased my exposure to it so much back when it was down and we had the chance and I still have some of the Apple shares from those call options. Meanwhile, over the last couple months, the stock's up about 40% in a straight line and the hype around the coming Apple iPhone 8 is growing exponentially too. So, discipline over conviction. Following the playbook. Making the hardest trade. I personally am trimming a bit of it today, about 10% of my position. Sound familiar? This article was written by Cody Willard for on .

Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Feb 16, 2017 at 6:20PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently said some 4 million locations, or about 35% of all retail stores in the U.S., accept its Apple Pay mobile payment option. Although there are some notable exceptions among the largest retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Target, who don't offer it, others like Gap do, or soon will feature the payment solution. Because it's available on mobile phones, tablets, and even the Apple Watch, its ubiquity and relative ease of use make it the go-to choice for consumers on the go as well as those dissatisfied with the hassle and delays of embedded chip cards. According to data analytics firm TXN Solutions, which surveyed the transactions from over 3 million payment cards, Apple Pay usage has soared by 50% over the past year. Image source: Apple. The rise of Apple Pay Indeed, during Apple's first-quarter earnings conference call with analysts last month, CEO Tim Cook said transaction volume had risen sixfold from the prior year as Apple Pay expanded into four new countries, including Japan, Russia, New Zealand, and Spain. While that would seem to clash somewhat with TXN's more muted (though still significant) rise, it comes down to a difference in what's being measured. While Apple isn't particularly forthcoming on details of the Apple Pay ecosystem, it is talking about the actual number of transactions made, while the data analytics firm is referencing the percentage of transactions from its panel of consumers who provide their credit and debit card data and whose banks distinguish Apple Pay transactions. While that naturally limits the universe of transactions captured, over time it still tracks the acceptance of the mobile payment option and its growth, and what it found was that most people were using it in mobile apps and on websites. A place to crash for the night That surprising conclusion was reached after finding that of all the places Apple Pay users were using the payment option, getting a cheap hotel room at the last minute topped the list. Ordering takeout was apparently the second favorite way to use the service.  Image source: HotelTonight. The TXN data, which examined payments made between December 2015 and December 2016, found mobile travel app HotelTonight, a last-minute reservation service, had 3.4% of all its credit cards transactions made with Apple Pay, followed by food delivery services Caviar, Postmates, and DoorDash, which all had around 2.5% usage rates or slightly higher.  What is more notable about the survey results is that despite the broad proliferation of places accepting Apple Pay as an option, it really hasn't caught on among brick-and-mortar retailers, where most places saw it represent less than 1% of all credit card transactions. And ultimately, regardless of where it is used, it isn't creating much of a stir in the payments industry, as it represents just a small percentage of total credit card transactions.   But let's first cross off the names of stores where people aren't using Apple Pay. Starbucks' mobile ordering trumps Apple pay At the bottom of the list is Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which came in last on a list of the 13 top places processing Apple Pay transactions, accounting for about 0.5% of the coffee shop's total credit card transactions. Considering Starbucks has its own highly regarded mobile ordering and payment option, which is often looked at as the gold standard for convenience and ease of use, it raises eyebrows that people are using Apple Pay there at all. On its first-quarter earnings conference call with analysts two weeks ago, Starbucks President Kevin Johnson said, "Mobile Order & Pay had a banner quarter, representing more than 7% of total transactions, double the figure from Q1 last year, and we now have nearly 1,200 stores with 20% or more Mobile Order & Pay transactions at peak, compared to only 13 stores one year ago." When you have customer loyalty like that, who needs Apple Pay? Image source: Starbucks. Food retailers still represent the lion's share of places seeing Apple Pay usage, and Lowes Foods, Sprouts Farmers Markets, Panera Bread, and Schnucks round out the bottom five places for users of the mobile wallet, with around 0.6% of their credit card transactions accounted for using the payment method. A prescription for future growth? So, if Starbucks and trendy grocery stores were bringing up the rear, who was it that was leading the brick-and-mortar pack? Would you believe Duane Reade, the New York metropolitan area drugstore chain owned by Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA)? According to the TXN data, the pharmacy operator was the top spot where people used Apple Pay, with 1.8% of the credit card transactions identifying the mobile payment option being chosen. That put it slightly ahead of No. 2 retailer Whole Foods Market (Nasdaq: WFM), which had about 1.7% of its credit card transactions using Apple Pay. Because both retailers have been with the service since Apple launched Apple Pay in 2014, it might not be so surprising they were well ahead of the others, including Canteen Vending at No. 3 with slightly less than 1% of its transactions, and fourth place Peet's Coffee with just under 0.8%. Whether that means Apple Pay will ever supplant EMV cards as a preferred payment option remains to be seen, but it seems hard to believe it will replace Starbucks' mobile order and pay app anytime soon. And though Apple Pay users seem to be a rare breed indeed, maybe all you need to see them in action is to simply stop by your local pharmacy.

Credit: Ben Patterson Related Top Apple stories of 2016 WWDC 2016: What Apple plans to announce Cool Yule Tools 2016: Digital disruption at Santa's Workshop Video 5 Weirdest iOS Keyboards With so many rumors surrounding the iPhone 8, it's been easy to lose sight of the fact that we're just a few short months away from seeing the next-generation version of iOS, the mobile OS that powers Apple's iconic smartphones. Earlier today, Apple announced that WWDC 2017 will be held from June 5-9 at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California. The annual developer's conference is where Apple will take the wraps off of iOS 11 while also showing us what the future of macOS, tvOS and watchOS will look like. "Each year during WWDC," Apple's press release reads, "millions of talented developers around the world learn about Apple's breakthrough platform technologies ranging from programming languages like Swift to breakthrough developer APIs like SiriKit, HomeKit, HealthKit and CarPlay. These Apple technologies inspire developers to continue creating incredible experiences for every aspect of customers’ lives and improve the way they manage their smart homes, cars, health and more for over one billion active Apple devices." While we haven't heard too many rumors regarding what type of new features iOS 11 will bring to the table, but it stands to reason Apple will have a quite a number of exciting new features to show off in just a few short months. Notably, WWDC this year is moving from San Francisco to San Jose, a move that Apple executive Phil Schiller touched on briefly during an interview with The Loop. Schiller said that downtown San Jose is going to provide a great environment for developers attending the conference. Of course, San Jose has the added benefit of being close to Apple’s Cupertino headquarters, which should make logistics much easier for the company, especially when it comes to getting engineers on site. According to Schiller, WWDC 2017 will be about the same size as previous conferences—about 5,000 developers and 1,000 engineers. The cost of tickets to the conference will also remain the same, he said. Join the Network World communities on Facebook and LinkedIn to comment on topics that are top of mind.

After years of practically being neglected, the Cupertino-based giant’s all-in-one desktop series needs a significant update to remain competitive, especially with the emergence of powerful rivals such as the Surface Studio. If rumors are any indication, however, it appears that 2017 is finally going to be the year when Apple makes the iMac relevant again. Rumors about the 2017 iMac have been emerging from the rumor mill for a while now, with numerous speculations pointing to the rollout of a powerful all-in-one desktop that is capable of providing the market’s most formidable players with ample competition. With the release of the iMac 2017, Apple appears to be aiming for dominance in the desktop stage as well. [Image by Pixabay] The release date of the device itself has not been announced by Apple, but rumors are high that the all-in-one would be unveiled sometime during Spring 2017. A PC Advisor report has stated that the 2017 iMac would most likely be released around March 2017. This would allow Apple to enter the market just as Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors are being rolled out. After all, Intel has just announced the chips’ S-series desktop processors back in January. The chips in the iMac 2017 are all but confirmed to be Intel’s Kaby Lake processors. The powerful chips have long been rumored for Apple’s all-in-one, especially after a very prolific gaffe from Best Buy back in October last year listed a Kaby Lake Core i7 iMac with Retina 5K display, 32GB of RAM, and a 2TB Fusion Drive. While the Best Buy ad might simply be an innocent mistake on the part of the U.S. retailer, the specs in the listing do line up with the most persistent rumors about the device. Considering that the iMac 2017 is set to be Apple’s flagship device in the all-in-one market, there is a good chance that the Cupertino-based tech giant would be equipping its iconic desktop computer with the best internals currently available in the market. A MacWorld report has stated that expectations are high for the iMac 2017 to be equipped with high-end chips, such as Intel’s 7th-generation Core i7-7700K processor. [Image by Pixabay] The Core i7-7700K chip is pretty special, mainly due to the processor’s ability to overclock. Under normal use, the powerful chip is capable of running at 4.2GHz, but once overclocked, the i7-7700K is capable of performing at an astounding 4.8GHz. Such speed would definitely make the iMac 2017 more than capable of running any heavy applications that users could throw at it. If any, the Kaby Lake processor would definitely make the iMac 2017 more robust than the Surface Studio, which still runs with a Skylake Core i7-6820HQ chip. With the iMac 2017 most likely packing a formidable processor, the all-in-one would practically be approaching Mac Pro performance levels. With rumors about a successor to the Mac Pro being very scarce, speculations are now high that Apple might very well retire the Mac Pro desktop unit and simply release a top-tier iMac Pro. Considering that listing that was mistakenly released by Best Buy last year, these speculations are not that far-fetched. After all, a Kaby Lake Core i7 all-in-one with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive definitely places the iMac 2017 up there with the best in the desktop business. Apple has not really been focusing on its desktop and laptop business during the last few years, with the Cupertino-based tech giant gearing their efforts more on the mobile business. In a lot of ways, the tech giant’s gambit has paid off, with the iPhone and the iPad being the most iconic devices in their respective categories. If the release of the redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro is any indication, however, it appears that Apple is once more exploring the other areas of its computing business. With the release of the iMac 2017, the Cupertino-based tech giant might very well be one of the most dominant players in the desktop market this year.

The OLED strip has replaced the function keys and it even brought with it more options and functions for first-party apps and a couple of third-party apps as well. What it did not come with is support for Microsoft Office. The Redmond giant is changing that this week.  On Thursday, Microsoft started rolling out an update to its Microsoft Office for Macs. The update comes with the anticipated Touch Bar integrations for Word, Excel and PowerPoint. This means, users of the 2016 MacBook Pro can henceforth have quick access to the different functions of the Microsoft Office software straight from the dynamic display panel, as reported by Apple Insider.  The integration is expected to be helpful to Microsoft Word users thanks to the new Word Focus mode. This basically removes the onscreen ribbons and commands from the Word interface. The Formatting tools are then shown on the OLED strip. Such new setup would allow users to focus on the work they are typing on the screen. Related Stories Apple Reportedly Working On Designing Its Own Processors For MacBooks MacBook Pro With Touch Bar Banned From Bar Exam You Now Have A Green Light From Consumer Reports To Buy New MacBook Pro For Microsoft Excel users, on the other hand, this integration would mean faster outputs. The Touch Bar will display the different formulas they can choose from, making it a lot easier and faster to generate results of computations and whatnot. Aside from the formulas, the different types of charts will also be shown on the secondary screen. TechCrunch also noted that Formatting tools for cell color, borders and others will also be featured on the smaller display.  As for PowerPoint users, creating presentations will become a breeze because the Touch Bar will now show all of the slide layers and the individual elements of the document. When the document is in Slideshow View, the MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar will display thumbnails for each slide, a timer to keep track of the speed of the presentation and the different controls of the software.  Microsoft also included Touch Bar integration for Outlook in the new update. Thus, the commonly used commands of Outlook will be shown on the Touch Bar. Moreover, a user composing an email can easily attach documents with just a tap on the OLED strip because a list of recent documents will be shown there. According to MacRumors, Microsoft announced Touch Bar support for Microsoft Office during Apple’s keynote event for the new MacBooks in October 2016. Back then, the Redmond giant promised that Touch Bar integration for Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook will come to Mac users soon. That time has finally arrived this week. The arrival of Touch Bar support for the different Microsoft software comes a week after beta testers got a taste of how this integration would look and feel like.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Kuo’s report, however, claimed that Apple would replace it with some sort of new biometric recognition. Are you willing to give up Touch ID for new biometric tech and a function area on iPhone 8? At this point, it’s not explicitly clear as to what biometric features the iPhone 8 might adopt. One earlier report, that Kuo corroborates, claimed that Apple was working to include a new front-facing sensor that would allow for facial recognition. That report explained that the device would feature “some form of facial/gesture recognition supported by a new laser sensor and an infrared sensor mounted near the front-facing camera.” Eye recognition has also been a rumored feature for the iPhone, though the timeline on this one is bit more hazy. A report last summer suggested that Apple had been working on eye scanning technology since as early as 2014, but that it wouldn’t be ready for a public launch until 2018. Furthermore, yesterday’s report wasn’t the first time we’ve heard from KGI that Apple was preparing to ditch Touch ID. Last month, the analyst predicted that was developing new biometric sensors to replace Touch ID technology, including facial recognition, to execute its vision for a zero-bezel iPhone. One possibility, if not a likely outcome, is that Touch ID will move towards a new optical fingerprint sensor that is embedded the display. This was thought to be the case all along, but a Kuo’s most recent report makes no mention of it and goes as far as to mention the “elimination of fingerprint recognition.” Personally, I have a hard time believing that Apple is already shifting away from Touch ID, but nevertheless, it seems like a possibility. If it does happen, it’s likely a tradeoff for a bezel-free design and a the new “function area.” The function area will likely be virtual software buttons that will ideally be some sort of contextually-aware. If Apple does get rid of Touch ID completely, would it be a worthy trade-off for a function area and other biometric technologies? Take the poll below and let us know in the comments.

Earlier this month, Apple poached the chief of Amazon's Fire TV unit to run its television operations. Timothy D. Twerdhal brings hardware and content experience to his new gig, and his hiring suggests a renewed focus on the Apple TV set-top box. Twerdhal's arrival comes as the company tests a new, fifth-generation Apple TV that it may release as soon as this year. Internally codenamed "J105," the new box will be capable of streaming ultra-high-definition 4K and more vivid colors, according to people familiar with the plans. The features will probably boost Apple TV sales as consumers increasingly upgrade to 4K television sets, but those enhancements alone probably aren't enough to turn the gadget into a groundbreaking, iPhone-caliber product. Time and again, the people say, Apple engineers have been forced to compromise on Apple's vision of revolutionizing the living room. Early on, the Apple TV was going to replace the clunky set-top boxes from the cable companies and stream live television. It never happened. The team debated bundling a gaming controller with the current model to better compete with Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox and Sony Corp.'s PlayStation. That didn't happen either. Originally, viewers were going to be able to shout commands from the couch to the Apple TV. Instead they must talk to the remote control. Apple has essentially settled for turning the television set into a giant iPhone: a cluster of apps with a store. "That's not what I signed up for," says one of the people, who requested anonymity to talk freely about internal company matters. "I signed up for revolutionary. We got evolutionary." Gene Munster, who covered Apple for more than a decade as a Piper Jaffray analyst and now runs Loup Ventures, echoes the criticism. "Apple TV begs the question: Why does Apple do hobbies?" he says. "Either do it right or don't do it at all."

See more videos Apple doesn't disclose how many Apple TVs it sells, but Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri acknowledged in a recent interview that sales decreased year-over-year from the 2015 holiday season to this past 2016 holiday period. The research firm eMarketer says the fourth-generation Apple TV has steadily lost market share since its release in the fall of 2015; in January just 11.9 percent of connected television customers were using it, the research firm says, down from 12.5 percent in September. In part, the slide reflects competition from Amazon and Roku, whose boxes do the same and more for less money. While the Apple TV itself isn't critical to Apple's bottom line, it's central to the company's services business because increasingly the living room is where consumers buy, rent and consume media. Services represented almost $25 billion in revenue for Apple in the last fiscal year, making it the company's second biggest category after the iPhone. Apple declined to comment or make Twerdhal available for an interview. The Apple TV's history is a study in gradualism. Previewed by Steve Jobs in 2006, the first box was designed simply to stream iTunes video from a Mac to a TV set. The next version, launched in the fall of 2010, let users stream content from the internet. The latest box was announced in September 2015, a few months later than originally scheduled. Widely considered an improvement by consumers and product reviewers, the Apple TV features the App Store, voice control and a glass remote that enables motion-controlled gaming, which for example lets players use the remote like a steering wheel for a car-racing title. But the latest Apple TV sells for $149, more than twice as much as its predecessor, $60 more than Amazon's Fire TV and $20 more than the priciest Roku. What's more, little about the viewing experience has changed. Apple TV users still have to buy an individual episode via the iTunes Store, pay extra for services like Hulu, or download an app tied to a particular channel and log in with an existing cable subscription. The current model was originally supposed to replace the cable box altogether. Early prototypes had connectors for a coaxial port, which sends the live cable TV signal to televisions. Under this plan, Apple was to control the interface, collect fees from viewers and then share most of the revenue with the cable and media companies. A new TV app was to be the main interface for accessing live shows and sports. But when the app was finally launched in December, it merely let viewers access their iTunes video library and the iTunes Store, functions that already existed on the Apple TV. The key new element is a "Watch Now" panel, a Netflix-style repository of favorite movies or shows and recommendations for new ones. Some Apple engineers now regret not making it possible to tailor the opening screen to viewer preferences - classic movies for the family film buff, say, or food shows for the budding teenage chef. The idea never made it onto the engineering roadmap, and adding it now would require a lot of resources. Apple had a backup plan if it wasn't able to replace the existing cable box - the much-ballyhooed "skinny bundle," a stripped down web service that would let viewers choose channels rather than paying for ones they don't watch. Apple proposed bundling the four main broadcast networks and a handful of cable channels as well as on-demand TV shows and movies for $30 to $40 a month. The media companies were willing to engage with Apple due to concerns about the rise of online services like Netflix and the cord-cutting phenomenon. But the two sides stumbled over cost, the composition of the bundles and negotiating tactics. The media companies blamed Apple's arrogance; Apple blamed the media companies' inflexibility. In the end, the talks fell apart, leaving Apple to tout stripped-down bundles from Sony PlayStation and DirecTV. After the negotiations foundered, Apple's hardware team ditched the coaxial port. The Apple TV's software is also less ambitious than originally envisioned. The current model features an iPhone-like app grid, but designers had prototyped more novel interfaces. One idea, dubbed "Intentions" internally, put the four tabs in the center of the screen: three for the Apple TV's main content types (video, music, and gaming) and one for everything else. Another idea: letting viewers pull up previews of content by hovering on each icon (a feature currently reserved for only a few of Apple's bundled apps). To a certain extent, the Apple TV is handcuffed by its parent's addiction to fat margins. Apple is constitutionally allergic to losing money on a product - even if it can make up the difference by selling content. Some engineers initially believed the current set-top box should be capable of streaming 4K video, which offers about twice the resolution as the previous generation of high-definition TV. But 4K requires a faster processor, which would have pushed up manufacturing costs. That would have forced Apple to accept a lower margin or charge more than the market would bear. Apple settled for a lesser chip that debuted back in 2014 - and no 4K. Likewise, not bundling a gaming controller was partially a cost-driven decision. The arrival of Twerdhal, the former Amazon Fire TV chief, will free up his predecessor, Pete Distad, to try and hammer out content deals and potentially revive the skinny bundle. Distad joined Apple in 2013 after serving as a senior vice president of content distribution at video streaming service Hulu. For his part, Twerdhal worked at Netflix and Roku, before joining Amazon. "The Amazon hire shows Apple is mixing things up, looking to make improvements,'" Munster says. "I think they realize it is drifting sideways at this point." Unless the company fixes the Apple TV, he says, it risks "losing the living room." Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Orlando Sentinel Apple Inc.

While you won't see Apple discounting its flagship laptop anytime soon, Amazon has no qualms about it and just shaved $100 off the retail price of Apple's laptop, bringing it down to $1,699. This laptop's main feature is the new multi-touch display that sits above the keyboard and replaces the traditional function row. By default, the Touch Bar shows traditional buttons like volume and screen brightness controls, but the buttons change based on the app you're using. We found the Touch Bar to be both fun and time-saving. However, the Touch Bar isn't the only ace up this laptop's sleeve. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro is also lighter and more compact than its predecessor. The screen's color gamut also trumps the screen on the XPS 13, Spectre x360, and Lenovo Yoga 910 - all of which compete heavily against the MacBook Pro. In terms of hardware, the laptop packs a 13.3-inch 2560 x 1600 resolution display, 2.9GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. It's worth noting that the laptop packs four Thunderbolt 3 ports, but has no USB Type-A ports. That means you'll need to buy dongles and adapters to get your peripherals to play nice with your laptop. (While Apple lowered the price of its dongles, various retailers like Amazon sell even cheaper dongles you can use). If you like the idea of having dynamic and contextually relevant buttons that have the potential to speed up your workflow, this Mac is for you. Especially now that Amazon offers it for $100 less than everyone else.

People have been eagerly awaiting a breakthrough in voice-controlled smart homes since – well, perhaps since Captain Jean-Luc Picard first settled back in his quarters on Star Trek: The Next Generation and issued the command for “Earl Grey, hot!” to the Starship Enterprise computer. Nearly 30 years later, smart home technology appears to be on the verge of that voice-control breakthrough, as major players including Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft compete to establish dominance in the space. Why now? Credit the Internet of Things, which has emerged as a solid technology foundation for a truly interconnected ecosystem of electronic devices in the smart home. In this ecosystem, voice provides the intuitive interface for easily controlling communications with – and among – all those devices. Whether it’s Amazon Echo, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana or the Siri-equipped Apple HomeKit, voice control is central to the smart home ecosystems that top technology companies aim to build. Before voice, people controlled electronic devices in nascent smart home systems with applications – an app to control the thermostat, another to run the ceiling fan and so on. It’s an approach whose limitations become increasingly obvious as the number of devices grows. Voice transcends the limitations of application-based control. It provides a common point of access to a potentially infinite number of devices, which can then communicate with each other across the Internet of Things. (It’s also gaining ground overall as a technology interface, with Google reporting in February 2016 that voice searches had doubled over the preceding 12 months.) Today, it’s not at all beyond the realm of possibility to imagine waking up in the morning and saying “Okay, I’m up” instead of having to fumble for your phone to silence the alarm, then asking “what’s the weather like?” instead of having to interact with a weather app, then heading to the kitchen – where the coffeemaker has automatically started a brewing cycle because it’s learned over time that’s the point at which you like your first cup of coffee. Or imagine realizing when you get to work one day that you forgot to thaw some chicken for dinner. Your spouse isn’t reachable, but plans on being home by noon. So you can just use your phone to send a voice command to a smart home device: “Ask Pat to put the chicken in the fridge to thaw.” The smart home device will detect Pat’s arrival and pass on the message. The question for companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft is which one will be first to command the ecosystem of devices that make up the voice-controlled smart home – and thereby dominate the space. Each company has its own unique voice capability, so the answer lies in part in who makes it easiest for device manufacturers to become part of their ecosystem – by means of open APIs or other technology for interconnectivity, for example. On the other side of the equation are the device manufacturers themselves, who understandably have little or no expertise in voice technology, which can be specialized and complex. Designers often need help designing the voice control element for devices that reside in a smart home. When these devices are attached to private home networks, they also need help enabling more advanced security features. Bridging the gap between the major players (with their sophisticated voice systems) and the manufacturers (with their limited voice experience) falls to another set of actors in the smart home scenario: semiconductor manufacturers. These companies are the ones that make the processors to enable the integration of complex voice and audio functionality in devices for smart homes. With more than 120 million voice-enabled devices projected to ship in 2021, we’ve got our work cut out for us. Inevitably, you can expect that every major technology player in the smart home space is going to find its footing there. The real issue is which one is going to find it first and seize the market advantage. There may be no way to know now who that’s going to be, but it’s clear what it’s going to take: an infrastructure that’s easy to join, device manufacturers who are eager to join it and processor companies, such as NXP Semiconductors, that can help make it happen.  -- Martyn Humphries is vice president of consumer and industrial application processors at NXP Semiconductors.

Analyst Hints At Advanced Facial Recognition Technology By Corazon Victorino On 02/16/17 AT 8:24 PM Close Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone is still shrouded in mystery despite the numerous reports and leaks that are circulating the web. If a new report is to be believed, the iPhone 8 could boast of major innovation in terms of biometrics. While the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus relied on the fingerprint scanner for its biometrics security, the new smartphone from the Cupertino giant is now rumored to come with an advanced 3D laser scanner.  MacRumors reported Thursday citing JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall that the star of the show at Apple’s September launch  event for the iPhones could sport a front-facing 3D laser scanner. This new technology will primarily be used for facial recognition to ensure top-of-the-line security. Obviously, the inclusion of such an advanced feature would have repercussions, and one of them is the possible death of Touch ID.  For iPhone users, Apple’s Touch ID is the first line of defense against hackers. The technology relied on fingerprint authentication to unlock the more recent iPhones and even carry out processes involving mobile payments and iTunes purchases. With the arrival of this 3D laser scanner however, there will be no more room for Touch ID to flaunt its functionality.  Related Stories This Is Why Your iPhone Turns Off When It's Cold Out Apple iPhone 8 To Face Tough Android Competitors This Year Apple Patent Confirms Display-Embedded Fingerprint Scanner The removal of Touch ID also makes sense because Apple is gearing for the launch of a new iPhone that does not have the iconic Home button. Previous reports may have claimed that the Cupertino giant was testing a different kind of mechanism for its fingerprint scanner — something that would place the scanner just below the edge-to-edge display. However, it appears Apple could be going for a different direction that does not include the fingerprint scanner at all.  Hall said the 3D laser scanner will be more secure than Touch ID, and it could be more useful as well. Phone Arena pointed out that the new facial recognition technology would eliminate the frustration of iPhone users who have experienced the struggle of unlocking their device under wet circumstances. Furthermore, the phone-centric news site stated how the 3D scanner could open the doors for more advanced augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)  endeavors in the future.  While its possible that Apple could expand the use of the 3D scanner in future projects, the technology will only debut with one primary purpose at launch: unlocking the iPhone via facial recognition. It would still take time for Apple to provide support for mobile payments. And by the time it does, that would only be the start of its venture to other applications of the new feature. Hall said Samsung’s biggest rival could even expand the scanning technology to other practical uses, like determining shoe sizes and facilitating online shopping.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

There’s an iPhone on eBay right now that will most certainly help you achieve that. It’s an iPhone 4s, the glass on both its front and back are completely shattered, but — and this is apparently the thing that makes it worth its $149,999 asking price — the back panel has been replaced with a totally unlicensed one honoring the late Steve Jobs. The seller insists that any potential buyers “do research before purchase,” so let’s take their advice and figure out what in the hell is going on here. Don't Miss: Huge leak reveals iPhone 8 form factor and exactly how Apple will eliminate the home button The seller’s description sheds very little light on why they believe this particular shattered iPhone is worth as much as a high-end sports car, but it’s clear it all comes back to that fancy Steve Jobs tribute on the back. The seller boldly claims that the phone is “1 of only 56 phones made to honor the late Steve Jobs.” The back panel of the iPhone reads “Steve Jobs 1955 – 2011” and replaces the official Apple logo with a version using Jobs’ likeness as the cutout. That particular logo was designed by Jonathan Mak, a design student in Hong Kong who created it shortly after Jobs’ death as a tribute to the tech guru. It quickly went viral and was ripped off for all kinds of unlicensed accessories, from phone cases to posters. The modified logo was also used by a company called Goldgenie, which has become fairly well known for producing absurdly expensive versions of the iPhone, Apple Watch, and other Apple devices. The company modifies them by adding lots of gold and sometimes gems, and often replaces parts of Apple’s devices with gold plated versions. After Jobs passed away in 2011, Goldgenie decided to roll out a special edition iPhone 4s paying tribute to him. The phone had its rear panel replaced with a gold version using Mak’s logo, and Goldgenie made only — wait for it — 56 of them. Unfortunately for the eBay seller in question, the phone in the listing is not one of these cherished tributes. Okay, so if it’s not one of these limited edition phones, how did it end up with the Steve Jobs treatment? Like I said above, that altered logo made it to all corners of the grey market, and one iPhone replacement parts maker decided to use it to create replacement panels for the iPhone 4s. Read More You could buy them (on eBay, ironically) for about $10 to $15, and countless were sold in the months following Jobs’ death. What the seller is trying to claim is an extremely limited edition, gold-plated tribute iPhone is really just a busted iPhone 4s with a busted $10 grey market replacement panel on the back. Try not to sprain your wrist as you pull your credit card out at mach speed.

Problem Solving | 16 Feb 2017 | Print  | Comment (1) Fixing (and Explaining) PDFpen 8.3.1’s Crash on Launch by Adam C. Engst I was surprised today when I launched PDFpenPro 8.3.1 to work on a PDF and it crashed instantly, well before the app had a chance to load. PDFpenPro blew out on my MacBook Air as well, which struck me as odd — both it and my iMac had been running macOS 10.12.3 Sierra for some time, and the app had worked correctly on both Macs recently. Luckily, my first guess at a solution worked: all I did was download the new PDFpenPro 8.3.2 manually. Replacing the old version with the new one restored PDFpenPro to full working order. Shortly afterward, all PDFpen and PDFpenPro users received email from Smile that apologized for the inconvenience, explained the problem briefly, and gave the same solution. For more details, I contacted Smile’s Greg Scown, whose expansion of the email’s explanation shows just how involved the modern Apple development world has become. Greg said that the reason PDFpen crashed — even before it actually launched — was because Smile’s developer signing certificate from Apple had expired. Code signing is a way of assuring users that an app comes from a known source and hasn’t been modified since it was last signed — it’s a way to prevent bad guys from attaching malware to legitimate apps. In the past, the expiration of a code signing certificate had no effect on already shipped software. PDFpen 6.3.2, which Smile still makes available for customers using OS X 10.7 Lion, 10.8 Mountain Lion, and 10.9 Mavericks, is signed with a certificate that expired long ago, and it has no trouble launching. What’s new with PDFpen 8 is that, in addition to being code signed, it has a provisioning profile, which is essentially a permission slip from Apple that’s checked against an online database in order to allow the app to perform certain actions, called entitlements. For PDFpen, the entitlement that’s being granted is the capability to access iCloud despite being sold directly, rather than through the Mac App Store, a feature that wasn’t possible until about a year ago. Since PDFpen’s provisioning profile is also signed using Smile’s code signing certificate, the expiration of the certificate rendered the provisioning profile invalid. An app called taskgated-helper determines this even before PDFpen’s code runs, so there’s no way for Smile to detect the error condition and present an error to the user. Since the developer’s code never runs, macOS should recognize what’s going on and display an error message that encourages users to contact the developer. The problem appears to be unique to apps that have provisioning profiles and are sold outside the Mac App Store. Since Smile’s certificate was good for only a year, it’s likely that other direct-purchase apps with iCloud entitlements will run into this problem soon too. As with PDFpen, downloading a new version with a current certificate should resolve the issue. Apple renewed Smile’s code signing certificate for five years, so if other developers receive a similarly long renewal, that will allow Apple to put off solving the problem within macOS. Note that Mac App Store apps should be immune from this sort of problem since they’re signed by Apple when distributed instead of the developer. If Apple failed to keep its certificates current, vast numbers of Mac App Store apps would crash, so Apple needs to stay on top of renewing its certificates. Back in 2015, Apple did, in fact, have a certificate renewal that caused numerous Mac App Store apps to fail to launch, reporting that they were “damaged.” That problem was a little different, but it shows that even Apple doesn’t necessary anticipate how everything fits together.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Feb 16, 2017 at 6:20PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently said some 4 million locations, or about 35% of all retail stores in the U.S., accept its Apple Pay mobile payment option. Although there are some notable exceptions among the largest retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Target, who don't offer it, others like Gap do, or soon will feature the payment solution. Because it's available on mobile phones, tablets, and even the Apple Watch, its ubiquity and relative ease of use make it the go-to choice for consumers on the go as well as those dissatisfied with the hassle and delays of embedded chip cards. According to data analytics firm TXN Solutions, which surveyed the transactions from over 3 million payment cards, Apple Pay usage has soared by 50% over the past year. Image source: Apple. The rise of Apple Pay Indeed, during Apple's first-quarter earnings conference call with analysts last month, CEO Tim Cook said transaction volume had risen sixfold from the prior year as Apple Pay expanded into four new countries, including Japan, Russia, New Zealand, and Spain. While that would seem to clash somewhat with TXN's more muted (though still significant) rise, it comes down to a difference in what's being measured. While Apple isn't particularly forthcoming on details of the Apple Pay ecosystem, it is talking about the actual number of transactions made, while the data analytics firm is referencing the percentage of transactions from its panel of consumers who provide their credit and debit card data and whose banks distinguish Apple Pay transactions. While that naturally limits the universe of transactions captured, over time it still tracks the acceptance of the mobile payment option and its growth, and what it found was that most people were using it in mobile apps and on websites. A place to crash for the night That surprising conclusion was reached after finding that of all the places Apple Pay users were using the payment option, getting a cheap hotel room at the last minute topped the list. Ordering takeout was apparently the second favorite way to use the service.  Image source: HotelTonight. The TXN data, which examined payments made between December 2015 and December 2016, found mobile travel app HotelTonight, a last-minute reservation service, had 3.4% of all its credit cards transactions made with Apple Pay, followed by food delivery services Caviar, Postmates, and DoorDash, which all had around 2.5% usage rates or slightly higher.  What is more notable about the survey results is that despite the broad proliferation of places accepting Apple Pay as an option, it really hasn't caught on among brick-and-mortar retailers, where most places saw it represent less than 1% of all credit card transactions. And ultimately, regardless of where it is used, it isn't creating much of a stir in the payments industry, as it represents just a small percentage of total credit card transactions.   But let's first cross off the names of stores where people aren't using Apple Pay. Starbucks' mobile ordering trumps Apple pay At the bottom of the list is Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which came in last on a list of the 13 top places processing Apple Pay transactions, accounting for about 0.5% of the coffee shop's total credit card transactions. Considering Starbucks has its own highly regarded mobile ordering and payment option, which is often looked at as the gold standard for convenience and ease of use, it raises eyebrows that people are using Apple Pay there at all. On its first-quarter earnings conference call with analysts two weeks ago, Starbucks President Kevin Johnson said, "Mobile Order & Pay had a banner quarter, representing more than 7% of total transactions, double the figure from Q1 last year, and we now have nearly 1,200 stores with 20% or more Mobile Order & Pay transactions at peak, compared to only 13 stores one year ago." When you have customer loyalty like that, who needs Apple Pay? Image source: Starbucks. Food retailers still represent the lion's share of places seeing Apple Pay usage, and Lowes Foods, Sprouts Farmers Markets, Panera Bread, and Schnucks round out the bottom five places for users of the mobile wallet, with around 0.6% of their credit card transactions accounted for using the payment method. A prescription for future growth? So, if Starbucks and trendy grocery stores were bringing up the rear, who was it that was leading the brick-and-mortar pack? Would you believe Duane Reade, the New York metropolitan area drugstore chain owned by Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA)? According to the TXN data, the pharmacy operator was the top spot where people used Apple Pay, with 1.8% of the credit card transactions identifying the mobile payment option being chosen. That put it slightly ahead of No. 2 retailer Whole Foods Market (Nasdaq: WFM), which had about 1.7% of its credit card transactions using Apple Pay. Because both retailers have been with the service since Apple launched Apple Pay in 2014, it might not be so surprising they were well ahead of the others, including Canteen Vending at No. 3 with slightly less than 1% of its transactions, and fourth place Peet's Coffee with just under 0.8%. Whether that means Apple Pay will ever supplant EMV cards as a preferred payment option remains to be seen, but it seems hard to believe it will replace Starbucks' mobile order and pay app anytime soon. And though Apple Pay users seem to be a rare breed indeed, maybe all you need to see them in action is to simply stop by your local pharmacy.

Interestingly, Apple’s frenemy Samsung is going to be the sole supplier of OLED displays for Apple’s best iPhone this year. But Apple is looking to fix this OLED “problem” in the years that follow, mostly since Samsung alone won’t be able to fulfill Apple’s iPhone needs. Don't Miss: Mesh is the hottest trend in home Wi-Fi, so we tested every top system to find the best Various reports have revealed that Samsung and other display makers including LG and Japan Display will invest heavily in OLED factories now that Apple is moving from LCD screens to OLED. Now, a new report from Bloomberg adds massive Chinese conglomerate BOE Technology Group Co. to that list. BOE has already sent OLED screens to Apple for testing, but it’s unclear whether they’ve been deemed suitable for the next-gen iPhone — that’s the 2018 iPhone, not the iPhone 8 coming out this year. BOE is one of China’s largest display panel makers, and it’s looking to invest $14.5 billion building two AMOLED plants in Sichuan in anticipation of future business. The iPhone is one of BOE’s targets, and that shouldn’t surprise anyone. Apple’s OLED adoption will convince many other smartphone makers to follow suit, numerous reports have suggested, even though OLED screens have been around for years. That means even if you’re not an iPhone user, you future smartphones might pack high-quality OLED screens thanks to Apple. Apple reportedly ordered some 160 million OLED screens from Samsung this year, but that won’t be enough to equip all 2017 iPhones with OLED displays. Instead, only the iPhone 8 will get the OLED treatment, while the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will stick to LCD screens. Samsung is also setting aside about 60 million OLED screens for its Galaxy S8 phones. In the future, Apple will want all of its iPhones to have OLED displays, and the same probably goes for other products it sells. Android device makers, in turn, will likely move to OLED displays as supply increases and OLED screens become even more affordable. Samsung Display, which has 95% of the OLED market according to the same report, will see tremendous competition in the coming years. BOE alone is expected to mass-produce 1.6 million square meters of flexible OLED glass substrates per year once its two factories come online, which is slightly more than what researchers from IHS estimate for this year’s total global OLED production.

Apple hasn’t announced 4K plans, but support for that format was clearly lacking when the company introduced its apps-friendly, fourth-gen Apple TV device in the fall of 2015.  Bloomberg said Apple is expected to launch its new device, codenamed “J105,” later this year. RELATED: Apple Launches New Apple TV Adding 4K would add an element already offered on certain Roku player models, the latest Amazon Fire TV box, the new Chromecast Ultra streaming adapter from Google, and an expanding batch of Android TV-powered devices. It wouldn’t be surprising to see a next-gen Apple TV device also try to close the gap with support for High Dynamic Range, as the Bloomberg report noted that the new product will also enable more vivid colors. Bloomberg suggested that Apple’s recent hiring of former Amazon Fire TV exec Timothy Twerdhal also indicates that Apple is looking to up the ante on video, and that it could enable his predecessor, Pete Distad, to resurrect Apple’s troubled plans to offer a national skinny bundle OTT TV service that focuses on access to broadcast TV networks. Research shows that Apple TV is lagging the pack. Parks Associates reported last year that Roku was the most popular brand of streaming media players, accounting for 30% of the players purchased from 1Q 2015 to 1Q 2016. Amazon and Google were tied, with 22% of sales, with Apple TV at about 20%. TAGS: Apple Apple TV OTT 4K UHD Ultra HD Share This Post View the discussion thread.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > iPhone 8 Expected to Have 3D Facial Recognition Instead of Touch ID iPhone 8 Expected to Have 3D Facial Recognition Instead of Touch ID Thursday, 16 February 2017 (12 hours ago) Apple's widely expected 5.8-inch iPhone with an edge-to-edge OLED display will feature a front-facing 3D laser scanner for facial recognition, corroborating previous rumors, according to JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall. Hall said the scanner will replace Touch ID on the so-called iPhone 8, as Apple plans to remove the Home button to allow for the edge-to-edge display. His research note claims the so-called iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus could also have a 3D laser scanner based on increased volume of the module within Apple's supply chain. The scanner is said to add $10 to $15 per module to the iPhone 8's bill of materials, which coupled with the OLED display, glass casing, and other increased production costs, could make its retail price up to $100 more expensive than it would be without those features, if Apple looks to maintain a similar profit margin. The increased costs are in line with a recent report claiming the iPhone 8 could cost upwards of $1,000 in the United States. Hall believes the switch to facial recognition will help alleviate consumer frustration when Touch ID does not work under wet conditions. He added that facial recognition will potentially be more secure than Touch ID, which could increase Apple Pay adoption among banks and merchants. The research note said the 3D laser scanner could eventually be used for other purposes, such as augmented reality, but likely not until 2018 at the earliest. One obvious and potentially most compelling use would be AR/VR experiences in which the user’s hands and other real world objects are being scanned and integrated into a field of view provided by the iPhone mounted into a Google Daydream-like headset. This would open up many interesting entertainment and gaming experiences not available today and might give Apple something extra in an AR/VR accessory compared to Google and others. He also believes that Apple is likely to eventually open up a 3D scanning API to developers, who could use it to do "everything from determining your shoe size for online orders to helping make sure you are properly fitted on your bike." Hall expects a strong iPhone 8 replacement cycle later this year, and he said an announcement about the product is possible as early as WWDC 2017, which kicks off June 5.

Year in and year out, the analyst insisted that Apple was on the verge of releasing a flat-screen television that would come in multiple sizes and be powered by the company’s iOS platform. That mythical HDTV never materialized, and at this point it looks like it never will. Instead, Apple continues to tweak its Apple TV set-top box, and now a new report sheds light on what we can expect from the next-generation model that will likely launch later this year. Don't Miss: Mesh is the hottest trend in home Wi-Fi, so we tested every top system to find the best After all these years, Apple is still fighting an uphill battle in the war for consumers’ living rooms. The company’s current-generation Apple TV is beloved by users, but it is still facing the same problem earlier models have faced: there aren’t very many users. Rivals have flooded the market with low-cost alternatives like the Fire TV and Fire TV Stick from Amazon, which are so popular that the company can’t even manage to keep them in stock. Few would argue that less expensive set-top boxes offer better features than the Apple TV. The problem is they offer the same core features — content is the most important part of the experience, for obvious reasons, and Apple has no advantage whatsoever when it comes to content. All of these devices can access the same core services such as Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now and Sling TV, so why pay $150-$200 for an Apple TV when you can pay $40-$80 for a Fire TV? Apple hasn’t yet found an answer to that important question, but the company continues to motor along while it tries to find a way to differentiate its offerings. In the meantime, a new report from Bloomberg suggests that Apple is indeed working on an updated fifth-generation Apple TV that should launch later this year. That’s the good news. The bad news is that it doesn’t sound like there will be anything special about the update. Bloomberg states that Apple is testing support for 4K resolution on the next-generation Apple TV, and the news site also claims that the box will support content with “more vivid colors.” It’s unclear what that means exactly, though it likely refers to HDR, which is now supported by many new HDTV and UHD TV models that have launched over the past year. As for release timing, the report has nothing firm to offer. Instead, it simply suggests that the new fifth-generation Apple TV model could be released at some point in 2017.

By Asha McLean | February 16, 2017 -- 23:30 GMT (15:30 PST) | Topic: Banking Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) has released its first quarter market update, reporting an 8 percent increase in statutory net profit to AU$1.6 billion. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, ANZ said initiatives including Apple Pay and Android Pay drove ongoing net customer acquisition gains in its Australian Retail Transaction Banking segment. Latest Australian news Australia's culture of trust is leaving the country vulnerable: Kaspersky Lab Village Roadshow targets 40 sites for piracy website blocking ​NAB to create new digital platform for healthcare ​ANZ says Apple Pay, Android Pay instrumental in Q1 customer acquisition NBN changes CVC pricing model from industry average to RSP average ANZ was the first bank in both Australia and New Zealand to launch Apple Pay, in April last year. ANZ was the only member of Australia's big four to embrace Apple Pay, having left the group of banks requesting collective bargaining rights with Apple and demanding open access to iPhone's near-field communication (NFC) technology. ANZ is currently the only bank in New Zealand offering the service. At the time of launching Apple Pay, ANZ chief executive officer Shayne Elliott revealed that the motivation behind launching ANZ Apple Pay was the pressure he received from customers. "The reason we are here is I was sick of being hounded on Twitter and email by customers saying, 'When are you going to get Apple Pay?'," Elliott said. "That was sort of a joke, but actually it's real, it's true, we're here today because customers want this. As a customer-focused bank who believes in innovation and the absolute digital way we've got to be, this just seemed like such a natural thing for us to be doing." The bank said it was also the first to work with Android Pay. Elliott told shareholders on Friday that his bank has the capacity to invest in the full slate of digital technology that it has long boasted a focus on. "That's something that we can never have enough money to invest in digital. The reality is that it's about getting the right cost mix," Elliott said. "That's things like Apple Pay, things like the whole digital experience that we want to continue to improve." For the first quarter of the 2017 financial year, the bank's cash profit came in at AU$2 billion, up 31 percent year on year. Profit before provisions was up 17 percent and revenue also climbed 7 percent over the corresponding period a year prior. Since the start of FY2017, ANZ has signed agreements to sell its 20 percent stake in Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank, the UDC Finance business in New Zealand, and ANZ's Retail and Wealth businesses in five Asian countries. The transactions are expected to complete in the second half of FY 2017 and 1H 2018, subject to regulatory approvals. "We're pretty pleased with the result. It's early days, it's the first quarter of the year and we're going through quite a transformation at ANZ ... we're really pleased with how the year has started," Elliott said. "We've had a view that the world that we live in is just slowing a little bit and therefore, in that view we've got to be even more efficient if we want to win and be winning with our customers." During the quarter, ANZ launched BladePay, a mobile payments solution for Australian businesses, in partnership with South African-based payments startup ThumbzUp. ANZ also recently extended its contract with Singtel and its subsidiary Optus Business, which will see the telco giant provide telecommunications and managed services to the bank throughout Australia and Asia out to 2020. At the time, Elliott said Singtel's services have "played an important role" in the bank's adoption of technology to simplify and enhance banking, as well as advocating staff collaboration. Earlier this week, ANZ announced the appointment Lynwen Connick as its new chief information security officer, who in March will leave her role as first assistant secretary information sharing and intelligence at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to take up her new position. Connick, who replaces former CISO Steve Glynn, will report to group executive technology Gerard Florian. Florian explained that Connick will be charged with ensuring the bank's information security strategy evolves with the changing technology landscape and supports the bank's digital transformation. Connick is the second executive appointment ANZ made this month, with Emma Gray joining the bank's technology executive team in the newly created role of chief data officer. Reporting to group executive of Digital Banking Maile Carnegie, who joined ANZ from heading up Google Australia in March last year, Gray will also play a crucial role in ANZ's digital transformation strategy. ANZ's company reshuffle was announced in September, after its COO Alistair Currie announced his departure. In its 2016 financial results, ANZ posted AU$5.7 billion in statutory net profit, representing a 24 percent tumble year-on-year. The bank attributed the profit dive to, amongst other things, its current focus on competing in the "digital age".

Although business at flagship Samsung Electronics is humming along, big calls will need to be made and the man most likely to be called upon to make them is Choi Gee Sung, the top lieutenant at Samsung Group and a mentor to Lee. "Choi is very experienced and has done a good job. He is the one best placed to manage group-level affairs in Lee's absence,"said one Samsung insider. While Samsung Electronics is still smarting from the debacle of its exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphone batteries, its semiconductor business is in rude health. Its share price has risen about 60 per cent in the past year. But the wide-ranging investigation, part of a corruption scandal that led parliament to impeach South Korean President Park Geun Hye, has been a major distraction for the country's largest conglomerate, or chaebol. "Everything has virtually stopped," said a second executive at Samsung Group's powerful strategy office that Choi heads. "We're mainly focusing on the prosecutor's investigation (into Lee and Samsung) ... We'll be running an emergency plan and everything will be under Choi's control for now." But some others say even Choi's role could be limited and Samsung may have to rely more on each affiliate's top management, with Choi also under investigation by special prosecutors. "Since we've decided to dismantle group strategy office, Choi's role is likely to gradually decrease, although we can't say for how much and when," another Samsung executive said. A fourth group insider said: "We have a system in place with professional management teams, so in terms of the day-to-day operations things should be fine." None of the Samsung individuals wanted to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. "It's not like Samsung businesses will grind to a halt. There are many smart people at the company," said Kim Yong Serk, a former Samsung Electronics executive who is now a professor at Sungkyunkwan University. But the arrest of Lee, 48, will have an impact on longer-term investment decisions at the conglomerate. "Samsung presidents are evaluated on an annual basis, so they can't make bold bets about the future. They need a chairman for that," Kim said. Samsung declined to comment on its management plans or Choi's role. BEATING APPLE When Samsung Electronics trailed Nokia in mobile phones - just five years ago - Choi, then CEO, set his sights on a different rival. "Competition is coming from elsewhere. There's a company more profitable than us and we should change our target," he told Reuters in January 2012, referring to Apple Inc. That year, Samsung ended Nokia's 14-year domination of the mobile market, ultimately also overtaking Apple as the world's biggest smartphone maker. In a Samsung career spanning more than three decades, Choi worked in all the main businesses, from semiconductors and home appliances to televisions and telecoms, before taking over as chief executive. As head of strategy, 66-year-old Choi has acted as Lee Jae Yong's mentor and been closely involved in preparing the path for him to take over from his father, who was incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014. Under Choi's guidance, Lee has moved closer to succeeding his father in a well-choreographed long-term plan, including a restructuring of the conglomerate to cement the Lee family's control. However, that plan included a controversial US$8 billion merger of two Samsung units that has been central to prosecutors' case against the group, and Lee. Prosecutors accuse Samsung of paying bribes totalling 43 billion won (S$53.07 million) to organisations linked to President Park Geun Hye's friend, Choi Soon Sil, to secure government backing for the merger. Choi Gee Sung and his deputy Chang Choong Ki were quizzed by prosecutors over their role in the deal. STEP UP FOR 'MR CHIP', TOO? Lee's absence, if prolonged, could also see a bigger role for Kwon Oh Hyun, Samsung Electronics' vice chairman and current CEO. Known as "Mr Chip", Kwon has overseen the growth of Samsung's component business, which now generates much of the firm's profits. "Kwon is a very practical manager. Like many Samsung managers in the component business, he doesn't feel comfortable (in the limelight)," said an executive who worked with him. Kwon, who studied electrical engineering at Seoul National University and at Stanford, cemented Samsung's position in memory chips and expanded the contract chip manufacturing business, producing chips that power the Apple iPhone. But, for all the experience and qualities these senior managers bring, Lee's absence will be felt. Lee had been instrumental in seeking to drive growth through new businesses, including signing off on South Korea's biggest outbound deal: an US$8 billion acquisition of US auto electronics maker Harman International Industries. "The biggest problem is that Lee is the one who sets the direction of Samsung as a whole," the fourth group insider said. "He doesn't get into every business decision, but he's the one who has to sign off on major investments or acquisitions ... That's why he can't easily be replaced."

Apple's Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp is setting up a plant in Bengaluru to focus solely on assembling iPhones, a separate source told Reuters earlier this month. Apple's move comes as it seeks to boost its share in the world's fastest growing major mobile market, where handsets far cheaper than Apple's iPhones dominate. It also comes as smartphone sales growth is slowing in Asia's other massive market, China. To lower prices, Apple has been seeking to set up local production and has been in talks with the Indian government regarding issues such as tax concessions. The industry source told Reuters the initial manufacturing of the iPhone SE model was not contingent on those concessions. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Economic Times newspaper earlier on Friday reported Apple planned to initially assemble 300,000 to 400,000 iPhone SE handsets in India. The industry source told Reuters the numbers would be substantially lower to begin with. The source also said it was too early to say what other phone models Apple would assemble at the Bengaluru plant. Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to India last year, with a third coming in the December quarter, according to market researcher Counterpoint, which estimates that three-quarters of smartphones sold in India were made locally. In the fourth quarter, Apple ranked 10th in India's smartphone market but led the premium segment with a 62 percent market share, Counterpoint said. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and a host of Chinese players including Xiaomi and Vivo dominate India's smartphone market where the vast majority of phones sold are priced below 15,000 rupees ($225). In comparison, the entry level iPhone SE model sells on Amazon.com's India site for 28,433 rupees ($424).

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Apple is Fortune’s ‘Most Admired Company’ for the 10th Year in a Row FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint Azeem Ullah 3 hours ago Fortune has unveiled its popular annual list of most admired companies in the world, and once again the list doesn’t deviate from the script by much. Apple again reigned supreme at the top of the charts. Far from the first time, the company is celebrating its 10th consecutive year at the top of the charts. It is followed by another giant of the industry, Amazon, which moved up one spot compared to last year. They were followed by Starbucks, Berkshire Hathaway and Disney. Alphabet sits further down at sixth, after falling from its high graces in 2nd, while Facebook and Microsoft were tied at ninth-spot together. One large company missing from the top-ten altogether was Samsung, which wound up being out of the Top 50 list altogether after being placed 35th last year, not helped in part by the Note 7’s forgettable launch and bribery charges against its VP. The report, in its initial stages,includes 1000 largest US companies based on revenue, as well as 500 international businesses with revenues above $10 billion. The list is then whittled down to just 680 companies across 28 countries with the highest revenues within their market. Finally, the list takes the opinion of 3800 analysts, executives and directors to reach a conclusion.

Unfortunately, Apple’s industry ranking this year wasn’t indicated due to insufficient response rate in the computer industry. Needless to say, the report will bring impetus to a company that might have a big product launch later this year.

Lee on bribery charges could hamper decisions on strategic investments and acquisitions at the sprawling conglomerate, insiders and former executives say, even with strong leadership at its many businesses. Although business at flagship Samsung Electronics is humming along, big calls will need to be made and the man most likely to be called upon to make them is Choi Gee-sung, the top lieutenant at Samsung Group and a mentor to Lee. “Choi is very experienced and has done a good job. He is the one best placed to manage group-level affairs in Lee’s absence,” said one Samsung insider. While Samsung Electronics is still smarting from the debacle of its exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphone batteries, its semiconductor business is in rude health. Its share price has risen about 60 per cent in the past year. But the wide-ranging investigation, part of a corruption scandal that led parliament to impeach South Korean President Park Geun-hye, has been a major distraction for the country’s largest conglomerate, or chaebol. “Everything has virtually stopped,” said a second executive at Samsung Group’s powerful strategy office that Choi heads. “We’re mainly focusing on the prosecutor’s investigation (into Lee and Samsung) ... We’ll be running an emergency plan and everything will be under Choi’s control for now.” But some others say even Choi’s role could be limited and Samsung may have to rely more on each affiliate’s top management, with Choi also under investigation by special prosecutors. “Since we’ve decided to dismantle group strategy office, Choi’s role is likely to gradually decrease, although we can’t say for how much and when,” another Samsung executive said. A fourth group insider said: “We have a system in place with professional management teams, so in terms of the day-to-day operations things should be fine.” None of the Samsung individuals wanted to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. “It’s not like Samsung businesses will grind to a halt. There are many smart people at the company,” said Kim Yong-serk, a former Samsung Electronics executive who is now a professor at Sungkyunkwan University. But the arrest of Lee, 48, will have an impact on longer-term investment decisions at the conglomerate. “Samsung presidents are evaluated on an annual basis, so they can’t make bold bets about the future. They need a chairman for that,” Kim said. Samsung declined to comment on its management plans or Choi’s role. Beating Apple When Samsung Electronics trailed Nokia in mobile phones ― just five years ago ― Choi, then CEO, set his sights on a different rival. “Competition is coming from elsewhere. There’s a company more profitable than us and we should change our target,” he told Reuters in January 2012, referring to Apple Inc. That year, Samsung ended Nokia’s 14-year domination of the mobile market, ultimately also overtaking Apple as the world’s biggest smartphone maker. In a Samsung career spanning more than three decades, Choi worked in all the main businesses, from semiconductors and home appliances to televisions and telecoms, before taking over as chief executive. As head of strategy, 66-year-old Choi has acted as Jay Y. Lee’s mentor and been closely involved in preparing the path for him to take over from his father, who was incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014. Under Choi’s guidance, Lee has moved closer to succeeding his father in a well-choreographed long-term plan, including a restructuring of the conglomerate to cement the Lee family’s control. However, that plan included a controversial US$8 billion (RM35.6 billion) merger of two Samsung units that has been central to prosecutors’ case against the group, and Lee. Prosecutors accuse Samsung of paying bribes totalling 43 billion won to organisations linked to President Park Geun-hye’s friend, Choi Soon-sil, to secure government backing for the merger. Choi Gee-sung and his deputy Chang Choong-ki were quizzed by prosecutors over their role in the deal. Step up for ‘Mr Chip’, too? Lee’s absence, if prolonged, could also see a bigger role for Kwon Oh-hyun, Samsung Electronics’ vice chairman and current CEO. Known as “Mr Chip”, Kwon has overseen the growth of Samsung’s component business, which now generates much of the firm’s profits. “Kwon is a very practical manager. Like many Samsung managers in the component business, he doesn’t feel comfortable (in the limelight),” said an executive who worked with him. Kwon, who studied electrical engineering at Seoul National University and at Stanford, cemented Samsung’s position in memory chips and expanded the contract chip manufacturing business, producing chips that power the Apple iPhone. But, for all the experience and qualities these senior managers bring, Lee’s absence will be felt. Lee had been instrumental in seeking to drive growth through new businesses, including signing off on South Korea’s biggest outbound deal: an US$8 billion acquisition of US auto electronics maker Harman International Industries. “The biggest problem is that Lee is the one who sets the direction of Samsung as a whole,” the fourth group insider said. “He doesn’t get into every business decision, but he’s the one who has to sign off on major investments or acquisitions ... That’s why he can’t easily be replaced.” ― Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Chatime is Tealive from now on, says Loob Singapore's economy surges 12.3pc, beating earlier estimate BMI: Malaysia'a GDP to grow this year due to boost in commodity prices Malaysia retains pole position as most attractive manufacturing market Malaysia's financial market improves with steps taken by FMC Weaker ringgit dampens travel to Singapore Ringgit ends lower against US dollar Swedish company invests RM100m in Penang Osram says gets US government approval for lamps unit sale Greece says will not accept ‘illogical’ demands in bailout review Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Related Articles Samsung’s history tainted by run-ins with the law (VIDEO) S.

Ironically, the iPhone SE was said to be geared exclusively towards emerging markets like India and China on launch. An atrociously high price tag - of Rs 39,000 - however meant it was still far from the reach of a large number of (potential) buyers. All this is going to change in the coming months as Apple starts making the iPhone SE in India. "Apple Inc will in the coming months start assembling its lower-priced iPhone SE models at a contract manufacturer's plant in Bengaluru," an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter was quoted by Reuters as saying. Apple's Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp is setting up a plant in Bengaluru to focus solely on assembling iPhones even as the Cupertino major seeks tax concessions from the Indian government to set up local production in the world's fastest growing major mobile market. The company will initially start by assembling 300,000 to 400,000 iPhone SE handsets in India and the initial manufacturing of the model will not be dependent on any tax concession offerings from the government. "It's (still) too early to say what other phone models Apple would assemble at the Bengaluru plant," the report adds. Apple set itself a target of selling 10 million mobile phones in India by 2016-17. It failed, because in a market like India -- where 70-80 per cent of the devices are sold in the under-Rs 10,000 segment - a new iPhone model (still) usually starts at over Rs 50,000 and that could be a problem.      Starting local assembly will help the company price its products more aggressively, with experts predicting that the price of an iPhone SE could go down by up to 10-12 per cent, should Apple make it in India. Samsung and a host of Chinese players including Xiaomi and Vivo notably dominate India's smartphone market where the vast majority of phones sold are priced below Rs 15,000. In comparison, the entry level iPhone SE model sells online for as high as Rs 28,433. The 4-inch iPhone from Apple is everything that the iPhone 6S is (save 3D Touch) only in a 5S-esque body.

Lee on bribery charges could hamper decisions on strategic investments and acquisitions at the sprawling conglomerate, insiders and former executives say, even with strong leadership at its many businesses. Although business at flagship Samsung Electronics is humming along, big calls will need to be made and the man most likely to be called upon to make them is Choi Gee-sung, the top lieutenant at Samsung Group and a mentor to Lee. "Choi is very experienced and has done a good job. He is the one best placed to manage group-level affairs in Lee's absence," said one Samsung insider. While Samsung Electronics is still smarting from the debacle of its exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphone batteries, its semiconductor business is in rude health. Its share price has risen about 60 percent in the past year. But the wide-ranging investigation, part of a corruption scandal that led parliament to impeach South Korean President Park Geun-hye, has been a major distraction for the country's largest conglomerate, or chaebol. "Everything has virtually stopped," said a second executive at Samsung Group's powerful strategy office that Choi heads. "We're mainly focusing on the prosecutor's investigation (into Lee and Samsung) ... We'll be running an emergency plan and everything will be under Choi's control for now." But some others say even Choi's role could be limited and Samsung may have to rely more on each affiliate's top management, with Choi also under investigation by special prosecutors. "Since we've decided to dismantle group strategy office, Choi's role is likely to gradually decrease, although we can't say for how much and when," another Samsung executive said. A fourth group insider said: "We have a system in place with professional management teams, so in terms of the day-to-day operations things should be fine." None of the Samsung individuals wanted to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. "It's not like Samsung businesses will grind to a halt. There are many smart people at the company," said Kim Yong-serk, a former Samsung Electronics executive who is now a professor at Sungkyunkwan University. But the arrest of Lee, 48, will have an impact on longer-term investment decisions at the conglomerate. "Samsung presidents are evaluated on an annual basis, so they can't make bold bets about the future. They need a chairman for that," Kim said. Samsung declined to comment on its management plans or Choi's role. BEATING APPLE When Samsung Electronics trailed Nokia in mobile phones - just five years ago - Choi, then CEO, set his sights on a different rival. "Competition is coming from elsewhere. There's a company more profitable than us and we should change our target," he told Reuters in January 2012, referring to Apple Inc. That year, Samsung ended Nokia's 14-year domination of the mobile market, ultimately also overtaking Apple as the world's biggest smartphone maker. In a Samsung career spanning more than three decades, Choi worked in all the main businesses, from semiconductors and home appliances to televisions and telecoms, before taking over as chief executive. As head of strategy, 66-year-old Choi has acted as Jay Y. Lee's mentor and been closely involved in preparing the path for him to take over from his father, who was incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014. Under Choi's guidance, Lee has moved closer to succeeding his father in a well-choreographed long-term plan, including a restructuring of the conglomerate to cement the Lee family's control. However, that plan included a controversial $8 billion merger of two Samsung units that has been central to prosecutors' case against the group, and Lee. Prosecutors accuse Samsung of paying bribes totalling 43 billion won ($37.74 million) to organizations linked to President Park Geun-hye's friend, Choi Soon-sil, to secure government backing for the merger. Choi Gee-sung and his deputy Chang Choong-ki were quizzed by prosecutors over their role in the deal. STEP UP FOR 'MR CHIP', TOO? Lee's absence, if prolonged, could also see a bigger role for Kwon Oh-hyun, Samsung Electronics' vice chairman and current CEO.

"He doesn't get into every business decision, but he's the one who has to sign off on major investments or acquisitions ... That's why he can't easily be replaced."

Photo: Reuters Mumbai: Apple Inc will in the coming months start assembling its lower-priced iPhone SE models at a contract manufacturer’s plant in Indian technology hub of Bengaluru, an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday. Apple’s Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp is setting up a plant in Bengaluru to focus solely on assembling iPhones, a separate source told Reuters earlier this month. Apple’s move comes as it seeks to boost its share in the world’s fastest growing major mobile market, where handsets far cheaper than Apple’s iPhones dominate. It also comes as smartphone sales growth is slowing in Asia’s other massive market, China. To lower prices, Apple has been seeking to set up local production and has been in talks with the Indian government regarding issues such as tax concessions. The industry source told Reuters the initial manufacturing of the iPhone SE model was not contingent on those concessions. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Economic Times newspaper earlier on Friday reported Apple planned to initially assemble 300,000 to 400,000 iPhone SE handsets in India. The industry source told Reuters the numbers would be substantially lower to begin with. The source also said it was too early to say what other phone models Apple would assemble at the Bengaluru plant. Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to India last year, with a third coming in the December quarter, according to market researcher Counterpoint, which estimates that three-quarters of smartphones sold in India were made locally. In the fourth quarter, Apple ranked 10th in India’s smartphone market but led the premium segment with a 62% market share, Counterpoint said. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and a host of Chinese players including Xiaomi and Vivo dominate India’s smartphone market where the vast majority of phones sold are priced below Rs15,000 rupees ($225). In comparison, the entry level iPhone SE model sells on Amazon.com’s India site for 28,433 rupees ($424).

(AAPL) Tips its Hand on iPhone 8 Wireless Charging Apple is now a member of the Wireless Power Consortium By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Feb 14, 2017, 12:19 pm EST     View All   Popular Posts: Report: Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Could Cost More Than $1,000 (AAPL) Alphabet Inc – Is Google Assistant Going Everywhere? (GOOGL) Apple Inc. (AAPL) Tips its Hand on iPhone 8 Wireless Charging Recent Posts: Would You Ditch Your Home Phone for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)? Apple Inc. (AAPL) Careens Closer to Major AR Announcement New Facebook Inc (FB) Video App Is Part of a Greater Plan View All Posts There are always plenty of rumors flying around about Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) coming iPhone releases. Usually, these are based on information leaked from the AAPL supply chain, but on a very few occasions, Apple itself inadvertently tips its hand. Source: Wireless Power Consortium That appears to be the case with the iPhone 8. For several months, the 10th anniversary release has been rumored to feature wireless charging. Thanks to an AAPL move, that now seems like a lock. AAPL Joins the Wireless Power Consortium Business Insider broke the news that Apple has joined the Wireless Power Consortium (or WPC). WPC is an industry association that oversees Qi, the most widely used wireless charging technology. That puts AAPL in a group with over 220 other companies that are members, including smartphone rival Samsung Electronic (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), whose Galaxy S7 supports Qi wireless charging. Apple does already use Qi wireless charging for the Apple Watch, but the company tweaked its implementation so it’s not compatible with standard Qi chargers. And it never bothered to join WPC — until now. That move is a very strong indicator that AAPL is planning to incorporate Qi wireless charging on a larger scale, and that points to the iPhone 8. Apple confirmed it had joined WPC (although the confirmation isn’t really necessary given that it’s now listed as a member on the organization’s website), but it did so by trying to minimize the implications. A company spokesperson told Business Insider: “Apple is an active member of many standards development organizations, as both a leader and contributor. Apple is joining the Wireless Power Consortium to be able to participate and contribute ideas to the open, collaborative development of future wireless charging standards. We look forward to working together with the WPC and its members.” What WPC Membership Means for iPhone 8 Wireless Charging Despite AAPL’s attempt to position its move as business as usual, joining WPC is a strong indication that rumors about the iPhone 8 offering wireless charging have been on the mark. However, Qi isn’t the advanced, over-the-air wireless charging many people had been hoping AAPL would implement. Instead, Qi — which has been in use since 2011– uses inductive charging. Rather than plugging an iPhone into a charger with a Lightning cable, it would be placed on a charge pad. So there’s still a recharger that requires physical contact, and that recharger is still plugged into the wall.

Hit titles can make millions of dollars and everyone wants a piece of the pie. As a result, games are getting better and better each and every year. From Nintendo to EA Sports, and small indie developers in-between. Everyone is focused on mobile. With that in mind, here are some of the most exciting mobile games coming in 2017. Advertisement Gamers have a lot to look forward to. It started off with a bang thanks to Pokemon GO and Clash Royale rolling into the year strong. And hasn’t let up to kickoff 2017. With big titles like Super Mario Run or Fire Emblem Heroes. Those are just a few of many though. This will be a great year for mobile gaming. Read: 10 Best First Person Shooter Games for Android Between big HD displays and powerful 8-core processors, the games are only getting better too. We now have near console-quality graphics, games that take players years to finish and more. Above are 10 great FPS games, we’ve also covered some awesome racing games for mobile, and below are exciting new games many are looking forward to as 2017 continues. Super Mario Run caused quite a stir when Apple co-announced it in late 2016. Teasing signs that Nintendo is ready to dive head-first into mobile. This is just the beginners. With Apple pushing the envelope for iOS games, NVIDIA leading the charge with Android TV and the Shield, and others, games continue to evolve for mobile. In fact, thinking back 10 years to the first iPhone to what we have now is impressive to say the least. Advertisement Mobile gaming is growing at an incredible pace, and is showing no signs of slowing down. Instead, we have some of the best games ever coming this year. It’s a term we hear often, “console-quality” graphics, but this could be the year it truly happens. Stunning titles like Shadowgun Legends or NOVA are surely going to deliver unrivaled experiences that many will enjoy. Not to mention virtual reality gaming is a thing, which continues to get better by the day. Some extremely exciting mobile games have already been released in 2017, so we won’t add them to our list below. Instead, these are all upcoming titles that everyone is anxiously waiting for. Myself included. Get ready for some of the best gaming on the go we’ve ever seen. Starting with the games listed in our slideshow below. Then, expect more to surface as the year continues. Shadowgun Legends   1 / 10 Honestly, Shadowgun is still one of my favorite mobile games to date, which was released back in 2011. Developed by Madfinger games, who have multiple award-winning titles. Like Shadowgun: Deadzone, Dead Trigger and Unkilled. However, for 2017 they’re getting back to what we all love. It’s called Shadowgun Legends, and this is the game I’m most looking forward to. Described as the first persistent-world FPS title for mobile. It takes place nearly 30 years after the original, where players will get to control their own Shadowgun Warrior in intense battles. There will be co-op, multiplayer and much more in an effort to fight off the Alien race coming to destroy humanity. If you haven’t seen it yet, take a look at the first gameplay video. It’s incredible. Shadowgun Legends isn’t even out yet but has already started winning awards. There is no release date at this time, but it should be here soon enough sometime in 2017. My NVIDIA Shield is ready, and so am I. Advertisement   1 / 10 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 2:30 PM, February 17, 2017 MUMBAI - Apple Inc will in the coming months start assembling its lower-priced iPhone SE models at a contract manufacturer's plant in the southern Indian technology hub of Bengaluru, an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday. Apple's Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp is setting up a plant in Bengaluru to focus solely on assembling iPhones, a separate source told Reuters earlier this month. Apple's move comes as it seeks to boost its share in the world's fastest growing major mobile market, where handsets far cheaper than Apple's iPhones dominate. It also comes as smartphone sales growth is slowing in Asia's other massive market, China. To lower prices, Apple has been seeking to set up local production and has been in talks with the Indian federal government regarding issues such as tax concessions. The industry source told Reuters the initial manufacturing of the iPhone SE model was not contingent on those concessions. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Economic Times newspaper earlier on Friday reported Apple planned to initially assemble 300,000 to 400,000 iPhone SE handsets in India. The industry source told Reuters the numbers would be substantially lower to begin with. The source also said it was too early to say what other phone models Apple would assemble at the Bengaluru plant. Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to India last year, with a third coming in the December quarter, according to market researcher Counterpoint, which estimates that three-quarters of smartphones sold in India were made locally. In the fourth quarter, Apple ranked 10th in India's smartphone market but led the premium segment with a 62 percent market share, Counterpoint said. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and a host of Chinese players including Xiaomi and Vivo dominate India's smartphone market where the vast majority of phones sold are priced below 15,000 rupees ($225). In comparison, the entry level iPhone SE model sells on Amazon.com's India site for 28,433 rupees ($424).

Microsoft Updates Office with Support for Apple MacBook’s Touch Bar GO Office tools working with the Touch Bar on new MacBook Pro Feb 17, 2017 06:50 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​Microsoft has released an update for its Office productivity suite that officially adds support for Apple’s new MacBook Pro Touch Bar feature, after the company previously introduced this functionality in preview form in early February. Starting today, Office can make full use of the Touch Bar to display controls that come in handy to Mac users when working with documents, and the productivity suite supports Word and PowerPoint for the time being, while Excel and Outlook will be added at a later time. Microsoft’s February updates for Office for Mac also includes a new object rotation slider that is displayed on the Touch Bar and which according to the software giant “provides a more intuitive and precise rotation experience.” How Office takes advantage of the Touch Bar Thanks to support for the Touch Bar, Microsoft Word can now enter the Focus Mode and focus entirely on the document, hiding all on-screen ribbons and commands and putting the emphasis on your content. You also get access to the essential controls right on the Touch Bar, such as style settings and commands to insert comments, photos, or links. PowerPoint makes it possible to use the Touch Bar in order to work with graphic elements, with a Reorder Objects button displaying a graphical map of all the layers on a slide. There are also other controls on the Touch Bar, including a timer for your slideshow. Excel will bring the most recently used functions in the Touch Bar, as well as formatting options, such as borders, cell colors, and recommended charts. And last but not least, Outlook benefits from a list of recent documents when composing a new mail, or quick access to calendar events and Skype for Business meeting options when composing a new mail. Support for Excel and Outlook will be added at a later time, but there is no ETA for the time being, so today’s update is all about Word and PowerPoint. #Microsoft#Office#Apple#MacBook#Touch Bar subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Demoes the Surface Studio in New Video GPD Pocket Is a 7-inch Laptop Running Both Ubuntu and Windows 10 5 Features That Will Make You Love Vivaldi (If You Try It Out) Microsoft Donated $250,000 to US President Donald Trump’s Inauguration Intel Makes Available Ethernet Connections CD 22.0.1 - Download Now NVIDIA Rolls Out GeForce Graphics Driver 378.72 Hotfix - Get It Now Don’t Hold Your Breath for a New Windows 10 RS2 Build These Days Apple Could Launch iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 Betas at WWDC 2017, June 5-9 3D Facial Recognition to Replace Touch ID on Apple iPhone 8 Twitter Makes Notifications from People You've Blocked Disappear First Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Reference Spotted Online Intel Makes Available Ethernet Connections CD 22.0.1 - Download Now    Microsoft Word with Touch Bar controls Related Apps Excel Add-In for QuickBooks: Connect with live data from your QuickBooks company profile and extract data that you can edit and analyze easier and more efficiently in Excel Excel Add-In for Email: Retrieve data from your IMAP email account to Microsoft Excel where you can view, edit and save the relevant content for other projects ToDoList: Create and manage daily assignments, prioritize and color-code tasks, assign tags, encrypt information, schedule reminders, upload the project via FTP and more Excel Add-In for Twitter: Retrieve the data from your Twitter account in Excel where you can analyze it and edit it easier and more conveniently using this utility Excel AddIn for Facebook: Connect to your Facebook account and retrieve data regarding comments, posts, views, music, pages, permission or friends in Excel Excel Add-In for YouTube: Retrieve data from your YouTube account such as activities, captions, channels, comments, playlists or searches and manage it in Excel Excel Add-In for Gmail: Seamlessly connect to your Gmail account in order to retrieve the data from your folders for further analysis or to create a database using this app Reader comments Microsoft Donated $250,000 to US President Donald Trump’s Inauguration more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the upcoming and highly anticipated iPhone 8 is rumored to sport a 5.8-inch (2800x1241) OLED screen. Unfortunately, as far as concrete evidence goes, there is not much else to go on. With a reportedly new form factor and design, how exactly will Apple compensate for such a radical diversion from previous iterations, especially if the company is to ditch the home button and Touch ID? Well, we may finally have a potential answer, one that several designers and concept artists have been clambering for since the launch of the 2016 MacBook Pro, such as the above concept video. According to reputable Apple analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 will adopt a new "function area" at the bottom of the display, made possible by the bump in the display size. The feature will operate similarly to virtual onscreen buttons but could be much more dynamic and adaptive. Additionally, Kuo believes Touch ID will be incorporated into the area using new biometric technologies, though it is not clear what those technologies may be. While you should take the new report with a grain of salt, perhaps two grains, it is not a far cry from, and perhaps reminiscent of the Touch Bar introduced in the 2016 MacBook Pro. If not to bring familiarity and implement design consistency, how would you like to see this feature utilized within iOS?

(Shin Wong-soo/REUTERS) With Samsung chief in jail, one-time mentor seen taking charge Add to ... Se Young Lee and Miyoung Kim SEOUL — Reuters Published Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017 11:29PM EST Last updated Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017 11:30PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print The arrest of Samsung Group scion Jay Y. Lee on bribery charges could hamper decisions on strategic investments and acquisitions at the sprawling conglomerate, insiders and former executives say, even with a strong leadership bench at its many businesses. Although business at flagship Samsung Electronics is humming along, big calls will need to be made and the man most likely to be called upon to make them is Choi Gee-sung, the No.2 lieutenant at Samsung Group and a mentor to Lee. “Choi is very experienced and has done a good job. He is the one best placed to manage group-level affairs in Lee’s absence,” said one Samsung insider. While Samsung Electronics is still smarting from the debacle of its exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphone batteries, its semiconductor business is in rude health. Its share price is up around 60 percent in the past year. But the wide-ranging probe, part of a corruption scandal that led parliament to impeach South Korean President Park Geun-hye, has been a major distraction for the country’s largest conglomerate, or chaebol. “Everything has virtually stopped,” said a second executive at Samsung Group’s powerful strategy office that Choi heads. “We’re mainly focusing on the prosecutor’s investigation (into Lee and Samsung)... We’ll be running an emergency plan and everything will be under Choi’s control for now.” But some others say even Choi’s role could be limited and Samsung may have to rely more on each affiliate’s top management, with Choi also under investigation by special prosecutors. “Since we’ve decided to dismantle group strategy office, Choi’s role is likely to gradually decrease, although we can’t say for how much and when,” another Samsung executive said. A fourth group insider said: “We have a system in place with professional management teams, so in terms of the day-to-day operations things should be fine.” None of the Samsung individuals wanted to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. “It’s not like Samsung businesses will grind to a halt. There are many smart people at the company,” said Kim Yong-serk, a former Samsung Electronics executive who is now a professor at Sungkyunkwan University. But arrest of Lee, 48, will have an impact on longer-term investment decisions at the sprawling conglomerate. “Samsung presidents are evaluated on an annual basis, so they can’t make bold bets about the future. They need a chairman for that,” Kim said. Samsung declined to comment on its management plans or Choi’s role. Beating Apple When Samsung Electronics still trailed Nokia in mobile phones - just five years ago - Choi, then CEO, set his sights on a different rival. “Competition is coming from elsewhere. There’s a company more profitable than us and we should change our target,” he told Reuters in January 2012, referring to Apple Inc. That year, Samsung ended Nokia’s 14-year domination of the mobile market, ultimately also overtaking Apple as the world’s biggest smartphone maker. In a Samsung career spanning more than three decades, Choi has worked in all the main businesses, from semiconductors and home appliances to TVs and telecoms, before taking over as chief executive. As head of strategy, 66-year-old Choi has acted as Jay Y. Lee’s mentor and been closely involved in preparing the path for him to take over from his father, who was incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014. Under Choi’s guidance, Lee has moved closer to succeeding his father in a well-choreographed long-term plan, including a restructuring of the conglomerate to cement the Lee family’s control. However, that plan included a controversial $8 billion merger of two Samsung units that has been central to prosecutors’ case against the group, and Lee. Prosecutors accuse Samsung of paying bribes totalling 43 billion won ($37.74 million) to organizations linked to South Korean President Park Geun-hye’s friend, Choi Soon-sil, to secure government backing for the merger. Choi Gee-sung and his deputy Chang Choong-ki were quizzed by prosecutors over their role in the deal. Step up for ‘Mr. Chip,’ too? Lee’s absence, ahead of what could be a lengthy trial, could also see a bigger role for Kwon Oh-hyun, Samsung Electronics’ vice chairman and current CEO. Known as “Mr Chip,” Kwon has overseen the growth of Samsung’s component business, which now generates much of the firm’s profits. “Kwon is very practical manager. Like many Samsung managers in the component business, he doesn’t feel comfortable (in the limelight),” said an executive who worked with him. Kwon, who studied electrical engineering at Seoul National University and at Stanford, cemented Samsung’s position in memory chips and expanded the contract chip manufacturing business, producing chips that power the Apple iPhone. But, for all the experience and qualities these senior managers bring, Lee’s absence will still be felt. Lee had been instrumental in seeking to drive growth through new businesses, including signing off on South Korea’s biggest outbound deal: an $8 billion acquisition of U.S. auto electronics maker Harman International Industries. “The biggest problem is that Lee is the one who sets the direction of Samsung as a whole,” the fourth group insider said. “He doesn’t get into every business decision, but he’s the one who has to sign off on major investments or acquisitions... That’s why he can’t easily be replaced.” Report Typo/Error Also on The Globe and Mail Samsung chief appears for second round of questions in graft probe (Reuters)   More Related to this Story Samsung chief Jay Y.

Apple's Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp is setting up a plant in Bengaluru to focus solely on assembling iPhones, a separate source told Reuters earlier this month. Apple's move comes as it seeks to boost its share in the world's fastest growing major mobile market, where handsets far cheaper than Apple's iPhones dominate. It also comes as smartphone sales growth is slowing in Asia's other massive market, China. To lower prices, Apple has been seeking to set up local production and has been in talks with the Indian federal government regarding issues such as tax concessions. The industry source told Reuters the initial manufacturing of the iPhone SE model was not contingent on those concessions. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Economic Times newspaper earlier on Friday reported Apple planned to initially assemble 300,000 to 400,000 iPhone SE handsets in India. The industry source told Reuters the numbers would be substantially lower to begin with. The source also said it was too early to say what other phone models Apple would assemble at the Bengaluru plant. Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to India last year, with a third coming in the December quarter, according to market researcher Counterpoint, which estimates that three-quarters of smartphones sold in India were made locally. In the fourth quarter, Apple ranked 10th in India's smartphone market but led the premium segment with a 62 percent market share, Counterpoint said. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and a host of Chinese players including Xiaomi and Vivo dominate India's smartphone market where the vast majority of phones sold are priced below 15,000 rupees ($225). In comparison, the entry level iPhone SE model sells on Amazon.com's India site for 28,433 rupees ($424).

Is it cloud storage, cloud backup, cloud sync, cloud computing? By Dustin Miller HTF Columnist EVELETH – What is the cloud? The simple answer is it is a bunch of servers on the Internet networked together to provide you your services and storage from the Internet instead of your hard drive. Different servers will have different functions, such as processing your requests or storing your data. Most people use the cloud for something—and many don’t even realize it. If you have your phones being backed up to Google or Apple, you are using cloud storage. They give you some storage space to back up your files from your phone in case disaster happens; you will then, hopefully, be able to restore your phone fairly easily with minimal data loss. There are many different types of clouds out there as well. There is cloud storage, cloud backup, cloud sync and cloud software. Google Drive is a cloud computing service, which allows you to edit documents and spreadsheets all online. This service is entirely online-based and even allows you to save files on your account. You don’t even need a computer to use this—there are apps for most smart phones and tablets. Dropbox is an example of a cloud sync application. You upload files and then the files will be transferred to all other dropbox installations that you have installed or users you are sharing the folder/file with. Of course, depending on the size of the file, this can take a little bit of time. This service is primarily used for sharing your files with other computers or people. Cloud storage places such as Apple iCloud or Amazon Cloud are mostly used to back up your files and documents, and store them online. Many of your off-site storages will use a cloud-based storage as well. This gives you a backup of all of your data in the event something happens to your computer. Is the cloud secure? Should I store personal data on the cloud? This depends. Some cloud services will encrypt your data, but always make sure it is encrypted before you do store any personal information up there. All the main cloud companies have many security measures in place to protect your data, but on the Internet (as with anything) there is always that chance it can end up in the wrong hands. Of course, using a strong password will also help keep your data safe. When deciding if you want to use the cloud, you also need to see who actually owns the material once it is uploaded. You may give up some of your rights to that file on some cloud services—so always be sure to check their terms and conditions. I, personally, like the cloud for storing some of my files that I like to access from multiple locations. I mostly use Google Drive’s storage for many of those files. I also use online backup for some of my critical documents in case of a computer crash. Dustin Miller is a general partner of Cold Snap Technology in Eveleth, MN.

(AAPL), Groupon Inc (GRPN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY) Options activity provides a look at expectations on AAPL, BMY and GRPN By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Feb 16, 2017, 9:08 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is Going to $30 This Year Don’t Count Out Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Just Yet Monday’s Vital Data: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), Twitter Inc (TWTR) and Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI) Recent Posts: Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Groupon Inc (GRPN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY) Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is Going to $30 This Year Wednesday’s Vital Data: Micron Technology, Inc. (MU), Cisco Systems, Inc (CSCO) and Twitter Inc (TWTR) View All Posts U.S. stock futures are feeling the heat this morning, and Wall Street is set to take a breather following the longest record-setting winning streak in nearly 25 years. All three of the major market indices are up, on average, 1.6% so far this week, driven by positive economic data, President Donald Trump’s promises for a massive tax plan and Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s hints at a March interest rate hike. The euphoria has some analysts saying the market has come too far too fast. As a result, futures on the S&P 500 are down 0.17% heading into the open, followed by Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, off 0.15%, and Nasdaq-100 futures, which have shed a mere 0.02% at last check. On the options front, volume surged to a near-term high on Wednesday, as roughly 20.5 million calls and 16.7 million puts changed hands on the session. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio ticked higher to 0.58, while the 10-day moving average edged lower to another one-month low of 0.65. Turning to Wednesday’s volume leaders, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) overtook Samsung as the No. 1 smartphone seller in the fourth quarter, though it took quite a bit of effort to get there. Elsewhere, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) rallied for a second straight session amid heavy call options volume and rumors of a potential takeover bid. Finally, Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN) posted stronger-than-expected earnings and revealed that Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) has taken a 5.7% stake in the company. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Apple is once again back at the top of the smartphone market, according to the latest data from Gartner Research. Apple sold 77 million smartphones in the quarter, edging out Samsung’s 76.8 million units sold. While the headline is impressive, it took headline-news-worthy battery issues for Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and the withdrawal of the Galaxy Note 7 from store shelves to boost Apple into the top spot. For AAPL options traders, however, a win is a win. The stock saw volume soar to 1.35 million contracts on Wednesday, with calls snapping up an above average 65% of the day’s take. But not everyone has bought into the AAPL hype, as the March put/call open interest ratio of 1.44 ranks near the upper echelons of its annual range, with puts easily outnumbering calls among options set to expire within the next month. Peak put OI for the month totals 41,000 contracts at the March $130 strike, with another 32,000 open at the $100 strike. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY) Rumors tend to emerge in the wake of product failures — a situation that is especially true in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets. Bristol-Myers stock has shed some 30% in the past several months after reporting that a promising cancer drug had failed to meet its endpoints in clinical trials. The company’s weakness has spawned rumors that that Roche, Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) are actively exploring a BMY takeover, with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) also said to be considering a deal.

I Have the Answer! The debate among experts is whether you should own AAPL stock, or simply make money trading it By Nicolas Chahine, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Feb 16, 2017, 9:39 am EST     Popular Posts: Take Tesla Inc (TSLA) Profits, Pour Them Into Twitter Inc (TWTR) Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Can Double Your Money Get a Free Refill on Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Recent Posts: How Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Can Deliver More Free Profits Go Long Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) Stock for Free Trade Apple, Inc. or Own It? I Have the Answer! View All Posts We’ve all heard the argument that it’s wrong to trade Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Many prominent experts rage over those who dare to trade around the price action of AAPL stock. It is confusing to investors to figure out who is wrong. Sure, I could spend a few hours parsing data and calculating returns while making assumptions of entry and exit spots. Or, I can accept the fact that they are both right to a degree. Source: Shutterstock On the one hand, it is undeniable that owning Apple stock for decades has been a winning proposition. But so was trading around the chop. It comes down to what works for each us individually. Most investors enter positions but get stopped out when things go wrong. So I will refrain from judging which group is smarter. I found neutral ground using AAPL options. I commit to Apple long-term, especially when it falls out of favor, and leave myself room for error. I do so with no money out of pocket, thereby rendering my risk to a fraction of owning the stock. Last month, I created $5 per contract out of thin air trading AAPL stock when it had appeared to be too late. Even more recently, I repeated for another $1.2 yield in mere days. This strategy is easy to do on equities that are solid and what some would consider sure things like AAPL or Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). I am less easy about doing this with say Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). With stocks that are perceived to be risky, such as Netflix, I would need to be pickier with my entry and exit points. Today, I want to repeat performance regardless of which whale bought Apple or who sold it. How to Trade AAPL Stock Here The Trade – Long AAPL: Sell the AAPL 2018 $105 put for $2.70 to open. The 22% price buffer from current levels translate into a 90% theoretical chance of success. I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own AAPL stock at the strike sold. Some investors prefer spreading the risk into a credit put spread instead, and that works too. Click to Enlarge I have been a longtime harsh critic of Tim Cook, so I don’t count myself as an AAPL bull, but I do know how to do math. Apple’s valuation makes sense at $100 or even $200 per share given current conditions. So I do trust selling risk against that fact rather than chase hope that Tim Cook is able to grow the company. For now, he has a boulder that is hard to stop, and I can count on buyers to support the price. I realize that markets are at all-time highs and precariously perched. So I could buy sacrifice puts in AAPL stock to guard against a market crash. For example, I could spend 20 cents buying the AAPL Jun $100 put to limit my loss if we fall off a cliff in the next four months. I am not required to hold my trades through expiration. I can close it for partial gains or losses at any time. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

Not only that, the display will be made of a flexible panel just like the Samsung Galaxy line. However, a new report seems to claim that the iPhone OLED displays will be even better than before. According to KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 8 will feature an impressive pixel density for its OLED display. The said display, according to Kuo, will have a resolution of 2800×1242 pixels. With the screen size of 5.8 inches, this results to a pixel density of around 521 pixels per inch. To put this into perspective, the current iPhone 7 has a pixel density of 325 ppi. Even when compared to the iPhone 7 Plus with its 401 ppi pixel density, the iPhone 8 is still the sure winner. iPhone 8 concept by Moe Slah (via youtube.com) Although the iPhone 8 will have a 5.8-inch OLED panel, according to Kuo, the active display area is only 5.15 inches. With that in mind, it would seem that the actual pixel density is around 512 ppi. Even though it is a bit smaller than the full screen density, it is still massive compared to its predecessor. Kuo also pointed out that Apple is moving to replace the home button altogether. Earlier this year, there were reports that the physical home button will be replaced by a virtual home button. However, Kuo seemed to contradict that by saying that instead of a virtual home button, Apple will implement a virtual function area. The virtual function area is situated below the active screen and would measure approximately 1125×320 pixels. Unfortunately, apart from the approximate size, nothing much is known about the virtual function area. On the face of it, it seems that Apple is trying to reimagine much of the design specs for the iPhone 8. The increased pixel density would mean that it will have quite a powerful CPU and GPU. This is to compensate for all the display processing needs. Furthermore, it may also increase the system RAM by a considerable amount. To support all the pixels that have been added to the display. Then again, it is important to note that these are mere speculations done by people who have followed Apple diligently. However, one cannot discount that Kuo, along with other analysts, have been on the spot when it comes to their predictions. Nevertheless, consumers are encouraged to take these reports with a grain of salt. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News With Samsung chief Jay Lee in jail, one-time mentor seen taking charge With Samsung chief Jay Lee in jail, one-time mentor seen taking charge With Samsung chief Jay Y Lee being arrested, Choi Gee-sung who is the No 2 lieutenant at the group will take charge By: Reuters | Seoul,south Korea | Updated: February 17, 2017 10:53 am Samsung Group scion Jay Y Lee on bribery charges could hamper decisions on strategic investments and acquisitions at the sprawling conglomerate. (Image source: AP) The arrest of Samsung Group scion Jay Y Lee on bribery charges could hamper decisions on strategic investments and acquisitions at the sprawling conglomerate, insiders and former executives say, even with a strong leadership bench at its many businesses. Although business at flagship Samsung Electronics is humming along, big calls will need to be made and the man most likely to be called upon to make them is Choi Gee-sung, the No 2 lieutenant at Samsung Group and a mentor to Lee. “Choi is very experienced and has done a good job. He is the one best placed to manage group-level affairs in Lee’s absence,” said one Samsung insider. While Samsung Electronics is still smarting from the debacle of its exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphone batteries, its semiconductor business is in rude health. Its share price is up around 60 percent in the past year. But the wide-ranging probe, part of a corruption scandal that led parliament to impeach South Korean President Park Geun-hye, has been a major distraction for the country’s largest conglomerate, or chaebol. Watch all our videos from Express Technology “Everything has virtually stopped,” said a second executive at Samsung Group’s powerful strategy office that Choi heads. “We’re mainly focusing on the prosecutor’s investigation (into Lee and Samsung)… We’ll be running an emergency plan and everything will be under Choi’s control for now.” But some others say even Choi’s role could be limited and Samsung may have to rely more on each affiliate’s top management, with Choi also under investigation by special prosecutors. “Since we’ve decided to dismantle group strategy office, Choi’s role is likely to gradually decrease, although we can’t say for how much and when,” another Samsung executive said. A fourth group insider said: “We have a system in place with professional management teams, so in terms of the day-to-day operations things should be fine.” The arrest of Lee, 48, will have an impact on longer-term investment decisions at the sprawling conglomerate. (Image source: AP ) None of the Samsung individuals wanted to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. “It’s not like Samsung businesses will grind to a halt. There are many smart people at the company,” said Kim Yong-serk, a former Samsung Electronics executive who is now a professor at Sungkyunkwan University. But the arrest of Lee, 48, will have an impact on longer-term investment decisions at the sprawling conglomerate. “Samsung presidents are evaluated on an annual basis, so they can’t make bold bets about the future. They need a chairman for that,” Kim said. Samsung declined to comment on its management plans or Choi’s role. BEATING APPLE When Samsung Electronics still trailed Nokia in mobile phones – just five years ago – Choi, then CEO, set his sights on a different rival. “Competition is coming from elsewhere. There’s a company more profitable than us and we should change our target,” he told Reuters in January 2012, referring to Apple Inc. That year, Samsung ended Nokia’s 14-year domination of the mobile market, ultimately also overtaking Apple as the world’s biggest smartphone maker. In a Samsung career spanning more than three decades, Choi has worked in all the main businesses, from semiconductors and home appliances to TVs and telecoms, before taking over as chief executive. As head of strategy, 66-year-old Choi has acted as Jay Y Lee’s mentor and been closely involved in preparing the path for him to take over from his father, who was incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014. Lee’s absence, ahead of what could be a lengthy trial, could also see a bigger role for Kwon Oh-hyun, Samsung Electronics’ vice chairman and current CEO. (Image source: AP) Under Choi’s guidance, Lee has moved closer to succeeding his father in a well-choreographed long-term plan, including a restructuring of the conglomerate to cement the Lee family’s control. However, that plan included a controversial $8 billion merger of two Samsung units that has been central to prosecutors’ case against the group, and Lee. Prosecutors accuse Samsung of paying bribes totalling 43 billion won ($37.74 million) to organizations linked to South Korean President Park Geun-hye’s friend, Choi Soon-sil, to secure government backing for the merger. Choi Gee-sung and his deputy Chang Choong-ki were quizzed by prosecutors over their role in the deal. STEP UP FOR ‘MR CHIP’, TOO? Lee’s absence, ahead of what could be a lengthy trial, could also see a bigger role for Kwon Oh-hyun, Samsung Electronics’ vice chairman and current CEO. Known as “Mr Chip”, Kwon has overseen the growth of Samsung’s component business, which now generates much of the firm’s profits. “Kwon is very practical manager. Like many Samsung managers in the component business, he doesn’t feel comfortable (in the limelight),” said an executive who worked with him. Kwon, who studied electrical engineering at Seoul National University and at Stanford, cemented Samsung’s position in memory chips and expanded the contract chip manufacturing business, producing chips that power the Apple iPhone. But, for all the experience and qualities these senior managers bring, Lee’s absence will still be felt. Lee had been instrumental in seeking to drive growth through new businesses, including signing off on South Korea’s biggest outbound deal: an $8 billion acquisition of U.S. auto electronics maker Harman International Industries. “The biggest problem is that Lee is the one who sets the direction of Samsung as a whole,” the fourth group insider said. “He doesn’t get into every business decision, but he’s the one who has to sign off on major investments or acquisitions… That’s why he can’t easily be replaced.” Tags: Samsung Election 2017 UP elections 2017: Akhilesh vs Shivpal wide open on family turf Uttar Pradesh elections 2017: Unsure about western UP, BJP wants more of Modi UP elections 2017: Azam Khan invokes 2002 riots to attack PM Modi Best of Express Govt slams opposition for politics over Army Chief's 'tough action' in Valley remarks EntertainmentRunning Shaadi movie review: Taapsee Pannu film huffs and puffs to finishing line EntertainmentAnushka Sharma, Virat Kohli fans, their new selfies will make you drop a beat.

Stock: Services Here's why you shouldn't be overlooking this key catalyst. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Feb 16, 2017 at 9:31PM With the iPhone providing 64% of trailing 12-month revenue at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the tech giant's business is still primarily driven by that segment. But it doesn't mean investors should overlook Apple's other business segments. One is standing out more than ever: the company's App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and other services. Apple's App Store drives the majority of services revenue. Image source: Apple. 1. $7.2 billion: In Apple's most recent quarter, quarterly services revenue hit an all-time high of $7.2 billion -- up 18% year over year, handily exceeding Apple's overall revenue growth of 3% and beating growth in any other segment. But even this growth in Apple's services segment understates how rapidly services revenue is growing. Apple CFO Luca Maestri explained the discrepancy between reported growth and actual segment growth in the company's first-quarter earnings call: Our run rate growth was actually higher when taking into account two discrete items. On one hand, the 14th week added to Services revenue this December quarter. On the other hand, that benefit was more than offset by the comparison to the one-off $548 million patent infringement payment included in Services revenue a year ago. 2. 9.2%: Apple's services segment is growing as a proportion of total revenue. In the company's most recent quarter, services accounted for 9.2% of total revenue, up from 8% in the year-ago quarter and 6.4% in the same quarter two years ago. 3. 43%: Adjusting for the extra week in Apple's first quarter this year, App Store revenue soared 43% year over year, shattering all previous records. This was driven by growth both in average revenue per paying account and in the total number of paying accounts. As Maestri was sure to mention, Apple's App Store revenue growth outpaced the overall app industry, and more than doubled 2016 revenue from Alphabet's Google Play store. Going forward, Maestri believes "the App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth." 4. $3 billion: If you had any doubts about the importance of the App Store to Apple's services segment, wonder no longer: It's critical. Apple said fiscal first-quarter App Store revenue was $3 billion in December alone. 5. $60 billion: Based on the trajectory of developer revenue in 2016, the business of apps is just getting started. Apple's developer community has now raked in $60 billion in earnings, garnering over $20 billion just in 2016. 6. Over 150 million subscriptions: Between Apple's own subscription services and third-party content subscriptions offered through the App Store, the company has more than 150 million paid customer subscriptions. Apple Music. Image source: Apple. 7. $51 billion: What kind of growth should investors expect from Apple's services segment? The business could double over the next four years, according to Apple management. This would bring annual services revenue to a staggering $51 billion in 2020. While these figures alone make a great case for investors to pay close attention to Apple's services segment, the very nature of Apple's services themselves justify the segment's importance. Unlike the unpredictable nature of focused product revenue from iPhone, Mac, and iPad, services revenue is more sustainable, stable, and predictable. Further, it's a solid measure of the degree to which a growing number of customers are becoming increasingly invested in Apple's powerful ecosystem of hardware, software, and services.

TECHNOLOGY Nonstop Innovation Is Why Snap Won't End Up Like Twitter The maker of Snapchat has shown a penchant for innovation since its founding in 2011. By Salvador Rodriguez Salvador Rodriguez is a staff reporter for the San Francisco bureau of Inc. He covers Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, tech diversity, virtual reality, and other aspects of technology and entrepreneurship. Previously, Rodriguez was the Silicon Valley correspondent for the International Business Times; before that, he was the lead tech blogger and gadget reviewer for the Los Angeles Times. Rodriguez has interned with The New York Times in Arizona, The Arizona Republic, and the Houston Chronicle. He was born in Mexico and raised in Texas, and he earned his journalism degrees at Arizona State University. One of his special skills is the ability to name all the Super Bowl winners chronologically from memory. @sal19 Staff reporter, Inc.@sal19 WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The biggest problem with Twitter is that it's never had much innovation, an analyst once told me. "If you used Twitter the first day it existed and then slipped into a coma for eight years and woke up today, you'd recognize the platform. It looks very much the same," then-Forrester Research analyst Nate Elliott told me in early 2015. "While Facebook innovates every day and constantly offers users new ways to engage on the site, Twitter's basically the same exact thing it's always been." I'm reminded of this conversation -- which is just as apt today as it was two years ago -- as I read headlines from reporters and analysts who are quick to compare Snap Inc. to Twitter. The premise of the comparison is a recent slowing in Snapchat's user growth disclosed in the company's S-1 filing. To some minds, this deceleration is reminiscent of Twitter, which has demonstrated little ability to increase its user base since first going public in late 2013. That's where the comparison starts and stops, because weak user growth in and of itself isn't a problem. It just seems that way because it's often a symptom of the real problem: a tech company's inability to create innovative new features and products. That's a problem Snap doesn't have under CEO Evan Spiegel, who has proved time and again he is all about making things new. On that score, Twitter and Snap couldn't be more different. As Elliott pointed out two years ago, Twitter hasn't changed much since it first came into existence in 2006. To this day, Twitter is a service based on 140-character messages that you see in a reverse-chronological timeline. Certainly, Twitter has added little wrinkles here and there -- you can now watch NFL games live on the service, there's some algorithmic surfacing of tweets deemed relevant to your interests, and if you wish to avoid online harassment, you can mute whatever terms offend you. But by and large, Twitter is as it always has been, a place where you can send out micro-messages to the world. Twitter has been so afraid to reinvent itself that it is now practically on life support as a result. Snapchat, on the other hand, is a drastically different app than it was even just a few years ago, and as a company, it has completely changed. When Snapchat was first going mainstream in 2012 and 2013, it was largely known as "that sexting app." Its primary purpose was to send your friends photos and videos that you didn't want hanging around. You couldn't read a story about Snapchat without reading the word "ephemeral." Practically none of those characterizations can be used to describe Snapchat today Just look at one of the additions to Snapchat in the last year: Memories. This feature is the exact antithesis of what Snapchat was five years ago. Back then, you wanted your snaps to go away. Now, Snapchat makes it easy for you to share an old photo or video. This kind of innovation is no anomaly. Since 2012, Snapchat has changed the premise of its app over and over again. In 2013, it added Stories so you could broadcast your daily activities with all of your friends for 24 hours. In 2015, the app introduced Discover, giving its users a new way to access media. And last year, Snapchat rebranded itself as Snap when it introduced Spectacles, its first foray into hardware. It's not likely to be the last, with Spiegel now calling Snap a camera company, not a social media or messaging service. Time and again, Spiegel has spotted where user behavior is heading and placed Snap in a position to benefit from it. This is something Twitter has largely been unable to master. Even when Twitter has noticed an opportunity, it has always tripped after gaining a head start -- I'm talking about bite-size videos (see: Vine) and live streaming (see: Periscope). When Sony Pictures was hacked in 2014, some leaked emails involved Snapchat. It showed that the company had paid tens of millions of dollars in three acquisitions: one was Scan.me, a QR code scanning company, another was AddLive, a real-time video chat startup, and the third was Vergence Labs, which made technology similar to that of Google Glass. Scan.me and AddLive were turned into features for Snapchat, and Vergence Labs was clearly a predecessor for Spectacles. In this respect, Spiegel has shown he possesses vision and an ability to spot talent and pull the trigger on important acquisitions that merits comparisons to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Without a doubt, Snap has its challenges. It's concerning that such a young app could already be facing user-growth problems. It's troubling just how fiercely Facebook is attacking Snapchat, and it's alarming that Spiegel and co-founder Bobby Murphy do not want to give shareholders any voting power whatsoever. Snap must overcome these issues, but as analysts and investors comb through the company's S-1 filing for nits, it's important to keep in mind what Spiegel and Snap have already shown when it comes to innovation.

One of the most prevalent rumors is that the Touch ID button is going the way of the headphone jack. Analysts and others suggest iris scanning will be in. Still other rumors say a new feature using 3-D laser scanning will enable augmented reality (AR). Based on what Apple CEO Tim Cook has said about AR, though, I suspect the 3-D sensing will actually be used for facial recognition. Let me explain. Facial recognition maps points on your face. Credit: eForensics Magazine What Does Mr. Cook Say About Augmented Reality? In a recent interview with The Independent, Mr. Cook explained how excited he was about AR. He told The Independent that AR has “resonance,” because it helps individuals be present in the world while still allowing for an improvement on what’s going on around them. Still, Mr. Cook seemed to indicate that the technology behind AR wasn’t quite ready for the iPhone. He said, I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it’s not a product per se, it’s a core technology. But there are things to discover before that technology is good enough for the mainstream. If AR technology isn’t yet good enough for the mainstream, it seems pretty unlikely that it’s ready for the iPhone 8. So, what would the 3-D sensing technology rumored to be in the next-generation handset be utilized for? The Patents tell us Even More Whenever Apple is about to release some sort of new technology into its mobile devices or computers, we tend to see a flurry of patent filings. In addition, we often hear about Apple buying some company that’s already heavily involved in that technology. To this point, though, we haven’t seen Apple file any patents for iris scanning technology. Nor has Cupertino made any investments yet into iris scanning. All we’ve got is a trademark for “Iris Engine,” which is a big part of why folks seem to think an iris scanner will replace Touch ID. On the other hand, Apple filed a patent application back in 2011 for a facial recognition system that could be used to unlock an encrypted device. We’ve also seen Cupertino invest several years of time and resources into facial recognition. As Jeff Gamet pointed out, Cupertino has purchased at least three companies within the past seven years that were deep in facial recognition technology. What 3-D Sensing can do for Facial Recognition To really understand where I’m going here, you need to know what 3-D laser scanning, or 3-D sensing, is able to do. The idea behind 3-D laser scanning is to create a non-contact, non-destructive technology to digitally capture the shape of a physical object. In facial recognition, it would create a digital matrix of points that define what a person’s face looks like. It would enable your phone to remember the shape of your chin more precisely than a photograph can allow for, for example. The texture of your skin could also be captured. So could the unique shapes that make up your forehead, cheeks, and every other part of your face. This technology could also be used for iris scanning, but it’s overkill. You don’t need 3-D laser scanning for iris recognition. The unique features of the iris can be established with a camera operating in the near-infrared wavelength band. The Case for Faces Instead of Eyes Apple already has experience with facial recognition, courtesy of Photos on iOS and macOS. It seems like that technology could be ready for broader use. We’ve also got a patent filing, albeit a six-year-old one. Finally, there’s this 3-D sense technology that will possibly come to play within the iPhone 8. The 3-D sense technology isn’t needed for iris recognition. Tim Cook has seemed to suggest that AR isn’t ready for mainstream yet. Facial recognition seems to be the most obvious reason for the iPhone 8 to have 3-D sense technology. Only time will tell, of course. We’ll keep digging deep into the rumors that we hear about, and let you know what we think.

As detailed by Recode, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai believes that access to FM radios in smartphones is a public safety issue. Speaking to the North American Broadcasters Association yesterday, Pai explained that access to the FM radio capabilities in smartphones would increase public safety as radio is a reliable source of information in situations where internet and/or cellphone networks are inaccessible. This includes situations such as severe weather and other natural disasters. While Pai is an advocate for access to the FM capabilities of smartphones, we shouldn’t expect immediate change. Pai explained that, being a believer in free markets, he can’t support a government mandate requiring access to the chips and thus hopes that the issue will sort itself out in the marketplace. As a believer in free markets and the rule of law, I cannot support a government mandate requiring activation of these chips. I don’t believe the FCC has the power to issue a mandate like that, and more generally I believe it’s best to sort this issue out in the marketplace. Users have long called out manufacturers to switch FM radio chips on in devices. The National Association of Broadcasters publicly requested that Apple enable user access to the capability, while a petition last year gained steam but ultimately had no bearing on the industry. The decision to open the FM chip to users is one that largely lies with manufacturers at this point. Carriers have done so on devices where manufactures agree, but Apple remains a holdout and restricts access to FM functionalities. Even though Pai is a supporter of opening up the FM chip, we shouldn’t expect any swift action to be taken on his part. It’s up to Apple to enable the feature and Pai has made it clear he won’t force the company to do so. Would you use the FM chip if it was activated? Let us know down in the comments.

Photos Videos Topics Live NZ 107/10 (14.5) - SA 185/6 (20) Live AUS 30/0 (4.1) - SL (Yet to bat) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Rahul Gandhi Sasikala Assembly Elections 2017 UP Elections 2017 Raees Home Money With Samsung chief in jail, one-time mentor seen taking charge Shares1 Fri, 17 Feb 2017-09:18am , Reuters The arrest of Samsung Group scion Jay Y. Lee on bribery charges could hamper decisions on strategic investments and acquisitions at the sprawling conglomerate, insiders and former executives say, even with a strong leadership bench at its many businesses. Although business at flagship Samsung Electronics is humming along, big calls will need to be made and the man most likely to be called upon to make them is Choi Gee-sung, the No.2 lieutenant at Samsung Group and a mentor to Lee. "Choi is very experienced and has done a good job. He is the one best placed to manage group-level affairs in Lee's absence," said one Samsung insider. While Samsung Electronics is still smarting from the debacle of its exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphone batteries, its semiconductor business is in rude health. Its share price is up around 60 percent in the past year. But the wide-ranging probe, part of a corruption scandal that led parliament to impeach South Korean President Park Geun-hye, has been a major distraction for the country's largest conglomerate, or chaebol. "Everything has virtually stopped," said a second executive at Samsung Group's powerful strategy office that Choi heads. "We're mainly focusing on the prosecutor's investigation (into Lee and Samsung)... We'll be running an emergency plan and everything will be under Choi's control for now." But some others say even Choi's role could be limited and Samsung may have to rely more on each affiliate's top management, with Choi also under investigation by special prosecutors. "Since we've decided to dismantle group strategy office, Choi's role is likely to gradually decrease, although we can't say for how much and when," another Samsung executive said. A fourth group insider said: "We have a system in place with professional management teams, so in terms of the day-to-day operations things should be fine." None of the Samsung individuals wanted to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. "It's not like Samsung businesses will grind to a halt. There are many smart people at the company," said Kim Yong-serk, a former Samsung Electronics executive who is now a professor at Sungkyunkwan University. But arrest of Lee, 48, will have an impact on longer-term investment decisions at the sprawling conglomerate. "Samsung presidents are evaluated on an annual basis, so they can't make bold bets about the future. They need a chairman for that," Kim said. Samsung declined to comment on its management plans or Choi's role. BEATING APPLE When Samsung Electronics still trailed Nokia in mobile phones - just five years ago - Choi, then CEO, set his sights on a different rival. "Competition is coming from elsewhere. There's a company more profitable than us and we should change our target," he told Reuters in January 2012, referring to Apple Inc. That year, Samsung ended Nokia's 14-year domination of the mobile market, ultimately also overtaking Apple as the world's biggest smartphone maker. In a Samsung career spanning more than three decades, Choi has worked in all the main businesses, from semiconductors and home appliances to TVs and telecoms, before taking over as chief executive. As head of strategy, 66-year-old Choi has acted as Jay Y. Lee's mentor and been closely involved in preparing the path for him to take over from his father, who was incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014. Under Choi's guidance, Lee has moved closer to succeeding his father in a well-choreographed long-term plan, including a restructuring of the conglomerate to cement the Lee family's control. However, that plan included a controversial $8 billion merger of two Samsung units that has been central to prosecutors' case against the group, and Lee. Prosecutors accuse Samsung of paying bribes totalling 43 billion won ($37.74 million) to organizations linked to South Korean President Park Geun-hye's friend, Choi Soon-sil, to secure government backing for the merger. Choi Gee-sung and his deputy Chang Choong-ki were quizzed by prosecutors over their role in the deal. STEP UP FOR 'MR CHIP', TOO? Lee's absence, ahead of what could be a lengthy trial, could also see a bigger role for Kwon Oh-hyun, Samsung Electronics' vice chairman and current CEO. Known as "Mr Chip", Kwon has overseen the growth of Samsung's component business, which now generates much of the firm's profits. "Kwon is very practical manager. Like many Samsung managers in the component business, he doesn't feel comfortable (in the limelight)," said an executive who worked with him. Kwon, who studied electrical engineering at Seoul National University and at Stanford, cemented Samsung's position in memory chips and expanded the contract chip manufacturing business, producing chips that power the Apple iPhone. But, for all the experience and qualities these senior managers bring, Lee's absence will still be felt. Lee had been instrumental in seeking to drive growth through new businesses, including signing off on South Korea's biggest outbound deal: an $8 billion acquisition of U.S. auto electronics maker Harman International Industries. "The biggest problem is that Lee is the one who sets the direction of Samsung as a whole," the fourth group insider said.

Lee on bribery charges could hamper decisions on strategic investments and acquisitions at the sprawling conglomerate, insiders and former executives say, even with a strong leadership bench at its many businesses. Although business at flagship Samsung Electronics is humming along, big calls will need to be made and the man most likely to be called upon to make them is Choi Gee-sung, the No.2 lieutenant at Samsung Group and a mentor to Lee. "Choi is very experienced and has done a good job. He is the one best placed to manage group-level affairs in Lee's absence," said one Samsung insider. While Samsung Electronics is still smarting from the debacle of its exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphone batteries, its semiconductor business is in rude health. Its share price is up around 60 percent in the past year. But the wide-ranging probe, part of a corruption scandal that led parliament to impeach South Korean President Park Geun-hye, has been a major distraction for the country's largest conglomerate, or chaebol. "Everything has virtually stopped," said a second executive at Samsung Group's powerful strategy office that Choi heads. "We're mainly focusing on the prosecutor's investigation (into Lee and Samsung)... We'll be running an emergency plan and everything will be under Choi's control for now." But some others say even Choi's role could be limited and Samsung may have to rely more on each affiliate's top management, with Choi also under investigation by special prosecutors. "Since we've decided to dismantle group strategy office, Choi's role is likely to gradually decrease, although we can't say for how much and when," another Samsung executive said. A fourth group insider said: "We have a system in place with professional management teams, so in terms of the day-to-day operations things should be fine." None of the Samsung individuals wanted to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. "It's not like Samsung businesses will grind to a halt. There are many smart people at the company," said Kim Yong-serk, a former Samsung Electronics executive who is now a professor at Sungkyunkwan University. But arrest of Lee, 48, will have an impact on longer-term investment decisions at the sprawling conglomerate. "Samsung presidents are evaluated on an annual basis, so they can't make bold bets about the future. They need a chairman for that," Kim said. Samsung declined to comment on its management plans or Choi's role. BEATING APPLE When Samsung Electronics still trailed Nokia in mobile phones - just five years ago - Choi, then CEO, set his sights on a different rival. "Competition is coming from elsewhere. There's a company more profitable than us and we should change our target," he told Reuters in January 2012, referring to Apple Inc. That year, Samsung ended Nokia's 14-year domination of the mobile market, ultimately also overtaking Apple as the world's biggest smartphone maker. In a Samsung career spanning more than three decades, Choi has worked in all the main businesses, from semiconductors and home appliances to TVs and telecoms, before taking over as chief executive. As head of strategy, 66-year-old Choi has acted as Jay Y. Lee's mentor and been closely involved in preparing the path for him to take over from his father, who was incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014. Under Choi's guidance, Lee has moved closer to succeeding his father in a well-choreographed long-term plan, including a restructuring of the conglomerate to cement the Lee family's control. However, that plan included a controversial $8 billion merger of two Samsung units that has been central to prosecutors' case against the group, and Lee. Prosecutors accuse Samsung of paying bribes totalling 43 billion won ($37.74 million) to organizations linked to South Korean President Park Geun-hye's friend, Choi Soon-sil, to secure government backing for the merger. Choi Gee-sung and his deputy Chang Choong-ki were quizzed by prosecutors over their role in the deal. STEP UP FOR 'MR CHIP', TOO? Lee's absence, ahead of what could be a lengthy trial, could also see a bigger role for Kwon Oh-hyun, Samsung Electronics' vice chairman and current CEO. Known as "Mr Chip", Kwon has overseen the growth of Samsung's component business, which now generates much of the firm's profits. "Kwon is very practical manager. Like many Samsung managers in the component business, he doesn't feel comfortable (in the limelight)," said an executive who worked with him. Kwon, who studied electrical engineering at Seoul National University and at Stanford, cemented Samsung's position in memory chips and expanded the contract chip manufacturing business, producing chips that power the Apple iPhone. But, for all the experience and qualities these senior managers bring, Lee's absence will still be felt. Lee had been instrumental in seeking to drive growth through new businesses, including signing off on South Korea's biggest outbound deal: an $8 billion acquisition of U.S. auto electronics maker Harman International Industries. "The biggest problem is that Lee is the one who sets the direction of Samsung as a whole," the fourth group insider said. "He doesn't get into every business decision, but he's the one who has to sign off on major investments or acquisitions... That's why he can't easily be replaced."

As with the first one, Metallica are featured, but instead of singing “Master of Puppets,” they’re going against type with Rihanna‘s “Diamonds in the Sky.” You can watch the clip above, and it also features, among others, country star Blake Shelton and Chelsea Handler belting out Bon Jovi‘s “Livin’ on a Prayer” in a bar. The show, which will premiere exclusively through Apple Music, is an expansion on the viral video series that began on The Late, Late Show With James Corden. Metallica’s segment throws actor/comedian Billy Eichner (Difficult People, Parks and Recreation) into the mix. The five of them made headlines two months ago when they were caught by TMZ going into a supermarket and breaking into “Enter Sandman” at the deli counter. At the time, it was believed they were filming an episode of Eichner’s show Billy on the Street. Corden, who serves as one of the executive producers, has lined up an impressive group of A-list guests for his show. In addition to Metallica and Shelton, the trailer hints at appearances by John Legend, Alicia Keys, Will Smith and Ariana Grande. They’re not restricting the cast to singers, either. NFL Hall of Famer Michael Strahan, professional wrestler John Cena and basketball legend Shaquille O’Neal are also in the mix, with the latter two humorously struggling to fit into the car. It is not yet known when Apple plans to officially debut the series.

By Brendan Cole February 17, 2017 03:09 GMT Andrew Wakefield after a hearing at the General Medical Council (GMC) in 2010 after it ruled he acted unethically in doing his research into a link between MMR vaccinations and autism.Reuters Campaigners and scientists have called on Amazon and Apple to remove from their services an anti-vaccination documentary made by a discredited doctor who falsely links vaccines with autism. The film, titled Vaxxed, has been put on sale on iTunes, Amazon Instant Video and Vimeo and is directed by Andrew Wakefeld, who was struck off in 2010 for his fraudulent claims that linked autism with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Now a member of the "anti-vaxxer" movement in the US, there are concerns among scientists that Wakefield is spearheading a campaign that could hamper vaccination programmes in Europe. Edzard Ernst, professor emeritus of complementary medicine at Exeter university, told The Times that Wakefield's data had been proven to be wrong and that his view that people should not be vaccinated risked public health. "Any company or person trying to make money by alarming people and thus endangering public health is not just unethical and immoral but also despicable and irresponsible," he said. Founder of the pro-science charity Good Thinking, Simon Singh also said the film should be withdrawn, adding: "If they are willing to put profit above public health then they are free to do so but it would be hugely disappointing". A doctor prepares an MMR injection in the Paediatric Outpatients department at Morriston Hospital in Swansea (Reuters) The film, which has made $1.1m (£930,000) at the box office, was screened in London this week and will be showed around the country. It alleges that data was covered up linking vaccines with autism. The claims by Wakefield are thought to have stopped many children from being vaccinated. The film was pulled from the Tribeca Film Festival in New York in 2016 over its controversial claims. Helen Bedford, professor of child public health at University College London, said the film lacks any credible scientific evidence. "In contrast there is significant, solid scientific evidence of no link between the MRR vaccine and autism from studies around the world." While Apple and Amazon did not comment, Vimeo said its platform was an open one, which meant any filmmaker or distribution company could sell videos directly to the public, The Times reported.

Stock: Services Here's why you shouldn't be overlooking this key catalyst. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Feb 16, 2017 at 9:31PM With the iPhone providing 64% of trailing 12-month revenue at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the tech giant's business is still primarily driven by that segment. But it doesn't mean investors should overlook Apple's other business segments. One is standing out more than ever: the company's App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and other services. Apple's App Store drives the majority of services revenue. Image source: Apple. 1. $7.2 billion: In Apple's most recent quarter, quarterly services revenue hit an all-time high of $7.2 billion -- up 18% year over year, handily exceeding Apple's overall revenue growth of 3% and beating growth in any other segment. But even this growth in Apple's services segment understates how rapidly services revenue is growing. Apple CFO Luca Maestri explained the discrepancy between reported growth and actual segment growth in the company's first-quarter earnings call: Our run rate growth was actually higher when taking into account two discrete items. On one hand, the 14th week added to Services revenue this December quarter. On the other hand, that benefit was more than offset by the comparison to the one-off $548 million patent infringement payment included in Services revenue a year ago. 2. 9.2%: Apple's services segment is growing as a proportion of total revenue. In the company's most recent quarter, services accounted for 9.2% of total revenue, up from 8% in the year-ago quarter and 6.4% in the same quarter two years ago. 3. 43%: Adjusting for the extra week in Apple's first quarter this year, App Store revenue soared 43% year over year, shattering all previous records. This was driven by growth both in average revenue per paying account and in the total number of paying accounts. As Maestri was sure to mention, Apple's App Store revenue growth outpaced the overall app industry, and more than doubled 2016 revenue from Alphabet's Google Play store. Going forward, Maestri believes "the App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth." 4. $3 billion: If you had any doubts about the importance of the App Store to Apple's services segment, wonder no longer: It's critical. Apple said fiscal first-quarter App Store revenue was $3 billion in December alone. 5. $60 billion: Based on the trajectory of developer revenue in 2016, the business of apps is just getting started. Apple's developer community has now raked in $60 billion in earnings, garnering over $20 billion just in 2016. 6. Over 150 million subscriptions: Between Apple's own subscription services and third-party content subscriptions offered through the App Store, the company has more than 150 million paid customer subscriptions. Apple Music. Image source: Apple. 7. $51 billion: What kind of growth should investors expect from Apple's services segment? The business could double over the next four years, according to Apple management. This would bring annual services revenue to a staggering $51 billion in 2020. While these figures alone make a great case for investors to pay close attention to Apple's services segment, the very nature of Apple's services themselves justify the segment's importance. Unlike the unpredictable nature of focused product revenue from iPhone, Mac, and iPad, services revenue is more sustainable, stable, and predictable. Further, it's a solid measure of the degree to which a growing number of customers are becoming increasingly invested in Apple's powerful ecosystem of hardware, software, and services.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Hearts Awards back in Apple Valley for second year Thursday Feb 16, 2017 at 5:48 PM Feb 16, 2017 at 5:48 PM By Joselyn VillalobosFor the Daily Press APPLE VALLEY — The Unforgettables Foundation returns to town for the second year Friday “recognizing the biggest hearts of the High Desert and mountain areas” via its second annual Unforgettable Hearts Awards ceremony. During the event, which is scheduled for 11:30 a.m., the nonprofit will showcase 30 individuals, businesses and charities that have lent a helping hand throughout the community. The Unforgettables Foundation works to aid low-income families, assisting with funeral costs for children who have died. Unforgettables Foundation founder Tim Evans wanted to hold the Hearts Awards to recognize others who have bettered the community in their own way. “The Hearts Awards are for the individuals, businesses and charities that have done caring and big-hearted things for children, families and seniors in our community,” Evans said. The 30 recipients were nominated by not only residents, but political figures as well. After the nominations were submitted, an Unforgettables Foundation committee consulted with past winners to choose who will receive this year’s awards. Desert View Funeral Home and Mead Mortuary were selected to receive the foundation’s most valued award this year, the Summer Austin Award. The award was named after a young girl who was killed in a car crash seven years ago. “They have been involved in our sector helping a lot of indigent cases for many years,” Evans said. “They have been very hands-on to help us be successful.” Though this is the second year the Unforgettables Hearts Awards is being held in the High Desert, the awards ceremony originally resided in Redlands for six years. Last year, Assemblyman Jay Obernolte and Rep. Paul Cook helped bring the awards to the High Desert. Last year, approximately 100 people who attended the ceremony. There are already 140 people signed up to attend this year. “It was a strong turnout,” Evans said. “It was an excellent event; we heard a lot of great feedback.” Obernolte and Senator Mike Morrell will be the keynote speakers for the afternoon. First District Supervisor Robert Lovingood and 3rd District Supervisor James Ramos will be co-emcees. There is an entrance fee of $65 at the door. The event will run from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and will be held at Apple Valley Conference Center, 14975 Dale Evans Parkway, Apple Valley.

The move could add up to £400 to the cost of a top-of-the range laptop, making Microsoft the latest foreign firm to blame the fall in the value of the pound for increasing prices. The jump follows similar moves by Apple and speaker maker Sonos, which saw the cost of computers, speakers and apps rise by as much as 25 per cent. Microsoft has blamed the falling value of the British pound in the wake of the Brexit vote Microsoft said it was adjusting the British pound prices of its hardware and software following the fall in the pound since the EU referendum. Sterling has fallen by about 16 per cent against the dollar since June last year. It has been a big boost for exporters as this has made British goods cheaper abroad. But it also means Microsoft – which reports in dollars - is making less money selling the same computer in the UK than it does in America. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Politicians should have been 'quicker and clearer' in... Business minister's crisis talks in Paris over threat to... Share this article Share Microsoft and Apple have earned criticism for passing this increase, which came into effect on Tuesday (Feb 15), on to consumers. A spokesman for Microsoft said: ‘These changes only affect products and services purchased by individuals, or organisations without volume licensing contracts. ‘For indirect sales where our products and services are sold through partners, final prices will continue to be determined by them.’ A Surface Book computer like the one pictured now costs £150 more than a week ago On the Microsoft online shop, its Surface Book computer now starts at £1,449 - up £150 from a week ago. Its top-end version of the laptop now costs £400 more. The American company, which employs more than 5,000 people in the UK, recently reported soaring profits. It spoke out in favour of Britain remaining part of the EU and has already increased the cost of its business software and cloud services in the UK. In October, Apple launched its new Mac computers along with a 20pc price hike. One computer, the Macbook Pro, saw its price jump by £500 overnight.

That little black box is the ultimate bargaining tool and you soon wonder how you ever lived without it. With the promise of “watching a family of pigs jump in muddy puddles” at the end, it’s amazing how easy those previously impossible tasks like nap time, bath time, and eating vegetables become to manage. However, like any addictive substance, it doesn’t take long for the shine to soon come off. Soon, that one episode turns to two, then three as you find yourself giving your child more TV, just so they can get the same ‘fix’. Meanwhile, you finally accept a problem when your 2-year-old starts walking around the house at every minute of the day demanding all his or her favourites. “I want Peppa Pig, Paw Patrol, Fireman Sam”… If this sounds familiar, you need help. What started as a healthy habit has spiralled down a very slippery slope.   The township of Adventure Bay decided that all emergency response and public works authorities should be at the command of a 10-year-old boy, with essential services carried out by a bunch of puppies… Is this the type of irresponsible and incompetent governance we should be teaching our kids?  The Australian Department of Health advises kids under the age of two get zero screen time, and psychologists agree, too much screen time can set up young kids for much bigger problems down the track. “Watching a screen at a young age can limit time for active play and learning, reduce opportunities for language development, reduce the length of time young kids can stay focused, and affect the development of the full range of eye movement,” the Department says. For kids aged two to five, less than an hour a day is recommended, with studies suggesting prolonged screen time can inhibit creativity, lead to slower development of language and social skills, and even lead to obesity. But how practical is it for the busy parent, fighting kids’ temper tantrums and boredom, especially at the shops, going to a restaurant, or just trying to make dinner or have a shower? Sydney mum Jenny, who has three young boys, including 23-month-old Noah, says zero screen time is “a little bit impractical,” but TV and tablets are not a big part of her kids’ lives. Noah gets up to an hour of screen time per day – usually a half an hour of TV in the morning while he has his milk, and sporadically throughout the rest day, when Jenny “needs to get something done.” “When it just gets too crazy and too busy, we’ll resort to it,” she said, “but there’ll be days when I don’t even think about putting on the TV.” She says playtime with toys on the floor can be a good alternative option, though typically Noah wants “a bit of interaction,” and if she’s cooking, she may put him up on the bench so he can get interested in the what’s going on.   Sydney mother of three Jenny and her toddler Noah, who she encourages to explore the world around him while out in public, rather than a zombie staring at a phone or tablet  Perhaps the most high profile parent who tried to limit his children’s time in front of technology, was Steve Jobs. In 2010, a New York Times journalist asked the Apple founder what his own children thought of the new iPad. To the reporter’s surprise, Jobs replied that they hadn’t ever used it, as he tried to limit the amount of technology that the kids had in the home. So if you have the man behind the iPad telling you that it isn’t good for his own kids… Should the rest of us feel that tablets are okay for ours? Jenny is one to say she’s foregone the tablet, especially when out. While it is an easy thing to do, plonk your kids in front of a screen, she says usually Noah is more interested in the food, the surroundings, and distractions of the restaurant. Studies overwhelming say real-world interactions are vital to healthy development of children Noah’s age.  Apple Founder Steve Jobs confessed his didn’t allow his children to have iPads, as he wanted to limit the amount of technology in the home  From birth to the age of three, children’s brains develop rapidly, are extremely sensitive to their surrounding environments, and need real-world stimuli to develop healthy neural networks. Being flooded by images and sounds from a screen can actually stunt proper development, as the brain is allowed to passively observe, instead of actively engage. As children get older, experts suggest the gradual introduction of TV and screen time, but still advise parents to allow plenty of time for physical play. New data from Independent Australian researcher Roy Morgan shows that Australian children aged six to 13 now spend nearly more than 22 hours a week – or more than three hours a day – spent in front of a screen, with internet usage eclipsing TV. Cutting down on screen time can be difficult, but encouraging school-aged kids to play outside, get involved with sports teams, hobbies, reading, arts and crafts, and participating in other non-screen activities will aid in their learning and social development.  Author of 10 books on raising children, parenting expert Michael Grose says that without a doubt, technology is the toughest challenge parents face today. Michael says toddlers and teenagers are very similar when it comes to forming good and bad habits that will endure throughout their lives. “We know that if a teenager starts drinking at 15-16, they are more likely to develop alcohol problems in adulthood compared with someone who starts drinking at 22. It’s the same with toddlers, habits they get into, are more likely to stay with them for life.” Author and parenting expert Michael Grose says that technology is the toughest challenge this generation of parents will face raising kids He adds that toddlers are all about exploring the world and their surroundings. “Once they’ve explored every nook of the house, they need another creative outlet, and when they’re not out of the house, technology provides another portal to the world. Television is highly addictive. It’s all about faces, characters and stories. Children are drawn to these stories, along with the colour and the movement.” Michael also warns that girls could be more susceptible to becoming addicted to TV and tablets than boys. “Girls are more likely to sit in one spot, and concentrate on a task, such as watching TV, while boys are always moving. We’ve seen the reason why girls are so much better at reading at a young age, is because they are able to sit down and concentrate on learning, while boys get distracted very easily. While this is a positive for educational purposes, it can also pose a danger picking up bad habits.” If your toddler is already addicted to tablets and screens, and you want to bring them back from the brink, here are Michael’s top tips how;  HOW TO RID YOUR TODDLER OF SCREEN ADDICTION TOTAL TIME PER DAY, Guidelines suggest that pre-school age children (between 2-5) should not have more than one-hour of screen time (device and TV) per day. Ration out the time allowed and stick to this amount. DON’T GIVE INTO TANTRUMS, Parents have to remember what tantrums are. Toddlers carry out tantrums because they are either frustrated that they cannot communicate their emotions and wants effectively, or they launch into a tantrum to make you change their mind when you have denied them something they want. It’s the later here. Basically, with a tantrum your toddler is trying to bully you into giving in. That’s not healthy, and no matter how severe the tantrum gets, you cannot cave in. While it may be easier to ‘just let them watch or play a few more minutes’ it is much better for your child in the long run if you stick to your guns and not give in, no matter how painful it may seem. DISTRACTIONS, good parents will have ready distractions when cutting out screen time. Michael suggests to have activities ready, ideally in another room that you can lead your toddler towards and quickly engage them in before any tantrum starts. Hopefully, by the time they realise they are no longer watching TV or playing on a tablet you have immersed them in something else. It also helps if the parent is doing the activity with them, rather than watching as it will more likely draw the child in more. GET READY TO DO BATTLE, understand this will be a battle and prepare for war accordingly. Part of the growth stage of being a toddler is challenging your parents authority. Toddlers say, “hey I am my own person” and want to explore what that means. They will want to defy you and continue doing something they enjoy. Here it is up to the parent to remain neutral and disengage. Whatever you do, you cannot get emotional, quick to anger or frustrated. Remain calm, like a policeman would and assert your authority calmly. Explain this is the way it is, and no more. BOUNDARIES, while you have established a clear amount of screen time per day, to fully stick to this, you must set clear boundaries beforehand. When sitting down, explain to your toddler, they are only watching one episode or having 10 minutes tablet play time. Then stick to it. If you are firm, eventually the tantrums will stop, as they know that you have established clear boundaries and they will only ever get a set, fair amount. Try to avoid horse trading with your child. For instance, don’t give second episodes or extra time for good behaviour, because then they will always expect more. Find other ways to reward them.  Facebook Twitter Shares Discussion Related Articles How security at major events is nothing more than an illusion Thanks to a friend who scored a free ticket I attended the Guns N Roses concert at Sydney Olympic Park on Saturday night where more than 40,000 rock fanatics were expected to pile in to ANZ Stadium.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Huawei reportedly developing its own voice assistant By Ida Torres - February 16, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter While Siri (Apple), Alexa (Amazon), and Google Assistant (well, Google) are still waging battle over which digital voice assistant is the best, the other OEMs are actually thinking of developing their own, instead of just adapting these existing ones to their device. Samsung is reportedly in the final stages of their own product and now the latest rumor is that Huawei is also doing the same for their own smartphones and other devices. This may be good news for its users but bad news for Google. Google has reportedly been trying to get third-party manufacturers to adapt its Google Assistant and pre-install it in their devices. But Huawei, which is the third-largest smartphone manufacturer in the world (just behind Apple and Samsung) is reportedly set to join in the battle of the digital voice assistants. They are still in the early stages, but a team of more than a hundred engineers are already working on it in their Shenzhen offices. And they really want to go up against the “big boys” and not just the minor players. What will give them the advantage particularly in their local market is that this product will be communicating in Chinese. Many Google services are actually blocked in China, so having a really good digital assistant will help Huawei stand out in the already crowded domestic market. They will still continue working with either Google or Amazon for their other markets. Just last month, Huawei announced that they were going with Amazon’s Alexa for their Mate 9 smartphones to be released in the US, which is a blow for Google of course. Currently, the Google Assistant is only available in the Google Pixel smartphones, Google Home, speaker, and smartwatches that will be running on Android Wear 2.0.

Yeah, that’s what Apple’s AirPods inventory looks like across the country right now. That’s right… nearly two months after Apple first launched its new truly wireless AirPods earbuds, it’s still next to impossible to find them in stock at an Apple store. Shipping quotes for online orders vary — Apple’s online store says new orders ship in 6 weeks, and Best Buy orders won’t be delivered until the end of March. As always, however, you can get AirPods right this minute on Amazon if you’re willing to pay a premium. But guess what: That premium is now lower than it has ever been. AirPods can now be had on Amazon for as little as $230, which is about $50 less than the average price on Amazon just one week ago. Check out the AirPods page on Amazon right here, and click on “other sellers” to see what your options are. Just make sure that if you decide to buy a pair, you make sure the seller you choose has good feedback. Some highlights from the product page: Audio automatically plays as soon as you put them in your ears and pauses when you take them out. To adjust the volume, Change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just double-tap to activate Siri. Because the ultralow-power W1 chip manages battery life so well, airpods deliver an industry-leading 5 hours of listening time on One charge. They’re made to keep up with you, thanks to a charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time. Need a quick charge? just 15 minutes in the case gives you 3 hours of listening time.

She shares her concerns about cosmetic surgery games aimed at children as young as three Cosmetic surgery games for children – five words you don’t expect to see together. Yet that’s exactly what came up when my nine-year-old searched online for “free games for kids” one afternoon a couple of months ago. She showed it to me and we had the usual discussion about downloading apps without asking, then I took a closer look. The game is set in a clinic, and players perform cosmetic surgery on animated patients. My patient wanted her nose fixed, which involved marking where the incision should go, using a scalpel to cut into the skin, moving a bone inside the nose, then gluing and stitching up the wound. According to the game blurb, “Every girl dreams of delicate face and stunning figure. If makeup can’t give the beauty you want, then come to join this amazing plastic surgery game!” I deleted the game, and explained to my daughter that I thought it was a little bit gross and a lot inappropriate and that it gives the wrong message to children about appearance. I’m not sure she understood the last part, but she was happy to forgo the game as it was a bit – in her words - “ick”. So is it simply about the “ick” factor or are there greater concerns about children playing cosmetic surgery games? Psychologist Deirdre Cowman, who is campaigning to stop games like this being marketed to children, says it’s not just about the graphic imagery. “It’s also because of the message these games give to young people about changing your body to meet societal expectations of beauty. I want kids to grow up feeling comfortable in their bodies and not to be exposed to games about plumping lips and removing wrinkles - which ultimately teach them that their bodies are things to be fixed rather than enjoyed.” The #SurgeryIsNotAGame campaign is being run by Endangered Bodies, an international movement challenging body-toxic culture. The campaign includes a petition calling on Apple, Amazon and Google to prohibit the marketing of cosmetic surgery applications to children. One of the challenges facing the campaign is that research is scarce. “The games are such a new phenomenon, there isn’t really concrete evidence out there yet,” says Dr Cowman. “However, research has shown that when children and adolescents view idealised images of women and men, they have stronger body dissatisfaction. And interestingly, research conducted by the University of the West of England found that young girls who played with ‘makeover’ apps for only ten minutes showed a decrease in their body confidence. This suggests that exposure to these games could potentially be harmful in terms of how young people see themselves.” Dr Farrah-Hani Imran is a plastic, reconstructive and cosmetic surgeon who is currently undertaking a PhD in the School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin - she encounters people every day who are dissatisfied with their appearance. “When people find out my day job, the questions that immediately follow are, ‘How can I change X’, or ‘I hate my lips, nose, cheeks, chin, eyes, breasts’ and so on. This is usually from a person with no functional deformity, exhibiting clear signs of low self-esteem; enamoured by glossy magazines and media images to conform to perceived ideals.” Dr Imran is concerned that cosmetic surgery games may contribute to this problem. “While it is fun to play virtual dress up and do basic operations - think of the board game Operation - once it goes into actual aesthetic procedures and cosmetic surgery aimed at children, a line has been crossed. The games trivialise and normalise aesthetic procedures and cosmetic surgery.” Left: Dr Deirdre Cowman is calling on Apple, Amazon and Google to stop cosmetic surgery games being marketed to children. Right: Dr Farrah-Hani Imran, concern over games. Dr Cowman is keen to point out that the issue isn’t the games themselves, but rather the fact that they’re being played by children. “We’re not asking for these games to be banned,” she explains. “It’s totally up to the individual to decide if they want to play games like this. However, we are calling on Apple, Amazon and Google to stop the games from being marketed to children. The games generally feature large, bright logos and cartoon characters, which appeal to a young audience. We’re asking these three major platforms to do more than simply including a recommended age range for these games. We’re asking them to implement a policy which is clear to every game developer, that they will not accept any such apps that are targeted at children.” I contacted Google to find out how apps get their ratings and a spokesperson explained it as follows. “Google Play’s policies are designed to provide a great experience for users and developers. While we don’t comment on specific apps, we can confirm that our ratings are based on the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) guidelines. If users come across any apps they think violate these policies, we encourage them to report it to our support team so we can review the app and take action if necessary.” I checked the age rating for the game my daughter downloaded – it’s a “PEGI 3” meaning it’s suitable for children aged three and upwards. So how does a plastic surgery game end up with an age rating of three? Lee Cash, a game producer who has worked in the gaming industry here and abroad, explains how the rating system functions. “The developer completes a self-assessment form declaring the nature of the content contained within their app or game. The content is then reviewed and, if the platform holder agrees with the assessment, it passes and is fit for publication on the store. The crux of the issue, and why inappropriate content can sneak through the morality net, is down to the sheer volume of content that is relentlessly flung at the platform holders. Nudity and violence is universal in its classification of propriety; few would argue where such content falls on the spectrum of suitability. Plastic surgery apps aimed at children, however? It’s fuzzy and, quite simply, the platforms likely have no clear designated position on content of this nature.” Of course, the first line of defence for monitoring online activity is the parent, and in a perfect world, we would all make sure our children never download inappropriate games. However, I suspect mine is not the only household in which apps can slip through the parental net. James Kelleher, developer of The Lonely Beast apps, feels it goes without saying that children shouldn’t be playing these games. “There are hundreds of these shoddy surgery clones littering the app stores - I remember seeing one where you could operate on a badly-drawn bootleg Peppa Pig - and they’re usually vehicles for countless in-app purchases and spammy ads. “These plastic surgery games are a disturbing sub-genre of an already weird game niche, and a good reminder of why parents shouldn’t rely on PEGI ratings or app stores to filter what their kids are playing.” In the meantime, what can parents do to help children to develop positive body image? “It’s hard to completely shelter your children from the world’s obsession with appearance and weight so it’s important to encourage kids to think critically about the media they consume,” says Dr Cowman. “As well as traditional media, this also includes cartoons, music videos, social media and computer games which often subtly - and not so subtly- promote the idea that only very thin or very muscular bodies are acceptable.” She says it’s also a good idea to be aware of how you talk about your own body and other people’s bodies in front of children. “Children pick up on little things and if they grow up hearing their parents criticise their bodies or being overly concerned about calories, it has an impact on how they feel about themselves and their bodies. We hope that the #surgeryisnotagame campaign can also start a conversation about how we can raise body positive children and create a society that accepts and celebrates all bodies.” There are eight Endangered Bodies representatives around the world supporting the petition and Andrea Mara is the Irish representative.

It’s even been being moved from the first to the fifth spot in the market share list. The reasons behind this disastrous drop were multi-faceted and involve issues from supply chain management to the lack of high-end products. However, the company’s online-focused marketing strategy is widely considered as a major reason. Online marketing was a success, but it’s not one-size-fits-all Born in 2010, Xiaomi positioned itself a brand with internet DNA and tried to engage customers with its geeky positioning. This is perfectly reflected in its slogan “Born for You, Burn for MI” (为发烧而生). In line with the positioning, Xiaomi leveraged corresponding online-focused marketing strategies, rejecting physical retail stores, traditional distribution channels, and conventional advertising as a way to keep lower product prices. From online flash sales, social media promotion to creating a fanatic fan community, Xiaomi’s marketing moves proved to be a success in tapping China’s urban starter smartphone user base in its early stage of development with smartphones packed decent specs and affordable prices. As the first regions to adopt smartphones, China tier-one and tier-two cities have gradually becoming saturated in recent years. Lower-tier cities and rural areas, where internet penetration is lower and traditional retailing still dominates, are taking bigger roles in driving smartphone market. Market changes. Sticking to the old strategies, no matter how effective it was in the past, to tap a different market is obviously not a wise choice. How will Xiaomi differentiate? While Xiaomi is losing ground, its local competitors Oppo and Vivo are rising by adopting the exact tactics that Xiaomi once avoided. Now, Xiaomi is shifting to the offline-focused strategy that’s helped its rivals boom. Xiaomi opened its first flagship retail stores in 2013. Back then, the move was largely a PR effort to build a more favorable company brand. Currently, there’s overall 47 Mi Homes in the country, including one in Hong Kong and one in Taiwan. The firm’s obviously more serious about going offline this time. Company founder Lei Jun said the smartphone maker is going to add 200 brick-and-mortar Mi Home stores in 2017. A combined 1,000 such stores will be opened in the future three years. In addition, the company started a pilot of a direct-to-retail model to eliminate distributors and other middlemen. Every individual retailer can order directly from the company on Xiaomi’s marketplace. The site shows that Xiaomi will offer training and incentive plans to individual merchants in the plan. Compared with opening physical stores, this is a less pricey way to reach to customers.   Tags: brick-and-mortar store, OPPO, Smartphone, Vivo, Xiaomi Vote Up Vote Down Emma Lee Emma Lee is Shanghai-based tech writer, covering startups and tech happenings in China and Asia in general.

February 16, 2017 491 0 Another day, another new iPhone 8 rumor. The display is in the news again today but not due to any iPhone 8 Edge news. This time we will focus on the home button or lack of one. A new report is making the rounds from Apple Guru and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. We will cut to the chase with this iPhone 8 rumor as Kuo says it will feature virtual buttons this year. Not a virtual home button under the glass, but a section at the bottom dedicated for buttons. Despite that, it’s still billed as a 5.8-inch iPhone 8 and not the iPhone 8 Plus or the iPhone 8 Edge by Kuo. If you’re a little confused with the overall dimensions of the iPhone 8, don’t feel alone. Kuo says the iPhone 8 will actually use a 5.8-inch OLED display but that only 5.15-inches of the panel will be usable. The bottom will feature a “function area” where we assume you can unlock your handset. What else it will do is anyone’s guess although we can’t imagine Apple would waste the space. It should be cool. If you were hoping for the iPhone 8 Edge rumors to be true, you may be disappointed. The report doesn’t use that moniker says the side bezels will be non-existent so we will probably see a full-screen flat OLED panel. It will apparently leave the same footprint as the 4.7-inch iPhone though due to slim bezels and their interesting approach. If you’re having trouble wrapping your head around it, check out the diagram below. Nothing new was mentioned in regards to the iPhone 8 specifications aside from the fact that it may have biometric features and great battery life. Apple is said to still offer up a 4.7-inch iPhone 8 and a 5.5-inch iPhone 8. Those models are thought to only see a slight improvement over the iPhone 7 whereas the iPhone X or Anniversary Edition will get to billing. via – MacRumors Tags appleiPhone 8Rumors Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Add to Google+ Add to Pinterest Post navigation Previous article Previous post: Samsung Hello could be an answer to Echo and Home Next article Next post: Unworded brings its Twisted Typography to Android Live Comment Your email address will not be published.

The company's AI assistant will soon be competing with Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. Huawei has formed a team with over 100 engineers in Shenzhen, China which is currently in early stages of development for the new digital smart assistant, according to one of Bloomberg. Huawei’s digital assistant will be aimed at Chinese customers meaning it will communicate in Chinese languages. One of Bloomberg's sources claimed that Huawei will continue to work with Google and Amazon when it comes to providing other services to its phones internationally. The company's own assistant will mostly rival Apple’s Siri on iPhones as most of Google’s services in China are blocked off despite majority smartphone users  are using Android OS. Although Huawei intends to continue working with Google, the company’s endeavor to build its own AI assistant clashes with Google’s plan in convincing other manufacturers to pre-install its own assistant on their devices. Currently, Google Assistant is only available on the Pixel phones, Google Home and Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches. As for Huawei’s commitment with Amazon, the Chinese phone maker previously just released its Mate 9 smartphone in the U.S. last month and it comes with Alexa already pre-installed. The Huawei Mate 9 first launch in China and other Asian markets back in November 2016. Huawei new digital assistant for its smartphones in China will be the company’s second investment in artificial intelligence. Back in October, the company announced that it plans to fund UC Berkeley in a partnership to research deep learning, natural language processing and computer vision, according to TechCrunch. Huawei has proven to be quite ambitious with its future plans. One of he company’s top executives, Richard Yu, stated last month during CES 2017 that Huawei wants to be the number one smartphone manufacturer by 2021.

We like it so much, we even made it one of our top picks for both 2016 and 2015. This year, though, Dell is changing things up a bit with an all-new model: The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1. Yes, Dell has turned the XPS 13 into a hybrid laptop-tablet thanks to a new 360-degree-hinged display. The PC maker also lopped off some of the XPS 13’s already slim chassis and added a new webcam to the mix. The XPS 13 2-in-1 does have a few quirks, namely the odd placement of the aforementioned webcam and a slower processor than the standard XPS 13. But overall, the XPS 13 2-in-1 ($1,299 as tested) is a solid offering that’s nearly as good as its stablemate. View photos The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 has a stylish palm rest and wonderful keyboard.More Cutting the fat Dell’s original XPS 13 is an attractive, well-built machine. So it’s nice to see that the PC maker didn’t alter much of that system’s DNA when it came time to build the XPS 13 2-in-1. The laptop’s aluminum lid features an understated Dell logo, while its carbon fiber palm rest gives the system a unique look and feel that’s durable, but smooth to the touch. At 12 x 7.8 x 0.54 inches, the XPS 13 2-in-1 is slightly slimmer than the standard XPS 13, which measures 12 x 9.3 x 0.6 inches. Both laptops weigh 2.7 pounds. The XPS 13 2-in-1 360-degree touchscreen folds smoothly, but is sturdy enough to prevent any unnecessary play when in laptop mode. Like its predecessor, XPS 13 2-in-1’s gorgeous InfinityEdge display sports ultra-thin bezels that makes it feel like you’re holding nothing more than a screen when using the system in tablet mode. View photos Dell made a thin laptop even thinner with the XPS 13 2-in-1.More I use a MacBook Air 13-inch (starting at $999) as my daily driver and the size difference between it and the XPS 13 2-in-1 is quite noticeable. The XPS isn’t just shorter and slimmer than Apple’s (AAPL) offering; it weighs less, too. It’s not as if the Air weighs a ton, either. But every ounce counts when you’ve got a bag that’s already overflowing with pens, unopened bills and random deodorant sticks — don’t ask — like mine. That said, the MacBook comes with a more powerful processor, so if you’re looking for a system with more oomph, you’ll probably go with the Air. The closest competitor Apple offers to the XPS 13 2-in-1 is the standard 12-inch MacBook (starting at $1,299), which is narrower, thinner and lighter than the Dell. However, the XPS can also be used as a tablet, which is more useful than saving a few extra tenths of an inch. A tablet with no edges The XPS 2-in-1’s 13-inch, 1,920 x 1,080 display is absolutely gorgeous, though not as sharp as the optional 3,200 x 1,800 panel. Still, movies looked clear and colors were radiant. The notebook’s screen is also exceptionally bright, making it easy to view if you ever happen to use it out in the midday sun. Using the XPS 13 2-in-1 as a tablet is a bit odd at first, though. The slate is pretty wide in portrait mode, which makes holding it feel a bit uncomfortable when you’re not resting it on your lap or a table. I did, however, like flipping the display over and using the keyboard as a stand to watch movies while making dinner. View photos The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is a bit large for a tablet, but its screen certainly is gorgeous.More Read More There’s one annoying thing about XPS 13 2-in-1’s design: its webcam placement. See, like the original XPS 13, the 2-in-1’s webcam is situated along the laptop’s bottom bezel, just below the screen. But rather than placing it off-center as Dell did with the regular XPS, the company centered the camera. That’s great and all, but you still end up giving the person you’re video chatting with a nice view of your chin and nostrils. You can certainly fix that by using the 2-in-1 in tent mode, but you shouldn’t have to do that at all. So-so power Here’s the thing about the XPS 13 2-in-1. In order to make it slim and lightweight enough to use as a tablet, Dell eliminated the laptop’s internal fans. And to ensure that the system didn’t have a meltdown without its fans, the company swapped out the standard XPS 13’s Intel processor for a power-sipping Intel chip that produces less heat. The problem? That CPU is also less powerful than the one found in the regular XPS. While Dell markets the XPS 13 2-in-1 as running on an Intel Core i7 chip, it’s not the beefy Core i7 you’re probably hoping it is. Instead, it’s a Core i7 7Y75, which is an updated and rebranded version of Intel’s old Core M chips. View photos The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 doesn’t have as powerful a processor as the standard XPS 13.More Why does that matter? Because the XPS 13 2-in-1’s processor isn’t nearly as powerful as the CPU found in the standard 13. That doesn’t mean the 2-in-1 is underpowered in any way. On the contrary; with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB solid-state drive, the XPS 13 2-in-1 is more than powerful enough for your average someone who simply wants to surf the web with 20 browser tabs open, stream Spotify and talk to coworkers on Slack. But if you want to do things like photo editing and gaming, the XPS 13 2-in-1 will have trouble keeping up. Should you get it? Dell already won me over with the original XPS 13, so I was hesitant when I originally fired up the XPS 2-in-1. But being able to use the system as a slate is certainly welcome. Still, I’d gladly sacrifice that 360-degree hinge for a more capable processor. If you’re the kind of person who wants to do basic web browsing and doesn’t expect to do any kind of heavy photo editing or the like, the XPS 13 2-in-1 is an excellent choice. If you’re looking for more power, though, stick with the standard XPS 13.

Mobile by Sean Hollister February 14, 2017 1:49 PM PST @starfire2258 Signal If you send encrypted text messages from your phone, there's a decent chance you use Signal. Since the app made headlines in 2015 by offering encryption between Android and iPhone, it's grown in popularity, to the point that it's now one of the preferred ways to tip The New York Times on a story. As of today, Signal will do video calls as well. Mind you, Signal creator Open Whisper Studios is calling the feature a beta for now, which suggests it might still have its share of bugs. And if you're using an iPhone, there's one thing you may want to do for security's sake as well: since the app uses Apple's CallKit on iOS 10 to let you answer calls from the lock screen, it will send a record of who you called, and how long you spoke, to Apple's iCloud servers. The creators aren't trying to hide that, by the way -- it's plainly disclosed in their blog post. Signal's creators also say the update should improve standard voice calls as well, since the company's using an "entirely new calling infrastructure" for both. If you code, you can check out the details in their GitHub repos. You'll have to opt-in if you want to try video calls for yourself: Go to Signal Settings > Advanced > Video calling beta to enable the feature, and Settings > Advanced > Use CallKit if you want to disable the CallKit features on an iPhone.

For an appliance to proclaim itself the "most powerful home blender on the market", you’d hope that it could back up that assertion. And so the Artisan Power Plus Blender does. Housed inside its glossy die-cast metal base is a mighty 3.5 HP motor. This powers 11 variable speeds plus pulse and boost functions, mobilising a 3mm-thick patented blade to liquefy fruit, vegetables, frozen fruit, nuts, grains, ice and more, with a dynamic vortex to draw ingredients down. Three preset programmes take the guesswork out of time and speed combinations for smoothies, juices and soups, while a self-cleaning function means there’s no scrupulous hand washing required. KitchenAid Artisan Power Plus Blender – Design and Features Built to coordinate with other appliances in the Artisan range, the Power Plus has some recognisable design details, such as the retro curves of its base and a trio of colours: Candy Apple, Cast Iron Black and Medallion Silver. Its controls are similarly ergonomic and well labelled. However, it's the jug that takes this blender to a new level of functionality. It nestles into a removable blender jar pad, while the jug itself is double-walled so that it can heat soup to a piping hot temperature without the exterior becoming warm to the touch. A sturdy, soft-touch handle makes it easy to lift the jug off (it drops onto the base rather than twisting in) and a tight-fitting push-on lid keeps the contents firmly inside. There are other thoughtful design features, too, such as a power switch at the rear to prevent it being accidentally turned on, a detachable power cable, and carry handles so the heavy base can be picked up without incident. Two flick switches on the front start and stop the speed or programmes, and give a high or low pulse of speed, while the adjacent control dial twists to select a programme or speed. KitchenAid Artisan Power Plus Blender – What is it like to use? Given that the Power Plus has been positioned as a blender for the health-conscious, some recipes with the instructions would be appropriate. Unfortunately, there aren’t any. However, there is a clear guide to what order to add ingredients and suggested items to make/blend using each programme, such as crumb toppings on pulse and butters using the variable speed. I started by using the soup programme to blend and heat a precooked vegetable and stock mixture, cooled to room temperature. Once the blender was switched on, a status indicator light pulsed to show it was ready for use. However, selecting the soup programme with the dial didn’t start it – the start/stop switch was still required. This two-step process presumably exists for safety reasons. The soup programme began slowly to initially chop the vegetables but soon ramped up to an impressively fast speed. At top speed, it was as loud as it was powerful. The programme took around five minutes, the last part of which slowed down to allow the contents to settle and reduce froth. The jug was cool to the touch, yet inside, the soup was hot and steaming. Even better, its consistency was noticeably smooth and silky, with no trace of the vegetables or a fibrous consistency. Next, I tried out the smoothie programme, making a fruit and vegetable smoothie with ice. It started at a low speed before progressing to a higher one. We layered the ingredients into the jug: liquid first, then fruit, then vegetables, finishing with ice. We kept the tamper handy in case any ice or solid items needed moving around, but the programme blended well without it. It took less than a minute to reduce the contents to a consistently coloured smoothie. There were no traces of ice or solid ingredients, and the programme was less noisy than the soup version. I finished with the juice programme. This uses several variations of speed to blitz whole fruit and vegetables to liquid, before finishing with a low speed to reduce froth. The programme took just over a minute to juice the four oranges, with periods where it was noisy with quieter intervals. The result was well-blended orange juice – however, it was very thick and pulpy; more smoothie than juice. Once it had settled, the contents at the bottom appeared more juice-like but I found the best results were achieved on straining the mixture. The pulse functions proved handy, although the top-most level was quite noisy, as was blitzing on anything higher than speed 7. As the Power Plus has a cleaning setting, I used this to get rid of any traces of food. Filling the jug with warm water and washing up liquid, I started the self-cleaning programme. Helpfully, this is at the opposite end of the dial to the rest of the programmes, so that it isn't accidentally selected. The programme uses pulses of high speed to whisk the soapy water to the top of the jug; it took around 30 seconds. Once it had finished, the water was tipped away and the jug rinsed. There were traces of food remaining in the crevices of the lid, but this was easily rinsed away. All the parts are dishwasher safe. Should I buy the Artisan Power Plus Blender? There’s no doubt that this blender can whizz through anything you put in it, making it ideal for keen cooks and healthy-eating lovers. The trade-off is the noise that this produces – it may not be the best fit for early morning or late-evening blending. Noise and cost aside, it’s incredibly user-friendly and it's probably the best blender that money can buy. If lumps are non-negotiable, it’s time to upgrade to this pro-style smooth operator. Verdict It will amaze you with the smoothness of its smoothies, although we wish it came with a set of earplugs.

AI is largely seen as the full realization of what big data, analytics and automation have been moving towards — a fuller implementation of machine learning. It is being explored in a variety of verticals. Ford announced last week that it is investing $1 billion in startup Argo AI aimed at developing a brain for connected, autonomous vehicles. Consumers are getting comfortable with the concept of AI in their homes. Amazon has said that it sold millions of its Echo devices, which rely on Amazon’s Alexa AI for user interactions. AI research is also flourishing. As CIO Magazine noted, “Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft all open-source or share their latest research in AI to advance developments in the space. These moves from such notable organizations also meet the collective interests of scientists and researchers who prefer to share their findings with the larger community, instead of limiting access to a select group.” On the telco side, work exploring AI’s role in the network has been focused on more intelligent orchestration with an eye toward AI-assisted implementations of 5G. In early 2016, KDDI R&D Laboratories and partners Wind River KK, Hewlett-Packard Japan, and Brocade K.K., developed an AI-assisted automated network operation system for virtualized networks; the proof-of-concept was aimed at exploring automated network operation with AI-based failure prediction. In identifying key big data trends for 2017, Ovum said that it has “seen machine learning proliferate, from consumer services to enterprise applications and tooling; for instance, machine learning has become table stakes for data preparation and other tools related to managing curation of data for data lakes.” Ovum went on to say that “machine learning will be the biggest disruptor for big data analytics in 2017.” Nokia plans to boost its NFV orchestration capabilities through its recently announced purchase of Comptel for 347 million euros ($370.8 million). While Nokia’s initially announced plans for Comptel focused on NFV orchestration and rebalancing its focus on software versus hardware, Comptel launched late last year a suite of AI-powered applications for telcos with customer engagement and “next best actions” in mind. Mikko Jarva, CTO of the intelligent data business unit at Comptel, said that AI applications, such as the new FasterMind suite of applications, is the next logical step for big data. “If we think about big data applications, they have been around and related to data storage and data discovery, reporting and also interesting predictive analytics use cases,” Jarva said. “Going to the next step is when you start making the data actionable and extracting value out of it. You need to come up with a capability that can take the insights and make them work for you.” FasterMind focuses on recommendations, predictions and automation of real-time customer engagement for cross-selling and upselling. Jarva said that since the applications need to work much faster than typical big data applications, they work with a smaller, more focused data set that is part of an overall “data fabric.” Comptel’s approach, he said, is to leverage AI as part of helping people design use cases and offers, identifying the customer journey and the points at which end users are most open to new offers, and improving the customer experience with contextual information and AI-powered chatbots or real-time data for customer service reps — all on a shorter time-scale that is more relevant to both the operator and the consumer. “This is part of a bigger trend we have seen in the move toward real-time,” he added. “I think there is more interest in moving from after-the-fact to deciding in real-time what to do with the data and the insights.”       Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) AI big data COMPTEL Nokia About Author Kelly Hill Twitter LinkedIn Editor, Big Data, Analytics, Test & MeasurementKelly Hill currently reports on network test and measurement, as well as the use of big data and analytics.

The Black Cats have spent four days in the Big Apple as David Moyes looks to galvanise his squad ahead of the relegation run-in. Sunderland are bottom of the Premier League, with just 13 games left to save their top-flight status. But Moyes is hopeful that a bit of time spent out of the spotlight over the States can help unite his squad, and help cement the vital team spirit that will be needed if they are to battle their way to safety. https://www.instagram.com/p/BQluXdoBzxP/embed The trip has been very much a private affair, but goalkeeper Vito Mannone has posted two pictures on his Instagram account. One showed the Italian shot-stopper alongside striker Jermain Defoe, while the other was a great team picture from NYC. And if team spirit was the name of the game, then it certainly looks like it was mision accomplished, judging by the smiles on the players’ faces. https://www.instagram.com/p/BQlE5hJAx6C/embed Sunderland now head back to Wearside to prepare for a return to Premier League action, with the trip to Goodison Park to take on David Moyes’ former side Everton next up. The club are also hosting an open training session on Monday (February 20). The session, which is free, is at the Stadium of Light, with doors open from noon via exit seven, which is located in the West Stand area, adjacent to the club store.

In the interview, Lavapitsas says he has in fact read the NC Grexit coverage, but he proceeds to completely mischaracterise NC’s analysis: To put it bluntly, Naked Capitalism doesn’t get the Eurozone crisis, and certainly doesn’t get what needs doing in the case of Greece. It doesn’t get the Eurozone crisis, because it systematically underplays the importance of competitiveness, and the averages of competitiveness for the Eurozone crisis. It’s a very confused take on why Germany has emerged as the dominant trading partner, something to do apparently, with German productivity and efficiency. It’s got nothing to do with that. I’ve read this blog for over 8 years and I’ve never seen Yves roll out the German cultural superiority argument. Lavapitsas is strawmanning. He then digs deeper into his hole by displaying the usual economist ignorance of the technical complexity of a Grexit: The short-term costs [of Grexit] must be managed in the best possible way, to minimize the transition difficulties. They’re not as severe as people make out. I agree with the view that says that the payment systems in the banks, which rely on IT and so on, are a difficult problem… and they will take time to sort out. To disentangle the computer systems of the domestic banks from the European system…because they will be using a different … accounts, a new currency. It won’t be easy. I know that. But creating bank notes and so on, thats straightforward. Let’s not exaggerate, however, the transition costs, because the many instances in which countries have changed money, even recently, and the transition costs were nonexistent or very, very small, certainly the political step. India is a good example here. If you allow me - the Indian government, as you know, recently withdrew unilaterally, all large denomination bank notes from circulation. It was a mad thing to do…. What struck me, though, more than anything in this case, is that the Indian people took it in their stride. Yeah, the Indians who have killed themselves because of the cash shortage really “took it in stride” [T]he short-term costs of exiting the Eurozone - if they are done by a government that has got political support - can be handled without political losses, or at least without serious political losses. All that talk about Greece descending into anarchy, people fighting in the streets, war breaking out, and all this, is wildly exaggerated. Shorter Lavapitsas: sure there may be huge IT obstacles and it may require impossible coordination from adverse international players, but if we all sit in a circle in Omonia Square with our fingers in our ears, it will all come out roses and lollipops. Reply ↓ Foppe February 15, 2017 at 8:10 am Peculiar/disappointing. He doesn’t strike me as wholly uninterested in reality (going by https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/lapavitsas-varoufakis-grexit-syriza/ ), though obviously there’s a bit of wishful thinking as to the way reality works underlying his statements. (But vastly less than Davis’s fantasies about post-brexit-britain.) Reply ↓ RabidGandhi February 15, 2017 at 8:31 am That’s the odd part. During the 2015 Syriza meltdown, it was Varoufakis the EU-phile vs. Lavapitsas the realist who (correctly) saw that Brussels would not back down from austerity. Now Lavapitsas seems to have taken his own holiday train to Fantasy Land with a sparkle pony Grexit that ain’t gonna happen. Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorFebruary 15, 2017 at 6:46 pm Lapavitas was talking up a Grexit in 2015 too, but not as forcefully as now. That’s why he doesn’t like the NC coverage. Also his position on competitiveness is bizarre. He’s accepted the main neoliberal talking point (that’s what they use to argue for “structural reforms” as in crushing labor) but basically takes the position that the solution is a cheaper currency. That works only to a degree. How much can Greece expand its export industries? It can’t do much in agriculture. I’m not certain how much they could increase tourism. We’ve run post debunking the competitiveness issue, for instance, this one: http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2016/01/how-the-labor-cost-competitiveness-myth-is-making-the-eurozone-crisis-worse.html From my introduction: This article shows, decisively, how wrong-headed this worker-crushing approach is. It shows that labor is a comparatively small percent of the cost of wholesale goods, and in the case of Germany, how the reductions in labor costs (the Haartz reforms) had almost nothing to do with Germany’s growth in exports. Instead, the bigger effect of the wage reduction in Germany was to constrain domestic demand, which led the European Central Bank to set interest rates unduly low, which then set off excessive borrowing and real estate speculation in the periphery countries. That in turn led to banking crises that the bailouts transfigured into sovereign debt crises. From the author, Servaas Strom: Firstly, exports and imports are—by definition (as explained in Storm and Naastepad 2015a, 2015c)—much less responsive to changes in (relative) unit labor costs than to changes in (relative) prices for several reasons. Unit labor costs make up less than 25% of the gross output price, while a second reason is that firms in general do not pass on all (but mostly only half of) unit labor cost increases onto market prices. What it means is that (when using realistic unit-labor cost elasticities) observed changes in Germany’s relative unit labor cost statistically “explain” only a minuscule fraction of its export growth and current account surplus (Wyplosz 2013; Gabrisch and Staehr 2014). For instance, IMF economists Danninger and Joutz (2007, p. 15) find that relative cost improvements accounted for less than 2% of German export growth during 1993-2005. Germany’s superior export performance can instead be completely explained by the “income effect” (Storm and Naastepad 2015a): German firms supply mostly complex, high-tech, and high-priced goods to fast-growing markets as well as to faster-growing countries such as China, Russia and Saudi Arabia (Gabrisch and Staehr 2014; Diaz Sanchez and Varoudakis 2013; Storm and Naastepad 2015a; Schröder 2015). Germany excels in non-price (technology-based) competitiveness and does not engage (much) in price competition. Secondly, as shown in Figure 1, there is no clear sign of a nominal wage squeeze on German workers if we compare Germany to the Eurozone as a whole (but excluding Germany). German nominal wages increased relative to the Eurozone in the 1990s and the German relative nominal wage stayed more or less flat during the period 1999-2007 (there was a negligible decline of 0.7 percentage points over these eight years). It is nevertheless true that Germany’s unit labor cost declined relative to those of the rest of the Eurozone (as Figure 1 illustrates), but this was not a result of wage restraint: It was completely due to Germany’s outstanding productivity performance: during 1999-2007 average German labor productivity (per hour worked) increased by almost 8 percentage points compared to the rest of the Eurozone, which accounts fully for the decline in Germany’s relative unit labor costs by 7.8 percentage points over the same period. It was German engineering ingenuity, not nominal wage restraint or the Hartz “reforms”, which reduced its unit labor costs. Any talk of Germany deliberately undercutting its Eurozone neighbors is therefore beside the point. Thirdly, the increase in current account deficits in Southern Europe resulted from an increase in the trend growth of their imports, while the trend growth of their exports stayed unchanged (notwithstanding the sustained rise in their unit labor costs). There is convincing statistical evidence for the European Union (Diaz Sanchez and Varoudakis 2014; Storm and Naastepad 2015c) showing that initial increases in current account deficits were followed only later in time by increases in relative unit labor costs—which, if true, means that the current account deteriorations were not caused by higher (relative) unit labor costs. The only rational explanation for the observed time-sequence is that Southern Europe first experienced a debt-led growth boom, which then led to higher imports and higher capital inflows leading only after a lag of many quarters to lower unemployment and higher wage growth in excess of labor productivity growth (see Storm and Naastepad 2015c). This explanation is consistent with the first two statements of “consensus diagnosis” outlined above. . Reply ↓ JohnnyGL February 15, 2017 at 11:44 am As Yves as explained, if there’s no access to the SWIFT payments system for international wire transactions, there’s no imports/exports. Truckloads of physical euros getting shuttled across the border is NOT a realistic option for a variety of reasons. If Lapavitsas can’t somehow guarantee SWIFT access for the new Drachma, then those “IT obstacles” become a crushing burden to overcome. If they DO get SWIFT access, then things look better, but still not as optimistic as Argentina after they broke the dollar peg. Argentina got a tailwind with buoyant grain/soy prices to help them balance payments. Greece only has the tourism industry, which is much flakier than food exports. Reply ↓ ChrisAtRU February 15, 2017 at 12:41 pm Well … there’s always hacking! ;-) Curious to see if the Greeks take Schäuble’s offer this time – debt relief for #GrExit. My inclination is that the Euromantic Greeks will not. Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorFebruary 15, 2017 at 6:32 pm Argentina also already had its own currency! Not at all comparable as far as the IT issues are concerned. Reply ↓ Left in Wisconsin February 15, 2017 at 11:49 am I agree that he has not adequately characterized Yves’ position but he admits to not being a regular reader. And Yves has strongly emphasized many times the practical difficulties of exiting the Euro, such that a non-regular reader could conclude that her central conclusion is that exiting is an impossibility. Not accurate perhaps but understandable. I read Lapavitsas’ main point as “There is no solution for Greece if we keep the Euro so we must get rid of it even though there may be adjustment costs.” What I found a bit strange was the separation of the argument about low German wages from the argument about high German productivity. German productivity doesn’t have to be growing rapidly if existing conditions and the Euro ensure a permanent productivity advantage. On the other hand, unless he is suggesting that higher wages in Germany will lead to a lot more German vacations in Greece, bringing a lot of new Euros into the latter (which I think is exactly what he is saying), then it is hard to see the connection between higher wages in Germany and better outcomes in Greece. Because he has already dismissed productivity as an issue. Despite my own reservations, I have come to the conclusion that both the EU and Euro are toast, though TPTB may succeed in dragging the process out for several more years. If the Greeks play their cards right, maybe they can jointly exit the Euro at the same time as the Finns or the French and they can share the IT burden. Reply ↓ ChrisAtRU February 15, 2017 at 12:00 pm #BodySnatcherAlert It was actually Schäuble under the hood! Good effing grief. Competitiveness is neoliberal euphemism for “wage depression”. Someone in the commentariat reminded us of the German “mini-jobs” morass recently. I guess he doesn’t mind the 40% cut to his pension to help increase Greek competitiveness (or perhaps MP’s were spared). Reply ↓ Oregoncharles February 15, 2017 at 3:41 pm Once again: what isn’t sustainable will come to an end – as Yves herself said the last time we discussed this. Greece in the Euro isn’t sustainable. That is Lapavitsas’ motivation. The real question, then, is “how?” Unfortunately, the likeliest answer is “badly.” As someone else said, Greece’s best bet at this point is to hang on until one of the forthcoming elections (my bet is on France – but it might be more than one) goes against the Euro and EVERYBODY has to deal with it. Then the transition is more like the transition INTO the Euro. If they wind up going it alone, probably suddenly, then Lapavitsas will turn out to be guilty of wishful thinking, unless NC missed something. I certainly wouldn’t know. International payments go through SWIFT, do they not? How independent is it? Might matter a lot. Reply ↓ Tom_Doak February 15, 2017 at 5:14 pm Is it not possible that someone has been working since the last Greek crisis to sort out the payments systems, etc., and that the Grexit will take place as soon as they can manage it technically? Because everyone knows what happens when the circles around the drain start to tighten … I suppose it’s also possible that they won’t allow it, that some will insist that Greece should bear all the burden of separation when it happens, and be severely punished. Because it seems there are plenty of evil people among the “minders.” Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorFebruary 15, 2017 at 6:36 pm It isn’t even remotely just in Greece’s hands. There are tons of other parties outside Greece that have to do coding too. You can’t even start until everyone agrees on a three letter designation for the new currency. That’s a matter of international standards (ISO). That doesn’t have to take very long, but it is a necessary condition for getting started in any meaningful way. Since I have not heard of anyone asking for a new ISO code, it’s not likely anyone, even in Greece, has done any real work. Reply ↓ Procopius February 16, 2017 at 8:04 am I noticed he mischaracterized the Indian demonetization, too. They didn’t remove the high denomination bank notes. Those, they left in place. What they removed were the equivalent of American $10 and $20 bills, without increasing the number of $5 and $1 bills in circulation. What they’re proposing to bring in are the equivalent of American $50 bills and, eventually, an increase in the supply of smaller bills. Not completely unworkable, but less convenient than the system they’re throwing away. He’s either a maroon (unlikely) or your typical political weasel with his own used car to sell you.

Reply ↓ From Cold Mountain February 15, 2017 at 1:25 pm Really? His action was outward, in a sense, yes? We all read of this man’s struggle and it effected us in someway. Maybe he was tired, like me, of all the fighting, and saw there was no need for fighting. Or if we fought and own there would be more fighting against us. And on and on. Because as a culture, humans have not learned that doing nothing is the greatest common denominator. That doing, and being, nothing would bring peace. But the influence for us to be and do is just too much in the Facebook generation. What that man performed was the ultimate boycott. He will no longer need to buy food, clothes and shelter from these multinational companies that are raping the earth and exploiting everyone. But until we get the middle class to boycott these companies people like him, and I will suffer. And there is a limit to human pain and suffering. I empathize with him, for I am close to suicide myself. I am on disability and functionally homeless. I want to work but I get fired the moment I relapse because “Right to Work” is newspeak. Reply ↓ kareninca February 15, 2017 at 7:13 pm I’m very sorry about how hard things are for you. I fervently hope you don’t kill yourself. It’s hard to know what else to write. Things may not get much better economically anytime soon. Some people find help by joining a church; I have a friend who is homeless who is allowed to park in the local Lutheran church’s parking lot (I know that doesn’t sound like much but in Silicon valley, having a place to park the car you live in can be a big deal). The people in the congregation have been very nice to her. If you don’t like religion (fair enough) there are other groups; you have to make sure you’re not alone. Reply ↓ From Cold Mountain February 15, 2017 at 10:08 pm Thanks Kareninca. I am not in as bad of an economic state as most people, even being on disability, but it means I will have to move away from my community, which I am not looking forward to. I do not even own a car. But I am intelligent, so I will manage for now. Several people in my family have attempted or have died by suicide. So I know enough about it to check into a hospital before I get too out there. But thank you again. People do not seem to understand how just a simple kind word can help. Reply ↓ kareninca February 16, 2017 at 1:07 am It’s clear that you have a lot going for you. In your case, I think you will be able to help other people as well as helping yourself. Best wishes, and good luck, although I don’t think you’ll need luck. Reply ↓ Bill February 15, 2017 at 10:09 am Fairly typical statements of someone suffering from the psychological state of “depersonalization”. Real people with real lives don’t think or talk like this. It’s almost a setup for suicide……..all is hopeless because “the general condition of things is unacceptable too me”……..Actually, we could al say that, fairly truthfully, at any time, and then feel hopeless and cut our wrists. This is the writing of someone who has distanced themselves from their feelings of pleasure in everyday life and events. Reply ↓ jrs February 15, 2017 at 1:26 pm “This is the writing of someone who has distanced themselves from their feelings of pleasure in everyday life and events.” There is more wrong here than is easily made economic (no of course it doesn’t help we live under capitalism, that is a system build entirely on slavery and exploitation and little else, but even so). However, I don’t think it’s really a CHOICE to be distanced from feelings of everyday pleasure etc.. Set points of sensitivity to pleasure and pain are probably partly genetic and also set very early in life. For some pain comes way too easy, enjoyment comes too hard (true if this person had a different life maybe they’d still get enough despite this). And enough stress over a life can exacerbate this, so pain is even more frequent, enjoyment even more elusive. Reply ↓ From Cold Mountain February 15, 2017 at 1:29 pm Funny how it is always “their fault” for suffering. “Real people with real lives”? There is no true Scottsman. I want you to live my real life for a month and see how you do. The man was an artists, and there is no room for art in Neo-liberalism. It is non-local, and non-profitable. Art serves people, not profit. You know, he was probably told by all his teaches that he could be “anything he wanted to be”. So he listen to them and what he got was nothing close to what they told him. Reply ↓ Mel February 15, 2017 at 1:49 pm Artists can be alarming. Check this: The two real political parties in America are the Winners and the Losers. The people do not acknowledge this. They claim membership in two imaginary parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, instead. Both imaginary parties are bossed by Winners. When Republicans battle Democrats, this much is certain: Winners will win. This is very familiar. It is also from 1972. Kurt Vonnegut. Thirty-five years later we catch up.

A seasonally adjusted 2.9% in December 2016, and only 2.6% without seasonal adjustment. Maybe one day we’ll talk about the Celtic Tiger again. But Ireland, hamstrung by its inability to devalue and by harsh austerity measures, shows lingering weakness, masked by emigration, to this day. Iceland, by contrast, is the one looking like a Nordic Tiger. I’m not sure its helpful to compare Ireland to Iceland as the structures of the economies are so very different. But its certainly true that the failure to really address austerity and the banking system is a key reason for a slow Irish economy. A real problem for the Irish economy which is not addressed often is that it lost an enormous amount of output capacity. Emigration, quite simply, meant that the construction industry shrunk to a fraction of its size. Last week I listened to multiple complaints on radio about the lack of housing in Dublin and, most particularly, that the new National Childrens Hospital will cost 1 billion euro to build, up from an original estimate of 45 million. The reason for both problems is linked – the Irish construction industry has been stretched to absolute capacity trying to catch up with growth, but is unwilling to pay money to get all the engineers and architects back who have moved to London, Sydney and Vancouver. The result? Massive inflation in construction costs. In the case of the National Childrens Hospital, it will cost at least a quarter of a billion more to build because of the failure to build it during the recession (because austerity), and instead build it when the money is available – i.e. a classic case of pro-cyclical policy. Nobody mentioned this once in all the discussions I listened to. A particular issue in Ireland which is widely noticed now is that there is really a dual economy. Dublin and the immediate region is booming. Lots of jobs, restaurants full, cranes on every horizon. But the rest of the country is still mired in recession, with strong tourism growth the only bright spot.

Reply ↓ Jeremy Grimm February 15, 2017 at 1:04 pm Some thoughts on the Kucinich video clip: The Military Industrial Complex and Intelligence Industrial Complex is not monolithic. A new Cold War with Russia might benefit some portions of each — but often with costs to other portions of both behemoths. Even the Pentagon and Intelligence budgets cannot grow without constraints which makes money going to “X” pull money from “Y”. When the Army built its Future Combat Systems — the Navy and Air Force had to wait their turn to build their ships and F-35s. I suspect similar considerations are at play in the Department of Homeland Security. The CIA/Pentagon undermining Obama’s peace initiative in Syria — assuming it was an undermining of Obama’s authority as Commander-in-Chief — should have resulted in a major shake-up at the highest levels of both organizations. Obama did nothing. Trump must clean house if he expects to act as Commander-in-Chief. As an aside — the Pentagon teaming with the CIA seems very strange. I have trouble believing Flynn resigned and went without Trump’s support solely on account of the leaked/reported reasons. Kucinich expressed concern that Trump needs to find a reliable source for his and the Nation’s information. Our Intelligence Industrial Complex has proven an extremely poor source for reliable information. I would expect Trump’s business associates could provide him with better information to support his operations than the Intelligence Industrial Complex. To maintain his authority Trump needs to ask for a lot of resignations from high levels throughout the Military Industrial Complex and Intelligence Industrial Complex.

Perhaps we should consider, as has been commented on NC, you don’t get to be president unless they have something on you. Certainly in the case of Trump that appears true, it seems Trump will be rolled. The question is whether he will resign or fall in line and play along.

Reply ↓ fresno dan February 15, 2017 at 9:04 am The Flynn Defenestration Will Hamper Trump’s Foreign Policy Moon of Alabama (Carolinian) So why was Flynn really under pressure and why didn’t Trump back him? It would have been easy for Trump to say: “I ordered Flynn to do that. Obama did similar. In both cases it was a GREAT success. USA! USA! USA!” Nobody would have been able to further attack Flynn over the issue after such a protective move. But Trump, completely against his style, held his mouth and did nothing. What else happened in the White House that let him refrain from backing Flynn? Sure, the real beef other people have with Flynn is not about Russia but other issues, like his plans to reform the intelligence services. But by throwing Flynn out like this Trump opened himself to further attacks. As it looks now a rather small gang of current and former intelligence officials – with the help of the anti-Trump media – leaked Flynn out of his office. They will not stop there. Now blood is in the street and the hyenas will lust for more. The Trump magic is broken. He has shown vulnerability. Now they will go after their next target within the Trump administration and then the next and the next until they have Trump isolated and by the balls. …… Flynn is no big loss for the world, the U.S. or the Trump administration. But Trump has now lost the initiative. He long managed to set the media agenda for the day by this or that “outrageous” tweet or remark. Now this advantage has been taken away from him over some nonsense allegations and his lack of backing for one of his top people. He will soon rue the day he let this happen. =============================================================== Reply ↓ jsn February 15, 2017 at 9:36 am DeFlynnistration Reply ↓ Benedict@Large February 15, 2017 at 11:18 am Too bad Trump made such a poor appointment to Attorney General. The withholding of information on Flynn during his vetting should at least be referred there for possible criminal wrongdoing, but (and I noted this when sessions name came up) who the hell would take Sessions seriously were that to happen? It seemed to me then that the most important job Trump’s AG would have early of was protecting Trump from an internal coup. Reply ↓ Ed February 15, 2017 at 12:45 pm The acting Attorney General at the time was an Obama holdover and in fact one of the principle movers in the plot against Flynn. Trump’s pick for Attorney General, Sessions, hadn’t been confirmed yet. His vote was needed in the Senate to confirm DeVos as Secretary of Education, so his confirmation vote was delayed. One worry I had about Trump is that his lack of government experience means he could easily get played by the DC crowd and this does seem to be happening. Reply ↓ Anne February 15, 2017 at 9:46 am Martin Longman at WaMo doesn’t think the “blackmail” threat adds up, at least as it’s being presented to us: It’s very hard to believe that the Trump administration remained ignorant about the transcript(s) prior to getting the DOJ notice in “late January.” But, assuming that is actually true, they knew at least at that point the threat of blackmail was over and that Flynn still had a real problem. In fact, no later than that point, they realized that Spicer and Pence had a problem because they were on the record defending Flynn. If we read between the lines here, it’s clear that something a little different happened. The DOJ notice wasn’t really about the Russians blackmailing Flynn. It was about the Intelligence Community blackmailing Trump. If they didn’t get rid of Flynn voluntarily, then they’d leak the transcripts and expose them all for lying. It wasn’t the only message that was fired across the administration’s bow. The CIA denied one of Flynn’s National Security Council appointee’s a security clearance. A senior Defense Intelligence analyst said, “since January 20, we’ve assumed that the Kremlin has ears inside the SITROOM [Situation Room],” and “There’s not much the Russians don’t know at this point.” There were “multiple current and former US law enforcement and intelligence officials” who told CNN that the British dossier was getting corroborated. “Two defense officials” were quoted saying that “the Army has been investigating whether Mr. Flynn received money from the Russian government during a trip he took to Moscow in 2015” in possible violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. Bold is mine. The administration, meanwhile, has everyone on board with new talking points: that what Flynn did wasn’t a problem – the problem is the leakers that exposed it. And as Glenn Greenwald points out, here: It’s hard to put into words how strange it is to watch the very same people — from both parties, across the ideological spectrum — who called for the heads of Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning, Tom Drake, and so many other Obama-era leakers today heap praise on those who leaked the highly sensitive, classified SIGINT information that brought down Gen. Flynn. It’s even more surreal to watch Democrats act as though lying to the public is some grave firing offense when President Obama’s top national security official, James Clapper, got caught red-handed not only lying to the public but also to Congress — about a domestic surveillance program that courts ruled was illegal. And despite the fact that lying to Congress is a felony, he kept his job until the very last day of the Obama presidency. […] But this is just the tawdry, craven game of Washington. People with no actual beliefs shamelessly take diametrically opposite views on fundamental political questions based exclusively on whether it helps or hurts their leaders. Thus, the very same Democrats who just three months ago viewed illegal leaking as a grave sin today view it as an act of heroic #Resistance. What matters far more than this lowly and empty game-playing is the principle that is so vividly apparent here. Given the extreme secrecy powers that have arisen under the war on terror, one of the very few ways that the public has left for learning about what its government officials do is illegal leaking. As Trevor Timm notes, numerous leaks have already achieved great good in the three short weeks that Trump has been president. Notwithstanding the reality that we live in very fked-up times, perhaps I am being craven as well when I suggest that the benefit of beginning a round of investigations and possibly hearings is that maybe it will slow-walk what the GOP thought was going to be a lightning round blitz of legislation to unravel and repeal any and everything that had even a scintilla of progressive elements. Or, maybe the GOP will realize that Dems will be so mesmerized and distracted by the shiny object of Trump’s Benghazi, that it will be easier to “get things done.” Sometimes the chaos works for you, and sometimes it doesn’t, but it’s clear that chaos is going to rule the day for the foreseeable future.

I think the major difference is the spooks have the info on practically everybody now – no longer necessary to target someone specifically and build a file on them. Just sweep it all up and store for when it might be needed. This aspect has not been discussed nearly enough. All the data that’s being collected isn’t to provide intelligence. There is so much being collected it’s nearly impossible to separate a signal from the noise. The real reason the spooks want all this is so it’s available in case someone won’t play ball and needs to be blackmailed which is exactly what going on right now.

Reply ↓ Jeremy Grimm February 15, 2017 at 1:16 pm I’m not fan of Trump but I’d rather a few old soldiers were made to “fade away”. The President as figurehead is not a pleasant idea. Besides I believe not only is the President not a figurehead but the President has too much power. President Obama was less than a figurehead — he was too busy figuring how to get ahead after he left office. Reply ↓ Anne February 15, 2017 at 1:06 pm Maybe we’re seeing one of the consequences of having such a massive security/intelligence apparatus upon which there are fewer constraints than ever. Add to that what had always been the case, that of politicians putting that apparatus to use for their own agenda, which often involved engineering the collapse of governments, or installing new leadership, or God knows what else. Okay, so how normal would it be for someone running for president and not the incumbent to have someone on his – or her – campaign, using connections gained via some sort of government service, to aid in that candidate’s win, or bring about an opponent’s loss? I mean, I have no idea what the answer to that is – I don’t think I’ve read or heard anyone saying that Flynn’s alleged involvement during the campaign and before the election falls into the category of “no problem, they all do that.” Maybe they do, but you’d think we might have heard about it if it was a normal kind of thing. Or maybe not – seems like the kind of thing they’d definitely want to keep the lid on. Okay, so then Trump is elected. Part of the transition is reaching out to your counterparts around the world – I get that – but is it normal for a president-elect, or someone on his staff, to appear to begin to be implementing new policy or changing the old before the end of the sitting president’s term? Once he took the oath of office, Trump certainly had the right to lift sanctions, but how normal or accepted is it to essentially come in during the transition period and eat the sitting president’s lunch? It’s not like Obama decided, in his last 2+ months in office, to defer to the president-elect, to hand him the keys and say, “Okay, let’s slap that Student Driver magnet on this thing and let you take the government out for a spin – I’ll sit in the back seat and catch some zzzz’s. Try not to crash the car, okay?” Finally, can we at least admit that between Trump and Flynn, Trump was the novice who knew nothing about how things worked? That Flynn had been known to go rogue in the past, had a habit of ignoring the rules when he didn’t agree with them (probably one of the things Trump actually liked about him), and that he could have led Trump to believe that what he, Flynn, was doing – or even what Trump wanted him to do – was just a case of “this is how it works?” Is that possible? As usual, I have more questions than answers, but the reason I’ve posed them is because I wonder if the intelligence community isn’t feeling its powers have been usurped by someone who doesn’t have the authority to do so, and is now making it clear that that is just not going to be happening.

It’s pretty eye-opening. From what I can tell politicians do this type of thing all the time which is why we never hear about it – because it’s a big nothingburger. Trying to cite the Logan Act is just more BS – in the over 200 years of its history not one single person has been prosecuted under it ever. If the spooks are feeling that their power has been usurped, well then good for Trump (I can’t believe I just typed that) because they are not the ones in charge.

Apparently, Pence was livid at being lied to and in turn, lying. Any thoughts on that? I’m not as well informed on this subject as I should be.

Reply ↓ fresno dan February 15, 2017 at 9:16 am Carla February 15, 2017 at 7:36 am The neocons and liberal hawks also hated Flynn because – as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency – he oversaw a prescient 2012 analysis that foresaw that their support for the Syrian insurgency would give rise to “a declared or undeclared Salafist principality in eastern Syria.” The DIA report, which was partially declassified in a lawsuit over the 2012 killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other U.S. personnel in Benghazi, Libya, embarrassed the advocates for an escalation of the war in Syria and the ouster of secular President Bashar al-Assad. Flynn even went further in a 2015 interview when he said the intelligence was “very clear” that the Obama administration made a “willful decision” to back these jihadists in league with Middle East allies, a choice that looked particularly stupid when Islamic State militants started beheading American hostages and capturing cities in Iraq. ……………. But “regime change” in Syria was dear to the neocons’ hearts. After all, Israeli leaders had declared Assad’s removal central to smashing the so-called “Shiite crescent” reaching from Tehran through Damascus to Beirut. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Aug. 30, 2013, claims to have proof that the Syrian government was responsible for a chemical weapons attack on Aug. 21, 2013, but that evidence failed to materialize or was later discredited. [State Department photo] The neocons and liberal hawks had come very close to getting the direct U.S. military intervention that they so wanted to destroy Assad’s army after a mysterious sarin gas attack outside Damascus on Aug. 21, 2013. The Obama administration quickly pinned the atrocity on Assad even though a number of U.S. intelligence analysts suspected a “false flag” attack carried out by jihadists. ……………… Amid these heightened tensions, the mainstream media in the United States and Europe joined in the full-scale Russia/Putin-bashing. All rational perspective on the underlying reality was lost, except for a handful of independent Internet journalists and foreign-policy outsiders who rejected the over-the-top propaganda. A Few Dissenters Too Many But even a few dissenters were a few dissenters too many. So, to enforce the new groupthink – holding Russia at fault for pretty much everything – a new McCarthyism emerged, deeming anyone who dared disagree a “Moscow stooge” or a “Russian propagandist.” Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaking with supporters at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, March 21, 2016. (Photo by Gage Skidmore) The ugliness penetrated into the U.S. presidential campaign because Democrat Hillary Clinton took a belligerent line toward Russia while Trump broke with the Republican establishment and called for improved ties between Washington and Moscow. Clinton called Trump Putin’s “puppet” and – after Clinton’s stunning loss – the Obama administration floated unproven allegations that Putin had intervened in the election to put Trump in the White House. ================================================== This is a great article because it shows the tremendous inertia in the Federal government.

Reply ↓ dcrane February 16, 2017 at 1:23 am That’s fascinating…but according to Wikipedia Trump can reassert his powers any time he wishes, and if the VP-Cabinet coalition disagrees it goes to Congress and requires two-thirds of both houses (within 21 days following 48 hours to assemble Congress if necessary) to keep the Veep in charge. If the Prez again contests, the voting is repeated in apparently Groundhog Day fashion.

He says in his resignation letter that he did not deliberately leave out elements of his conversations with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak when he recounted them to Vice President Mike Pence………….Russian ambassador raised the sanctions to Flynn and that Flynn responded that the Trump team would be taking office in a few weeks and would review Russia policy and sanctions. That’s neither illegal nor improper. …… He was also a fat target for Democrats. Remember Flynn’s breakout national moment last summer was when he joined the crowd at the Republican National Convention from the dais calling for Hillary Clinton to be jailed. In normal times, the idea that U.S. officials entrusted with our most sensitive secrets would selectively disclose them to undermine the White House would alarm those worried about creeping authoritarianism. Imagine if intercepts of a call between Obama’s incoming national security adviser and Iran’s foreign minister leaked to the press before the nuclear negotiations began? The howls of indignation would be deafening. =================================================================== Thanks Carla – good catch. I guess what I take out of it is what a pussycat Trump is – despite all the bluster not any fight at all for one of his (Trump’s) appointees. No need to impeach Trump – he will do exactly as he is told… Was Flynn someone who Trump personally decided on, or was Flynn just chosen from a hat? I would think that as Flynn spoke at the convention, Trump had some desire in bringing this guy into his administration. It will be a change of pace – instead of all the yammering about how a president is loyal to a fault, we will have with Trump “cause any deviation from my tweet storms, and your FIRED.” Reply ↓ Montanamaven February 15, 2017 at 8:55 am From the comments section of the MOA piece comes this link. theduran Reply ↓ Pat February 15, 2017 at 9:20 am Interesting.

Reply ↓ Carolinian February 15, 2017 at 10:28 am This is a good article. Sample: In passing I should say that I find it impossible to believe that Sally Yates herself genuinely believes that the warnings she is supposed to have given the White House about Flynn are anything other than absurd. What they in fact show is not that there is a serious case against Flynn but – as was also shown by Yates’s refusal to defend the ‘travel ban’ Executive Order in the courts – that as Acting Attorney General Yates was actively working against the President and the administration she was supposed to be serving, in this case by making farfetched claims against one of the President’s advisers. One wonders whether the Yemen raid fiasco may have also caused Trump to not defend.

Reply ↓ Carolinian February 15, 2017 at 12:43 pm It’s a standard bit of rhetorical phraseology. The article is clearly labeled as opinion and therefore everything therein is by implication opinion. Your objection seems to be that he doesn’t paste an IMO in front of every sentence. And btw the notion that Yates–on the way out in any case–was conducting a bit of political grandstanding by her resignation is hardly confined to this article. The similar notion that she referred Flynn for political reasons strikes me as quite plausible. Reply ↓ Carolinian February 15, 2017 at 12:48 pm That is to say “by her defiance.” She was of course fired by Trump rather than resigned. Reply ↓ Katharine February 15, 2017 at 1:04 pm “Standard” is questionable. To the extent that it is an accurate description, writing standards have sunk dramatically in the past thirty years. Decent English writing does not require pasting IMO anywhere. It calls for use of expressions that accurately reflect what the author means to communicate, e.g. They appear rather…. They might more plausibly be viewed as…. Here of all places, I would hope to see the traditional concept of “fact” respected. Reply ↓ Anne February 15, 2017 at 1:30 pm When one is expressing an opinion, one generally tries to stay away from phrases like “what they in fact show,” because as soon as one makes that kind of declarative statement, one has crossed over from engaging in a bit of rhetorical phraseology, to engaging in rhetorical deception. And, for what it’s worth, just because one can find multiple expressions of opinion about anything, including someone else’s motives, does not elevate those opinions to the level of fact.

Daniel Ramirez Medina, 23, was arrested Friday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who went to the suburban Seattle home to arrest the man’s father. ICE spokeswoman Rose Richeson said in a statement that agents were there targeting a “prior-deported felon.” Ramirez, however, was brought to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 7 and has a work permit under Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He also has a job, a young son and no criminal record, Northwest Immigrants Rights Project Legal Director Matt Adams said. Ramirez is being held in Tacoma. … And the House and Senate are cranking out Congressional Review Act rollbacks of regulations, which he has been happily signing. “Done almost nothing” = the frogs are getting warm.

Reply ↓ Katniss Everdeen February 15, 2017 at 8:27 am Ultimately it was obama who did almost nothing for the “dreamers” except put them in this position. His “protection” was structured in such a way as to only exist as long as he was around. For whatever reason, he never saw fit to make it impervious to future challenges by chief executives who didn’t see things the way he did. Maybe he was sucked in by visions of “permanent democratic majorities.” Or maybe he “somehow” knew clinton would succeed him. Or maybe he just didn’t give enough of a shit to suffer the slings and arrows that would come from defending the indefensible, regardless of how sympathetic they were. But one thing’s for sure. Trump didn’t make the laws that obama spent eight years taking credit for ignoring.

The subsequent Democratic wins were driven by making sure not to leave those votes on the table. Hillary did worse despite 12 years of population growth. The Democratic establishment is reacting as spoiled children are apt to do. They aren’t thinking through the consequences of their actions. Their behavior is about diverting attention from “are you ready or Hillary” madness, and their complicity in delivering Trump.

It is known. In the US, the ratio of governors to governed, and the corresponding accountability of what soon became “the rulers” to “the ruled,” started to approach a limit of zero as soon as the republic was founded. At first, the ratio was intended to be about 1 to 30,000. That had already gone by the board by 1840; thereafter, it spun out of control completely. The 17 million Americans in the 1840 census enjoyed 242 representatives; the 31 million Americans of 1860 enjoyed even fewer, 238, in 1858. And by now the numbers are laughable: 320 million people are “represented” by 435, about 700,000:1, while the proportion of the national wealth spent by those persons has risen from 2% to 20%. So the idea of representative or accountable government is a laughable relic for the US, of exactly the same utility as the fragment of the True Cross in a medieval church crypt. It is there to inspire the credulous to kneel. People might as well yell at the movie screen, while spitting at their neighbors, as talk national politics. It is just like talking about a football game on TV. Really, they have no say in the outcome: it is just a moment of vicarious pleasure, endowing them in their fantasies with something they will never have in life: power, or influence over power. But it does make money for the high priests of futile babble, just like sports; so I can’t say it is completely pointless.

I have enough faith in Sanders’ political acumen and commitment to his cause(s), that if he found it beneficial to break away from the Democrats, he would do so.

Despite the odds against him he has run rings around them and is still very much in the game, still fighting the good fight. He’s had to make compromises along the way, but he hasn’t compromised on the core issues and as such continues to be a huge embarrassment to the Dems.

Reply ↓ RabidGandhi February 15, 2017 at 8:50 am Sanders is already a “player” and there is nothing the Vichy Democrats can do about it. When Sanders decided to run as a Democrat (with all the sliminess that entailed) I was the first to criticise his strategy. I was wrong. If Sanders had not ran as a D, he never would have become a national phenomenon and his mantras of socialised healthcare and punish the bankers would still be well outside the Overton Window. Instead, he now tours around the country rallying support for policies that a mere two years ago would have been unthinkable to get people talking about. I would compare the Sanders 2016 phenomenon to Occupy. Sure many can say that Occupy did not achieve its goals (whatever they were), but it did make one huge step forward: it brought the idea of the 99% vs the 1% into the public discourse: it brought the discussion of inequality onto the table despite it having been banned for decades by the our Acela Bubble Overlords. To me, moving the public discourse is far more important than winning the presidency or permanently occupying Zuccotti Square, because material change is not going to come from presidential maneouvres or a small group of activists occupying public spaces; it’s only going to come from the mass of the population demanding substantial concrete changes. In that regard, Sanders, a self-proclaimed Socialist being unremovably on the public scene, is something that rightly frightens the bejeezus out of the imperial eunuchs plaguing Washington.

No real change happens until there is failure of governance at the center, either through bankruptcy, war, or widespread civil disorder, which creates a power vacuum, which may then be exploited by an organized group of intellectuals allied with a politically powerful and well financed cohort of already powerful people who roll forward a popular, well-articulated and program of reform that has been discussed for a generation and is therefore already widely familiar and culturally accepted, and indeed is already almost taken for granted as the cure for what ails ya. Until that time, violence will be swiftly met with more effective violence, and the people who “put their lives at risk to fight,” as you have it, will go to prison or the hospital, with only one result: to establish the existing authorities even more firmly than they had been before, now bolstered by the full support of the propertied classes, whose fears ripen them for polarization by the demagogues of reaction. RR Palmer’s work, including especially Twelve Who Ruled and Age of The Democratic Revolution, is a graduate seminar in the paradigms of such things. Learning them in advance saves lives, money, and grief. Also recommend Edmund Wilson’s To The Finland Station, a must read for anyone on this site. The playbooks of both sides were written from 1789-1820, and really nothing basic has been added since then, although subsequent examples have proliferated and historical interpretation continues to ramify and grow in sophistication. Reply ↓ aletheia33 February 16, 2017 at 8:51 am just noting, by putting their lives at risk i do not mean physical fighting. i refer to MLK’s phrase “coffin ready” vis a vis nonviolent action and to willingness to risk one’s livelihood or other major supports of one’s life as one would ideally prefer to live it. obviously a tall order for people raising children, yet parents did this in the civil rights movement. and yes, further out the spectrum, people were scaring the establishment to death by rioting and advocating militant action, and maybe that is a necessity as well. do you include gene sharp in your reading recommendations? thank you for your recommendations and thoughts, i will continue to keep my mind open for further education!

The truth is, Trump would rather just do the job himself. Politico reports that White House chief of staff Reince Priebus is struggling to fill what is, in theory, an extremely prestigious post and that at least two people have turned down offers. Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News Thursday that the report is false. … The real problem is that it is hard to imagine any communications director feeling empowered to do what the gig typically entails: creating a strategic messaging plan for the White House. This is not a theoretical concern. Recall that then-candidate Trump went through three surrogate communications directors in a seven-week span last summer. … Reply ↓ Ed February 15, 2017 at 1:44 pm This is interesting.

Reply ↓ The Trumpening February 15, 2017 at 8:18 am The cover story for the Flynn firing makes no sense. No doubt after Obama imposed sanctions on Russia in December Flynn called the Russian ambassador to say this was no biggy. The goal was to stop Russia escalating with a tit-for-tat. But Flynn would not have done this on his own accord. And surely this is far from Flynn’s first rodeo and so he knows any calls to the Russian ambassador are recorded by counterintelligence officers. And true to form, after Putin declined to escalate the sanctions, Trump called him smart on Twitter. So there is no way Flynn was let go for “lying” because it is not conceivable that Trump and Pence were not aware of his actions since they probably ordered him to make the contact. Trump Twitter (aka #FrogTwitter or the lastest, #MilkTwitter) is either reacting with overblown anger at Trump’s cowardice or pointing out that Flynn was kind of a warmongering NeoCon so perhaps it is better he is gone. The one thing Trump excels at is hiring and firing. He also understands better than most the importance of not caving into the media or to establishment pressure. But Flynn was at the center of two of the Trump Administration’s most worrying policies. First escalating with Iran is just plain dumb since the US has no leverage (short of war, which Trump has promised to stop doing) and so it would have been better to ignore Iran. The raid in Yemen seemed problematic as well. Trump has promised more of a paleo-conservative foreign policy but the first three weeks had more of a neo-conservative feel. Perhaps Bannon and Trump decided Flynn was a liability on foreign policy and decided to take the opportunity these Russian leaks afforded to dump Flynn without humiliating him with the real reason why they were doing so?

Trump’s executive orders may not be accomplishing much, but I think they serve as a blueprint for the Congress, and it’s there where some real damage can be done – and little the Dems will be able to do about it. Once the Cabinet gets up and running, and working in a nice rhythm with the GOP in Congress, that’s when the real trouble starts. I don’t anticipate the GOP doing much to check whatever Trump’s up to, as long as his bill-signing pen is in good working order. Unless and until there’s some kind of event in which Trump just completely shits the bed and the GOP’s constituents are coming at them with torches and pitchforks, I think we can expect the GOP to just go along and pretend that all is well.

Just as certainly, this flurry of federal contract awards will be followed by numerous bid protests during the ensuing months. This white paper explains the various administrative and judicial protest fora available to disappointed bidders seeking to challenge awards they contend were flawed, provides an outline of each forum’s respective procedures, and examines the benefits and disadvantages of each forum. This white paper is designed to assist offerors and contractors contemplating whether and where to file a protest challenging a contract award to a competitor, or whether to intervene in a protest to protect a contract award, with an understanding of how the federal bid protest process operates. Even before the current financial crisis, the U.S. government was considered the largest single procurer of goods and services in the world, and the inexorable growth of federal procurement in recent years has been nothing short of breathtaking. Since 2000, the rate of growth in federal contract procurement spending has exceeded the rate of U.S. inflation in every year, and cumulatively during the period of 2000 through 2006 grew at a rate five times the rate of U.S. inflation (Federal Procurement Data System, 2007). While this rate of growth is certainly not sustainable, annual federal procurement budgets in excess of $400 billion, outside of financial-recovery-related spending, are now the reality, providing an attractive market opportunity for vendors in virtually every field of goods and services.1 Notwithstanding a 20-year movement toward more commercialized approaches to federal procurement, selling to the government is always governed by federal statutes and regulations, and offerors invariably will invest considerable time and resources in responding to an agency solicitation. Consequently, vendors expect fair and even-handed consideration of their submissions, consistent with the terms of the solicitation and governing statutes and regulations. Additionally, Congress utilizes the federal acquisition marketplace to advance a variety of socio-economic goals, and those benefited by such policies, notably the small business community, insist on agency adherence to these policies in the acquisition process. Above all, the public expects an honest, competitive, and transparent procurement system that yields good value for taxpayer dollars. To those ends, the Obama administration has signaled its intent to foster firm, fixed-price contracts in lieu of cost-based contracts, and to increase contracting oversight as well as its opposition to noncompetitive contract awards and outsourcing. http://govcon.net/guide-to-federal-procurement-protests/ Ain’t that a stitch?

While it’s a minority hypothesis in the scientific community, the correlation of amyloid plaques and onset of Alzheimers disease is not an open and shut case. But because academic science is skewed towards molecular mechanisms of disease with tractable biomarkers, the overwhelming focus is on reducing plaques. And what Merck and other studies keep confirming is that treating the plaques does absolutely no good. To me the emphasis needs to be on holistic approaches to health.

If you tune out most of the societal pressure and propaganda from the government and corporations, you can go to community college and then finish a four year degree at a state school with little student debt. You can live at home for a handful of years while you get established. When you work, you save 15% of your income and put it into well-diversified low cost tax-deferred funds (e.g. Vanguard Target Date funds). You only buy a house or condo when prices are reasonable and you can afford them. If renting is cheaper, do that. A car is for transport, so buy as small as possible and only if you actually need one. There is huge societal pressure to do the opposite of what I just listed above. You will generally be branded as a “loser” by many people. But you will be the one building up a large savings balance and not a lot of debt. Retirement in your 50s and 60s would actually be feasible. If you do what the TV says you should do, go to prestigious schools at high cost using student debt, overbuy a house immediately, buy expensive new cars every three years, put your money into the non-fiduciary accounts of financial advisors that are “helping” you, then retirement will probably just be a chimera, but you will be viewed as a “winner”.

Private universities in the US are astronomically priced. Many of the student loan debacles are coming out of the private college and university system. There are a lot of seats in relatively inexpensive state universities and most community colleges are high quality and one of the best deals of anything in these country. A major problem is that there is little good career counseling in high school and the first couple of years of university. Taking out $25k of loans per year is a very expensive way of finding yourself. Most Fortune 100 CEOs didn’t graduate from Ivy League colleges. I don’t believe in free college, but anybody should be able to work summer and part-time jobs and graduate with less than 1x typical starting annual gross pay in debt. That is not possible at many universities. 2. People are getting married later and household sizes are smaller. Yet the average new home size has doubled over the past few decades while inflation-adjusted square foot cost has stayed the same. So house costs are going up. Rent restrictions etc. in cities is also putting pressure on rentals and condos in those cities. We have multiple millennial children. We focused on controlling education costs and loan amounts, so none of them carried more than $25k of loan at graduation. Only half of the kids own cars. A couple still live at home but cover their costs at home. The older one of those has paid off a small amount of student debt, been stashing money away, and could buy a house in our area without even blinking at this point, but is continuing to save money instead. The youngest is still figuring things out but went to community college and has no debt, so a lot of freedom to figure things out. The older kids have been saving aggressively for retirement and already had 1X gross income in retirement savings before aqe 30. It is doable, but we have worked hard on providing guidance and advice. Because they didn’t get buried in debt or unaffordable home purchases, they have been able to try different things. We know other kids with $100k+ of student loans without good jobs. Nobody was talking to them about finances and careers until the debt was incurred. In some of those cases, their parents, despite good jobs, are inadequately prepared for retirement so the lack of financial education has been a problem for a long time. Our society is focused on marketing you to buy into the “Dream” which is expensive and puts a lot of money into other people’s pockets. Slowly people are wising up which is why Vanguard is sucking money in like a Hoover and regular mutual funds and brokerages are laying people off. We are hearing the wails from much of the real estate industry about lack of household formation hampering housing sales as millenials aren’t buying in. Household debt is at very high levels compared to historical amounts. Much of the financial and university system is focused on maintaining that. However, corporate America hasn’t been doing its part to work with its work force to help it grow. Instead, they want all their workers to come in pre-trained and ready to go. Their short-term cost-cutting focus means that their customer base is struggling and so their revenues aren’t growing. Not sure how this is going to end yet, but not getting sucked into the “Dream” is some decent protection. Reply ↓ jsn February 16, 2017 at 9:52 am It sounds like you and yours have done well with this plan, well done. None the less, the plan isn’t generalizable: for education to provide enough jobs for all the educated would imply a social distribution of priorities radically different from what we have. To say “society is focused on marketing”, however, I believe reverses causality. Marketing is focused on society. To lead a sane life in the US is to be constantly on guard against what the dominant agents in your culture are constantly telling you. Those not lucky enough to have strong guidance at home become extractive resources for a system structured to scam money or wealth in any form. With the monetary system under its current management, the more people succeed according to your model, the more people elsewhere necessarily become unemployed: to the extent you and yours become educated and accrue wealth without incurring debt, you are drawing money from circulation (your wealth) which, because all income is someone else’s prior expense and you are not spending and therefore curtailing someone else’s income, necessarily becomes a demand dampening force creating a disemploying force in the macro economy. This is what IIRC Keynes called “the paradox of thrift”: what works individually is counterproductive systemically unless the central monetary authorities support your savings with an offsetting budget surplus. Ours does not. I do believe in free college, like health care, primary education, a clean environment including water and air these are all public goods and can best be provided by the public. They all create more real wealth than they cost in monetary wealth by making healthy productive societies and if done would provide that grounding to everyone to resist that “marketing that focuses on society.” Reply ↓ a different chris February 15, 2017 at 1:04 pm This is BS, and not in the Bachelor of Science way.

As Oklahoma’s attorney general and head of the Republican Attorneys General Association, Pruitt helped collect millions of dollars in political donations from industries he is now supposed to regulate. What’s more, he won’t commit to recusing himself from matters related to these lawsuits. … 8. He let poultry polluters off the hook. After receiving political donations from poultry polluters, Pruitt stopped pursuing litigation against them. As a state senator, he helped weaken a state law regulating poultry operators, allowing dozens of new chicken houses near rivers. After he took office as attorney general, a poultry waste lagoon subject to his oversight overflowed after a storm, fouling nearby creeks and lakes with chicken manure. … 10. Even former Republican EPA administrators say he’s unqualified. Christie Todd Whitman, President George W. Bush’s EPA administrator, said Pruitt is a “denier of climate change” who “doesn’t believe in regulation.” William Reilly, who led the EPA under President George H.W. Bush, said someone who is so “determinedly contemptuous” of science “cannot effectively lead” the EPA. Reply ↓ Vatch February 15, 2017 at 12:19 pm Huh.

Interestingly, Gaddafi wrote an op ed for the NYT years back about a One State Solution. It’s a good article. Read the comments from 2009, some hopeful bits about the peace obama would bring. Anyway, here’s Gaddafi: In absolute terms, the two movements must remain in perpetual war or a compromise must be reached. The compromise is one state for all, an “Isratine” that would allow the people in each party to feel that they live in all of the disputed land and they are not deprived of any one part of it. A key prerequisite for peace is the right of return for Palestinian refugees to the homes their families left behind in 1948. It is an injustice that Jews who were not originally inhabitants of Palestine, nor were their ancestors, can move in from abroad while Palestinians who were displaced only a relatively short time ago should not be so permitted.

No mention of Single Payer, (which I wrote in under ‘Personal Concerns’ on my form.) No mention of voter registration drives. No mention of Sanders or the Our Revolution movement. In fact, nothing positive at all. The document came off as intending to raise fears and thus encourage funds donations to calm those fears. This would be the ultimate Faux Virtue Signal; putting one’s money where the mouth of someone else is. If ‘they’ tried this anywhere else, ‘they’ would be arrested for solicitation for fellatio. Reply ↓ aab February 16, 2017 at 4:16 am Not that long ago, this would have upset me. But if only 25% are even affiliated with the Democrats, which includes a whole lot of people like you and me, I really don’t think this is going to work. The percentage of people buying the Russia nonsense worries me, but it seems unlikely that war lust will drive people that have abandoned the party back to it. It violates their brand identity. I was worried about all the left/protest organizational energy splintering too much electorally, with Our Revolution and Brand New Congress and Justice Democrats and People’s Party and on and on. But there will be a simple message for 2018 that I think can work: vote against corporate Democrats in the primary, and vote against corporate Democrats in the general election. They can’t return to power in 2018 anyway, so on the national level, nothing bad happens to us beyond will already be happening. Then we see which organization is worth backing in 2020, and whether we’re taking the Ds over or taking them down. It’s not like I’m Netflixing and chilling about all this. I know it’s still really hard. (I’m hearing you in my head as I type, cwaltz.) But I can see a path forward despite all the obstacles. Depending on what happens with the coup, of course. Reply ↓ ambrit February 16, 2017 at 4:51 am As I commented on the “Trump Isn’t Imploding” thread a minute ago, absent some real radical politicos emerging within the Democratic Party apparatus, it looks like ‘Whig City here we come’ for the Party. (I noticed as I was typing this that I have begun to refer to the Democratic Party as simply The Party. Shades of a totalitarian mind set!) Will the American electorate accept a Path Sideways as a viable alternative to the Path Backwards being propounded by both wings of, to steal from Gore Vidal, the Property Party? Desperation makes people do strange things. Electing Trump is plain centrist compared to what’s lurking out there. The Anti Trump crowd had better watch out for what they wish for. I agree about the 2018 political races. I’m both fearing and hoping for more disruption candidates getting into office. Got to go back to sleep. Work in the morning. Cheers.

So far, Manchin has voted for every nominee except DeVos and Price. At least Warner has also voted against Sessions and Mnuchin, in addition to voting against DeVos and Price. Reply ↓ DH February 15, 2017 at 2:56 pm Wegmans’ heartland is Upstate New York and Pennsylvania. That is largely Republican turf with Trump doing quite well. Also, at least in NYS, grocery stores can’t sell wine – only liquor stores can, So this boycott will be limited to a few people in a few Virginia grocery stores. The vast majority of Wegmans’ shoppers won’t even know there is a boycott.

You might realize something about yourself that would entrance and delight you. As far as I can tell, that planet might be Nibiru. This could explain why astronomers don’t see Nibiru in our solar system, which should be a great relief to mankind. It may have gotten lost on its elliptical orbit and ended up trapped by another star. Oh man, that would be ironic wouldn’t it? No more Nibiru! It’s toast! Strange the article didn’t mention this though. You’d think it would be the first thing they’d talk about.

You must not commit adulterous crimes of betraying the electorate. You must not steal from the public purse for your own benefit. You must not testify falsely to satisfy those who donate to your campaigns. You must not cheat the electorate by peddling economic fallacies. Honor the voters.’[a]” 20 “Bernie,” the Establishment Dem replied, “I’ve obeyed all these commandments since I was young.” 21 Looking at the man, Bernie felt genuine suspicion toward him. “There is still one thing you haven’t done,” he told him. “Go, and stop taking money from corporate interests. Instead, work to give living wages, healthcare and basic income to the all workers and the poor, and you will have wins in elections. Come, follow me.” 22 At this the Establishment Democrat’s face fell, and he went away sad, for he had many corporate donors. 23 Bernie looked around and said to his followers, “How hard it is for these corporate Dems to enter the White House!” 24 This amazed them. But Bernie said again, “Dear followers, it is very hard[b] to win elections as an Establishment Democrat. 25 In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a corporate Dem to win a national election!” 26 The followers were astounded. “Then which Establishment Democrat in the world can ever win?” they asked. 27 Bernie looked at them intently and said, “Humanly speaking, it is impossible. But not with true integrity and a democratic socialist vision for the working masses. Everything is possible with that.” Reply ↓ ambrit February 16, 2017 at 3:58 am Wonderful! The early Christian churches and communities were run along communitarian lines, so, this is not far from the “truth” of the matter.

As far as Apple professing ‘concern’ about safety re lithium batteries, and using that concern as a reason to block right to repair – well jeez, Apple, get with the 21st century. Material scientists at Tufts Univ have developed a lithium battery that does not use liquid or flamable electrolites, cannot short out by damage in a way that causes a thermal overload event, and then outgassing, and then fire. (So, wait, you want an electric car with lithium batteries that fireball on severe compression? aka, a crash? aka ‘venting with flame’?) Come on ,Apple! You’re supposed to be the ‘wave of the future’ but you’re hiding behind soon-to-be obsolete battery technology to protect your rents? Look, Apple, you’ve provided replacement Lith-ion batteries for your products for years. So far as I know, you have not been subject to massive torts litigation or tech shop snarking because your replaceable batteries were dangerous or defective or hard to install. Get with the program and stop acting like the entity you styled yourself as the opposite of. You remember: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zfqw8nhUwA Here’s the thing, Apple. I’ve been recommending your products for years, decades. I’m rethinking this. And for the battery geeks out there: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/super-battery.html Hmm.

If you lock yourself into current technology in order to protect your rents, even so you will find that the world and technology move on without you. New technologies are no more amenable to the old rental extraction schemes than they ever were. You can move with the times AND keep your brand’s panche, or you can demand ‘all stop in the name of our rents’ and be slowly but surely replaced entirely.

With decision-makers embracing digitalisation, technology has become integrated into every facet of business. And while the likes of cloud computing and data analysis are still important, 2017 brings with it fresh expectations around the trends that will impact the organisation. Below we examine five of these trends. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been steadily gaining momentum, first as a purely machine-to-machine incarnation and now as a device to organisation tool. In its simplest form, IoT relates to devices being connected to the internet. The classic example is your fridge ordering milk when you run out. But what does this mean for business? By being able to harness the data of devices in the field, an organisation can better understand how effective its operations are in remote areas. In retail, for example, this provides insight into consumer buying patterns that means the difference between ordering the right kind of stock versus sitting with old products that will not be sold. Plugging the data transmitted from these devices into the organisational back-end provides decision-makers with a wealth of information that can be used to guide strategy in more nuanced ways. This wealth of data brings us to the next key trend – artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive computing which takes data analytics to the next level. These systems can predict, infer, and in some ways, think and learn by experience much like humans do. While Apple’s Siri saw the popularisation of AI and cognitive computing, it has evolved considerably in recent years. Today, many businesses can potentially use cognitive computing to eliminate much of the administration and even customer engagement functions (think chat bots) of employees. This leaves them with the capacity to enhance their own skills and fulfil more strategic and innovative job functions inside the organisation. As part of this move towards a more connected and intelligent world, is the arrival of the third big trend – digital currencies. With investment in the fintech sector increasing significantly in recent years, businesses are finding new ways for customers to interact with financial products. While expectations are such that digital currencies will disrupt banking and payments over the next few years, the more immediate benefits for Africa are already being felt. Fintech companies have already launched solutions that cater for the previously unbanked. With mobile penetration in developing markets continuously increasing, digital currencies are a great alternative to more traditional banking solutions. The arrival of bitcoin and increasing interest in adopting blockchain solutions means companies need to be open for more alternative financial opportunities that were possible previously. This new way of doing business is forcing South African financial institutions into experimenting with similar solutions and offerings as an alternative. And while it might seem the stuff of science fiction, robotics is also evolving at a rapid rate as the means of enhancing efficiencies in especially manufacturing and mining. For example, industrial robotics has been one of the key industries in Japan with robots being used to replace humans on the factory floor and doing dangerous jobs. So, while AI is driving the acceptance of virtual bots performing customer service engagement activities, robotics linked with data analytics will see the rise of more ‘minimum wage’ focused devices. Finally, virtual and augmented reality will complete the convergence of online and real-world technology integration. Sure, the gaming industry has been the most notable beneficiary of these alternate reality systems but consider the impact it can have in business. Now you can walk into your warehouse with special goggles linked to the enterprise resource planning system and see how old stock is. Elsewhere, an engineer can open a diagram of a machine and see which part requires to be serviced next before disaster strikes. The benefits of embracing these and other trends cannot be ignored. From productivity gains and cost efficiencies, to quicker innovation cycles and increased value, those businesses who will be the most successful will be the ones that can prioritise and monetise emerging technology opportunities.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 17 February 2017 | MYT 2:30 PM Facebook says Irish challenge to US data transfers ‘deeply flawed’ No big deal: Gallagher said that the level of transparency and the variety of protections in the United states "match anything in Europe" and said the court had not heard expert arguments on the quality of US privacy protections. — AFP DUBLIN: Facebook said a legal challenge against the way it transfers EU user data to the United States was "deeply flawed" and should not be referred to the EU's top court because ample privacy protections were already in place.  The challenge by the Irish data regulator is the latest to question whether methods used by large tech firms such as Google and Apple to transfer data gives EU consumers sufficient protection from US surveillance.  The issue of data privacy came to the fore after revelations in 2013 from former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden of mass US surveillance caused political outrage in Europe.  Facebook says the case could lead to a breakdown in transatlantic data transfers that could knock EU economic output by up to 1.3%.  Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner, which regulates Facebook as its European headquarters are in Dublin, found in May that a complaint about privacy protections in mechanisms Facebook uses to transfer data were "well-founded."  It is asking the Irish High Court to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), which would then decide whether to ban the use of "model contracts" – common legal arrangements used by thousands of firms to transfer personal data outside the 28-nation bloc.  A lawyer representing Facebook told the High Court that the case by the Irish regulator was flawed because it did not take into account the EU-US Privacy Shield agreement that came into force last August to address earlier concerns about US surveillance.  Under the agreement, the replacement for the Safe Harbour agreement struck down by the CJEU in 2015, the United States agreed to limit the collection of and access to Europeans' data stored on US servers.  "How could you have a well founded concern about the protections that are available without having looked at it (privacy shield)," Paul Gallagher, representing Facebook, told the High Court.  "There should be no reference because the (Data Protection Commisioner's) decision has been overtaken by events," he said. "The decision is deeply flawed."  Gallagher said that the level of transparency and the variety of protections in the United states "match anything in Europe" and said the court had not heard expert arguments on the quality of US privacy protections.  The Irish commissioner's office initially became involved after Austrian law student and privacy activist Max Schrems made a complaint in Dublin about Facebook's handling of his data in the United States.  Schrems and other privacy campaigners contend that alternative arrangements such as model clauses don't offer Europeans any means of redress either.  A lawyer representing Schrems, James Doherty, told the court that a referral to the European Court was "unnecessary or at least premature" as the Irish regulator had not fully investigated the complaint and had not used all tools in its power to restrict data flows where consumers' rights were threatened. — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks ‘Horizon Zero Dawn’ prepares for final push Carpool and save with GrabShare JPMorgan moving mortgages online to please paper-weary customers Pokémon Go: The universe expands Google adds voice-activated shopping, taking on Amazon Others Also Read With Samsung chief in jail, one-time mentor seen taking charge Mourinho fumes over attitude issues in St Etienne win Genting Highlands to house country‘s second Premium Outlet advertisement Latest News Apple to start India manufacturing in coming months with iPhone SE: source JPMorgan moving mortgages online to please paper-weary customers Pokémon Go: Tips for the Gen 2 update European parliament calls for robot law, rejects robot tax Facebook says Irish challenge to US data transfers ‘deeply flawed’ Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: Tips for the Gen 2 update The smartwatch is dead; long live the smart watch European parliament calls for robot law, rejects robot tax Uber gives restless staff a way to cash out with no IPO in sight Facebook CEO warns against reversal of global thinking Apple vowed to revolutionise TV – why hasn’t it?

News Business Business News Small businesses could be ‘driven out of London’ by rate rise The average micro business in the City will be paying business rates of £17,000 as of April this year Josie Cox Business Editor Friday 17 February 2017 08:15 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online The survey found that close to three quarters – or 74 per cent -- of businesses consider rates to be the single biggest issue affecting them Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images An increase in business rates is the single biggest issue concerning small businesses in the city of London, easily trumping fears around economic uncertainty and worries relating to recruiting the right talent. According to a survey by the Federation of Small Businesses, the average micro business in the city, defined as a company with fewer than 10 employees, will be paying business rates of £17,000 as of April this year under a Government hike. “London is in serious danger of losing its vital support system of micro and small businesses,” the FSB’s chairwoman for London, Sue Terpilowski, said in a statement. Read more Tax system 'favours multinationals over local shops, businesses say' “We need to realise that the hard costs of operating a business in the Capital are starting to outweigh the benefits which simply does not make economic sense – and so tacking these burdens at the Spring Budget is critical,” Ms Terpilowski added. Business rates – which are sometimes referred to as non-domestic rates – are levies that companies occupying commercial properties pay. That tax goes towards covering the cost of services provided by local authorities and the emergency services. The survey found that close to three quarters – or 74 per cent - of businesses consider rates to be the single biggest issue affecting them, followed by 36 per cent who cited economic uncertainty, and, one third who said that the difficulty around recruiting the right staff was their biggest concern. Read more Amazon's business rate to be cut City of London business rates projected to increase by £1.4bn UK consumer spending slumps to five-month low after Christmas boom “The new business rates will drive firms out of London, force some businesses to cut staff or close down altogether,” said Simon Pitkeathley, the chief executive of Camden Town Unlimited, which represents more than 300 businesses in the area. The survey was conducted between 2 February and 14 February and included responses from 129 businesses. Friday’s report chimes with criticism voiced by other think tanks and organisations, including the Confederation of British Industry. Earlier this week, Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium slammed the current business rates system, calling it unsustainable. “At a time when retail is being re-imagined and customers seek more engaging experiences, business rates are a disincentive to innovate and invest in physical space,” she said in a statement. “Further measures to reform business rates are essential to fix an unsustainable system that continues to discourage investment.” Business picture of the day 32 show all Business picture of the day 1/32 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Lee's release Samsung chief appears for second round of questions in graft probe Samsung chief arrives at prosecutor's office before arrest hearing By Se Young Lee and Miyoung Kim SEOUL (Reuters) - The arrest of Samsung Group scion Jay Y. Lee on bribery charges could hamper decisions on strategic investments and acquisitions at the sprawling conglomerate, insiders and former executives say, even with a strong leadership bench at its many businesses. Although business at flagship Samsung Electronics is humming along, big calls will need to be made and the man most likely to be called upon to make them is Choi Gee-sung, the No.2 lieutenant at Samsung Group and a mentor to Lee. "Choi is very experienced and has done a good job. He is the one best placed to manage group-level affairs in Lee's absence," said one Samsung insider. While Samsung Electronics is still smarting from the debacle of its exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphone batteries, its semiconductor business is in rude health. Its share price is up around 60 percent in the past year. But the wide-ranging probe, part of a corruption scandal that led parliament to impeach South Korean President Park Geun-hye, has been a major distraction for the country's largest conglomerate, or chaebol. "Everything has virtually stopped," said a second executive at Samsung Group's powerful strategy office that Choi heads. "We're mainly focusing on the prosecutor's investigation (into Lee and Samsung)... We'll be running an emergency plan and everything will be under Choi's control for now." But some others say even Choi's role could be limited and Samsung may have to rely more on each affiliate's top management, with Choi also under investigation by special prosecutors. "Since we've decided to dismantle group strategy office, Choi's role is likely to gradually decrease, although we can't say for how much and when," another Samsung executive said. A fourth group insider said: "We have a system in place with professional management teams, so in terms of the day-to-day operations things should be fine." None of the Samsung individuals wanted to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. "It's not like Samsung businesses will grind to a halt. There are many smart people at the company," said Kim Yong-serk, a former Samsung Electronics executive who is now a professor at Sungkyunkwan University. But arrest of Lee, 48, will have an impact on longer-term investment decisions at the sprawling conglomerate. "Samsung presidents are evaluated on an annual basis, so they can't make bold bets about the future. They need a chairman for that," Kim said. Samsung declined to comment on its management plans or Choi's role. BEATING APPLE When Samsung Electronics still trailed Nokia in mobile phones - just five years ago - Choi, then CEO, set his sights on a different rival. "Competition is coming from elsewhere. There's a company more profitable than us and we should change our target," he told Reuters in January 2012, referring to Apple Inc. That year, Samsung ended Nokia's 14-year domination of the mobile market, ultimately also overtaking Apple as the world's biggest smartphone maker. In a Samsung career spanning more than three decades, Choi has worked in all the main businesses, from semiconductors and home appliances to TVs and telecoms, before taking over as chief executive. As head of strategy, 66-year-old Choi has acted as Jay Y. Lee's mentor and been closely involved in preparing the path for him to take over from his father, who was incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014. Under Choi's guidance, Lee has moved closer to succeeding his father in a well-choreographed long-term plan, including a restructuring of the conglomerate to cement the Lee family's control. However, that plan included a controversial $8 billion merger of two Samsung units that has been central to prosecutors' case against the group, and Lee. Prosecutors accuse Samsung of paying bribes totalling 43 billion won ($37.74 million) to organizations linked to South Korean President Park Geun-hye's friend, Choi Soon-sil, to secure government backing for the merger. Choi Gee-sung and his deputy Chang Choong-ki were quizzed by prosecutors over their role in the deal. STEP UP FOR 'MR CHIP', TOO? Lee's absence, ahead of what could be a lengthy trial, could also see a bigger role for Kwon Oh-hyun, Samsung Electronics' vice chairman and current CEO. Known as "Mr Chip", Kwon has overseen the growth of Samsung's component business, which now generates much of the firm's profits. "Kwon is very practical manager. Like many Samsung managers in the component business, he doesn't feel comfortable (in the limelight)," said an executive who worked with him. Kwon, who studied electrical engineering at Seoul National University and at Stanford, cemented Samsung's position in memory chips and expanded the contract chip manufacturing business, producing chips that power the Apple iPhone. But, for all the experience and qualities these senior managers bring, Lee's absence will still be felt. Lee had been instrumental in seeking to drive growth through new businesses, including signing off on South Korea's biggest outbound deal: an $8 billion acquisition of U.S. auto electronics maker Harman International Industries.

Lee on bribery charges could hamper decisions on strategic investments and acquisitions at the sprawling conglomerate, insiders and former executives say, even with a strong leadership bench at its many businesses. By Se Young Lee and Miyoung Kim SEOUL (Reuters) - The arrest of Samsung Group scion Jay Y. Lee on bribery charges could hamper decisions on strategic investments and acquisitions at the sprawling conglomerate, insiders and former executives say, even with a strong leadership bench at its many businesses. Although business at flagship Samsung Electronics is humming along, big calls will need to be made and the man most likely to be called upon to make them is Choi Gee-sung, the No.2 lieutenant at Samsung Group and a mentor to Lee. "Choi is very experienced and has done a good job. He is the one best placed to manage group-level affairs in Lee's absence," said one Samsung insider. While Samsung Electronics is still smarting from the debacle of its exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphone batteries, its semiconductor business is in rude health. Its share price is up around 60 percent in the past year. But the wide-ranging probe, part of a corruption scandal that led parliament to impeach South Korean President Park Geun-hye, has been a major distraction for the country's largest conglomerate, or chaebol. "Everything has virtually stopped," said a second executive at Samsung Group's powerful strategy office that Choi heads. "We're mainly focusing on the prosecutor's investigation (into Lee and Samsung)... We'll be running an emergency plan and everything will be under Choi's control for now." But some others say even Choi's role could be limited and Samsung may have to rely more on each affiliate's top management, with Choi also under investigation by special prosecutors. "Since we've decided to dismantle group strategy office, Choi's role is likely to gradually decrease, although we can't say for how much and when," another Samsung executive said. A fourth group insider said: "We have a system in place with professional management teams, so in terms of the day-to-day operations things should be fine." None of the Samsung individuals wanted to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. "It's not like Samsung businesses will grind to a halt. There are many smart people at the company," said Kim Yong-serk, a former Samsung Electronics executive who is now a professor at Sungkyunkwan University. But arrest of Lee, 48, will have an impact on longer-term investment decisions at the sprawling conglomerate. "Samsung presidents are evaluated on an annual basis, so they can't make bold bets about the future. They need a chairman for that," Kim said. Samsung declined to comment on its management plans or Choi's role. BEATING APPLE When Samsung Electronics still trailed Nokia in mobile phones - just five years ago - Choi, then CEO, set his sights on a different rival. "Competition is coming from elsewhere. There's a company more profitable than us and we should change our target," he told Reuters in January 2012, referring to Apple Inc. That year, Samsung ended Nokia's 14-year domination of the mobile market, ultimately also overtaking Apple as the world's biggest smartphone maker. In a Samsung career spanning more than three decades, Choi has worked in all the main businesses, from semiconductors and home appliances to TVs and telecoms, before taking over as chief executive. As head of strategy, 66-year-old Choi has acted as Jay Y. Lee's mentor and been closely involved in preparing the path for him to take over from his father, who was incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014. Under Choi's guidance, Lee has moved closer to succeeding his father in a well-choreographed long-term plan, including a restructuring of the conglomerate to cement the Lee family's control. However, that plan included a controversial $8 billion merger of two Samsung units that has been central to prosecutors' case against the group, and Lee. Prosecutors accuse Samsung of paying bribes totalling 43 billion won ($37.74 million) to organizations linked to South Korean President Park Geun-hye's friend, Choi Soon-sil, to secure government backing for the merger. Choi Gee-sung and his deputy Chang Choong-ki were quizzed by prosecutors over their role in the deal. STEP UP FOR 'MR CHIP', TOO? Lee's absence, ahead of what could be a lengthy trial, could also see a bigger role for Kwon Oh-hyun, Samsung Electronics' vice chairman and current CEO. Known as "Mr Chip", Kwon has overseen the growth of Samsung's component business, which now generates much of the firm's profits. "Kwon is very practical manager. Like many Samsung managers in the component business, he doesn't feel comfortable (in the limelight)," said an executive who worked with him. Kwon, who studied electrical engineering at Seoul National University and at Stanford, cemented Samsung's position in memory chips and expanded the contract chip manufacturing business, producing chips that power the Apple iPhone. But, for all the experience and qualities these senior managers bring, Lee's absence will still be felt. Lee had been instrumental in seeking to drive growth through new businesses, including signing off on South Korea's biggest outbound deal: an $8 billion acquisition of U.S. auto electronics maker Harman International Industries. "The biggest problem is that Lee is the one who sets the direction of Samsung as a whole," the fourth group insider said. "He doesn't get into every business decision, but he's the one who has to sign off on major investments or acquisitions... That's why he can't easily be replaced."

West Dennis, MA, February 17, 2017 --(PR.com)-- Apps4Sailing.com has just released a new innovative way for sailing schools and instructors to teach sailing. Called The Sailing Instructor App Pack, sailing schools and instructors can create their own sailing lesson apps for their students. The apps will run on Android and Apple phones, tablets; also Mac and PC desktops, laptops. Using Apps4Sailing's best selling Windows CD "Learn to Sail! with Multimedia!" the instructor goes through the CD lesson topics using the included recording headset and easy recording software that saves the session as a computer movie file. The lessons have narration, animation, text and digital video. The instructor provides their own professional teaching narrative on top of this reflecting their own unique style of teaching. "It is exciting that mobile technology has advanced the way it has, creating opportunity never imagined 10 years ago," states Linda Cullum, Owner of Apps4Sailing. Having your own custom sailing lessons in an app format for all mobile devices, laptops and desktops opens up a whole new way of teaching that benefits the student and the instructor. It can mean less time in the classroom and more time out on the water." Once the recording is done, the movie files are sent to Apps4Sailing via email or Dropbox where they are converted into the various app file formats. They are then sent back to the school or instructor for distribution to the students. Little Pines Multimedia is the parent company of Apps4Sailing and has been selling sailing instructional CD's since 1997.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive This Desert Life: History in your hand Friday Feb 17, 2017 at 12:01 AM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe A few months ago, I downloaded onto my cell phone what’s become my favorite digital tool: Field Trip. Field Trip is a location-based app that sends notifications when users are in proximity to places of interest. An example: as I strolled north toward the corner of Sixth and A streets in Victorville last Sunday, Field Trip notified me that I was near the Old Victor School. Once notified, users can access information about the site through the app. In the school’s case, I learned the 95-year-old building was the third elementary school built in Victorville and has been restored “at least once by dedicated and forward-thinking citizens.” The known world became a part of Field Trip in 2012. The app was designed by Niantic Inc., the company better known for unleashing Pokemon Go on an unsuspecting populous last year. Field Trip was the first app released by Niantic, when the now-independent company was part of Google. At the time, The Atlantic described Field Trip as “Google's probe into the soft side of augmented reality,” a tool, in other words, meant to alter how the world is perceived and interacted with through Google Glass. So, imagine staring through the digitized lenses of Google Glass and seeing, simultaneously, the Old Victor School and the info Field Trip has on the building. Now imagine all that in a foreign locale. Instantly, you’ve learned the intimate details of the place — as though you’ve lived there all your life. But Google Glass — and its competitors at places like Apple — has yet to augment reality on a massive scale. So, for the time being, Field Trip has been reduced to yet another distraction forcing our sights downward to screens, away from our un-augmented reality. And yet I feel slightly more connected to the High Desert and its history because of the app. In fact, it’s how I learned about Brownie, arguably Victorville’s most famous canine. Brownie was the Victorville railroad station’s “mascot” beginning in 1943 after he wandered into the depot one night, “bruised and bleeding” from an altercation with a passing car, according to a previous Daily Press article written by Ellie Moon. The station’s night telegraph operator set Brownie up with a blanket and a pan of warm milk, and the dog rested near the heat of a stove. Over time, Brownie moved to sleeping under the telegraph operator’s desk and remained “a permanent fixture at the depot.” Described as “the hungriest dog you ever saw,” Ellie wrote that although meat was rationed during World War II, railroaders saved scraps for him. A terrier and pit bull mix, Brownie was “leery of human affection at first,” but he warmed up to the workers, who eventually bestowed upon the dog the title of honorary station manager. Brownie was so adored by the railroad employees that when he was struck and killed by one of the trains in 1945, they “placed him in a typewriter box and found a shady place under a Cottonwood tree” until a more proper burial could be arranged. The workers then pooled their money together and bought Brownie a black headstone with this inscription: BROWNIE “A RAILROAD DOG” A FRIEND AND A PAL 1945. I learned about Brownie through Field Trip while on my stroll through Old Town Victorville. The app informed me the headstone is located outside the Route 66 Museum, so I visited on Thursday to pay my respects to Brownie and to ask museum volunteers if they’ve encountered the dog’s ghost (a paranormal investigation was conducted in the museum Wednesday evening). Delvin Harbour and Sue Bridges told me there have been unexplained sightings in the museum, but none involving Brownie. “If he’s anywhere, he’s probably at the railroad,” Sue said. That makes sense. The museum only inherited what’s left of Brownie. Initially, his headstone was in the nearby Forrest Park. It was moved to the museum in 2008 when the park met its end. Delvin and I got to talking after that — about Route 66 and High Desert history — and I relished in his knowledge, his passion. I left with a contented feeling only good conversation provides, which I suppose is ironic considering a cell phone app brought me there in the first place. But maybe that’s the point. There’s constant chatter of a widening disconnect between people spurred by our attachment to all things digital. And I don’t know how I feel about “augmented reality,” but I believe connecting with one another now depends on how we use technology. Because while it can easily disconnect us, it can also bring us to the Delvins and Sues out there, as well as to a mongrel dog that found compassion and friendship in a sleepy desert town.

A post written by Kirk Koenigsbauer, Corporate Vice President for the Office team on Thursday, noted that the updates to Word, Excel and PowerPoint for Mac include a new object rotation slider on the Touch Bar, which provides a more intuitive and precise rotation experience.  Also Read: Microsoft to disable older versions of Skype for Mac, Windows "Now from the Touch Bar you can enter Word Focus Mode, a brand-new experience that hides all of the on-screen ribbons and commands so you can simply focus on your work," Koenigsbauer wrote about the update in Word. A one tap quickly applies a new style to a heading or paragraph and a user can also insert comments, photos or hyperlinks directly from Touch Bar. The Touch Bar commands in PowerPoint will now allow a user to easily manipulate graphic elements.  "The Reorder Objects button produces a graphical map of all the layers on a slide, making it easy to find the right object and move it where you want it. And by sliding your finger across the Touch Bar you can easily rotate an object to get just the right angle," Koenigsbauer added. Also, typing an equals sign into a cell in Excel immediately pulls up the most recently used functions in the Touch Bar.  The Touch Bar in Outlook now provides quick access to the most commonly used commands as one works on email and manage calendar.  "When composing a new mail, the Touch Bar displays a list of recent documents. One tap and you can add a file-either as an attachment or a link. And from the Today view on the Touch Bar you can not only see your calendar events for the day, but even join a Skype for Business meeting," Koenigsbauer noted. This is the latest app to get Touch Bar support and joins other apps like Adobe`s Photoshop and Apple`s Final Cut Pro.

The Constitutional Court considered the appeal and rule the bill constitutional,” he said. The organizations had announced their intention to apply to the Constitutional Court before the German Bundestag approved the bill on recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The local Armenian community had nothing in common with the case. “There was not even a need for the community to interfere. Germany is a democratic country. A number of Turkish organizations exercised their right to apply to the Constitutional Court, but we were sure the Constitutional Court would not step back and consider at least the fact that the Bundestag’s resolution was nothing but a statement, without any legal force. With respect to recognition of the Armenian Genocide the document is certainly most appreciable,” Serovbe Isahakyan said. The Armenian community should work to have a bill criminalizing the Armenian Genocide adopted. With respect to Turkish organizations’ intention to apply to the European Court of Human Rights, Serovbe Isahakyan said: “I think the same will happen.

Lee, rides on an elevator as he arrives at the office of the independent counsel in Seoul, South Korea, February 16, 2017. Koo Yoon-sung/News1 via REUTERS/Files By Ju-min Park | SEOUL SEOUL For Jay Y. Lee, the third-generation leader of South Korea's massive Samsung Group and scion of the country's wealthiest family, home is now a 6.56 square meter (71 square foot) detention cell with a toilet in the corner behind a partition. He has no shower, only a wash-stand. Bed is a mattress on the floor. The 48-year-old Lee was arrested early on Friday for his alleged role in a corruption scandal that led to the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye, a decision that is being reviewed by the country's Constitutional Court.. He has denied any wrongdoing. Lee is being held in a single cell and will not be allowed contact with other inmates, said an official at the Seoul Detention Centre, a facility on the outskirts of the city where arrested politicians and corporate chieftains are usually held, along with other detainees. "This is a highly public case, and as you know many involved in the case were already here," the official told Reuters. Prison officials don't want Lee discussing the case with others involved in the case, the official said, explaining why the Samsung scion was being held in a single cell. Also, there may be safety issues. "There are concerns about destroying evidence," the official said, adding that Lee was not being given special treatment. Lee's lawyers declined to comment. Lee, who is divorced with two children, has a net worth of $6.2 billion and ordinarily lives in a $4 million Seoul mansion. The Samsung Group he heads is the world's biggest manufacturer of smartphones, flat-screen televisions and memory chips, and Lee is accustomed to rubbing elbows with Silicon Valley titans such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Apple's Tim Cook. An accomplished equestrian, Lee is also a lifetime member of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews in Scotland. At the detention centre, Lee will be allowed visitors but they can speak only through a glass partition, for up to 30 minutes at a time. However, inmates are allowed unlimited meeting time with their lawyers. He can exercise, but on his own, for 30 minutes a day. ID CHECK, PHYSICAL Before he entered his cell, prison officials subjected Lee to an identification check and physical examination, according to the detention centre official, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. He showered and was issued an inmate uniform and boxes with toiletries and bedding. Prosecutors have up to 10 days to indict Lee, although they can seek an extension. After indictment, a court would be required to make a ruling within three months. Lee will be given simple 1,443 won ($1.26) meals, usually rice with side-dishes. Anything additional must be bought at the centre's commissary. Meals will be served on plastic trays slid through a small square window in the cell door. Lee is required to wash his own tray. Inside the cell, he can watch TV between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., but only a single channel with recorded programmes broadcast by the justice ministry. Fellow inmates include Choi Soon-sil, a friend of President Park Geun-hye who is at the centre of the scandal and who Lee is accused of bribing, as well as the country's former culture minister and former presidential chief of staff. The cell has a small study table to one side. "Inmates can receive eyeglasses and books from outside but should buy other things at the commissary inside, such as snacks, coffee, instant noodles, detergent, razors, and towels," said a man surnamed Sohn who runs a private errand service for detainees at the centre and requested that his full name not be used due to the sensitivity of the matter.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news of iPhone 7s and iPhone 8 changes. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Tuesday. iPhone Casing: A new rumor claims that the iPhone 7s and iPhone 8 will use different casings, reports MacRumors. According to this rumor, the tech company plans to continue using aluminum casings on its iPhone 7s. However it claims the iPhone 8 will use a glass casing with a stainless steel frame. This isn’t the first time that this rumor has popped up. The current iteration of it comes from unnamed sources in AAPL’s supply chain. Fingerprint Sensor: Apple has filed a patent for a new way to read fingerprints, AppleInsider notes. This new patent is for a way to scan a person’s fingerprints without using a dedicated scanner. It includes using micro-LED technology that could sense the fingerprints. This technology is already available in most smartphones, which could make it easy to integrate into AAPL’s devices. It is possible that this method will make its way into the iPhone 8, which rumors claim will have a full display on the front without a dedicated Home button. Apple Music: Eddy Cue, AAPL’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, says that the company’s music streaming service is still growing, reports 9to5Mac. According to Cue, Music is now “well past” having 20 million subscribers. The service reached 20 million subscribers in December 2016. While Cue doesn’t give exact numbers, it appears that the music streaming service is doing well.

A post written by Kirk Koenigsbauer, Corporate Vice President for the Office team on Thursday, noted that the updates to Word, Excel and PowerPoint for Mac include a new object rotation slider on the Touch Bar, which provides a more intuitive and precise rotation experience. "Now from the Touch Bar you can enter Word Focus Mode, a brand-new experience that hides all of the on-screen ribbons and commands so you can simply focus on your work," Koenigsbauer wrote about the update in Word. A one tap quickly applies a new style to a heading or paragraph and a user can also insert comments, photos or hyperlinks directly from Touch Bar. The Touch Bar commands in PowerPoint will now allow a user to easily manipulate graphic elements. "The Reorder Objects button produces a graphical map of all the layers on a slide, making it easy to find the right object and move it where you want it. And by sliding your finger across the Touch Bar you can easily rotate an object to get just the right angle," Koenigsbauer added. Also, typing an equals sign into a cell in Excel immediately pulls up the most recently used functions in the Touch Bar. The Touch Bar in Outlook now provides quick access to the most commonly used commands as one works on email and manage calendar. "When composing a new mail, the Touch Bar displays a list of recent documents. One tap and you can add a file-either as an attachment or a link. And from the Today view on the Touch Bar you can not only see your calendar events for the day, but even join a Skype for Business meeting," Koenigsbauer noted. This is the latest app to get Touch Bar support and joins other apps like Adobe's Photoshop and Apple's Final Cut Pro. --IANS sku/ksk/vm SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Are F-16s a good choice for the Indian Air Force?

Lee, rides on an elevator as he arrives at the office of the independent counsel in Seoul, South Korea, February 16, 2017. Koo Yoon-sung/News1 via REUTERS/Files By Ju-min Park | SEOUL SEOUL For Jay Y. Lee, the third-generation leader of South Korea's massive Samsung Group and scion of the country's wealthiest family, home is now a 6.56 square meter (71 square foot) detention cell with a toilet in the corner behind a partition. He has no shower, only a wash-stand. Bed is a mattress on the floor. The 48-year-old Lee was arrested early on Friday for his alleged role in a corruption scandal that led to the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye, a decision that is being reviewed by the country's Constitutional Court.. He has denied any wrongdoing. Lee is being held in a single cell and will not be allowed contact with other inmates, said an official at the Seoul Detention Centre, a facility on the outskirts of the city where arrested politicians and corporate chieftains are usually held, along with other detainees. "This is a highly public case, and as you know many involved in the case were already here," the official told Reuters. Prison officials don't want Lee discussing the case with others involved in the case, the official said, explaining why the Samsung scion was being held in a single cell. Also, there may be safety issues. "There are concerns about destroying evidence," the official said, adding that Lee was not being given special treatment. Lee's lawyers declined to comment. Lee, who is divorced with two children, has a net worth of $6.2 billion and ordinarily lives in a $4 million Seoul mansion. The Samsung Group he heads is the world's biggest manufacturer of smartphones, flat-screen televisions and memory chips, and Lee is accustomed to rubbing elbows with Silicon Valley titans such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Apple's Tim Cook. An accomplished equestrian, Lee is also a lifetime member of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews in Scotland. At the detention centre, Lee will be allowed visitors but they can speak only through a glass partition, for up to 30 minutes at a time. However, inmates are allowed unlimited meeting time with their lawyers. He can exercise, but on his own, for 30 minutes a day. ID CHECK, PHYSICAL Before he entered his cell, prison officials subjected Lee to an identification check and physical examination, according to the detention centre official, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. He showered and was issued an inmate uniform and boxes with toiletries and bedding. Prosecutors have up to 10 days to indict Lee, although they can seek an extension. After indictment, a court would be required to make a ruling within three months. Lee will be given simple 1,443 won ($1.26) meals, usually rice with side-dishes. Anything additional must be bought at the centre's commissary. Meals will be served on plastic trays slid through a small square window in the cell door. Lee is required to wash his own tray. Inside the cell, he can watch TV between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., but only a single channel with recorded programmes broadcast by the justice ministry. Fellow inmates include Choi Soon-sil, a friend of President Park Geun-hye who is at the centre of the scandal and who Lee is accused of bribing, as well as the country's former culture minister and former presidential chief of staff. The cell has a small study table to one side. "Inmates can receive eyeglasses and books from outside but should buy other things at the commissary inside, such as snacks, coffee, instant noodles, detergent, razors, and towels," said a man surnamed Sohn who runs a private errand service for detainees at the centre and requested that his full name not be used due to the sensitivity of the matter.

At right, Matthew Fienup of CLU’s Center for Economic Forecasting lays out CERF’s predictions for the coming year. Photos by ROB VARELA/Acorn Newspapers Thousand Oaks Rotary Club’s annual Economic Outlook Forecast Breakfast at Cal Lutheran University, traditionally a subdued event, got a shot in the arm last week courtesy of Bill Dallas, CEO of Skyline Home Loans. Bouncing among the roles of historian, self-promoter and motivational speaker, the Oaks Christian School founder told a crowd of over 100 inside CLU’s Lundring Events Center that the nation was approaching a point of no return. A return from what? It wasn’t clear. “We are right now cresting on that point, we are emotionally out of control as a country and as a people. We’re scared. We don’t want to admit it, and we are being led by somebody totally different,” he said. “What Uber did to taxis and Apple did to smartphones is what Donald Trump has done to the Republican Party, presidential elections, polling, global governance and maybe even the financial global markets: He’s disrupted it; he’s changed it forever.” Unlike most speakers at the long-running economic breakfast, who opt to stay on the dais and stick to statistical analysis, Dallas grabbed the microphone and headed out into the audience for his portion of the keynote address. When he finished speaking, the successful attorney and businessman dropped the mic to the ground in a symbolic move, leaving master of ceremonies Susan Murata of Hospice of the Conejo to rush to pick it up. Event organizer Patrick Mc- Coy said Dallas’ performance was “a reflection of his strong passion and remarkable acumen in business matters.” “Bill’s ability to leave his chair and deliver up close a flamboyant and provocative speech really dazzled that early-morning audience,” McCoy said. Rotary, CLU tradition The brainchild of former Rotarians Merv Kopp, Dennis Gillette and Martin Anderson, the economic breakfast at CLU is a 25-year tradition. The event brings together CLU’s Center for Economic Research and Forecasting and local leaders in the fields of public policy, finance and real estate to predict what’s in store for the regional economy. Speaking at the breakfast for the second time, Matthew Fienup, new executive director of CERF, said his organization predicted no major economic shift this year resulting from a Trump presidency (the prediction was the same for a Hillary Clinton victory). CERF has historically been one of the more pessimistic forecasting outlets. “We’re the only economic forecast I’m aware of that’s saying no change,” Fienup said. “There are some saying positive change, there are some saying negative change . . . we’re saying no change. We expect that slow growth (of the past eight years) to continue.” He said CERF, which produces regular federal, state and regional forecasts, doesn’t believe Trump will be able to institute the major policy changes that could kick-start the economy, like corporate tax and regulatory reform. If Trump were able to lower the corporate tax rate, for example, that change alone would force CERF to revise its forecast upward, Fienup said. “High rates not only reduce investment, they put American companies at a disadvantage in relation to their foreign counterparts,” the economist said. “Lowering federal corporate tax rates and, in particular, allowing the repatriation of foreign earnings, would have a big positive impact.” State, local economy Regarding Trump’s impact on the California economy, Fienup said even a minor change to the Affordable Care Act could have major consequences in a state where one-third of residents receive subsidized healthcare coverage via Medi-Cal. But looming larger for the California economy is last year’s minimum wage hike. Fienup said CERF agrees with research that suggests an increase to a $15-an-hour minimum wage will lead to massive job losses among lower-skilled workers. “We find evidence for very strong increases in the unemployment rate among that group,” he said. “Our research also suggests that the impact may actually be larger than previously predicted.” Shifting to the topic of Ventura County, Fienup shared a string of statistics to demonstrate how the local economy is failing to keep pace with neighboring counties. Ventura County, the economist said, is the only county in Southern California that has not returned to pre-recession (2008) job levels. “There were fewer people with jobs living in Ventura County last year than there were the year before. That is unprecedented in Ventura County for a non-recessionary economy,” he said. “And the jobs that are coming back are not the same ones that we lost,” Fienup added, saying the county is seeing fewer jobs in high-paying fields like finance and technology. Despite all of these factors, home prices in the county continue to rise, driven by a lack of supply caused by negative feelings about growth, Fienup said. Prices have returned to 90 percent of their levels before the housing crisis, he said. The combination— stagnant wages and higher housing costs—means that Ventura County’s affordability rate stands at just 26 percent, which means just one in four people can afford the cost of a median-priced home. By comparison, Orange County’s affordability rate is 29 percent. Fienup said unless policy changes are made to allow for more residential development, the county’s economy will continue to under-perform. “We would argue what needs to change is really attitudes about densification, infill development, attitudes about urban expansion,” the economist said. “Not without any sustained development do we expect . . . any of these numbers to change direction in the years ahead.” Return to top Copyright © 2003-2017 J.Bee NP Publishing, Ltd., All Rights Reserved.

Businesses have several online platforms through which to promote their services and these offer quick and easy communication channels to build brand awareness.” Those attending the event were reminded that online communications should not replace face-to-face networking. “There is a very personal quality to face-to-face conversations as they offer customers and business associates the best opportunity to ask questions, get help and work through issues. These personal connections may then develop online once the initial relationship has been established,” Cllr Mackin added. Brushing up on their networking skills, the participants were advised to be warm and treat people with respect, and to follow up and deliver on any promises made.

Matt Brian, @m4tt 02.13.17 in Internet Comments 768 Shares Share Tweet Share Save It's been six months since Apple acquired the keys to the viral juggernaut that is Carpool Karaoke. In that time, we've learned that the iPhone maker plans 16 half-hour episodes that will include celebrities like Alicia Keys, Ariana Grande, John Cena and Will Smith, but there's been little talk about how it will stand alone from the original Late Late Show segment. Thanks to a new trailer, we now have some idea of the route Apple is taking: much of it is staying the same, but an Apple budget will also take the series in a couple of new directions. First, is additional confirmation that British host James Corden won't front every installment. He does appear in some, but the trailer also shows shots of Billy Eichner riding shotgun with Metallica and John Legend driving Alicia Keys (although Corden is shown in the back seat in a later shot). Second, the teaser highlights that some parts of the show won't take place in a car at all. Shaq and John Cena are shown hanging out in a bakery, John Legend welcoming a choir in a laundromat and Will Smith whizzing by the Hollywood sign in a helicopter. Although Apple is ready to market its new series, during the Grammys no less, there's still no word on when the episodes will be released. The company says it's "coming soon" to Apple Music, which likely means you'll need a subscription to view them.

Lee, the third-generation leader of South Korea's massive Samsung Group and scion of the country's wealthiest family, home is now a 6.56 square meter (71 square foot) detention cell with a toilet in the corner behind a partition. He has no shower, only a wash-stand. Bed is a mattress on the floor. The 48-year-old Lee was arrested early on Friday for his alleged role in a corruption scandal that led to the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye, a decision that is being reviewed by the country's Constitutional Court.. He has denied any wrongdoing. Lee is being held in a single cell and will not be allowed contact with other inmates, said an official at the Seoul Detention Centre, a facility on the outskirts of the city where arrested politicians and corporate chieftains are usually held, along with other detainees. "This is a highly public case, and as you know many involved in the case were already here," the official told Reuters. Prison officials don't want Lee discussing the case with others involved in the case, the official said, explaining why the Samsung scion was being held in a single cell. Also, there may be safety issues. "There are concerns about destroying evidence," the official said, adding that Lee was not being given special treatment. Lee's lawyers declined to comment. Lee, who is divorced with two children, has a net worth of $6.2 billion and ordinarily lives in a $4 million Seoul mansion. The Samsung Group he heads is the world's biggest manufacturer of smartphones, flat-screen televisions and memory chips, and Lee is accustomed to rubbing elbows with Silicon Valley titans such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Apple's Tim Cook. An accomplished equestrian, Lee is also a lifetime member of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews in Scotland. At the detention centre, Lee will be allowed visitors but they can speak only through a glass partition, for up to 30 minutes at a time. However, inmates are allowed unlimited meeting time with their lawyers. He can exercise, but on his own, for 30 minutes a day. ID CHECK, PHYSICAL Before he entered his cell, prison officials subjected Lee to an identification check and physical examination, according to the detention centre official, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. He showered and was issued an inmate uniform and boxes with toiletries and bedding. Prosecutors have up to 10 days to indict Lee, although they can seek an extension. After indictment, a court would be required to make a ruling within three months. Lee will be given simple 1,443 won ($1.26) meals, usually rice with side-dishes. Anything additional must be bought at the centre's commissary. Meals will be served on plastic trays slid through a small square window in the cell door. Lee is required to wash his own tray. Inside the cell, he can watch TV between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., but only a single channel with recorded programmes broadcast by the justice ministry. Fellow inmates include Choi Soon-sil, a friend of President Park Geun-hye who is at the centre of the scandal and who Lee is accused of bribing, as well as the country's former culture minister and former presidential chief of staff. The cell has a small study table to one side. "Inmates can receive eyeglasses and books from outside but should buy other things at the commissary inside, such as snacks, coffee, instant noodles, detergent, razors, and towels," said a man surnamed Sohn who runs a private errand service for detainees at the centre and requested that his full name not be used due to the sensitivity of the matter.

Huawei is the third-largest smartphone maker to enter the competitive space of digital voice assistants. The company will have a tough road ahead at it will compete with Apple’s Siri, Google’s Google Assistant and Alexa by Amazon. One thing to note is that Alexa has just started to come on to smartphones while Siri and Google Assistant are veterans in this game. Apart from these Samsung is also working on its voice-based digital assistant Bixby that is set to enter the market with Samsung Galaxy S8 in coming weeks. Even though Huawei does not have to compete with other devices but if the company makes the digital assistant cross-platform then it will have to compete with Cortana by Microsoft, which is very capable at what it does. Cortana is still available for Android devices, but Windows 10 devices are home for Microsoft’s digital assistant. A team consisting of more than 100 engineers is working on developing the digital assistant at the company’s offices in Shenzhen in China, as reported by Bloomberg. According to the report, the company is not likely to limit the digital assistant to Huawei smartphones and it is aimed at taking on Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. The company is not worried about any smaller players in the market right now. One interesting thing to note is that Huawei is ensuring that the assistant can communicate in Chinese languages to target the Chinese market while expanding its offence against Google and Amazon outside China. The company has aimed for $33 billion in sales. It currently stands at number three in global smartphone shipments after Apple and Samsung. An amusing fact is that Huawei is the same company that announced that it will use Amazon Alexa on Huawei Mate 9 in the United States. This AI may take off as the company has very limited or no competition in the Chinese market. Google Assistant, the second major competitor, is blocked in China making it a perfect opportunity for the company to capitalise on this gap.
