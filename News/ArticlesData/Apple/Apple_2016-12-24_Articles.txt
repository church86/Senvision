(Money Sharma/AFP/Getty Images) It’s the end of 2016, and the most popular smartphones in China—a nation of 700 million smartphone users—aren’t made by Apple, Samsung, or even Chinese cult brand Xiaomi. Oppo and Vivo, two little-known companies in the West, have come to dominate the Chinese smartphone market using seemingly antiquated marketing strategies. As of the third quarter 2016, Oppo held the biggest smartphone market share at 16.6 percent, with Vivo closely behind with 16.2 percent. Huawei and Xiaomi came in third and fourth, with 15 percent and 10.6 percent respectively, according to market research firm Counterpoint. Apple was a distant fifth with 8.4 percent market share. The two companies came out of seemingly nowhere to sell millions of smartphones. Oppo’s sales were 84 percent higher than last year, mainly on the popularity of OnePlus, a line of smartphones with edgy designs, high-end specs, and low prices. Vivo relies on simple but solid designs and rock-bottom prices, a formula that propelled its sales 114 percent higher than prior year’s. A Vulnerable Xiaomi The phone market in China is fairly simple to enter, but difficult to dominate. Related Coverage Can China’s ‘Homegrown Apple,’ Xiaomi, Succeed Abroad? At the high end of the market, Apple still reigns. Around $60 billion of Apple’s total sales were generated from China alone last year, and it wasn’t too long ago that Apple vied with Xiaomi—which hailed itself as China’s own Apple—for top smartphone market share. While Apple still has a stranglehold on the top end of the market, its position has eroded over the last year due to Beijing’s blockage of iTunes, a slowing Chinese economy, Xi Jinping’s anti-graft measures, and a flood of cheaper but high-quality alternatives. (Source: Counterpoint Research) It’s the middle range of the market that’s more interesting, and it’s where Oppo and Vivo have recently excelled. This is a market that has seen numerous winners emerge over the years such as Lenovo, Huawei, and most famously, Xiaomi. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun styled himself as a China version of Steve Jobs, focusing on design, high-end specs, but at a lower price point than Apple. Xiaomi—popular with urban millennials—was known for its high-profile launch parties and until recently, an internet-only sales model. But Xiaomi runs a version of Google’s Android operating system. And without an app ecosystem to lock in users, companies found that customer loyalty was almost non-existent amongst commodity-like smartphones that run Android. Even a brand with cult status like Xiaomi was susceptible to newer entrants. Going Brick-and-Mortar Oppo and Vivo are both owned by Guangzhou-based BBK Electronics, a company started by billionaire investors and entrepreneur Duan Yongping. Both brands have similar approaches to selling phones. They observed that Xiaomi was a favorite of urban millenials—at least those who want a cheaper or Android-based alternative to the Apple iPhone. Xiaomi until recently only sold phones directly via its website, and promoted each phone release via hip launch parties. Oppo and Vivo saw an opening in working with retail stores, where two out of three phones are still sold in China. The companies especially targeted stores outside of large cities and in rural areas, where consumers are more price-sensitive, have less access to the internet, and place more reliance on local technical and customer support. Oppo and Vivo partnered with retail sales professionals in small vendors and offered sizable affiliate sales commissions and subsidies to sales reps. Related Coverage Spy Software Found Preinstalled on Lenovo, Huawei, and Xiaomi Smartphones Apple Walks a Thin Line on User Privacy While Dealing With China “Oppo and Vivo are willing to share their profit with local sales,” Jin Di, an analyst at market research firm IDC, told Bloomberg. “The reward was an extremely active and loyal nationwide sales network. They’re doing something different—they do local marketing.” It’s an antiquated strategy, but it’s a fit with Chinese consumers outside of major cities. The small vendors serve as the companies’ local salesmen, technical support, and customer support. With the added incentives, they help promote the products to friends and consumers on WeChat, and steer sales away from competitors toward Oppo and Vivo phones. Their other killer app? Oppo and Vivo phones often carry powerful, zoom-enabled front cameras for selfies. Xiaomi, meanwhile, has moved up market in recent years. It now manufactures a variety of other products such as video cameras and “Internet of Things” home devices in an effort to position itself as China’s homegrown Apple. Through the success of Oppo and Vivo, Xiaomi also realized the value of having a retail presence. It now runs a few hundred stores in China.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft feted to be the first trillion dollar tech company 3 by Surur  @mspoweruser Dec 25, 2016 at 17:00 GMT1 week ago There was a time when it appeared Apple was well on its way to being the first tech company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, reaching a high of $775 billion in February 2015. Since then however weakness related to its inability to produce another hit product has become evident, and its market cap has since receded to $617 billion. Now Michael Markowski from financial publication Equities.com has postulated that Microsoft is on track to take that crown, despite being third in line behind Apple and Google. Market Capitalization Apple $617 billion Alphabet $548 billion Microsoft $492 billion Amazon $359 billion Facebook $333 billion Markowski notes that unlike a hardware company a digital company like Microsoft had a more scalable business model that could reach more consumers, and  better cash flow and higher margins. The author notes that from the short list Microsoft had the highest free cash flow, and that its acquisition of LinkedIn boosted its PE multiple significantly, as social network companies are traditionally valued much higher despite lower earnings, making Microsoft, even at $492 billion, significantly undervalued. Also due to its high dividend yield of 2.5% the downside for its share price is limited. He also note that Microsoft only paid LinkedIn around $60 per user, compared to Facebook’s $218 per user, and that professional users tend to be worth a lot more than regular users, again suggesting a lot of upside is possible for Microsoft, especially if  the emerging Social Investing Community (SIC) industry, which allowed companies to crowd fund from social media, comes to fruition. Markowski notes that Microsoft’s only competition in the race is Alphabet/Google, noting both Microsoft and Google had more than double the annual cash flow of Amazon and Facebook. After a decade of stagnation under Steve Ballmer Microsoft’s share price has gained more than 50% over the last three years. Markowski postulates another doubling, which will likely not take place without the narrative around Microsoft changes drastically, which should be an interesting change for loyal fans used to seeing Microsoft left out of the conversation.

As for its reasoning, Consumer Reports explained that the inconsistent, yet sometimes impressive, battery life was too big of an issue to overlook. Now, Apple Marketing executive Phil Schiller says that the company is working with Consumer Reports to “understand” the tests. Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data That’s what’s so ironic about this: Consumer Reports reported a three and a half hour test on the MacBook Pro, which if you’ve used one like me, know is completely possible with some serious CPU-intensive tasks. But then again tested in the 18-19+ hour range which is totally unbelievable, even if just the screen was on. So if anything, this test is in Apple’s favor. Schiller claims that the results obtained by Consumer Reports, which saw battery life of anywhere from 3.5 hours to 19.5 hours, do not match Apple’s lab tests or field data. Apple, of course, extensively tests battery life in-house and in real-world use to come up with its own estimates. It also has some “field data” from devices out in the wild. For its part, Consumer Reports explained that it’s normal to see battery life time vary less than 5 percent between tests, making the performance of the MacBook Pro models highly abnormal. In a series of three consecutive tests, the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third. The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for 19.5 hours in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours.  While the lack a recommendation may seem arbitrary on the surface, Apple uses the results from the organizations like JD Power and Consumer Reports heavily, specifically in retail stores and marketing. While it seems unlikely that Consumer Reports will reverse its recommendation without Apple somehow fixing the battery life issues, it’s noteworthy that the company has approached them directly about the data. Ben Lovejoy noted earlier today that something definitely seemed “odd” about the data Consumer Reports found. Many other tech reporters added onto Ben’s report but he was the 1st to lay out the claim.  It’s possible that the results revealed a software-side problem that’s affecting battery life, in which Apple is likely working with publication to obtain more information and potentially work towards a fix. In the meantime, Apple has yet to address the new MacBook Pro’s battery life in a software update, aside from removing the antiquated (/s) “Time Remaining” statistic. In our tests, we were unable to get the Touch Bar MacBook to last much beyond 8 hours using the same tests Apple quoted for 10 hours. Guides MacBook Pro View THe Guide Phil Schiller View THe Guide Consumer Reports View THe Guide http://deecees.wordpress.com deecees So, because Apple have a battery problem with their latest MacBook Pro range, ALL previous models loose the Time Remaining estimate? Come on Apple you can add features to the OS for Touch Bar, why can’t you just remove the Time Remaining estimate for your latest lemon models and leave it where it was for the previous ranges?

Several Withings iOS-compatible products — mostly health-related connected accessories — have been available at Apple Stores for nearly two years as part of a retail alliance, AppleInsider reported on Saturday. The Withings product sales continued even after the company was acquired by Nokia in April for nearly $190 million. The Withings brand was integrated into Nokia’s Digital Health unit. “Now, the devices made by the Nokia subsidiary are no longer listed on Apple’s website. Previously, Apple carried a wide range of iOS-compatible Withings devices in its retail stores, including the ‘Body Cardio Scale’ and ‘Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor,’” the report added. Five years after Apple and Nokia settled a lawsuit, the tech giants have again locked horns over patents with Apple filing an antitrust lawsuit against third-party companies Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) that act on Nokia’s behalf, and the Finland-based firm suing Apple directly earlier this week. Nokia filed a suit in Europe and the US, claiming Apple is still infringing on Nokia patents. The lawsuit covers 32 patents, including display, user interface, software and video-coding technology. Nokia said that since settling the initial case, Apple has “declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other [parts] of its patented inventions, which are used by many Apple products.” In its lawsuit, Apple argued that Nokia already has agreements to license its patents for fair and reasonable terms, also know as “FRAND” (Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory). “But Nokia is transferring these patents to PAEs in order to aggressively pursue money,” Apple argued. According to the Cupertino-based tech giant, Nokia has been conspiring with PAEs patent assertion entities (Acacia Research and Conversant Property Management) in an “illegal patent transfer scheme” to wring money out of Apple because Nokia’s cell phone business is failing. According to the AppleInsider report, Apple has now “expunged all mention of Withings and its product line from the Apple.com online retail database”. “Whether or not the recent Withings removal is related to Nokia’s shady legal dealings has yet to be confirmed, but Apple has in the past used its retail might as a retaliatory weapon,” the report added. In 2011, the two companies settled a patent fight over smartphone technology through a licensing agreement that committed Apple to make a one-time payment to the company and to pay regular royalties in the future, media reported. The companies also agreed to withdraw complaints against each other with the International Trade Commission over the use of intellectual property.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) RICHARD DREW / ASSOCIATED PRESS Costumed characters work in a color-coded designated activity zone in New York’s Times Square. Street performers and costumed characters can be issued summonses or face arrest if they’re caught operating outside the eight designated rectangles, under new rules aimed at controlling overly aggressive street performers. Each area is painted teal and measures 8 feet by 50 feet. Image Gallery for Big Apple Greeter reveals secrets and tips for first-timers in NYC Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link As a native New Yorker, a licensed city tour guide and a volunteer Big Apple Greeter, I’ve answered lots of questions from tourists over the years. Among them: “Is it safe to drink the water?” (Yes.) “What does ‘curb your dog’ mean?” (Dogs should not use sidewalks as a bathroom.) And my favorite: “Where are all the supermodels?” (I don’t know.) The Big Apple Greeter organization matches out-of-towners with locals for free neighborhood visits and other outings, and as a greeter, I’ve also shepherded tourists from around the world on their first subway rides, visits to Harlem and Brooklyn, and tastes of local delicacies (like bagels). Along the way, I’ve given lots of advice on enjoying the city while staying safe, having fun and sticking to a budget. Here are some tips. Safety Street food is safe to eat. Crime is very low, but safeguard your wallet from pickpockets and don’t drape your purse over your chair. Many people will accost you, trying to sell you things. Keep walking. It’s not uncommon to hear of pedestrians hit by bikes or even cars. Look both ways when crossing the street. Use seatbelts in cabs. The best things in New York are free •Staten Island Ferry. Great views of the Statue of Liberty, Lower Manhattan and New York Harbor. Runs 24 hours a day. Beautiful at night with the city lit up. No. 1 subway to South Ferry or 4 or 5 trains to Bowling Green. • 9/11 park. A powerful symbol of the city’s resilience, with One World Trade rising above. Reflecting pools built in the footprints of the twin towers are a moving tribute to those who perished. Be sure to stop at the Survivor Tree. Check out the Oculus nearby, a cool and curious white-winged structure with shops and eateries inside. • Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. Take the C or A train to the High Street stop on the Brooklyn side and walk back to Manhattan. • Central Park. New Yorkers live in tiny apartments. City parks are our collective backyards. Enter at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, just north of the Manhattan White House, aka Trump Tower. • The High Line. This vertical park built on an old rail line 30 feet above the street runs for about a mile from 34th Street west of 10th Avenue to just below 14th Street. Expect crowds. • Grand Central, 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue. Notice the famous four-faced clock, cathedral windows, grand staircases and zodiac signs in the ceiling. A black rectangle in the northwest corner of the ceiling is a reminder of the days prior to a 1990s renovation when the entire ceiling was black from decades of tobacco smoke. • Times Square. New Yorkers hate this place. Under new rules, tip-hungry costumed characters and half-naked painted women must stay confined to a teal-colored zone. The subway It’s noisy, dirty and confusing but generally safe and efficient. Chances are you will encounter homeless people, panhandlers, musicians and trains so crowded you can’t get on. It runs 24 hours a day, though trains and riders thin out overnight. Trust your gut: If someone is acting strangely or aggressively, make like a New Yorker and walk away. If you bump someone accidentally, a sincere apology is expected. Get a free map from a manned booth. There’s also a map in every car of every train. Most New Yorkers can provide basic directions but this app is good for route-planning: https://citymapper.com/nyc . Trains are sometimes rerouted on weekends; see http://web.mta.info/weekender.html . Each one-way ride costs $2.75. Best deal is an unlimited seven-day pass for $31. Or put $20 on a regular pay-per-ride MetroCard and the machine will give you a free 11 percent bonus, $2.20, covering 8 rides total. If you pay in cash and don’t have exact change, you’ll get coins back. If you pay by credit card and you’re from abroad, type in 99999 as your zip code. There’s a $1 fee for the card, but you can refill it. Prices are likely to rise in spring 2017. Attractions Buy online timed tickets for attractions when available. Otherwise arrive a half-hour before opening time to reduce your wait. Empire State Building, Top of the Rock or One World Trade observatories? I prefer the first two because they’re in the middle of Manhattan, whereas much of what you see from One World Trade is the harbor and New Jersey. Many museums schedule a few free hours each week. The Metropolitan Museum of Art lists a suggested admission but you don’t have to pay it. To me, the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection is worth the steep $25 admission (don’t miss Van Gogh’s “Starry Night”). Neighborhoods A few of my favorites: In Harlem, have a bite at Marcus Samuelsson’s Streetbird on 116th Street and walk across the neighborhood’s main street, 125th Street. Joe Shanghai on Pell Street in Chinatown is cheap, crazy, fun and good; be prepared to wait for a table and beware the hot broth inside the pork dumplings. From Chinatown, walk to Little Italy for dessert at Ferrara’s, 195 Grand St. Hang with the hipsters in trendy Brooklyn: Take the L train to Bedford in Williamsburg or Jefferson in Bushwick. Among many options for great pizza, I like Lombardi’s, C train to Spring Street.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: December 27, 2016 7:38 pm Consumer Reports’ team conducted tests on the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar and a 15-inch MacBook Pro. Apple’s new MacBook Pro series did not receive recommended ratings from Consumer Reports. The site, which conducted several tests on MacBook Pro 2016 series to evaluate display, performance etc noted that battery life of the laptops were ‘highly inconsistent’. However, Apple’s Senior Vice President Phil Schiller said the results do not match company’s extensive lab tests. Schiller tweeted out saying, “Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data.” He attached a link to an imore article as well. Consumer Reports’ team conducted tests on the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar and a 15-inch MacBook Pro. The report insists they tested battery life on these laptops repeatedly and averaged those results together to come to a final battery score. “The MacBook Pro battery life results were highly inconsistent from one trial to the next,” the report reads. Check out the tweet here: Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data. http://t.co/IWtfsmBwpO — Philip Schiller (@pschiller) December 24, 2016 Consumer Reports has talked about its battery tests in detail: “For instance, in a series of three consecutive tests, the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third. The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for 19.5 hours in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours,” the report reveals. It adds the laptops fail to meet Consumer Reports’ standards for recommended models, owing to disappointing battery results. It is worth noting these are the first set of MacBooks to not receive recommended ratings from Consumer Reports. The report revealed their methodology of conducting battery tests as well. It put out a step-by-step procedure of how they performed the tests. Consumer Report notes the performance of a device can be influenced by a software update and thus they performed the battery tests again after macOS Sierra 10.12.2 was released. However, according to the report, the update did not make any difference in the results. Apple unveiled its new MacBook Pro series at its event on October 27. Apple’s newest MacBook Pro is the thinnest and lightest one yet. The function key on the keyboard in the new MacBook Pro has been replaced by a new ‘Retina-quality’ multi-touch display known as the Touch Bar. Apple claims the MacBook Pro features the ‘brightest and most colourful Retina display yet’ with 500 nits of brightness, which Apple claims is 67 per cent brighter than the previous generation. The device starts at Rs 1,29,900 for the 13-inch variant (256GB) without the TouchBar. The one with TouchBar costs Rs 1,55,900 for the 256GB version and Rs 1,72,900 for the 512GB storage option. The 15-inch display variant of Apple MacBook Pro is available in India at Rs 2,05,900 for 256GB storage variant. The 512GB option costs Rs 2,41,900. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple Best of Express PM Modi frames UP fight: Growth exiled for 14 yrs, give us majority EntertainmentDangal box office collection day 11: Aamir Khan film all set to take over Sultan as biggest hit of 2016 EntertainmentRaees: Dear Shah Rukh Khan, why are you so 'Zaalim' on us?

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Patently Apple Wishes our Friends and Colleagues a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year | Main | The Irish Ministry Disagrees that a recent EU Court Tax Ruling in a Spanish Case Spells bad news for Apple » December 25, 2016 Nokia's Second Patent Infringement Lawsuit against Apple Covers Qualcomm RF Technology, Siri and the iPhone's Design   Yesterday Patently Apple posted a report titled "Part 1: Nokia Files an 8 Count Patent Infringement Case against Apple Primarily Focused on the H.264 Standard." In Part two I uncover a second patent infringement case that was filed by Nokia Technologies Oy and Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc. that contains a basket of ten patents referred to as Nokia's Patents-in-Suit. Unlike their first Infringement lawsuit that basically focused on the H.264 standard, their second lawsuit is a shotgun approach with every patent covering a different aspect of technology.   In this lawsuit Nokia attacks Apple on several technical fronts including the iPhone's use of RF technology from Qualcomm, various Siri services including "Find my iPhone" and the actual industrial design of the iPhone that includes the cutout for its backside camera.   Apple purchases specific parts for their iPhone 6s from Qualcomm and one such part that is highlighted in this case is presented to you further below in this report. Nokia basically claims in their filing that the technology that Qualcomm uses in their part infringes a Nokia patent. So why is Apple being sued for alleged patent infringement on a Qualcomm part? Shouldn't Nokia be suing Qualcomm first to make that determination a fact of law? To be sure this is an overreach by Nokia to be accusing Apple of this patent infringement rather than Qualcomm.   With a lawsuit overreaching as it is, you can understand why Apple decided to pull all Withings products from their retail and online stores out of retaliation. The Withings brand is now integrated into Nokia's Digital Health unit, according to MacRumors who broke the story on Friday.   Apple's Alleged Infringing Products   Nokia lists the alleged infringing Apple products as being the following: the Apple iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 5s, iPhone SE, iPad Pro (LTE), iPad Air 2 (LTE), iPad Air (LTE), iPad Mini 4 (LTE), iPad Mini 3 (LTE), and iPad Mini 2 (LTE) (collectively, the "247 Accused Products").   In a partial highlight found in Nokia's lawsuit relating to Qualcomm's RF part found in the iPhone 6s Nokia notes that "For example, as shown below, the iPhone 6s includes a Qualcomm MDM9635M baseband processor that, on information and belief, includes a digital signal processor. On information and belief, the Qualcomm MDM9635M produces a digital baseband quadrature signal that represents the information to be transmitted via the Qualcomm WTR3925 RF transceiver.   According to Nokia all of Apple's "accused products" that use this Qualcomm part infringe their '247 patent. "Additionally, Apple provides instruction manuals that instruct users of the '247 Accused Products to use the '247 Accused Products in a manner that infringes the '247 patent, such as by making cellular telephone calls."   It would appear that giving consumers the ability to make cellular phone calls on a cellular phone is owned by the Nokia gods. Their arrogance in making such an absurd claim is astounding. Don't they lock up people in rubber rooms for less?   Some of the other Apple features challenged by Nokia relate to Siri and Find my iPhone. Nokia even challenges the iPhone's shape and camera cut-out on the rear side of the iPhone as infringing their patent 9,473,602 as noted below. As for Siri, Nokia's lawsuit claims that many aspects of Siri services infringe their '294 patent. The filing specifically points out that Siri uses a series of processes that infringe Lucent Technology patents over the use of databases and tables that interact with web-based applications like music and mail. Overall, Nokia further claims that Apple's iOS 10 specifically infringes claim #7 of the '294 patent.   At the end of the day, to better understand this case from top to bottom requires that you review all of the materials available to you. Below are links to the patents that Nokia is using in this case and further below is a copy of the full patent lawsuit as was presented to the court in Texas. For the legal beagles and patent sleuths among us, enjoy.   The Ten Counts of Patent Infringement against Apple   Patent 7,415,247 entitled "Method and Arrangement for Transmitting and Receiving RF Signals through Various Radio Interfaces of Communication Systems."   Patent 9,270,301 entitled "Method and Arrangement for Transmitting and Receiving RF Signals through Various Radio Interfaces of Communication Systems."   Patent 8,036,619 entitled "Oscillator Having Controllable Bias Modes and Power Consumption."   Patent 6,393,260 entitled "Method for Attenuating Spurious Signals and Receiver."   Patent 6,480,700 entitled "Apparatus, and Associated Method, For Operating a Communication Device at Reduced Level of Current Consumption."   Patent 7,653,366 entitled "Hybrid Switched Mode/Linear Power Amplifier Power Supply for Use Patent in Polar Transmitter."   Patent 6,826,391 entitled "Transmission and Reception Antenna System for Space Diversity Reception."   Patent 9,473,602 entitled "Portable Electronic Device."   Patent 6,208,725 entitled "Arrangement for Controlling Remote Telephones."   Patent 6,701,294 entitled 'User Interface for Translating Natural Language Inquiries into Database Queries and Data Presentations."   2. Nokia v. Apple Case 01441 - Patent Infringement Case - Patently Apple by Jack Purcher on Scribd   In the end it's difficult to understand how one lawsuit can cover such a quantity of varying aspects of a smartphone to be argued at one time before a non-technical jury.   Perhaps Nokia's strategy is to completely overwhelm and frustrate a jury of non-technical members in the hopes that they'll just throw their hands up in the end and decide on a verdict by saying "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe" and give Nokia one or more wins out of sheer frustration to make it seem that they're fair jury members.   It's a crazy legal system and Apple is going to have to spend a lot of money and time to try and make this simple for a jury to digest. But in the end, I'm not sure that will suffice. They should move all patent cases out of patent troll friendly Texas and send them to Vegas – because it's really now become a game of playing the odds of an outcome of a trial rather than winning on the merits of the patents. It's a joke.   The patent infringement case 2:2016cv01441 presented in today's report was filed in the Texas Eastern District Court. The Presiding Judge in this case is noted as being Judge Rodney Gilstrap.   In case you missed it, see Part One: Nokia Files an 8 Count Patent Infringement Case against Apple Primarily Focused on the H.264 Standard   Notice: Patently Apple presents only a brief summary of certain legal cases/ lawsuits which are part of the public record for journalistic news purposes.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on December 25, 2016December 25, 2016 by Monika Donimirska Nintendo Needs Apple, but Apple Also Needs Nintendo Image source: Nintendo. There’s a lot of Nintendo (NASDAQOTH: NTDOY)  going on at Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)  these days. Super Mario Run — Nintendo’s first mobile app devoted to its signature side-scrolling gaming franchise — made its debut exclusively on devices running Apple’s iOS last week with record-setting success. This week we saw Pokemon Go introduced for Apple Watch, also exclusively for Apple’s smartwatch. Nintendo reports that there were 40 million downloads of Super Mario Run through Apple’s App Store in its first four days of availability. The record-breaking pace followed a third-party report that just 25 million downloads had taken place in that time. Heavy initial activity doesn’t necessarily mean Nintendo has a financial hit on its hands. Super Mario Run is a free download, and a third-party report indicates that fewer than 10% of the players downloading the game have paid over the $10 price to unlock more features and loosen up restrictions. Super Mario Run is drumming up mixed reviews, but a lot of the knocks have to do with the limitations for the free account. There’s no doubt we’ll be hearing mixed reviews for the Pokemon Go Apple Watch app, but in this case mostly on the restrictions of the small smartwatch screens in duplicating this summer’s hot app experience. An unlikely pairing Image source: Niantic Labs. It makes sense for Nintendo to team up with Apple to make sure that Super Mario Run and a smartwatch version of Pokemon Go hit the market on Apple devices first. Android has the wider established base, but Apple fans spend money. Aiming for iPhone and iPad owners with Super Mario Run is a bet that folks will pay $10 for a mobile game if it’s iconic enough. The Apple Watch move with Pokemon Go is simply a matter of riding the only smartwatch platform that matters. Still, it’s an odd partnership, considering where this relationship stood just a few years ago. Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime had some choice words in attacking Apple back in 2010 , when it seemed as if Apple’s gadgetry was eating into the popularity of Nintendo’s portable system. “It doesn’t look like their platform is a viable profit platform for game development, because so many of the games are free versus paid downloads,” Fils-Aime said at the time. Fils-Aime also dismissed mobile gaming as a niche where gamers were treated to just snacks instead of hearty meals. A lot has changed now that Nintendo is turning to Apple gamers first, and shareholders are seeing the difference. Nintendo stock soared 29% the day Apple unveiled Super Mario Run , a big deal since it stands to make a lot more money this time than it does with its minority stake in Pokemon Go . However, we can’t dismiss what Apple stands to gain here. Nintendo’s preference to iOS vindicates the premium consumers pay for Apple products. The $10 price point for the premium version of the game should also educate users to pay more for their mobile diversions. Both companies have a lot riding on this month’s new Nintendo iOS releases. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Consumer Reports published a surprise report Thursday saying it could not recommend any new MacBook Pro model due to its erratic, if not bad battery life.  "The MacBook Pro battery life results were highly inconsistent from one trial to the next," Consumer Reports said. This is the first time a MacBook hasn't received a "recommended" designation from Consumer Reports. Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller followed up with a tweet late Friday saying Apple is "working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data." In his tweet, Schiller linked to a story from iMore that says Consumer Reports was just going for a pre-Christmas headline and should have done more testing. Consumer Reports' review says that in-house testing revealed wild fluctuations in battery life for unplugged MacBook Pro computers. In the case of the 13-inch model without a Touch Bar, for example, battery life ranged from 19.5 hours to just 4.5 hours. Apple says the devices should operate for up to 10 hours between charges. "The laptops did very well in measures of display quality and performance, but in terms of battery life, we found that the models varied dramatically from one trial to another," Consumer Reports said in a blog post about its MacBook Pro rating. It ended up giving the 15-inch MacBook Pro a score of 56 points out of 100. The 13-inch versions with and without a Touch Bar got 40 and 47, respectively, out of 100. "For the battery test, we download a series of 10 web pages sequentially, starting with the battery fully charged, and ending when the laptop shuts down," the Consumer Reports post reads. "The web pages are stored on a server in our lab, and transmitted over a Wi-Fi network set up specifically for this purpose. We conduct our battery tests using the computer's default browser -- Safari, in the case of the MacBook Pro laptops." The MacBook Pro laptops, released in the fall, haven't been as well-received as Apple would have hoped for due to issues ranging from battery life, cost, dongles required and even alleged staleness. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for more information about battery life tests and Schiller's tweet. Consumer Reports also didn't immediately respond to a requests for comment and confirmation that it's working with Apple.

Whether you've got a first or second-generation Apple Watch, changing and customising the watch face is a doddle. Apple provides a load of options when it comes to new faces, but there's also a bunch of third-party designs on offer to ensure your wrist looks as classy as possible. With that in mind, we thought we'd give you a quick rundown of the whole Apple Watch face thing, and provide all you wearable enthusiasts with some tips on how to quickly change Apple Watch faces and customise their design. Related: Apple Watch 2 review How to change the Apple Watch face First things first, how do you actually change the watch face? Well, it couldn't be any simpler. The easiest way is to swipe left or right, from edge-to-edge, on your watch face. That will cycle through the various watch face designs and you can simply stop when you see something you like the look of. Alternatively, you can hard press – or 'Force Touch', to use Apple's terminology – on the watch face and it will take you to the face-switching screen. From here, you can swipe left and right to scroll through the various designs. Once you see one you like, just tap it to set it as your new watch face. Related: CES 2017 Customising the Apple Watch face Once you've chosen a design you like, you'll be pleased to learn there are further customisation options you can use to tinker with the watch face design. How do you unlock these marvellous features? Well, it's pretty much the same process as before. Force Touch the watch face display to bring up the switching screen and just tap the 'Customise' button that appears below the watch face itself. Now, you should be able to swipe left and right to highlight a specific part of the watch face. Once you've highlighted the element you want, just turn the digital crown to customise it. This usually means you can change the colour of the specific part of the face you've highlighted. Related: Apple Watch review Apple also allows you to add what it calls 'complications' to the watch face. This term essentially refers to any area of the watch face that provides information other than the time. So, if your chosen face contains information such as the date, fitness data, or music details, you can customise that too. To do so, simply hard press the screen, tap 'Customise', then tap the particular complication you want to edit. Or you can tap 'Customise' then scroll all the way to the left to edit the complications from there. Whichever method you use, just press the digital crown to save the changes you've made, then tap the watch face to set it as your current face. It's also worth noting that not all watch faces are customisable, and not all allow you to add complications. Most designs come with some extra customisability, though. Adding complications The customisation doesn't quite stop there. You can also add more complications and other information from third-party apps to your watch face, depending on which design you've chosen. It's fairly easy to figure out which apps provide Apple Watch complications. Just open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, tap the My Watch tab, and go to Complications. From here, you can add new complications by tapping the + symbol, or remove them using the - symbol and then tapping Remove. Once you've added a new complication to the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, you should be able to go into the customise screen on the watch itself, select the new complication, and customise it. Making Multiple versions of your watch face Managed to get your watch face looking just how you like? That's wonderful news, but perhaps you're intrigued to see what other breath-taking customisation designs you can come up with. In which case, you'll be delighted to hear you can make multiple versions of your chosen face. Related: Apple Watch tips and tricks All you have to do is hard press the screen when it's on the watch face, then scroll all the way to the right and tap the + symbol. Now, you can just turn the Digital Crown to choose a face, and tap the one you want. You can then customise the face by firmly pressing the display again and tapping Customise. Using this method, you'll be able to add multiple versions of the same watch face and customise each to look a bit different. Isn't technology wonderful? Deleting watch faces If you've had enough of your current watch face, you can always banish it forever. To delete a watch face, hard press the display, then swipe to the face you want to delete. Once you've found it, it's simply a case of swiping up and tapping Remove.

Today TRVL, a team of a dozen staffers in Amsterdam and eight developers and designers in Rotterdam, announces its updated app for iOS. The update delivers more content, including photo galleries and four or five fresh stories a day (instead of one “magazine” every week, as before). The frequent crashes are supposed to stop. A search function has been added. Maps now load faster. And so forth. The three-year delay in updating the app is partly blamed on many of the tech team having been acqui-hired by Apple to help build out the launch of Apple News. Now they’re back in Europe and working on TRVL again. On the monetization front, TRVL will onboard its booking platform, which nets commissions on hotels and other travel products via Expedia Affiliate Network. In January it will add Booking.com’s inventory of 1 million hotels. It will soon start comparing prices of Booking.com, Expedia, and Hotels.com in real-time with every search result. It will add five currencies, including the euro and the pound, for buying travel. An iPhone version will debut, too. Jochem Wijnands, founder and chief executive, summarized the bigger picture for Tnooz like this: “This update is a first step to turning the TRVL app into a place where you find inspiration, and our booking engine, and meet local experts that can recommend destinations/hotels/neighborhoods ‘just for you.’ It will also be where your travel data lives.” TRVL remains significant as an experiment in presenting magazine-style content in the mobile-first era. In mere months after its debut, it quickly racked up a subscriber base that outpaced the (paying) readerships of many major national travel magazines, though the quality, diversity, and reliability of the content may not have been comparable. The latest changes suggest the final nail in the era of publishers dreaming of building app experiences that readers would pay subscriptions for and that would “keep” readers inside an app’s walls. The new TRVL is free, but it has dropped the magazine format pretensions. Soon TRVL will also publish video. It says it will re-introduce long-form stories, but this will not be the same thing as the old dreams. For a while, traditional print publishers raced to create TRVL-like experiences, often by hiring Adobe, but largely without gaining traction with readers. In a Medium blog post, Wijnands notes that non-traditional companies also struggled. “In September 2015, after we shipped Apple News, I returned from Cupertino. By then, the world of digital publishing had changed dramatically. Newsstand no longer existed. Flipboard was on its way out. Facebook’s instant articles had launched and paid content as a business model for digital publications was officially dead….” “Sadly, the online magazine didn’t survive either. TRVL might be the last manifestation of the hope that once possessed us all when the iPad was invented — ie., that it was possible to publish online magazines to rival or even better print magazines both in popularity and revenue…. “But that’s not what happened. The launch of Newsstand — built to support legacy publishers — was the first sign that things were going wrong. Downloading a 500MB magazine that was nothing more than a PDF of the print version wasn’t a good experience. This wasn’t why people had bought an iPad…. “So, while TRVL as a digital magazine didn’t seem to have much of a future, we decided that the premises that TRVL was built on most definitely did….” Now the industry waits to see if the latest attempts to meet market demands will thrive.

Fitbit Charge 2 Review GO Fitbit Charge reinvented with new design and more features Dec 25, 2016 14:00 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  INTRO HARDWARE FEATURES CONCLUSIONS Fitbit continues to be number one in terms of wearable sales, as the company sold a total of 5.3 million units in the third quarter of 2016 for a market share of 23 percent, according to IDC data. Although Apple has improved a lot thanks to the Apple Watch, the Cupertino-based company is only fourth in Q3 2016 charts, with 1.1 million sold units (4.9 percent market share), while Xiaomi and Garmin take the second and the third place, respectively. But in the end, it’s very clear that Fitbit is by far the leading choice for those looking for new wearables. Earlier this year, the company revamped its product portfolio with new models, including an updated Charge version that it calls… Charge 2. Built from the very beginning to be super-comfortable to wear, the Charge 2 incorporates Fitbit’s latest technologies that are also available on the more-expensive Blaze, including PurePulse heart rate monitoring, reminders to move, and SmartTrack for auto exercise recognition. The charge was Fitbit’s best-selling tracker, so the second generation is expected to continue the success of the original model, and even surpass it thanks to all these upgrades. But can it really do that? Is the Charge 2 worth the $150 (€160) price? Does it have what it takes to be used as a full smartwatch replacement? These are all questions that we’re going to answer in the next chapters. Fitbit Charge 2 and Fitbit Blaze HARDWARE First and foremost, the Charge 2 comes with an OLED display that provides you with information such as the current time, steps, heart rate, and calories burned. It can also be used for starting a new workout, and you can navigate either by touch or using the only side button. The screen has no colors, and this is particularly important for battery life because Fitbit paid particular attention to how long you can use the tracker. It features a lithium-polymer battery which Fitbit says that can last up to 5 days, but this obviously depends on a number of workouts, such as how often you exercise and how you use the device. The company, however, recommends “charging the device every few days to ensure that you’re always tracking,” so it’s better to charge it every 4 days. As for real-life performance, the 5-day estimate is not at all inaccurate, and during our test, the Charge 2 provided between 3 and 5 days of battery life, again depending on how it was used. The lack of a GPS sensor helps a lot because, on most wearables, GPS is the main battery hog. And thanks to the display and the battery optimizations implemented by Fitbit, the 5-day battery life is not at all far-fetched. The Charge 2 also comes with an optical heart rate tracker which powers what Fitbit calls “PurePUlse Heart Rate,” a catchy name for a heart activity monitoring with a few extras. There’s also an altimeter for counting floors, a vibration motor, and a 3-asix accelerometer. If you’re looking for features like GPS, speakers, microphones, or barometers, they’re not there because, at this point, Fitbit just wants to go with the essentials and make sure that these are working correctly. Fitbit Charge 2 charger The device comes with interchangeable bands, and you can choose from a large collection, including bands made from metal and from leather. The default one is made from elastomer, similar to what you can find right now on the majority of smartwatches, but it’s really comfortable to wear all the time. The design of the tracker also contributes to this, and it follows the shape of the wrist in a more natural way than the Microsoft Band 2, for example. There’s barely any pressure on your wrist, and the only thing that’s in contact with your skin all the time is the heart rate sensor. The band comes with a surgical-grade stainless steel buckle that keeps the tracker in place all the time, as long as you adjust it correctly. The Fitbit Charge 2 uses Bluetooth LE to connect to your phone, and it can work with iOS, Android, and even Windows smartphones thanks to the dedicated app available on all these platforms. FEATURES If you’re planning on buying the Charge 2 to use it as a smartwatch, you shouldn’t do it. Although it does come with some features that you typically find on smartwatches, the Charge 2 is first and foremost an activity tracker that’s supposed to monitor your workout sessions. It can alert on phone notifications, but support is very basic. For example, the Charge 2 vibrates on new calls, text messages, or calendar events, but it won’t show emails, WhatsApp or Facebook messages. And it doesn’t let you interact with calls or messages in any way, so its only purpose is to alert you and then it's up to you yo take further action on the phone. The Charge 2 also supports several clock faces, but there’s nothing to be super-excited about because most options are pretty basic. You can configure them from the companion Fitbit app on the phone, where you can also find alarms, should you want to use the tracker to wake you up in the morning. If in terms of smartwatch capabilities the Charge 2 does not excel, the activity tracking section is the one that Fitbit has been specifically focused on. Fitbit Charge 2 band First and foremost, the heart rate tracker, which Fitbit calls PurePulse Heart Rate, offers continuous and automatic heart rate monitoring providing statistics and analysis which the company says should help track health and manage stress. Truth be told, the tracker does offer heart rate zones support, which helps you better adjust workouts for cardio or fat burning (a feature that’s also available on other devices like the Microsoft Band 2 and Samsung Gear Fit 2), but it also comes with readings that could help improve health and fitness. The Fitbit app offers plenty of information on your heart rate statistics, as well as tips to improve cardio fitness and find the best exercises for each individual. As far as exercises are concerned, the Fitbit Charge 2 comes with SmartTrack, a feature that enables auto exercise recognition for a wide array of activities, including biking and hiking. Monitoring starts automatically, and you can always see essential stats on your display while you work out. “Super comfortable all the time.” One important thing is that the Charge 2 does not come with a GPS module, but it offers what Fitbit calls “Connected GPS.” In other words, there’s no GPS in there, but the tracker can connect to your phone’s GPS module when a Bluetooth connection is available to provide mapping data and more accurate distance monitoring. This is a double-edged sword because while you can’t use the tracker without a phone to map your exercise, you actually get longer battery life, which for so many people is essential. The lack of GPS shouldn’t be a problem if you plan on doing activities like running or biking, as the phone can always be around or in the pocket. The tracker also provides reminders to move to stay in shape. The Charge 2 is configured to “convince” you to take 250 steps every hour, but the Fitbit companion app lets you disable these reminders. Auto activity tracking seems to be working quite accurately, and during our tests, the Charge 2 correctly tracked my running sessions every time without me manually starting a new workout. But as a general recommendation, it’s better to do this every time because this way you won’t lose any stats, as auto recognition might fail to kick in from the very beginning and it could miss a few minutes of your workout session. Fitbit companion app on iOS Sleep tracking is also one of the features that you could find very helpful, but again, we’ve found this to be slightly inaccurate. Basically, sleep monitoring begins when laying down in bed and not when you actually fall asleep. So for example, if every night you’re watching a couple of episodes of Homeland before you go to bed, there’s a good chance that sitting relaxed on the couch and watching a movie is actually tracked as sleeping. The Fitbit app also lets you configure your sleep goals, and you can configure bedtime and wakeup time, as well as bedtime reminders to make sure you stick with your schedule. Another helpful feature is guided breathing sessions, which are similar to the Breathe app that’s available on Apple Watch starting with watchOS 3 update. The tracker guides you to breathe correctly and relax using instructions that are adapted to your real-time heart activity. You can choose between two-minute or five-minute sessions, and you can stop at any moment. “Frequent firmware updates.” A firmware update that was released in mid-December brought additional features on the Charge 2, including a vibration that guides you throughout the breathing session. Previously, the tracker was displaying visual guidance only, so with this update, the Charge 2's guided breathing feature works similarly to the one on the Apple Watch. Additionally, the same firmware update also brings a new face, but there's nothing to be super excited about because you only get basic information and nothing more. You can also toggle the tracker on silent by muting notifications straight from the device (and not using the phone, and see battery level on the screen (previously, this information was exclusively available on the device itself). THE BOTTOM LINE Let’s start by making this simple: the Charge 2 is one of the best trackers we’ve tried so far. The best smartwatch? Not so much. Fitbit has never been into smartwatches, and the Charge 2 is the living proof, as it perfectly puts the company’s focus on activity tracking in the spotlight. There’s no doubt that the Charge 2 was designed to tackle buyers who are trying to lose weight, stay in shape, or simply adopt a more active lifestyle, but since the times are changing, Fitbit had no other option than to add a few smartwatch capabilities as well. Notification support is very limited, but it's only there because Fitbit absolutely had to do this, mostly because the majority of smartwatches are also expanding in the activity tracking world. So Fitbit did the same thing and tried to step into the smartwatch world with its own activity tracker. But it goes without saying that buyers aren’t necessarily interested in this, but more in how the Charge 2 keeps track of their workouts. And the device clearly doesn’t disappoint. The Fitbit Charge 2 offers premium build quality and it’s always comfortable to wear, although we’ve missed waterproofing and swimming support. It has auto tracking for the majority of activities, such as running and cycling, and can also monitor sleep without any input from the person wearing it. And thanks to how soft the band is, the Charge 2 is quite easy to wear while sleeping, as it causes no discomfort during the night. In the end, the Charge 2 shows why Fitbit continues to be number one in terms of sales. It simply serves its purpose very well, even if it doesn’t come with military-grade aluminum, a super AMOLED screen, 3D Touch, or things like that. It’s a tracker that does its job and it’s hard not to be pleased with it if this is what you’re looking for.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (37 Images) #Fitbit#Charge 2#activity tracker#smartwatch review#Fitbit review subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (37 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Samsung Gear S3 Frontier Review Apple Watch Series 2 Review Samsung Gear Fit 2 Review Fitbit Blaze Review - Jack of All Trades, Master of One New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" 37 photos    Fitbit Charge 2 New Apps Babylon: Get one-click translation in any desktop application and term search results within an extensive collection of dictionaries and glossaries Chameleon Startup Manager Lite: Software utility which enables you to edit and manage the processes running on your computer, with support for multiple languages Chameleon Startup Manager Pro: A startup management tool that enables you to quickly remove unneeded startup items and monitors the system for new apps set to launch with Windows Portable CDBurnerXP: CD/DVD and Blu-ray burning software solution that can be launched directly from a removable drive, without requiring prior installation Collectorz.com Movie Collector: A fully-featured application that helps users create a movie database, group movies into folders, perform searches, and catalogue DVDs by their barcode ReaConverter Lite: Batch convert image files, add watermarks, edit photos and save them to a selected output format with this intuitive application GPU-Z Portable: A reliable and useful software solution that comes in handy to all those who want to keep an eye on the data regarding their video and graphics cards Reader comments Hands-On with the CHUWI Vi10 Plus Running Remix OS 2.0 more on: CHUWI i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Now, you can order an Uber in the matter of seconds. Another useful skill is The Bartender, which you can add on the Alexa app. Be sure to spend some time exploring the Alexa app, because you can set up your Echo to do everything from play music and provide weather forecasts to play music, order flowers, and … well, any one of 3,000 tasks, really.

When you turn on your new iPhone, you’ll be greeted by the Setup Assistant, through which you’ll establish essentials like your Wi-Fi network and six-digit passcode, Touch ID, your Apple ID and iCloud account, and whether you want to activate Find My Phone and Location Services. You’ll also be asked if you want to set up Siri (you do!), which includes saying a few phrases so that she can get to know your voice. It sounds like a lot of decisions and inputs, but the whole process takes only a few minutes. Better yet, none of these choices are binding; you can find them all again later under Settings. After you’re done with the basics, it’s time to make that matte black beauty truly yours, by topping it off with all of your contacts, apps, and content. You can do this the easy way or the hard way. Which path you choose will likely depend on whether this is your first iPhone or iPad.

Then enter your Apple ID and password, and go grab a peppermint mocha while your iPhone restarts with all of your settings, preferences, apps, and more in place. In other words, it’ll be just like your old device, but… newer. If this is your first Apple rodeo, or you just want a fresh start and like fiddling around in menus, select Set Up as New Phone, which will accomplish exactly what it sounds like. From there, it’s just a matter of personalizing to your preference. Want to add an email account? Go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Add Account. Want to fine-tune which apps refresh in the background (and drain your battery in the process)? Head to Settings > General > Background App Refresh and toggle your little heart out.

For the first time, iOS 10 lets you delete Apple’s many, many stock apps. Do it! It feels great, I promise. Oh, and while you’re digging around in Apple’s preloaded apps, make sure to stop by iMessage and load up on stickers and games either to liven up your conversations, or send them spiraling into a pit of craven trollery. There’s no one right way to iOS, but hitting those basics should at least get you started on a sane path.

Let’s fire up that wristable the right way. Assuming your Watch is already on and charged, go ahead and open up the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, the one you’ve tried to delete a few times but iOS wouldn’t let you. You’ll need an iPhone 5 or more recent, running iOS 9 (if you have an Android phone, uh… was there a gift receipt, perhaps?). Make sure you’ve got Bluetooth and Wi-Fi toggled on as well. Select Start Pairing on the Watch, then direct your iPhone’s camera at the pretty blue pattern that has appeared on the Watch’s face. Congrats! They’re now bonded.

Next, enter your Apple ID and password (this is all still on your phone, no text input on that tiny display during this process). Then decide whether you want to enable Location Services (yes), Siri (sure), and Diagnostics (meh?). Just keep in mind that your iPhone and Watch will mirror each other with these settings; change it on one device, and the other will as well. You’ll then be given the option to create a passcode. You should do this, if only because without one you can’t use Apple Pay, which is currently one of the best parts of Apple Watch ownership. You can also save yourself some annoyances down the line by telling your Apple Watch to unlock along with your iPhone. Add Some Apps And now the homestretch! It’s time for apps.

And delightfully simple to get started on. Setting up your Chromebook is literally a three step process, and that’s only if you include “turn it on” as one of the steps. Ready? Here you go: 1. Turn it on. 2. Choose your language, connect it to your Wi-Fi network, and sign into your Google account. 3. Choose a profile picture or icon (I’d go with an icon, but I’m shy). OK, that’s it, you’re done. Life with a Chromebook after that is simply a matter of collecting the apps you need (it already comes with Calendar, Google Drive, the full suite of Google Docs applications, Google Play Music, Hangouts, and Chrome remote desktop). You can find those in the Chrome Web Store. Oh, and you might have heard that Chromebooks only work when they’re hooked up to the internet. That’s not quite true; there are plenty of Chrome apps that have an offline mode as well, including Gmail Offline, Google Drawings, and more. Just in case you’re stuck in a no-Wi-Fi zone, make sure to load up on a few of these desktop-bound right away. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Chromebook how-to Skip Social.

It’s the gift that keeps on giving you comfortable temperatures and reasonable heating bills. Fortunately, getting it up and running also isn’t as daunting as it might seem. Your first step, which you or your loved one hopefully did before you bought it in the first place, should be to make sure that your wiring is compatible. Otherwise, no dice. Fortunately, Nest has a guide where you can check for yourself. The short version: If you have “thick, stranded wires held together by wire nuts” under your current thermostat cover, this isn’t going to work out. If you have two labels for each wire…it might. Once you’ve confirmed your Nest compatibility, go ahead and shut off power to your HVAC system for safety’s sake. Then you’re ready to roll up your sleeves and do some handiwork. Fortunately, everything you need—including a screwdriver—is included in the box. As far as home upgrades go, it’s pretty straightforward; you just remove your old thermostat, attach the Nest base, connect the wires, and attach the Nest display. There are enough steps within those steps that your best bet is to follow along with this video guide: Or better yet, if you don’t trust yourself with anything electrical, Nest makes it easy to find a professional in your area who can help. Once your Nest is installed and powered on, you’ll need to connect it to your home Wi-Fi network. From there, just use it like you would any other thermostat. Within a few days, Nest will learn your habits and make those adjustments on its own. Physical installation is also just one part of the process. A lot of the “smart” in your smart thermostat comes from hooking it up with your phone. For that, just download the Nest app and create a Nest account. From there, you can use your smartphone (or computer) to change the temperature remotely and keep track of your energy usage. Go Back to Top.

Setting it up should be a breeze, but there are still a few things you’re going to want to consider. Placement We know, we know, you want to just plug it in and turn your brain off. But where you plug in your television matters more than you’d think, and there’s no one-space-fits-all solution. A lot of factors go into how crisp your television’s picture looks that have nothing to do with the settings (we’ll get to those in a minute). You’ll want to sit a specific distance from your set depending on how big it is, the aspect ratio, and the resolution. The basic rule of thumb is to sit within spitting distance of two times the diagonal length of your set. The higher the resolution, the closer you can sit without being able to discern individual pixels. It sounds complicated, but it’s really not so bad. Besides, that’s why charts and viewing calculators like these exist. Calibration and Settings The biggest mistake people make with new TVs is assuming it simply looks the way it does. Not so! There are lots of tweaks you can make right away to ensure an optimal viewing experience. You can find a more in-depth roundup here, but the short version should be enough to get you started. Picture Mode: If this is set to Demo or Showroom, switch it on over to Home or Standard. Aspect Ratio: Set this to “Auto-Adjust” or “Normal” if your picture looks stretched-out or collapsed. Motion Enhancement: This goes by many names (Clear Motion Rate, Motion Flow, etc) but it always results in making everything you watch look like a soap opera. Burn it with fire. Set-Specific Calibration: Your levels! Your levels are usually not ideal out of the box. You can tinker with your contrast and backlight and sharpness on your own, but we’d recommend hitting up the CNET HDTV Picture Setting Forum. There you’ll find precise expert recommendations on most of the top sets on the market, and if you can’t find your specific boob tube, you can post yourself asking for help. Smart Start You could go through and sign into all your Netflix and Hulu and (shudder) Twitter accounts on your smart TV. But also maybe don’t! Get a Roku or a Chromecast or an Apple TV instead. Their interfaces are more reliable, their selections are much larger, and they’re cheap as all heck. It’ll be the best present you ever gave yourself. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Whether it’s a Galaxy S7 or a Google Pixel, the process of getting started with Android is basically the same, and blessedly simple. Once you’ve powered up your device, you’ll be greeted with a series of set-up chores. This is where you’ll set your language preferences, set up your Wi-Fi, enter your Google account details (in other words, your Gmail address and password), and set up a device password and/or fingerprint security, if your phone offers that feature. Being signed into your Google account makes it easy to set up a new phone from there, if you were already on an Android device. Just make sure that your old phone is backed up by going to Settings > Backup & reset. There, you’ll see options for Back up my data (turn this on, if it’s not) and Automatic restore (toggle this to on as well), which combined will mean that not only will your apps be waiting for you on your new phone, their various settings should be as well. There are ways to transfer your photos and text messages as well, but your best bet is to use a cloud-based service, like Google Photos or Dropbox (or both), that will take your photos with you on any device, regardless of platform. As for texts, the same holds true if you use WhatsApp or GroupMe instead of SMS. Once you’ve gotten your app and Google account situation squared away, you’ll want to link some of your other accounts to your phone for seamless integration down the line. Just head to Settings > Accounts, select Add account, and enter your info for Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, Skype, and whatever else you rely on on the regular. And that’s basically it! You can tinker in the settings to your heart’s content—this is Android, after all—but most of it just amounts to personal preference. One last tip? Keep an eye on Google Now, a personally assistant baked into Android that will learn from your search and location history to serve up timely information and articles. To make sure it’s on, go to Settings > Google > Search & Now, where you can customize the type of cards you see, which notifications you get, and what sort of voice activation you prefer, if any.

You’re about to enter the wonderful world of digital personal assistants. All you have to do is set it up. We can help. After taking your Home from the box and admiring its fine styling, download the Google Home app on your phone. Home will walk you through the typical steps of choosing a language, setting up the Wi-Fi, that sort of thing. You can do this in your sleep. Before long, the app wil ask where in your home you are placing your Home. Choose someplace accessible, like the bedroom or living room. Once that’s done, the app will prompt you to sign in to your Google account. This lets Home tap your calendar, your email, your flights and so much more, so Home can answer you when you ask, “OK, Google — what time is my interpretive dance class?” Want to use Home to play music? Of course you do. You’ll need a Chromecast, Chromecast Audio to make it work. Open the Home app and tap Menu in the upper left corner. Then choose More Settings>TV’s and Speakers to add the device. With that, you can enjoy the convenience of playing music or watching TV without doing anything more than saying, “OK, Google…” from the comfort of your couch. Connect your smart lights to Google Home as well. For all the Philips Hue or Samsung SmartThings owners out there, you have full control when the lighting systems are connected with Assistant. “Okay Google, change the color of light in the living room.” This is perfect when you are stuck cooking and your date is coming over in ten minutes.

This slick little gadget is your first step toward creating a smarter home. Now that you’ve got one, Alexa will help you do all kinds of amazing things, like order a pizza, summon an Uber, and tell you how to mix a perfect Manhattan. What she won’t do is set up your Echo. Don’t worry. It’s dead simple. First, make sure your Echo is charged. All set? Great. Turn it on and set up the WiFi connection by installing the Alexa app on your phone. Fire up the app, and it’ll walk you through configuring your Echo. No, really. It’s just that easy. The cool thing about Alexa is she learns from you. The more questions you ask, the smarter she gets. Use your Alexa app to get started by activating those apps and services you use. Definitely choose Uber, to make getting a car as easy as saying, “Alexa, get an Uber.” The Bartender is another useful one. “Alexa, as The Bartender who to make a Tom Collins.” Boom. Done. The first one is Ordering an Uber. Before asking Alexa to order you an Uber home, toggle the Uber app on through the Alexa app and link your Uber account. Now, you can order an Uber in the matter of seconds. Another useful skill is The Bartender, which you can add on the Alexa app. Be sure to spend some time exploring the Alexa app, because you can set up your Echo to do everything from play music and provide weather forecasts to play music, order flowers, and … well, any one of 3,000 tasks, really.

You can find those in the Chrome Web Store. Oh, and you might have heard that Chromebooks only work when they’re hooked up to the internet. That’s not quite true; there are plenty of Chrome apps that have an offline mode as well, including Gmail Offline, Google Drawings, and more.

It’s the gift that keeps on giving you comfortable temperatures and reasonable heating bills. Fortunately, getting it up and running also isn’t as daunting as it might seem. Your first step, which you or your loved one hopefully did before you bought it in the first place, should be to make sure that your wiring is compatible. Otherwise, no dice. Fortunately, Nest has a guide where you can check for yourself. The short version: If you have “thick, stranded wires held together by wire nuts” under your current thermostat cover, this isn’t going to work out. If you have two labels for each wire…it might. Once you’ve confirmed your Nest compatibility, go ahead and shut off power to your HVAC system for safety’s sake. Then you’re ready to roll up your sleeves and do some handiwork. Fortunately, everything you need—including a screwdriver—is included in the box. As far as home upgrades go, it’s pretty straightforward; you just remove your old thermostat, attach the Nest base, connect the wires, and attach the Nest display. There are enough steps within those steps that your best bet is to follow along with this video guide: Or better yet, if you don’t trust yourself with anything electrical, Nest makes it easy to find a professional in your area who can help. Once your Nest is installed and powered on, you’ll need to connect it to your home Wi-Fi network. From there, just use it like you would any other thermostat. Within a few days, Nest will learn your habits and make those adjustments on its own. Physical installation is also just one part of the process. A lot of the “smart” in your smart thermostat comes from hooking it up with your phone. For that, just download the Nest app and create a Nest account. From there, you can use your smartphone (or computer) to change the temperature remotely and keep track of your energy usage. Go Back to Top.

Setting it up should be a breeze, but there are still a few things you’re going to want to consider. Placement We know, we know, you want to just plug it in and turn your brain off. But where you plug in your television matters more than you’d think, and there’s no one-space-fits-all solution. A lot of factors go into how crisp your television’s picture looks that have nothing to do with the settings (we’ll get to those in a minute). You’ll want to sit a specific distance from your set depending on how big it is, the aspect ratio, and the resolution. The basic rule of thumb is to sit within spitting distance of two times the diagonal length of your set. The higher the resolution, the closer you can sit without being able to discern individual pixels. It sounds complicated, but it’s really not so bad. Besides, that’s why charts and viewing calculators like these exist. Calibration and Settings The biggest mistake people make with new TVs is assuming it simply looks the way it does. Not so! There are lots of tweaks you can make right away to ensure an optimal viewing experience. You can find a more in-depth roundup here, but the short version should be enough to get you started. Picture Mode: If this is set to Demo or Showroom, switch it on over to Home or Standard. Aspect Ratio: Set this to “Auto-Adjust” or “Normal” if your picture looks stretched-out or collapsed. Motion Enhancement: This goes by many names (Clear Motion Rate, Motion Flow, etc) but it always results in making everything you watch look like a soap opera. Burn it with fire. Set-Specific Calibration: Your levels! Your levels are usually not ideal out of the box. You can tinker with your contrast and backlight and sharpness on your own, but we’d recommend hitting up the CNET HDTV Picture Setting Forum. There you’ll find precise expert recommendations on most of the top sets on the market, and if you can’t find your specific boob tube, you can post yourself asking for help. Smart Start You could go through and sign into all your Netflix and Hulu and (shudder) Twitter accounts on your smart TV. But also maybe don’t! Get a Roku or a Chromecast or an Apple TV instead. Their interfaces are more reliable, their selections are much larger, and they’re cheap as all heck. It’ll be the best present you ever gave yourself. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Whether it’s a Galaxy S7 or a Google Pixel, the process of getting started with Android is basically the same, and blessedly simple. Once you’ve powered up your device, you’ll be greeted with a series of set-up chores. This is where you’ll set your language preferences, set up your Wi-Fi, enter your Google account details (in other words, your Gmail address and password), and set up a device password and/or fingerprint security, if your phone offers that feature. Being signed into your Google account makes it easy to set up a new phone from there, if you were already on an Android device. Just make sure that your old phone is backed up by going to Settings > Backup & reset. There, you’ll see options for Back up my data (turn this on, if it’s not) and Automatic restore (toggle this to on as well), which combined will mean that not only will your apps be waiting for you on your new phone, their various settings should be as well. There are ways to transfer your photos and text messages as well, but your best bet is to use a cloud-based service, like Google Photos or Dropbox (or both), that will take your photos with you on any device, regardless of platform. As for texts, the same holds true if you use WhatsApp or GroupMe instead of SMS. Once you’ve gotten your app and Google account situation squared away, you’ll want to link some of your other accounts to your phone for seamless integration down the line. Just head to Settings > Accounts, select Add account, and enter your info for Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, Skype, and whatever else you rely on on the regular. And that’s basically it! You can tinker in the settings to your heart’s content—this is Android, after all—but most of it just amounts to personal preference. One last tip? Keep an eye on Google Now, a personally assistant baked into Android that will learn from your search and location history to serve up timely information and articles. To make sure it’s on, go to Settings > Google > Search & Now, where you can customize the type of cards you see, which notifications you get, and what sort of voice activation you prefer, if any.

Blue Sky Innovation Technology How Apple alienated Mac loyalists Mac Pro Noah Berger / Bloomberg Philip Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple, introduces the Mac Pro during a launch event in San Francisco on Oct. 23, 2013.  Philip Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple, introduces the Mac Pro during a launch event in San Francisco on Oct. 23, 2013.  (Noah Berger / Bloomberg) Mark GurmanBloomberg To die-hard fans, Apple's Macintosh sometimes seems like an afterthought these days. Mac upgrades, once a frequent ritual, are few and far between. The Mac Pro, Apple's marquee computer, hasn't been refreshed since 2013. The affordable and flexible Mac mini was last upgraded in 2014. And when a new machine does roll out, the results are sometimes underwhelming, if not infuriating, to devotees. In October, after more than 500 days without an update, Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro, with a slimmer design and louder speakers. The laptop garnered mostly favorable reviews from the technology press but grumbles from creative types, a key constituency, who said the device under-performed rival products. Interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company's software team. They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the roll-out of new computers.

Apple unveiled long-awaited updates to its Mac computers Thursday, aiming to spark consumer interest in a product line often overshadowed by newer gadgets like the iPad and iPhone. The breakout feature is, as widely speculated, a new touch-sensitive panel on the MacBook Pro, Apple's top-of-the-line... (Tribune news services) While the Mac generates about 10 percent of Apple sales, the company can't afford to alienate professional designers and other business customers. After all, they helped fuel Apple's revival in the late 1990s. In a stinging critique, Peter Kirn, founder of a website for music and video creators, wrote: "This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines." If more Mac users switch, the Apple ecosystem will become less sticky-opening the door to people abandoning higher-value products like the iPhone and iPad. People now have more options. Microsoft, once derided by Mac loyalists for its clunky, buggy software, offers Windows 10, which provides the tablet type functionality Apple pioneered with the iPad. Microsoft's Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality and a well-reviewed creative paint program aimed at the Mac's audience. Sensing an opportunity, Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a "disappointment" and said more users than ever were switching to its Surface laptops. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. However, the company has said the Macintosh remains one of its most important products and denies it takes a back seat to other gadgets. Four years ago at Apple's annual developer conference, marketing chief Phil Schiller pledged to keep the computer front and center in the company's product arsenal. "Nobody turns over their entire line as quickly and completely as we do at Apple," Schiller said. "We're really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick so you can get the exact product you need." Two years later, the company held a 30th birthday party for the Macintosh, a splashy event that featured a OneRepublic concert at Apple's Cupertino, California headquarters. The company also created a website celebrating the Mac's history. Nokia sues Apple to escalate mobile-patent licensing battle Nate Lanxon, Ian King and Joel Rosenblatt Nokia sued Apple saying the iPhone maker infringed several mobile patents, turning simmering tension between the companies into a bitter public legal battle on multiple fronts. The Espoo, Finland-based company said Apple agreed to license patented inventions in 2011 but has refused to extend those... Nokia sued Apple saying the iPhone maker infringed several mobile patents, turning simmering tension between the companies into a bitter public legal battle on multiple fronts. The Espoo, Finland-based company said Apple agreed to license patented inventions in 2011 but has refused to extend those... (Nate Lanxon, Ian King and Joel Rosenblatt) To be fair, Apple depends on Intel Corp., which still makes key chips for Macs. Like the rest of the PC industry, Apple's innovation and product cycles are sometimes constrained by when Intel produces new chips-a process that's getting more difficult. Making a laptop stand out is also harder these days. But when Apple has tried to leapfrog the competition, it has fallen short. Take the company's attempt to create a longer-lasting battery for the MacBook Pro. Apple engineers wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life. In the run-up to the MacBook Pro's planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The change required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job, meaning work on other Macs languished, the person said. The new laptop didn't represent a game-changing leap in battery performance, and a software bug misrepresented hours of power remaining. Apple has since removed the meter from the top right-hand corner of the screen. In the Mac's heyday, people working on new models could expect a lot of attention from Ive's team. Once a week his people would meet with Mac engineers to discuss ongoing projects. Mac engineers brought prototypes to Ive's studio for review, while his lieutenants would visit the Mac labs to look at early concepts. Those visits have become less frequent since the company began focusing more on more-valuable products like the iPhone and iPad, and the change became even more obvious after the design team's leadership was shuffled last year, according to a person familiar with the situation. In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple re-organized its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power. That's part of a broader shift toward making Macs more like iPhones. Apple prioritizes features, like thinness and minimal ports, that sell its iPhones and iPads, which generated about 75 percent of revenue this year. Those are contrary to professional needs, like maximum computing power. Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook used the iPhone's Lightning connector, although this was ditched for a more standard USB-C port. There was even a gold MacBook Pro planned, but this was shelved because the color didn't look good on such a large product. The inside story of Apple's $14 billion tax bill Gaspard Sebag, Dara Doyle and Alex Webb "The Maxforce" is the European Union team that ordered Ireland to collect billions of euros in back taxes from Apple Inc., rattled the Irish government, and spurred changes to international tax law.

"The Maxforce" is the European Union team that ordered Ireland to collect billions of euros in back taxes from Apple Inc., rattled the Irish government, and spurred changes to international tax law. You'd think it might have earned the name by applying maximum force while investigating alleged... (Gaspard Sebag, Dara Doyle and Alex Webb) In recent years, Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning designers and engineers must work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision. Engineers are now "asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable," a person familiar with the matter said. When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end, Apple shipped the laptop in 2015, months after its 2014 goal. For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy). The update instead included a new rose gold color option alongside a standard speed increase. The internal turmoil has taken a toll. More than a dozen engineers and managers working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams or other companies in the past year and a half, said people familiar with the situation. Some were looking for a less all-consuming work environment, while others felt the future of Mac hardware was unclear in a world of iPhones and iPads. In 2013, Apple launched a redesigned Mac Pro, a black cylinder with bright white LED lights. It was a powerful desktop machine created partly to cast a halo over the entire Macintosh lineup. The Mac Pro was also the first Apple computer in years to be assembled in the U.S. Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused production headaches though. The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome beveled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on, the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. The political environment is tougher for such a move now. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump hammered Apple for building most of its products overseas and since his election he has pushed other companies to keep some jobs in the U.S. Still, Apple hasn't given up on Macs. In a recent company Q&A session, employees asked whether Mac desktop computers remain strategically important. "We have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that," Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said, according to a transcript of the discussion obtained by Bloomberg News. The latest MacBook Pro has a "Touch Bar," a thin touchscreen built into the keyboard that lets users quickly access app shortcuts, change system settings, and pick emojis. The laptop also has Touch ID to speed up online purchases and a giant trackpad for easier gesture control. Apple designers are already exploring standalone keyboards with the touch strip and a fingerprint reader for desktops. Apple will decide whether to release these based on how well the features do on the MacBook Pro. Mac fans shouldn't hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. Cue the outrage. Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Apple Inc. Apple iPhone Microsoft Corporation Microsoft Surface Intel Corp.

Our new stockbroker advises us to sell 100 of our 200 shares of Apple and all of our Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF shares. He wants us to buy shares of Digital Realty Trust and General Dynamics with the proceeds. Please tell us what you think of these trades. — LS, Oklahoma City Dear LS: Money is the root of all wealth, and your broker may have picked the right stocks to participate in the Trump economy and increase your wealth. What took you so long to sell that bond fund? Bond funds will surely perform poorly in a market with rising interest rates, and Apple’s future growth may be disappointing because the company has lost some of its core. Digital Realty (DLR-$95) is a real estate investment trust. REITs have been laggards since October because investors fear that higher interest rates will infect dividends and earnings growth. Logically, that makes sense; higher rates mean higher borrowing costs, which translate into lower earnings. Well, I’ve been a serious investor for 54 years and observed that REITs actually perform well during periods of rising rates. That’s logical, too, because higher rates often follow improving economic growth, which translates into higher occupancy rates, making it easier for REITs to raise rents. Although, in today’s market economy, I’d shy away from hotel REITs, which are facing a glut of new construction plus competition from Airbnb. And stay away from apartment REITs, especially those that are required to include low-income housing units in their upscale properties to qualify for zoning and mortgage money. Your broker’s recommendation of Digital Realty seems to be spot on. DLR owns, acquires, develops and manages technology-related properties, including internet gateway data centers and technology manufacturing facilities. DLR owns 162 properties in 11 countries, spanning four continents, and boasts a 92.5 percent occupancy rate. The $3.52 dividend, yielding 3.7 percent, has been raised in each of the past 10 years, and revenues have exploded to $2.1 billion in 2016 from $281 million in 2006. Earlier this year, DLR acquired an $875 million portfolio from Equinix, which included eight high-quality data centers in London, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt. And the 692 clients using these centers are new customers for DLR. DLR continues to see revenue growth on the Continent, even with Britain’s decision to exit the European Union. Meanwhile, net profit margins have impressively improved in each of the past 10 years, from 7.5 percent in 2006 to an expected 14.3 percent this year; and some analysts expect 18 percent by 2021, when DLR’s revenues may reach $3 billion. This is a solid growth REIT! Vanguard, American Funds, BlackRock, Fidelity, State Street and Bank of America probably agree, because they own 35 percent of DLR’s 160 million shares. This is a grand issue paying a fine dividend, and Wall Street thinks it could trade at the $130 level in the coming four years. Buy it. General Dynamics (GD-$175) is a $31 billion aerospace and defense company with 101,000 employees. Its information systems and technology business group provides technologies, products and services that support a wide range of secure mobile communications systems. Its marine systems group designs, builds and supports submarines and surface ships for the U.S. Navy. Its combat systems group is a global leader in tracked and wheeled military vehicles, and it also produces high-performance weapons systems and munitions. Finally, GD’s aerospace group has a solid reputation for superior aircraft design, quality, performance and reliability. All this morphs into potentially impressive revenue and earnings growth. The $3.04 dividend yields 1.9 percent and has been raised in each of the past 18 years. Net profit margins of 9.4 percent are at their highest level, and long-term debt has declined by over 50 percent in the past few years. Analysts believe that defense spending will be encouraged by the Trump administration, and GD looks to be the best pure-play company among defense contractors, with a return on equity over 25 percent. Some expect GD to split 3-for-1 in 2017 and foresee shares of the split stock trading between $80 and $85. Buy it. Malcolm Berko addresses questions about stocks. Reach him at P.O.

The latest comes from Consumer Reports, which refrained from recommending Apple’s newest laptop for the first time ever — and Apple is working with the organization to figure out what went wrong. More: Apple’s first 2016 MacBook Pro design failed tests, leading to poorer battery Consumer Reports was generally positive about the 2016 MacBook Pro’s display quality and performance. The machines fell down in battery performance, however, an area that has been a complaint of numerous buyers (apparently the result of the choice of a lesser design). According to Consumer Reports’ testing, the most significant issue with battery life wasn’t specifically how long the computers would run before shutting down but rather their inconsistent battery life. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, for example, ran for 16 hours, 12.75 hours, and 3.75 hours on subsequent tests. The 13-inch version without Touch Bar ran for 19.5 hours and 4.5 hours in different trial runs, and the 15-inch machine showed a range from 8 to 18.5 hours. More: MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar review The organization notes that laptops usually vary by less than five percent between tests; Consumer Reports said it was able to replicate the MacBook Pro’s inconsistent results via repeated testing. The reviewers requested a response from Apple and at first received a typical canned statement: “Any customer who has a question about their Mac or its operation should contact AppleCare.” Apple Vice President of Marketing Phil Schiller responded via Twitter Friday evening that Apple is taking things a little more seriously than that, however: Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data. https://t.co/IWtfsmBwpO — Philip Schiller (@pschiller) December 24, 2016 Consumer Reports cannot be faulted for its testing methodologies, which seem rigorous. The group upgraded its test machines to MacOS Sierra 10.12.2 and tested again to determine if Apple had resolved any battery issues in the latest update. The results were the same. Apparently, similar concerns about the 2016 MacBook Air’s battery life are not without merit. While lower battery life could be expected given their smaller battery capacity versus previous MacBook Air models, the incredibly inconsistent results suggest a problem — one Apple is hopefully working to resolve. Updated on 12-24-2016 by Mark Coppock: Added Phil Schiller’s response. What’s the best MacBook for your money? Hint — you can forget the Touch Bar Apple’s newest MacBook Pro is only slightly faster than previous models Can Apple’s new MacBook Pro 13 keep pace with Dell’s XPS 13?

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple to work with Consumer Reports to figure out MacBook Pro battery issues Yoni Heisler BGR NewsDecember 24, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share On one of the busiest shopping days of the year, Consumer Reports dropped a bombshell of a report where, for the first time in history, it was unable to give Apple’s MacBook Pro a ‘buy’ recommendation. The root of the problem is that Consumer Reports found battery life on Apple’s new notebook to be wildly inconsistent. Don't Miss: The best TV shows on Netflix you’ve never heard of While testing all three of Apple’s next-gen MacBook Pro models, Consumer Reports saw battery life fluctuate between 19.5 hours on the high-end and 4.5 hours on the low-end. All the more curious is that CR’s testing involved loading up a continuous stream of web pages in a browser, hardly a test designed to put a machine through the ringer. In the wake of the above report, some have been quick to call CR’s methodology into question. Indeed, the erratic results CR encountered prompted many people to wonder why the publication didn’t take a closer look at their own testing methods. To this point, Rene Ritchie of iMore writes: Those results make very little sense and I’d take apart my chain, link by link, until I found out what was going on. I’d check and re-check my tests, I’d watch the systems like a hawk, and I’d do everything possible to find what was causing the variance. I’d even — gasp — try testing different machines and something other than web pages to see if that revealed more information. Inconsistent results from battery life tests, for responsible publications, aren’t a reason to rush out a headline in time for the holidays. They’re a reason to start questioning everything, and to diligently retrace every step along the way, until you can get repeatable, reputable results. This is a valid point, though we should also point out that user complaints about MacBook Pro battery life began to surface well before Consumer Reports’ review came out. Regardless, Apple at the very least isn’t keeping its head in the sand. In a tweet sent out late on Friday, Apple executive Phil Schiller said that the company is working with Consumer Reports in order to figure out what exactly is the root of the problem. Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data. https://t.co/IWtfsmBwpO — Philip Schiller (@pschiller) December 24, 2016 That said, hopefully Apple will be able to figure out what’s going on sooner rather than later. Even if we dismiss Consumer Reports’ findings out of hand, the fact remains that many MacBook Pro users have found battery life on Apple’s new flagship notebook to be oddly inconsistent.

By Charlie Osborne for Zero Day | December 22, 2016 -- 17:53 GMT (09:53 PST) | Topic: Security Roy Zipstein | Apple Apple has given app developers more time to turn on App Transport Security (ATS) after originally insisting that software submitted to the App Store utilize the feature by the beginning of 2017. According to a brief note posted on the Apple developer website on Wednesday, ATS, first introduced in iOS 9 and OS X v10.11, will now not become mandatory for apps to support by the 1 January 2017. Instead, Apple has decided to give developers "additional time to prepare" for the switch and so has extended the original deadline. ATS is a feature of Apple's iOS and OS X operating systems which ensure that applications do not load resources over HTTP connections, which are not secure and may be eavesdropped on by attackers. Instead, ATS requires that resources are loaded through HTTPS, a secure communication protocol often used by other services including online banks and e-commerce websites which encrypts data through Transport Layer Security Layer (TLS). Back in June at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), the tech giant revealed that the security feature would become non-negotiable by January 1, 2017. Currently, ATS is enabled by default but app developers do have the option of disabling the feature. More security news Encryption backdoors are against US national interest, say lawmakers Facebook received national security letter for customer details in 2015 Mass internet surveillance is unlawful say judges in blow to Snoopers' Charter Why Windows 10 users have better anti-virus protection "It [ATS] improves privacy and data integrity by ensuring your app's network connections employ only industry-standard protocols and ciphers without known weaknesses," Apple states in the firm's ATS developer notes. "This helps instil user trust that your app does not accidentally leak transmitted data to malicious parties." While developers can still create exceptions to the rule and do not have to implement ATS for every transfer, the company recommends that HTTPS should be used exclusively to protect user privacy and data. In 2015, Google faced criticism after bringing the spotlight onto methods to create exceptions for apps to connect to insecure domains -- for the sake of advertising -- despite ATS. While Apple already provided the way to do so in the developer notes, Google was accused of placing advertising above what could be construed as user privacy and interests. No new deadline has been set for developers to utilize ATS, but the iPad and iPhone maker has promised an update when a new date has been confirmed. 2016 Holiday gift guide: Top tech, gadgets...

Several Withings iOS-compatible products — mostly health-related connected accessories — have been available at Apple Stores for nearly two years as part of a retail alliance, AppleInsider reported on Saturday. The Withings product sales continued even after the company was acquired by Nokia in April for nearly $190 million. The Withings brand was integrated into Nokia’s Digital Health unit. “Now, the devices made by the Nokia subsidiary are no longer listed on Apple’s website. Previously, Apple carried a wide range of iOS-compatible Withings devices in its retail stores, including the ‘Body Cardio Scale’ and ‘Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor,'” the report added. Five years after Apple and Nokia settled a lawsuit, the tech giants have again locked horns over patents with Apple filing an anti-trust lawsuit against third-party companies Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) that act on Nokia’s behalf, and the Finland-based firm suing Apple directly earlier this week. Nokia filed a suit in Europe and the US, claiming Apple is still infringing on Nokia patents. The lawsuit covers 32 patents, including display, user interface, software and video-coding technology. Nokia said that since settling the initial case, Apple has “declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other [parts] of its patented inventions, which are used by many Apple products.” In its lawsuit, Apple argued that Nokia already has agreements to license its patents for fair and reasonable terms, also know as “FRAND” (Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory). “But Nokia is transferring these patents to PAEs in order to aggressively pursue money,” Apple argued. According to the Cupertino-based tech giant, Nokia has been conspiring with PAEs patent assertion entities (Acacia Research and Conversant Property Management) in an “illegal patent transfer scheme” to wring money out of Apple because Nokia’s cell phone business is failing. According to the AppleInsider report, Apple has now “expunged all mention of Withings and its product line from the Apple.com online retail database”. “Whether or not the recent Withings removal is related to Nokia’s shady legal dealings has yet to be confirmed, but Apple has in the past used its retail might as a retaliatory weapon,” the report added. In 2011, the two companies settled a patent fight over smartphone technology through a licensing agreement that committed Apple to make a one-time payment to the company and to pay regular royalties in the future, media reported. The companies also agreed to withdraw complaints against each other with the International Trade Commission over the use of intellectual property.

X How to . . . move (almost) everything to your new phone Sun, Dec 25, 2016, 05:19 Updated: Sun, Dec 25, 2016, 08:00 Ciara O'Brien Photograph: iStock         It’s Christmas morning and you’ve just got your shiny new phone. You’ve got the new SIM card sorted (if you need it). But how do you transfer all your photos, contacts, email and music to your new device? And just how easy is it to move from Android to iOS and vice versa? Read on… First, a word of warning. Regardless of what system you are moving to, back up everything on your mobile phone first. That way if something goes wrong, you can always get your information back. Also, don’t give away or reset your old phone until you are happy that all your information and content has been saved to your new phone. iOS to iOS Apple makes it very simple to switch to a new phone. If you haven’t got automatic backups to the cloud switch on your iPhone, you need to back up the phone to the cloud first or connect it to iTunes and back everything up to your laptop through iTunes. Depending on which option you choose, there will be certain things you will still have to redownload. With iCloud backups, for example, you won’t be able to back up things that are already in the cloud, such as your photos (if you use iCloud Photo Library), Touch ID settings, and your iCloud Music Library and App Store content. Music or apps you bought through iTunes can be redownloaded if needed, and the backup should take care of app data. With iTunes backups, you’ll have to redownload iTunes and App Store content, unless you transfer purchases during your backup when prompted. You will also have to resync your music, videos and books you imported to your device through iTunes, and set up Touch ID again. Health, activity and keychain data will only be backed up if you choose encrypted backups. ADVERTISEMENT Once you have the backup sorted, it’s simply a case of telling iCloud (or iTunes) to hand over the backup. Through iCloud: Turn on your new device. You should see a “Hello” screen. Follow the on-screen prompts until you reach the wifi screen. Log into your local wifi network and follow prompts until you get to the Apps & Data screen. Tap Restore from iCloud Backup>Next. You’ll be prompted to sign in with your Apple ID, and then choose a backup. You may be prompted to sign into iTunes or the App Store. Once you’ve done this, the backup will start to install on your device. Leave it connected to wifi until everything has downloaded and you are happy all your content is there. Through iTunes: Switch on the new phone and wait for the “Hello” screen. Follow the on-screen prompts until you reach the Apps & Data screen. Choose Restore from iTunes Backup>Next. Connect your new iPhone to the PC where you backed up your old phone. Open iTunes and click on your device icon. You’ll be shown a screen with the option to restore backup, and shown a list of backups available. Yours will (most likely) be the most recent backup available. Then walk away, have a cup of tea, catch up on some Netflix and let the software do its work. You can then sync your iPhone with iTunes to get any content - music, movies, etc - that didn’t find their way back. This week we’re talking about . . . toys that spy on you Last minute tech gifts – plus where to find them today Bitcoin heads for biggest weekly jump since June Android to iOS Given that Android and iOS are both trying to poach each other’s customers, there is no surprise that changing your phone from one to the other has become a simpler process. In 2015, Apple introduced a new app, Move to iOS, that would help to shift Android customers to Apple more quickly and easily. If your new device is running iOS 9 or greater - we’re up to iOS 10 now so it should - and your old Android device is Android 4.0 or greater, you can use the app to move everything across. Go to the Google Play store on your Android phone and search for Move to iOS. Install the app. On your new iPhone, begin the setup for the phone from the “Hello” screen. But when you get to the Apps & Data page, select Move Data from Android. On your Android device, open the Move to iOS app. Tap Continue, check out the terms and conditions and tap Agree>Next. On your iOS device, you’ll see a screen called Move from Android. Tap continue, then wait for the code to appear. Enter the code on your Android device, and you’ll be directed to Transfer Data screen. Select the content you want to move - contacts, message history, photos, mail, calendars, free apps if available - then tap next, and leave the two devices to do their work. Wait until the loading bar on your iPhone finishes, regardless of what your Android device tells you. Once everything has transferred, continue to set up your iOS device through the onscreen prompts. iOS to Android You can bring your photos, music and contacts with you from iOS to Android, though any paid apps will unfortunately be left behind. To backup your images, all you need to do is download Google Photos. You will get 15GB of space between all your Google services, including Google Drive, if you want to keep the photos at their original resolution; accept a little compression and you can back up unlimited images to your Google account through Google Photos. Open the Google Photos app. If you have a Gmail account, sign in to the service with that username and password. Clink Menu in the top left corner, then select Settings>Backup & Sync and turn on backup & sync. All your photos will be uploaded to the cloud. ADVERTISEMENT To backup your iTunes music, you will need access to a PC where you have your iTunes account. Download Play Music manager here and install it on your PC. You will need to sign in with your Google ID. During setup, you will be asked where you store your music. Choose iTunes, and select upload all songs and playlists. Once you have it all installed and ready to go, you can upload up to 50,000 songs to your account, which can be accessed on any device, and you can still use your iTunes account if you wish. Contacts are the other thing everyone needs. As an iPhone user you’ll likely have been using iCloud to keep your contacts synced, but you can transfer them to Google. On a desktop PC or laptop, open iCloud.com and log in with iCloud ID. Choose Contacts, which will open your list of numbers and email addresses saved to your account. Choose All Contacts, and click on the gear icon in the bottom left corner. Choose Select All. Then click the gear icon again, and select Export vCard. All your contacts will now be saved as a VCF file, which you can upload directly to your Google account. Log into your Google account on your PC. Go to Google.com/contacts and select Import from the menu on the lefthand side of the screen. Choose the location of the VCF file you saved, and click Import. You will now see a list of contacts in your Google account. Android to Android If you are moving to a new Android handset, it can be a relatively simple procedure. When you start the setup of your new handset, many will ask if you want to restore your information from a backup, and give you the option of specific backups in a drop down menu. That should bring settings, app data and so on over to your new phone. To make sure it is enabled on your old phone, go to Settings>Backup and reset and select back up my data. That will back up your phone to the cloud. Contacts and photos are likely to already be saved in your Google account, but if not, you can sync all your contacts on your old phone by going to Settings>Accounts>Google and choose your Gmail account address. Check Sync contacts is checked. You can also force a sync by pressing Sync Now. Images that are on your phone are probably already saved to Google Photos, but if not, you can set it up easily. If Google Photos isn’t included on your handset, download the app from the Play Store. Open the Google Photos app and tap the menu icon. Tap Settings>Back up & sync. Turn it on. To do an immediate backup, click Backup & sync>back up all. If all else fails, you can transfer contacts, photos, videos and other content by Bluetooth, although it can be a time consuming project.

By Emily Bary October 17, 2016 Text Size Regular Medium Large You wouldn’t put discount tires on your new Tesla, so maybe you’re wary of using budget accessories for your fancy Apple products. But fear not, you don’t actually need to splurge on Apple’s own overpriced chargers and cables to take proper care of your iDevices. I learned that the hard way last week after dropping more than $300 on various Apple accessories for my new apartment, only to later find high-quality knock-offs on Amazon for only $125. It’s no secret that Amazon offers cheaper versions of most tech essentials, but many break easily, charge slowly, or pose safety hazards. Still, there are bargain cables and adapters that work like the originals and won’t break the bank. Here are four knock-offs that will save you money, and one Apple accessory where it’s worth it to splurge on the brand name. I ended up buying four USB power adapters from Apple, including a 12W one that charges the iPad efficiently. This came to $76, or $19 each. Here’s where I could have saved big: Barron’s has tested a $24 5-port USB charger from Anker for a year and found that it holds up well and charges devices quickly. The adapter plugs into the wall and can charge up to five devices at once while providing each one with the maximum amount of power that the device accepts. And, it only uses up a single wall outlet. I’d need to use up three outlets to charge my iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch at the same time, which would require a power strip, an additional cost, if I wanted them all to charge by my bed. Even without the power strip, I would have saved $50 by going with Anker’s cheaper, all-in-one solution. Lightning cables can be tricky. Third-party ones wear easily, but then again, so do Apple’s own cables. The key thing is to buy an Apple-certified cord, since others might damage your device or fail to charge it. Anker makes a popular one for $10, about half the price of Apple’s. I like charging my phone in a dock when it’s on my desk, so I can more easily see the phone screen while getting work done. Apple’s lightning dock costs $49, but the lightning cable and optional adapter are separate. For $20, I could have gotten G-Cord’s well-reviewed aluminum charging station for the iPhone, with an Apple-certified lightning cable included. The dock isn’t as spiffy as Apple’s, because it has G-Cord’s logo displayed on the front, but it is aluminum and it would have saved me $30. I also needed two HDMI cables for Apple TVs. Here there is absolutely no reason to buy the $19 Apple ones. Amazon’s 5-star cords come in at $9 dollars each. I’d save about $20 when buying two. Amazon sells cheap knock-offs of my MacBook Pro charger, for a little more than $25 instead of the $79 Apple charges. In this case, though, stick with the Apple version. Given how much power a laptop charger demands, it’s worth the extra cash to stick with a reputable company for safety reasons. As for Apple Watch chargers, there don’t appear to be too many third-party ones offered, and you don’t save much by getting one. Poweradd makes an Apple Watch stand that comes with a charging cable and costs about the same as Apple’s version. While the stand might be a nice touch, stick with Apple here too.

It also calculated a tax underpayment of €13bn, which minister for finance Michael Noonan has politely refused to pursue. The decision characterised Ireland, in the eyes of our fellow Europeans, as the union’s primary tax haven. Ireland is to appeal the commission finding, so too Apple. Yet the damage has been done. Finance had tried to soften up expectations with a raft of media stories predicting a much lower bill. Vestager, the 48-year-old former deputy prime minister of Denmark, who famously rode her bicycle to visit the Danish queen and is said… Want to read more?

Apple appears to have pulled the accessories in the last day or two, eliminating Withings products like the Body Cardio Scale, the Smart Body Analyzer, and the Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor. When searching for these products on Apple's site, they are no longer listed as available for purchase. Apple has stopped offering all Withings products because Withings is owned by Nokia following a spring 2016 purchase worth an estimated $192 million. The Withings brand has been integrated into Nokia's Digital Health unit and is led by Cedric Hutchings, formerly the CEO of Withings. A cached version of the listing for the Withings Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor, no longer available from Apple.com Earlier this week, Apple filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing Nokia and several patent assertion entities of illegally transferring patents to attempt to extort excessive royalty fees from the Cupertino company. Apple had established FRAND (Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory) deals with Nokia, but by transferring patents to patent holding companies, additional royalties can be demanded. In response, Nokia filed 40 patent infringement lawsuits against Apple across 11 countries, accusing the Cupertino company of failing to establish licensing deals for Nokia patents that cover displays, user interface, software, antenna, chipsets, and video coding. According to Apple, Nokia has been conspiring with patent assertion entities (Acacia Research and Conversant Property Management) in an "illegal patent transfer scheme" to wring money out of Apple because Nokia's cell phone business is failing. Nokia, meanwhile, says that it has not been able to reach a licensing agreement with Apple and must defend its rights.

If a company is suing you, and doing it in the way described in this article, you are not going to devote space on your shelves, in your retail stores, to that company. Simple.

EDIT: Releasing an OS update that blocks them from working on with iPhones would be petty. Not selling them is totally different.

Rating: 23 Votes britboyj 1 week ago Most companies tend not to enjoy funding lawsuits held against them... It's not about "throwing the toys out with the pram," it's about preventing conflicts of interest. Rating: 22 Votes robeddie 1 week ago I know it's their right, but at the same time, it seems so childish. And let's face it, Apple is suing other companies left and right too. In fact, haven't they battled Samsung? They should cut all ties with Samsung too (yeah, right). Rating: 18 Votes Stella 1 week ago Apple throwing its toys out of the stroller. Grow up. Apple store is the last place I'd personally buy a fitness gadget. Rating: 14 Votes kingchevy7 1 week ago People are calling this childish behavior????? Here's an analogy: You have an employee. That employee tries to scheme against your company to create a lawsuit against your company. Firing the dude is gonna be the first thing you do... It's not childish to pull product from a company that's clearly not playing nice. Think before you post people. Rating: 10 Votes bbeagle 1 week ago Wow. All these anti-Apple trolls. Your neighbor borrows your lawnmower. He injures himself while using it and sues you. Is it petty to not allow him to use your trimmer? Same thing with Apple here: I'm not going to help you if you're trying to hurt me. It would be petty if Apple was trying to pull Nokia stuff from Amazon with some lawsuit.... but they're not... just pulling it from their OWN stores.

Skip the usual, and give the season a bit of a twist with these options, and as always, take care out there and give your designated driver a hug. Mulled white wine: traditionally made with red, last year the folks at Vin Amité introduced me to mulled white. Lighter in style, use chardonnay or viognier, and mull with star anise, fresh orange peel (use the slices for garnish), cloves, and maybe a bit of brandy. Eggnog and bourbon: that about sums it up. Replace the rum with a good bourbon for a change. Non-boozy treat? A shot of espresso in a cup of nog, or half nog and half hot chocolate. Hot gin and tonic: a discovery at the newly opened Knotweed at Legend Distilling. The trick is using tonic syrup. An ounce and a half, equal parts gin (more or less), top with hot water and a cinnamon stick. Throw in a lemon slice for vitamin C. Alchocolates: the combo of hot chocolate and a libation, or combo of libations. Don’t be stingy with the whipped cream on top of good hot chocolate with a shot of kirsch, peppermint schnapps, Frangelico. I may try one with the brand new Lady of the Cask brandy from Maple Leaf Spirits this Boxing Day. Okanagan Mimosa: pour a splash of a late harvest wine, preferably a red for some colour, in the bottom of a glass, top with a sparkling wine, maybe a splash of the nearest fruit juice, for your health. My favourite combo: Rustic Roots Santa Rosa sweet plum wine, Bella Wines sparkling rosé (if you can find a bottle) or 8th Generation Confidence. Apple Pie Punch: for the non-imbibers, combine apple cider, ginger ale, apple slices and a cinnamon stick for garnish, and for the kids, turn this into an apple pie float with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Here is a Christmas recipe favourite of mine that I wanted to share Pair with a bottle of Prosecco or a crème de menthe cocktail! Ingredients Two packages (three oz each) lime-flavoured Jell-o 2 cups boiling water 2 cups cold water ¼ teaspoon peppermint extract 1 envelope Dream Whip or one container (4 ½ ounces) Cool Whip 8 cream-filled chocolate cookies (Oreos), finely crushed Dissolve Jell-o in boiling water, then add cold water and peppermint extract. Chill until slightly thickened, about 60-90 minutes. Prepare Dream Whip as directed on package if not using Cool Whip. Measure 1 ¾ cups gelatin and pour into a 9x5 inch loaf pan and chill 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, blend whipped topping into the remaining Jell-o. Carefully spoon 1/3 of creamy mixture into the pan, on top of the Jell-o. Sprinkle half of the cookie crumbs on top. Repeat these layers and spoon the remaining creamy mixture on top. Chill until firm, about four hours. Unmold from the pan, garnish with cookie crumbs if desired. Makes six cups or about 10 servings. Cheers to the season!

The company told developers on Friday, however, that it is extending that deadline. App Transport Security First introduced with iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan, ATS greatly improves device security for Apple customers. It requires apps to use secure network connections over HTTPS, which encrypts that traffic and protects it from third parties. In a short announcement, Apple wrote: “To give you additional time to prepare, this deadline has been extended and we will provide another update when a new deadline is confirmed…” This makes sure that all network communications coming out of iOS is encrypted. And it means that developers will use industry-standard encryption protocols, instead of third-party frameworks. iPhone Encryption Slow Adoption Now that HTTPS is becoming the default standard on the web, Apple wants to do the same for apps. But mobile analytics firm Appthority said that after the technology’s introduction, only 3% of the top 200 apps had support for ATS. At WWDC 2016, Apple said the developers needed to add ATS support to their apps by January 1, 2017. But now the company has changed its mind, and it hasn’t announced a new deadline. This worries CIO, who commented, “It’s hard to know why developers did not meet this deadline. There certainly was adequate time…The fact that they haven’t announced a new date suggests to me that it’s probably not in the next six months.” Absent additional information, that’s a reasonable interpretation of events. We hope, however, that Apple will still push developers to make this change sometime in 2017.

It’s an improvement over the third-party frameworks that developers previously used to implement HTTPS because it ensures that only industry-standard encryption protocols and ciphers are used.

The document includes Apple’s own public PGP key for those verifications. Apple noted that its current PGP key will be valid until May of 2018. PGP, or “pretty good privacy” is one of the most popular encryption schemes in general use today, through both the PGP Corporation and the open source GnuPGP. Apple posted links to both. You can subscribe to Apple’s Security-announce emails at Apple’s website. Check It Out: Apple Posts Its Public Encryption Key, Encourages Customers to Verify Emails Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr Tags: Apple, encryption, GnuPGP, PGP 6 Comments Add a comment JustCause December 23, 2016 Hmmm, has any other company went to this extent? Maybe they should just build this into Mail for macOS and iOS as well as Safari, that would leave only 3rd party apps needing to do anything manually. December 23, 2016 at 8:01 EST PM jbruni December 24, 2016 A public key is not used to encrypt emails (unless you are sending an email to Apple), but to validate the digital signature of the email. For Apple to encrypt emails, they would need your (everyone’s) public keys. December 24, 2016 at 1:01 EST PM jbruni December 24, 2016 Apple is been using PGP-signed emails for their security announcement for many years — at least a decade. The macOS email program supports S/MIME but not PGP/MIME which is really weird. There is obviously a disconnect at Apple. Since Mail supports S/MIME, Apple’s security division could easily sign emails using a certificate issued by Apple’s own CA (certificate authority), rather than having to rely on the end user installing a PGP-compatible client. I’d like to see Apple either use S/MIME thoroughly, and maybe provide a way for end users to easily get certificates (perhaps through AppleIDs?), or embrace PGP/MIME, include GnuPG in macOS, like they do other open-source software, and fully integrate PGP into Mail and Finder. December 24, 2016 at 1:09 EST PM gGrant December 25, 2016 I agree – GPG or something like that should be standard for all user mail. Apple’s Mail apps (all mail apps to be fair, but stick to Apple) should have it standard and transparent to users. I’m pretty sure the OS can send mail without using the app, so all mail services in the OS, for that matter. Our Mail is only for the intended recipient. We don’t want intermediate servers being littered with our plain-text. Anyone might be able to hack them. Now a dose of reality – i wonder if end to end encryption for Mail is actually possible. Is iMessage really encrypted? Recent stories cast doubt on that. December 25, 2016 at 9:15 EST AM gGrant December 25, 2016 …Or routers, then it doesn’t matter if Chinese government companies make routers that leak like a sieve. US routers probably do, too, but nobody worries about that. December 25, 2016 at 9:18 EST AM jbruni December 26, 2016 @gGrant, Apple Mail does support end-to-end encryption if you have exchanged certificates with your intended recipient. If that condition is met, Mail shows a lock icon in the new message window allowing you to encrypt the message using S/MIME. For the technically savvy, I recommend getting a free S/MIME email certificate from startssl.com. This allows you to digitally sign your emails. If more people get certificates, then that increases the ability to encrypt. December 26, 2016 at 11:59 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Why did Apple take down the health-related devices in the middle of the holiday season?  ( Withings ) Advertisement Customers looking to purchase Withings products from Apple's stores will not be able to find the health-related devices, as it looks like Apple has pulled them out. Searches for Withings devices such as the Body Cardio Scale, the Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor, and the Smart Body Analyzer on Apple's online store reveals that the items are no longer listed for sale. Presumably, the products have also been taken down from Apple's physical retail stores all over the world. Why Are Withings Products Being Pulled Out Of Apple Stores? Health-related devices such as those being produced by Withings are great holiday gifts, so why would Apple take them down from its physical and online stores? According to a Mac Rumors report, the reason behind the disappearance of Withings products in Apple stores is that the health device company is owned by Nokia, which purchased the accessory maker earlier this year for about $191 million. Withings has been integrated into the Digital Health unit of Nokia, which is led by former Withings CEO Cedric Hutchings. As reported earlier this week, Apple and Nokia are once again engaged in a patent battle, and it does not make sense that Apple will continue helping sell Withings products when it would benefit a company with which it is currently trading lawsuits. Apple And Nokia Patent Battle Apple and Nokia settled a patent lawsuit back in 2011, wherein Nokia accused Apple of infringing on certain patents that it held. The patents come with fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms, known as FRAND, which allow other companies to use them without needing to pay excessive licensing fees due to the patents being widely used in the tech industry. Despite the patents coming with FRAND terms, Apple eventually relented and agreed to pay a one-time fee to Nokia, along with future royalties. However, it seems that the history between Apple and Nokia will not end there. In the new patent battle between the two companies, Apple filed lawsuits against nine Nokia-aligned patent assertion entities, which are at times called patent trolls. Apple claims that the nine PAEs are working to have Apple pay out as much money as possible through exorbitant licensing requirements for patents that should have FRAND terms. In response, Nokia has filed five lawsuits against Apple for 32 counts of patent infringement. It could not yet be determined how this latest legal battle will play out, but Nokia is already said to be suffering from it. Shares for the company fell by almost 5 percent after the lawsuits were reported, as analysts are concerned that the legal battle with Apple will only delay the royalty payments that the company needs to maintain its profits.

Nokia purchased the Withings line of smart devices earlier this year for around $192 million and has since integrated the company into its smart line of products… The removal was first reported by MacRumors. Apple pulled a similar tactic when its Beats unit went toe to toe with Bose over its NFL exclusivity contract in October 2014 and prior patent disagreements. After things were resolved in December 2014, Bose products returned to the Apple Store shelves. Apple Retail Stores and Online Store represent a significant chunk of online sales and Apple apparently feels that it can use it as a strong arm bargaining chip in these types of negotiations. Sadly, we’re big fans of Withings products over here, which now support HomeKit and of course they are available at other outlets. Apple hasn’t pulled the Withings apps from the App Store yet but it probably wouldn’t hurt to download them if you think you will need them…just in case.

Videos Home Entertainment Movies Movie Reviews Review: Assassin’s Creed December 24, 2016 Entertainment, Movie Reviews, Movies By DAVIN ARUL Related Articles Review: The Great Wall Review: Railroad Tigers Oh, well – it looks like the search for a great movie adaptation of a videogame will have to continue. At first, this lavish, ambitious project based on the Ubisoft action-adventure series of hit games looked like it could have broken the dismal “tradition” of such adaptations being – not to put too fine a point on it – sucky. The good news is that Assassin’s Creed doesn’t suck, on the level of Super Mario Bros or Street Fighter, but it is still somewhat disappointing and suffers from peculiar storytelling choices that result in a flat and totally unsatisfying ending. There’s clearly a wide gulf between the attention paid to the eyebrow-raising action scenes, and the uninspired writing. Deviating a little from the game series, the movie focuses on an all-new character and tweaks the nature of the series’ MacGuffin, the Adam’s Apple – no wait, the Apple of Eden. It retains the basic set-up of having the protagonist faction the Assassins fighting to protect the basic liberties of humanity against the Templars, who want to just dominate everything. The Templars want the Apple because they believe it will allow them to eliminate free will in humanity and thus, there will be no more violence and strife … only mass obedience. ‘Funny how this spear-twirling move always makes my enemies appear … shorter.’ Photos: 20th Century Fox The Assassins are sworn to preserve that most fundamental of human rights – the option to make a total ass (or asshat) of oneself – and have kept the Apple out of the Templars’ hands for centuries. Main dude Callum Lynch (Michael Fassbender) is the descendant of an Assassin named Aguilar (Fassbender again), and the Templars need him to explore his “genetic memory” so that they can find out where the Apple has been hidden. All well and good, if you buy into the premise – heck, if the Templars can pour billions of dollars into inventing a scientific marvel on the level of the Animus, which can pull specific genetic memories out of a person’s nervous system, why the heck do they even need the Adam’s Apple … whatever … to start with? (Similarly, if they are rolling in that much dough, surely they could have invested in some facial recognition software, metal detectors and at least ­airport- level security to prevent the movie’s “duh” ending from coming to pass. Then again, keeping all those Assassins in their Animus research centre under very – VERY – minimal security shows these Templars aren’t so bright in the first place.) OK, you say, then we wouldn’t have an excuse to see Callum relive the escapades of his ancestor and treat us to all those exciting parkour-fuelled chases across Inquisition-era Spanish city rooftops, fight scenes that explode at a breakneck pace, that Leap of Faith moment, and – hello, ladies – all those shirtless Fassbender bits. Basically, then, the whole story of Assassin’s Creed is just a hook on which to hang these admittedly well-done action sequences. But a hook needs to be securely fixed to something in the first place. The result is not the intriguing conflict of opposing ideologies that the filmmakers state was their intent, but a battle of wits between the crafty and the witless. No prizes for guessing who wins. Assassin’s Creed Director: Justin Kurzel Cast: Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons, Michael K. Williams, Brendan Gleeson Hello, ladies.

By Agamoni Ghosh December 24, 2016 06:09 GMT Russian ambassador to Turkey Andrey Karlov killed by assassin IBTimes UK Update: MacReports says the Russian team could not technically hack the 4-digit pass code, however, they have been able to retrieve data from the device by using other means, which they have not divulged. Original report: Russian cyber experts have reportedly helped Turkish authorities in unlocking an iPhone 4s recovered from Mevlut Mert Altintas, the Turkish assassin who gunned down Russian ambassador Andrey Karlov in Ankara earlier this week. The authorities have not revealed what has been found on the phone and whether it is of any use to the investigation, according to MacReports. Earlier, there were conflicting media reports about Apple being asked to unlock the phone. 9 to 5 Mac says that Apple was never requested for any such bypass and Russia offered to attempt to break the four-digit passcode on the recovered iPhone, which it has done successfully. The latest incident is a reminder of the San Bernandino shooting suspect Rizwaan Farook's phone unlocking controversy, in which Apple refused to help the FBI bypass an iPhone 5C belonging to the shooter. However, the iPhone 4s used by Altintas is a rather old model and does not have a Secure Enclave or a Touch ID sensor. A Secure Enclave performs key management for encrypted files, where each encrypted file has a unique key, which in turn is encrypted with another key derived from the device UID and the user's passcode. Karlov was killed by Altintas, an off-duty cop, inside an art gallery while the ambassador was on the podium giving a speech. Altintas used his police ID to gain access to the gallery and shouted "Don't forget Aleppo" after killing the ambassador. He was eventually killed in a shoot-out with Turkish special forces and now authorities are trying to determine whether it was a one man act or if he was affiliated to any group.

Apple’s MacBook Suffering from Battery Inconsistency, Loses Top Recommendation GO Consumer Reports removes recommendation for 2016 MacBook Dec 24, 2016 06:47 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​Apple’s new MacBook series continues causing controversy these days, mostly around the battery life that this upgraded model provides, and now it’s Consumer Reports’ turn to step in and provide its own verdict. In an announcement recently, the organization has revealed that Apple’s 2016 laptop is the first MacBook Pro that doesn’t receive its recommendation, explaining that battery life inconsistency is too much of a problem to be overlooked. Consumer Reports explains that engineers tested three different MacBook Pros: two 13-inch models (one with a Touch Bar and another one without it), as well as a 15-inch model, all of them purchased from the official stores. “In a series of three consecutive tests, the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third. The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for 19.5 hours in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours,” the organization explains, adding that it repeated the tests several times. According to its own testing procedure, Consumer Reports allows a laptop’s battery life to vary by 5 percent from one test to another, but it’s very clear that in the case of the MacBook, the differences were simply huge. Consumer Reports said it performed battery tests on the laptops both before and after updating to macOS Sierra 10.12.2, but no difference was recorded. What’s more surprising, however, is that tests performed with Google Chrome actually led to better battery life, which is somewhat unexpected given the fact that native browsers are typically optimized for efficiency. Battery tech on the new MacBook People close to the matter say the controversy around the battery life of the new MacBook is mostly caused by Apple changing tech at the very last minute, after failing to implement a new battery layout under the hood of the new model. It appears that Cupertino worked with partners on building the MacBook with several battery packs that took the shape of the empty spaces under the case, in an effort to offer a bigger battery without compromising dimensions, the form factor, and the weight. These battery packs were supposed to be connected to each other with flex cables and work just like a single unit. But due to some issues, Apple decided to give up on this new system just before launching the MacBook, and instead picked an old tech that was previously offered on the MacBook as well. As a result, the device comes with new hardware, but with old battery technology, so reduced battery life was more or less to be expected. Of course, the bigger problem is the inconsistency between these tests, mostly when running the same processes on the same devices, but we’ll see what Apple has to say about this and if there’s a way to repair it. #Apple#MacBook#Consumer Reports#battery life subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news How Apple Wanted (But Failed) to Boost Battery Life of Its New MacBook Apple Working on Improved Sound Solutions for Portable Devices, Patent Shows Apple's macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Officially Released with Auto Unlock Improvements Apple Seeds Beta 3 of iOS 10.2, macOS 10.12.2 and tvOS 10.1, Videos App Removed - Updated New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Apple's new 2016 MacBook Pro New Mac Apps Free Download Manager: Download manager and accelerator that can handle HTTP, FTP, and BitTorrent protocols, while also being able to download YouTube content CheckMark Payroll 2017: Enables you to do-it-yourself payrolls and is the ideal solution for accountants, small businesses and professional payroll services.

Apple Pulls Nokia Products from Stores Following Patent Lawsuit GO Withings products no longer up for grabs from Apple Dec 24, 2016 07:03 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​ Apple and Nokia are engaging in a patent war once again, and now Cupertino has decided to pull all products owned by the Finish company from its stores until the legal dispute comes to an end. As a result, customers can no longer purchase Withings products from the Apple Store. Withings is a company that Nokia purchased earlier this year and which offers a number of premium devices, including smart devices like thermometers and scales, all of which connect to iPhones. It’s not clear if Apple actually intends to re-list these products in its stores anytime soon, but this is highly unlikely given the fact that the company is involved in a huge patent dispute with Nokia. As MacRumors notes, apps developed by Withings are still available in the App Store, and there’s only a small chance to see them go, but customers of Withings products are recommended to download them anyway as soon as possible just to be sure. The patent lawsuit Nokia has sued Apple in the United States and in Germany, claiming that the company violates some of its patents covering technologies used on products sold in these markets. Nokia said it has been working with Apple since 2011 to address any patent violations, but more recently, the company has refused to pay for using technologies that are patented by Nokia. “Since agreeing a license covering some patents from the Nokia Technologies portfolio in 2011, Apple has declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other of its patented inventions which are used by many of Apple's products,” Nokia said. “Nokia has created or contributed to many of the fundamental technologies used in today's mobile devices, including Apple products. After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple's use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights,” Ilkka Rahnasto, head of Patent Business at Nokia, said. An official statement from Apple on its decision to pull Withings products from stores is not yet available, but unfortunately, this dispute with Nokia has us, the customers, becoming collateral victims. #Apple#Nokia#Withings#patent war subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news No Joke: iPhone 7 Owners Try to Create Headphone Jack by Drilling Hole in Phone Apple Sued for Wi-Fi Technology Used on the iPhone Apple Sued Because Its iPhone Can Make Phone Calls and Send Emails Apple Sued for Bricking iPhones with Error 53 - Update New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Withings has a large collection of products working with iPhones New Mac Apps Free Download Manager: Download manager and accelerator that can handle HTTP, FTP, and BitTorrent protocols, while also being able to download YouTube content CheckMark Payroll 2017: Enables you to do-it-yourself payrolls and is the ideal solution for accountants, small businesses and professional payroll services.

The top selling band sells for $49 but costs just $2 to make. Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript You likely bought extra bling when you bought your Apple Watch. What you didn't know is just how much money Apple is making off of it. Reuters has learned that nearly a fifth of Apple Watch buyers wind up shelling out for spare bands. The top seller is the $49 black Sport Band made of synthetic rubber. Believe it or not, tech research firm IHS says that only costs Apple about $2 to make. While that doesn't account for the packaging, shipping, and materials costs, that's a whopping profit margin. Experts say buyers are trying to get more versatility out of the Watch. Research firm Slice Intelligence analyzed only bands made and sold by Apple and found that about 17 percent of Watch buyers bought more than one band. Apple's second best-selling band, the Milanese Loop made of woven stainless steel mesh costs $149. The stainless steel alloy Link Bracelet will set you back $449 - that's $100 more than the entry-level Apple Watch itself. Apple is doing what P&G does with Gillette razors - selling the product at a modest price but profiting on the sale of accessories that sport fat margins Apple allows third-party developers to put out their own bands, too. That could dent sales of its own accessories if they succeed. But experts say it's important to offer a wide array of bands to make the Apple Watch a must-have thing. Besides, that extra take from the bands gives Apple another slice of the pie.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this President Trump: An uncertain future for tech industry, digital rights Tech groups push policy priorities for the Trump administration Without tech industry guidance, U.S. may resort to weakening encryption Video Inside Google's Loon and Wing The Electronic Frontier Foundation is keenly worried that President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress will step up surveillance activities and pass laws to curtail electronic rights. As a result, the EFF is advising the tech sector to use end-to-end encryption for every transaction by default, and to scrub logs. "You cannot be made to surrender data you do not have," the EFF said. [To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page.] "We need to start securing our systems now," said Rainey Reitman, director of the EFF's activism team, in an interview. "If we wait until he [Trump] starts putting overbroad government demands on tech companies, they won't have the time to clean up their logs and encrypt data." "It's very clear to us that he is no friend to civil liberties," said Reitman, of Trump. "He will be in a position where he can move bills and support measures and even put out executive orders that can be very detrimental to digital rights." The tech community is wary, generally, of Trump. More than 1,000 people who work at tech firms have signed a pledge, Neveragain.tech , not to help the incoming administration create a database to target people because of race or religion or to facilitate mass deportations. The EFF has assembled evidence it believes justifies this call for action. That includes Trump's call for forcing Apple to open the iPhone owned by one the San Bernardino attackers. The government wanted Apple to hack into the iPhone, something it would not do. Trump's response to Apple was, "Who do they think they are? No, we have to open it up." The FBI ultimately unlocked the phone with help of a third party. Legislation also emerged to broadly compel the tech industry to provide a backdoor to encrypted communications, notably in an effort by Senators Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chair and vice chair, respectively, of the Senate Intelligence Committee. But the White House didn't support it at the time. Reitman believes the encryption issue will emerge again, and a Trump White House may approve backdoor legislation. This "is one of the things to watch out for over the next few months," she said. Many of the big vendors also have large contracts with the government and are seeking pro-industry trade agreements as well. But the industry has also received pushback from its users, particularly in the wake of revelations by Edward Snowden that the government was participating in surveillance efforts. Because of Snowden, "tech actually had to show that they were willing to fight for individual users and were willing to take steps to improve privacy," said Reitman. The EFF has outlined a set of specific recommendations it believes tech firms can take. Some are aimed at specific firms, such as calling on Twitter to enable end-to-end encrypted direct messages. The data the Trump administration could use to track certain groups is already available. Businesses, Facebook being the obvious example, may have databases with details about the religious and ethnic backgrounds of their customers, Reitman said. The effort by some in Silicon Valley to speak out against and fight any effort by tech firms to participate in this data collection will also be up against government contracting. "The Trump administration will always be able to find contractors that are willing to do most anything short of illegal, provided the potential liabilities are realistic," said Ray Bjorklund, who heads federal market research firm BirchGrove Consulting. The government can issue new orders on existing contracts, although terms and conditions can be set that protect both parties, said Bjorklund. The government could also re-open the business for other bidders, he said. Even without the EFF raising its own concerns, the Neveragain.tech effort points to use of data gathering in the Holocaust to illustrate the gravity of the issue. Christopher Browning, a Holocaust researcher who wrote a number of books, said that in many countries, particularly eastern Europe, the Nazis relied on local collaborators to identify local Jews. But in western Europe, especially The Netherlands, "registration of Jews was a key, seemingly innocent, but in retrospect fatal step that made it virtually impossible for those who did register to escape all further measures" short of attempted hiding, he said, in an email response to questions. "In The Netherlands forged papers were particularly difficult, due to the very advanced technology of the bureaucracy in producing ID papers," said Browning. "In contrast, in Athens the ability of the Jewish community to destroy all of its records before the Germans arrived made it very difficult for the Germans to find and identify Jews in southern Greece. Those on the islands, however, were for all practical purposes trapped and thus suffered a much higher fatality rate than those on the southern mainland." "Given that any intensified persecution of minorities in the U.S. would more likely follow the western European rather than eastern European model, then yes, registration is a key, endangering factor," said Browning.

While nothing has been leaked out of Apple’s chambers yet, rumors have been floating around about the iPhone 8 (or iPhone 7s — the name has not been revealed by Apple). Whether Apple will deliver the fireworks with iPhone 8 is not known yet, but going by the rumors, it appears there's a lot to look forward to. Related Stories Apple To Use Samsung Curved OLED Displays? iPhone 8 Rumors: Wireless Charging, All-Glass Design Here are eight expected features of iPhone 8: Curved OLED display: The iPhone is expected to come in three variants — two aluminum body variants just like the iPhone 7/7S and an anniversary edition curved OLED one. The displays for the OLED version would be reportedly supplied by Samsung. The OLED iPhone 8 might have embedded sensors in the display and workable edges like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. No Home button: Apple might finally ditch the home button, which has been there ever since the first iPhone debuted in 2007. Instead, it might have a display-embedded fingerprint sensor. A11 processor: iPhone is expected to come with a 10nm technology-based A11 processor made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. These processors are 30 percent more powerful and 20 percent more battery-efficient than the existing ones. TSMC is expected to start A11 production in April 2017. Wireless charging: iPhone 8 is expected have an all-glass design, which will support fast wireless charging. A glass design is better for wireless charging since it would not leak charge like metal cases. Touch ID, built-in camera: If Apple goes in for an edge-to-edge design it will have to account for the placement of the front camera and the fingerprint sensor. The iPhone 8 is expected to have a camera built into the display along with a Touch ID sensor. So basically, the phone will feel like a single sheet of glass with all the functionalities located inside the display. Iris/facial scanning: iPhone 8 is said to come with enhanced security features — Apple is expected to replace passcode encryption with Iris/facial scanning, which will unlock the phone using input from its camera. The company may reportedly call it a Retina Eye scanner. Multi-sensor camera: The 2017 smartphone is expected to come with a multi-sensor camera, which will have advanced light-sensing capability, resulting in clearer and more colorful images. New form factor: iPhone 8 is expected to sport an entirely new form factor. Apart from a bezel-less display, it is also expected to be thinner than the existing iPhones. The all-glass OLED model is likely to have smudge-free glass. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Under the direction of her father (Jeremy Irons), the company's founder, she is going to place the convicted criminal in her machine known as The Animus. Once attached, she will then attempt to connect him with his blood ancestors, hopefully 15th century Spaniard Aguilar de Nerha, the last man known to have been in contact with a biblical artifact known as the Apple of Eden. Turns out, Aguilar was a trusted member of a fearsome order known as The Assassins, their goal to keep the Apple and its secrets safe from the Knights of Templar. For centuries, they've wanted this artifact, its powers fabled to have the capacity to erase free will thus bending all of humanity to the Templar's thinking. They believe that by zapping this gift from God away from the people of the Earth they will in turn be saving it, eradicating violence forever, but at a cost those in the ranks of The Assassins believe is far too gigantic to be comfortably paid. Based on the popular video game series of the same name, there's certainly no shortage of talent both behind and in front of the camera as far as the epic, centuries-spanning adventure Assassin's Creed is concerned. Reuniting the core creative team behind last year's Shakespeare stunner Macbeth (stars Fassbender and Cotillard, director Justin Kurzel, co-screenwriter Michael Lesslie, composer Jed Kurzel and cinematographer Adam Arkapaw), it isn't like there isn't a lot to be impressed about here. But, much like close-but-no-cigar video game adaptations that have come before it like Duncan Jones' Warcraft and Mike Newell's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, this one can't help but come up a little bit short, failing to deliver an entertaining and involving narrative that warrants even a single solitary ounce of all this fuss. The problem is that none of this, not an ounce of it, makes any logical or practical sense. Having never played the games, I cannot claim how faithful Lesslie, Adam Cooper (Exodus: Gods and Kings) and Bill Collage's (Allegiant) script is to the source material. Be that as it may, this is convoluted even for a video game adaptation, the narrative traipsing back and forth through history with bewildering abandon with no concern whether the pieces are fitting together comfortably. But it's the present day stuff going on inside the Abstergo Industries corporate headquarters that's most idiotic. What's the point of keeping around blood descendants of all these assassins once they've served their usefulness? How does Sofia not see how her invention is being perverted? And, speaking of The Animus, what exactly does it do to those put inside of it? Do they suddenly get super powers, knowing all the skills of their ancestors? Is it like the Matrix and much like Neo once you jack-in are you suddenly gifted the power of kung fu? These are only a handful of the questions that the filmmakers don't bother to even try and answer, but they are arguably the most important ones. The sheer volume of silly lunacies transpiring over the course of the two or so hours the film runs are incalculable, trying to keep track of them all as pointless an exercise as any that can be imagined. Even for a video game movie, this thing is dumb. But, more than that, it doesn't have the good sense to revel in that stupidity, everything treated with a somber seriousness more suitable to Kurzel, Fassbender and Cotillard's last joint project but feels utterly alien and not at all appropriate here. Thing is, Kurzel and his crackerjack production team are far too talented for any of this to fall completely flat. Not only is Jed Kurzel's score magnificent, so is Arkapaw's dynamic cinematography and Christopher Tellefsen's (Moneyball) lyrical editing. Additionally, the action sequences, at least the ones unaided by noticeably obnoxious CG-generated enhancements, most notably the ones taking place during the Spanish Inquisition, are extraordinary, the fluidity of the images made more magnetic thanks to the aggressiveness of the violence. There's a stunning escape and chase sequence through a 15th century city that's an adrenaline-filled triumph, while a third act battle between the Assassins and the Templar-controlled security guards inside The Animus chamber is frankly incredible. Maybe video game movies will never work. Maybe they're so beholden to their source material they can't make the necessary changes required in order to work as a piece of narrative cinema. Seriously, what is there to say when the best of the genre is still the first Resident Evil movie released way back in 2002 that has since spawned five sequels of varying quality ranging from passably okay to astonishingly terrible? Kurzel and company try their hardest to change things, and at times they do come amazingly close to pulling it off. But overall Assassin's Creed is just too laughably nonsensical to be the one to do it. As cool as it all looks every now and then, and as glorious as the action can be, the characters are lifeless and the story is a chaotic nightmare, nothing holding together in ways that could add up to something substantive. This is nothing more than another video game adaptation that fails to rise to the challenge of being reborn for the cinema, and as such is a forgettable also-ran with precious little of merit allowing it to stand out from any of its equally unremarkable brethren.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Apple working with Consumer Reports to investigate MacBook Pro battery issue Apple Apple working with Consumer Reports to investigate MacBook Pro battery issue By Bindu Nair - Dec 24, 2016 Consumer Reports’ shock declaration that the 2016 MacBook Pro was not worthy of a recommendation has quite a stir. The laptop is the first one of its kind to not get the firm’s approval. The surprise result has now prompted Apple SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller to send out a tweet regarding the issue. The company is apparently working with Consumer Reports to understand their battery tests. He also stated that the findings did not match its extensive tests or field data. Apple’s marketing lingo claims that the MacBook Pro can last for up to 10 hours at a stretch. However, numerous customers have taken to online forums to complain about barely getting the notebook to last for 3 hours. The Consumer Reports evaluations further confirms this problem, with results varying wildly from one test to another. Also Read: Apple to launch premium iPhone codenamed Ferrari in 2017 Apple has done little of substance to address the issue publicly so far, apart from getting rid of the time remaining indicator in the latest macOS update. The information appears to have been reporting inaccurate estimates, leading to the brand eliminating it entirely and replacing it with a battery percentage status. Sources told 9to5Mac that Apple has been investigating consumer complaints for the past few weeks and came to the conclusion that the laptop was behaving as expected. The fault may lie in the way iCloud syncing works. The feature supposedly kicks into high gear when setting up a new MacBook, synchronizing an avalanche of data in the background. Because of its discrete nature, users may not have noticed that extensive iCloud syncing was causing battery drain. This issue apparently ends once the initial rounds of setting up have been completed. Consumer Reports for its part asserts that battery life improved once it switched from Safari to Chrome.

The company’s SVP of marketing sent out a tweet late Friday night, saying CR’s test results don’t match Apple’s data. Schiller’s comments follow Consumer Reports’ scathing review of Apple’s new MacBook Pro, in which the product-testing magazine said, for the first time ever, that it could not recommend the laptop due to inconsistencies in battery life. Here’s what Consumer Reports said: Typically, a laptop’s battery life may vary from one trial to another by less than 5 percent. To arrive at our final battery life score we average those measurements together. However, with the widely disparate figures we found in the MacBook Pro tests, an average wouldn’t reflect anything a consumer would be likely to experience in the real world. For that reason, we are reporting the lowest battery life results, and using those numbers in calculating our final scores. It’s the only time frame we can confidently advise a consumer to rely on if he or she is planning use the product without access to an electrical outlet. And here’s Schiller’s response: Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data. https://t.co/IWtfsmBwpO — Philip Schiller (@pschiller) December 24, 2016 Battery performance complaints have been aplenty since the MacBook Pro launched in November, and Apple responded by removing macOS’s “inaccurate” time indicator. Some users have reported improved battery life with macOS 10.12.2. Source: Twitter Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Consumer Reports reportedly stands by its controversial MacBook Pro battery findings Consumer Reports won’t recommend new MacBook Pros over inconsistent battery life Apple took no specific steps to improve MacBook Pro battery life with macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Schiller: doubling MacBook Pro RAM would’ve reduced space for batteries Related Topics Apple, Battery, Consumer Reports, MacBook Pro, Phil Schiller askep3 Hope there’s a software fix HK I wonder if there’s a link between battery life issues and the fact that engineers had to pull the intended battery design!? Mark S From what I’ve read it sounds like this product was rushed to a release date. For whatever reason the mac team didn’t have the engineers it needed, a custom battery was supposed to go in but they had problems, they then went with some less than custom battery solution to meet a release date (the lucrative Christmas season) but had software issues with the real time battery life countdown timer so they removed it stating it wasn’t a very accurate timer anyway (funny that timer has been around for many many many years now) to cover the product’s shortcomings. Byambaa Exactly, thats what i read somewhere too with some links, infos etc. don’t know where now. The King It sounds so unlike Apple to rush products for holiday sales. They usually try to get ish right before trying to sell it for a overpriced tag Mark S Phil you need to get with your marketing team (you know the people responsible for creating contrived conditions for products to be released) and then your engineering team to make better products, not worry about influencing independent companies without a financial incentive for selling expensive electronics devices. malhal Schiller is head of marketing and has a degree in biology Rowan09 If they take my 2011 MBP straight up for a 2016 equivalent with Touch bar, I wouldn’t complain about the battery life and I’m sure others would do the same. Problem solved. Someone can just send this comment to Phil and Tim. techfreak23 Who wants 10 hours of just web surfing and iTunes playback? Apple needs to stop catering to the people buying MacBook Pros as a $2500 Facebook machine and start tackling the real issues such as being able to do some serious work for more than 10 hours. Smdh… Jovani Hernandez I agree as more people buy MacBook pros just for school or social media and expect a 10 hour battery will cause apple to lower the performance of the mac over battery Rolf Bause Haha, what is there to understand? – They’ve put in a 49 W/h battery! n0ahcruz3 They’re testing it wrong lmfao Bacillus With only 4 button cells inside, this device seems to be intended to please Mr Hearing Impaired Phil Guy Phil should work on them MBP prices too.

With pop culture leaking so heavily into the aquifers of everyday life that people voted for a game show host to be president of the United States, these overwhelmingly popular internet clips managed to stand out at a time when everything gets shared with everyone. From videos that affirmed the human spirit in times of tragedy to a sister getting tricked into thinking zombies were coming to kill her, these viral hits were as much a welcome distraction as they were microcosms of 2016. Here's a look at some of our favorites. Canadian cop sorry for mocking Nickelback in drunken driving PSA Carpool Karaoke featuring Adele Leave it to Adele to turn a car ride into a phenomenon. Though this international treasure wouldn't be the first to readily sing while riding shotgun with "Late Late Show" host James Corden, she easily became the most popular, surpassing the likes of Justin Bieber, One Direction and First Lady Michelle Obama. Featuring Adele's incredible take on Nicki Minaj's "Monster," the video has garnered over 138 million views and would become the most viral video made by a late-night program since 2013. Viral story about Santa meeting dying child might not be true Pen Pineapple Apple Pen You'll want to stab yourself with a Pineapple Apple Pen. Like a minimalist "Gangnam Style," Japanese comedian Kazuhiko Kosaka's one-minute song will fill you with equal parts exuberance and shame. It's not hard to imagine how many social gatherings have been destroyed by an Apple TV featuring the absurd lyrics ("I have a pen/I have an apple") mixed with the all-too-easy-to-emulate dance moves. As of Thursday afternoon, the best argument against multiculturism has easily cracked 100 million views — which doesn't even count the numerous unofficial uploads of the video. Four historical events that would cause a viral frenzy today Little Sister's Zombie Apocalypse Like clicking on fake news or making light of a dead zoo animal, exploiting a family member post-dental surgery has become a timeless tradition of the internet. However, Cabot Phillips and his brothers' plan to completely annihilate their sister's sense of reality after getting her wisdom teeth yanked set the bar incredibly high when they convinced her that a zombie epidemic had broken out. Drugged up and mouth stuffed with cotton balls, Millicent takes charge of the situation, making such hard decisions on camera as which family pet to save, the dog or the cat. Deflating dinos, birds ablaze and other Thanksgiving disasters "He's the worst, he's already dying!" she says. "Leave him, get the cat!" The apocalyptic prank would earn them over 22 million views and an appearance on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show." Angry Uber Driver “Get out of my car!” Viral photo taken on N.C. bridge shows Trump supporters, not KKK Overwhelmed when seemingly presented with the epitome of stubbornness, this on-demand vehicle operator demanded his customer leave his car. Video of the enraging encounter would last nearly three minutes, yet it will echo forever in the halls of righteous indignation. A Teacher Reacts to the Death of an Icon When my teacher found out Prince died pic.twitter.com/biNapKWJBU— ॐ (@shvrdae) April 21, 2016 To say that 2016 robbed the world of titans dear to our hearts would be an understatement. We said goodbye all too soon to such greats as David Bowie, Gene Wilder and Muhammad Ali, each loss resonating profoundly with those they inspired. SEE IT: 92-year-old woman reacts to Willie Nelson song she wrote On the day that the curtain would fall on music legend Prince, one student would capture her teacher's reaction to the heartbreaking news, his emotional reaction encapsulating how fans everywhere were feeling. Woman getting pulled out of car Once again, we braved blizzards, wildfires and tornados, with Louisiana in particular facing one of the most catastrophic disasters in the history of the country. In August, a storm would dump over 7 trillion gallons of water onto the state, forcing authorities to evacuate at least 30,000 residents. In one incident caught on video by a team of rescuers who just so happened to be in the right place at the right time, a car can be seen sinking into the flood waters of Baton Rouge as a voice from inside says, "Oh my god, I'm drowning." After struggling to pierce the vehicle's windows, the team works quickly enough to free the woman and her dog from a tragic end. Chewbacca Mom What a Wookie. Captioning her video "It's the simple joys in life," mother of two and utterly enthusiastic "Star Wars" fan Candace Payne would create the most watched video of 2016 on Facebook Live when she donned a roaring Chewbacca mask she bought on sale. The footage would net nearly 165 million views and word is this jovial Jedi will return as a vlogger for TLC. Damn Daniel Damn Daniel pic.twitter.com/Va10hmpePO— Joshua Holz (@Josholzz) February 16, 2016 Where to begin. Joshua Holz made a collection of Snapchat videos in which he complimented friend and Riverside Polytechnic Daniel Lara on his fashion choices, repeating the line, "Damn Daniel!" Posted to Twitter, the kindhearted compilation has received over 334,000 retweets. The phrase would get co-opted by companies such as Denny's and Clorox, Lara would receive a lifetime supply of Vans' sneakers and Holz would get "swatted" - a prank in which someone convinces 911 to send a SWAT team to break into the target's home. Damn internet.

Just a few days after Nokia announced a series of lawsuits against the iEmpire, Apple is pulling all Withings products from its digital shelves. What does Withings have to do with any of this, you ask? Well, back in April, Nokia acquired Withings for a cool $191 million, pushing Nokia into the connected device and wearables market. And now, Apple wants nothing to do with either company. While the Cupertino, California-based company didn’t give a reason for its sudden decision to give the boot to all Withings products, it doesn’t take a genius to conclude that it was related to the recent legal troubles (lawsuits have been filed in both Texas and Germany, with more coming, Nokia insists). Plus, if history is any indication, this is actually a favorite method of Apple’s when it comes to dealing with courtroom disputes. A couple years ago, Apple also removed all Bose products after the company sued Apple-owned Beats in connection with noise-cancelling patents. More: Clear your schedule — ‘Pokémon Go’ has come to the Apple Watch But don’t worry, Withings lovers. In the event that Apple wins this lawsuit, you can expect to see these products returned to online stores. At least, Bose earned their place back on Apple’s stocklist once the Beats debacle was over. And it certainly looks as though Apple has the advantage, at least if the stock market is any guide. Nokia’s stock haven’t been doing all that well since the lawsuit was announced. Company shares dropped by nearly 5 percent following reports of the legal action. For now, however, you won’t be able to find Withings products anywhere in Apple stores, and that includes the Body Cardio Scale, the Smart Body Analyzer, and the Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor. If you search for these or similar Withings products, you’ll find that they’re no longer listed as available on Apple’s online store. Also watch: Share

Following the ratings agency Consumer Reports' refusal to recommend the device to consumers, Schiller tweeted Friday that he is working with CR to “understand their battery tests.” He further said that CR’s results did not match the information obtained from Apple’s lab tests and field data. Related Stories Report Says Don't Buy The New MacBook Pro, Here's Why No More Battery Life Indicator with macOS Sierra 10.12. 2 Update Consumer Reports said in its evaluation posted Thursday that the MacBook Pro 2016 failed to earn its recommendation over battery issues. The report stated that despite having done well in terms of display and performance, the MacBook Pro’s battery life varied dramatically from one trial to another. Complaints about MacBook Pro 2016 have been repeatedly posted on Apple’s support forum since the device’s release in November. Consumer Reports tested three models — a 13-inch one with Touch bar, and one without the Touch bar, and a 15-inch model. In final calculations, these models scored the lowest in terms of battery life on the CR chart. Consumer Reports, however, added that such flaws of the device can be easily corrected using a software update and it would conduct fresh tests whenever such an update is issued for the MacBook Pro. MacBook Pro is not the only Apple product riddled with battery problems. Its iPhone 6s units have also been suffering from battery issues, for which the company recently started a battery replacement program.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Several Withings iOS-compatible products -- mostly health-related connected accessories -- have been available at Apple Stores for nearly two years as part of a retail alliance, AppleInsider reported on Saturday. The Withings product sales continued even after the company was acquired by Nokia in April for nearly $190 million. The Withings brand was integrated into Nokia's Digital Health unit. "Now, the devices made by the Nokia subsidiary are no longer listed on Apple's website. Previously, Apple carried a wide range of iOS-compatible Withings devices in its retail stores, including the 'Body Cardio Scale' and 'Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor,'" the report added. Nokia claims Apple using its technology, files patent infringement lawsuit Nokia was the world's leading mobile phone maker from 1998 until 2011 when it bet on Microsoft's Windows mobile platform, which proved to be a flop. Five years after Apple and Nokia settled a lawsuit, the tech giants have again locked horns over patents with Apple filing an anti-trust lawsuit against third-party companies Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) that act on Nokia's behalf, and the Finland-based firm suing Apple directly earlier this week. Nokia filed a suit in Europe and the US, claiming Apple is still infringing on Nokia patents. The lawsuit covers 32 patents, including display, user interface, software and video-coding technology. Nokia said that since settling the initial case, Apple has "declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other [parts] of its patented inventions, which are used by many Apple products." In its lawsuit, Apple argued that Nokia already has agreements to license its patents for fair and reasonable terms, also know as "FRAND" (Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory). "But Nokia is transferring these patents to PAEs in order to aggressively pursue money," Apple argued. Apple in talks with government to manufacture iPhones in India: WSJ Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to boost technology manufacturing in the country through his 'Make in India' initiative. According to the Cupertino-based tech giant, Nokia has been conspiring with PAEs patent assertion entities (Acacia Research and Conversant Property Management) in an "illegal patent transfer scheme" to wring money out of Apple because Nokia's cell phone business is failing. According to the AppleInsider report, Apple has now "expunged all mention of Withings and its product line from the Apple.com online retail database". "Whether or not the recent Withings removal is related to Nokia's shady legal dealings has yet to be confirmed, but Apple has in the past used its retail might as a retaliatory weapon," the report added. In 2011, the two companies settled a patent fight over smartphone technology through a licensing agreement that committed Apple to make a one-time payment to the company and to pay regular royalties in the future, media reported. The companies also agreed to withdraw complaints against each other with the International Trade Commission over the use of intellectual property. 10 BEST SMARTPHONES OF 2016 REWIND 2016 10 BEST CAMERA SMARTPHONES OF 2016 7 'BIG BATTERY' SMARTPHONES OF 2016 RELATED From around the web From GADGETSNOW Recommended By Colombia From Around the Web From GADGETSNOW Recommended By Colombia Comments Sort By:Up VotedNewestOldestDiscussedDown Voted Characters Remaining: 3000 OR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATION Share on FacebookShare on Twitter SIGN IN WITHFacebookGoogleEmail Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, defamatory or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

[Photos: courtesy of Amazon, Apple, Google, Samsung, and Microsoft] Mark Sullivan 12.24.16 9:00 AM Large platform companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, Samsung, and Microsoft want to provide the operating system for our lives, and they will fight hard in 2017 to establish their foothold in the emerging technologies we will likely come to rely on in the future. Who will succeed? Those with the most complete product offerings have an advantage. Since people like to buy products that play well with the other products they already own, a platform company risks losing customers by not having a product in a hot category. These large companies already have an advantage over smaller companies due to their massive R&D budgets and their ability to hire the best people to build the stuff we want now and to anticipate the technology we’ll want in the future. And if a hot product is developed by some ambitious startup, these giants can easily swoop in and acquire both the product and the people who created it. These categories, while not new, will be the front lines of the platform wars in 2017. Smart Bluetooth Speakers Amazon brilliantly hit upon a whole new product category with its Echo home personal assistant device. While other platform companies like Google and Apple were limiting their respective personal assistants to smartphones, Amazon saw that people wanted a personal assistant that stood on the countertop, could hear and understand voices in the room very well, and contained a speaker that actually sounded good. Google has since created a competing device called Google Home, and there is plenty of speculation that Apple and Microsoft have something in the works as well. Amazon wisely opened up its personal assistant (called Alexa) to third-party developers, and thousands of them are now creating new "skills" for the home assistant. This trend will continue to escalate throughout 2017, and we will soon begin to see a new wave of skills that are more useful and easier to call up at your command. As more personal assistant devices find their way into homes in 2017, the platform companies that sell them will increasingly compete to get developers to create better and better skills for the devices. And the platform companies themselves will try to integrate more of their own services through the devices. For instance, Amazon might offer more useful shopping services through the Echo, while Google will try to offer new search and productivity services. Virtual Personal Assistants Home assistant devices are just one vehicle for the natural language assistants of the platform companies. Assistants like Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Amazon’s Alexa will begin showing up in new places, and in more useful ways, in the coming year. (Samsung has something called S Voice, but it this year acquired the company that developed Siri, so we may be seeing a new assistant technology from the company in the next year). The platform companies are already investing heavily in the research and development that will make these assistants better listeners and more suited to completing tasks. Natural language assistants must understand our words, but also the meaning and intent behind them. That first part is easier than the second: Microsoft said in October that its Cortana assistant can now understand language roughly as well as a human transcriptionist. The problem of teaching assistants to learn more about the user (identity, preferences, habits) is harder, but assistants will show improvement in this area in the coming year. Some will begin learning about the emotion expressed in the user’s comments and commands, which is harder still. They'll begin to display what seems like "common sense," which will enable them to communicate and interpret commands and requests in a more natural (and accurate) way. And assistants will become more knowledgable about more things. They’ll be harder to stump when asking random questions that you might normally use a search engine to answer. They’ll say "I can’t help you with that" less often. But assistants are in general not ready to learn in an open-ended, autonomous way; rather, they're being taught to learn in a highly structured way within well-defined contexts. An assistant, for example, may be tasked with learning what it can about a user’s habits based on calendar usage. Assistants are a prime example of a product that is increasingly linked to other products and services offered by the platform. They’re increasingly the thing we’ll use to call up all kinds of data and services, and they’ll show up in more and more contexts. If a consumer sees one assistant as clearly better than others, they might be very tempted to adopt the services the assistant is able to call up. Car Brains Automakers have been building platform companies’ infotainment systems into new models for some time, but the integration will soon go much deeper, and it will heat up the competition once again. Google and Apple each have a platforms (Android Auto and CarPlay, respectively) for extending the set of apps and services (messaging, music, navigation, phone calls, etc.) in Android and iOS to the car. They’re generally regarded as superior to the stock infotainment systems in cars. But now the platform war for the car extends way beyond the dashboard. Google, for example (and very likely Apple, too) has built a software central nervous system for the car, an operating system that will control the semi-autonomous or autonomous operation of the vehicle. Google may have first intended to sell an autonomous vehicle, but the company refocused efforts on creating the software brains for the vehicles, which could be used in the vehicles of more traditional car companies. Apple has very likely taken the same path. Google recently formed a new company called Waymo under the Alphabet parent company to market its auto software. Fiat Chrysler will be the first partner to use the system in its vehicles; it said in may it will first use it in 100 of its minivans. Apple has never formally announced its "Project Titan," but Uber, Tesla, and various automakers are furiously developing self-driving systems. And other platform players like Samsung may eventually jump into the fray. Microsoft HoloLens VR/AR Headsets Virtual reality and augmented reality products and experiences are new to many consumers, and it’s yet to be seen how popular the technology will be. Virtual reality, at least in the consumer space, may be the more mature technology. VR headsets like Oculus Rift and HTC Vive cover close out the outside world and create a 360-degree 3D world for the user. Companies like Facebook’s Oculus, Google, and HTC are already well down the road with the development of VR headsets and will continue to refine the technology during 2017. A growing number of phone makers are readying their devices to power the VR experiences in headsets based in Google’s new Daydream platform. Apple has so far stayed out of the virtual reality space. This may be because the company is more interested in augmented reality, as CEO Tim Cook has suggested in his comments. Augmented reality superimposes digital data and images over the real world as seen through the camera lens on a mobile device or headset. Microsoft’s HoloLens AR headset has been available to developers (and, technically, anyone else) for some time now, but augmented reality arguably had its coming out in 2016 with the Pokemon Go phenomenon in July. But that app requires viewing the overlaid content on the screen of a mobile device, which can be a clunky experience. The same type of experience is being used by toy makers to overlay digital imagery over dolls and action figures to make the play more interesting and to sell add-on products (accessories, media, etc.). Perhaps the biggest name in the consumer AR space is Florida-based Magic Leap, which says it has a new kind of headset lens to create sharper digital imagery. The company’s investors have put more than a billion dollars behind the product, but a 2017 release looks less and less likely. Two sources in the AR space have told me that if Apple releases some kind of AR product, it won’t be until 2018. So 2017 may be more of a warmup year for AR. If the technology captures the imaginations of consumers, the platform war may ensue in 2018 and 2019. Artificial Intelligence And Natural Language I saved this one for last because AI is now finding its way into many of the products and services sold by the platforms. Personal assistants (like Siri or Alexa) may be the first context in which many people encounter a conversational AI, but the technology will begin showing up in lots of different contexts across the platform in the coming years. Google and Apple already use AI in photo apps to automatically identify and tag images. Apple uses the same technology in the iPhone camera to recognize objects in the frame, and make adjustments accordingly. Microsoft, Google, and Apple are using AI in bots that can act as customer service reps on behalf of businesses. Eventually, more advanced versions of the neural networks we see today will be used as the means of processing virtually all kinds of complex data. Where today’s AI needs lots of human training, the technology will become increasingly able to learn on its own. We’ll eventually stop thinking about computers as input/output if-this-then-that machines, and more like huge systems arranged like the neurons in the human brain. They'll process data more like the brain does. We’re also in the early stages of a shift toward voice interactions with computers and applications. In the next year we may see some leaps forward in the machines’ ability not only to understand our words but also understand the real intent behind the words. We'll increasingly be able to speak commands to the devices in our lives. We'll tap screens less. The good news in all this is that as these big, well-monied companies battle it out, specific products naturally get better, and whole platforms get more complete. Today, no one company can provide everything we need throughout the day. This may become less true as the major platforms increasingly extend new products and services into our work, home, entertainment, and personal lives. Never miss a story.

Apple released iOS on September 13, 2016. This time last year iOS 9 stood at 70%. It's difficult to assess whether the slightly lower adoption rate is directly due to slightly slower sales of iOS devices or because users took the advice from articles like the one from Mashable titled "7 reasons why you shouldn't update your iPhone to iOS 10." Apple's next updated iOS adoption chart should give us a better picture. In stark contrast Google's Android Nougat OS, which was released on August 22, 2016, has an adoption rate of … drum roll … 0.4% as of December 5, 2016. That's well after the Google Pixel phone came to market and well after Black Friday sales. Worse is that Marshmallow, their previous Android version only stands at 26.3% and it was released in October 2015. With Android fans not being able to update their OS for a multitude of reasons has led to at least a million Android phones being infected with Gooligan or running into other forms of malware and ransomware. It was also reported last month that researchers had discovered that certain cheap Android phones were sending user's personal data to a firm in Shanghai.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

With pop culture leaking so heavily into the aquifers of everyday life that people voted for a game show host to be president of the United States, these overwhelmingly popular internet clips managed to stand out at a time when everything gets shared with everyone. From videos that affirmed the human spirit in times of tragedy to a sister getting tricked into thinking zombies were coming to kill her, these viral hits were as much a welcome distraction as they were microcosms of 2016. Here's a look at some of our favorites. Canadian cop sorry for mocking Nickelback in drunken driving PSA Carpool Karaoke featuring Adele Leave it to Adele to turn a car ride into a phenomenon. Though this international treasure wouldn't be the first to readily sing while riding shotgun with "Late Late Show" host James Corden, she easily became the most popular, surpassing the likes of Justin Bieber, One Direction and First Lady Michelle Obama. Featuring Adele's incredible take on Nicki Minaj's "Monster," the video has garnered over 138 million views and would become the most viral video made by a late-night program since 2013. Viral story about Santa meeting dying child might not be true Pen Pineapple Apple Pen You'll want to stab yourself with a Pineapple Apple Pen. Like a minimalist "Gangnam Style," Japanese comedian Kazuhiko Kosaka's one-minute song will fill you with equal parts exuberance and shame. It's not hard to imagine how many social gatherings have been destroyed by an Apple TV featuring the absurd lyrics ("I have a pen/I have an apple") mixed with the all-too-easy-to-emulate dance moves. As of Thursday afternoon, the best argument against multiculturism has easily cracked 100 million views — which doesn't even count the numerous unofficial uploads of the video. Four historical events that would cause a viral frenzy today Little Sister's Zombie Apocalypse Like clicking on fake news or making light of a dead zoo animal, exploiting a family member post-dental surgery has become a timeless tradition of the internet. However, Cabot Phillips and his brothers' plan to completely annihilate their sister's sense of reality after getting her wisdom teeth yanked set the bar incredibly high when they convinced her that a zombie epidemic had broken out. Drugged up and mouth stuffed with cotton balls, Millicent takes charge of the situation, making such hard decisions on camera as which family pet to save, the dog or the cat. Deflating dinos, birds ablaze and other Thanksgiving disasters "He's the worst, he's already dying!" she says. "Leave him, get the cat!" The apocalyptic prank would earn them over 22 million views and an appearance on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show." Angry Uber Driver “Get out of my car!” Viral photo taken on N.C. bridge shows Trump supporters, not KKK Overwhelmed when seemingly presented with the epitome of stubbornness, this on-demand vehicle operator demanded his customer leave his car. Video of the enraging encounter would last nearly three minutes, yet it will echo forever in the halls of righteous indignation. A Teacher Reacts to the Death of an Icon When my teacher found out Prince died pic.twitter.com/biNapKWJBU— ॐ (@shvrdae) April 21, 2016 To say that 2016 robbed the world of titans dear to our hearts would be an understatement. We said goodbye all too soon to such greats as David Bowie, Gene Wilder and Muhammad Ali, each loss resonating profoundly with those they inspired. SEE IT: 92-year-old woman reacts to Willie Nelson song she wrote On the day that the curtain would fall on music legend Prince, one student would capture her teacher's reaction to the heartbreaking news, his emotional reaction encapsulating how fans everywhere were feeling. Woman getting pulled out of car Once again, we braved blizzards, wildfires and tornados, with Louisiana in particular facing one of the most catastrophic disasters in the history of the country. In August, a storm would dump over 7 trillion gallons of water onto the state, forcing authorities to evacuate at least 30,000 residents. In one incident caught on video by a team of rescuers who just so happened to be in the right place at the right time, a car can be seen sinking into the flood waters of Baton Rouge as a voice from inside says, "Oh my god, I'm drowning." After struggling to pierce the vehicle's windows, the team works quickly enough to free the woman and her dog from a tragic end. Chewbacca Mom What a Wookie. Captioning her video "It's the simple joys in life," mother of two and utterly enthusiastic "Star Wars" fan Candace Payne would create the most watched video of 2016 on Facebook Live when she donned a roaring Chewbacca mask she bought on sale. The footage would net nearly 165 million views and word is this jovial Jedi will return as a vlogger for TLC. Damn Daniel Damn Daniel pic.twitter.com/Va10hmpePO— Joshua Holz (@Josholzz) February 16, 2016 Where to begin. Joshua Holz made a collection of Snapchat videos in which he complimented friend and Riverside Polytechnic Daniel Lara on his fashion choices, repeating the line, "Damn Daniel!" Posted to Twitter, the kindhearted compilation has received over 334,000 retweets. The phrase would get co-opted by companies such as Denny's and Clorox, Lara would receive a lifetime supply of Vans' sneakers and Holz would get "swatted" - a prank in which someone convinces 911 to send a SWAT team to break into the target's home.

In August, Ireland was ordered to collect $13.6bn in alleged unpaid tax from the iPhone maker. This week, Ireland blasted EU regulators. The government said they were interfering with national sovereignty and attempting to rewrite Irish tax law. Jim Clarken, CEO of Oxfam Ireland, offers his take on what could be the world's biggest tax dispute when it hits the courts in 2017 and the implications it could have for multi-national companies. "We know that Apple and other multinationals that are operating in Ireland are providing quality jobs and paying taxation on those parts of the work that they do here. But, we also estimate there are $93bn of excess profits being booked in Ireland every year by various companies and being moved through Ireland. So ultimately, that part of the tax puzzle is one that affects other parts of the world. That's why getting this global tax system right is essential for citizens everywhere and this is an indication that there are problems in the global tax situation. They've been highlighted in this case and its being pursued for those reasons," says Clarken. According to Clarken, Oxfam is calling for a global tax body, overseen by the UN, that will tackle a number of issues, because, "one of the biggest problems we have in the global tax system currently is a complete lack of transparency, so it's not clear where taxes are being paid, and where profits are being booked, and where real economic activity is taking place. And that is essential for all countries, so there's a sense of fairness in the tax system, that multinationals are taxed fairly and correctly, and the citizens in different places where that revenue should go to benefit from that." Also on this episode of Counting the Cost: Christine Lagarde's guilty sentence: Earlier this week, a French court found Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), guilty on of criminal charges linked to the misuse of public funds when she was France's finance minister nearly a decade ago. But the court did not impose a fine or a sentence. Natacha Butler reports from Paris. India's growth prospects for 2017: India's economy has sped ahead of the UK's's for the first time in over a century, due to the slump in the value of British sterling versus the US dollar. While global rankings are looking up for India, its people are suffering on the ground, because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's controversial decision to demonitise the 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes. Is this due to Brexit or is the Indian economy actually surpassing that of the UK's? And what does this mean for bilateral trade post-Brexit? Gregor Irwin, chief economist at Global Counsel, looks at the impact of these developments. The future of the supercar: Why is Lamborghini making a sports utility vehicle? Lamborghini's new CEO, Stefano Domenicali, discusses the long-term future of the supercar after a year which saw major changes in the automotive space.

But the company still appears interested in the auto segment, particularly as it relates to self-driving cars. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Dec 24, 2016 at 7:31AM News of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Project Titan has died down in the past year, but the tech giant is still tangibly interested in the advancement of autonomous car technology. In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis and contributor Daniel Sparks explain what we know about Apple's interest in self-driving cars. Also, they discuss what investors need to keep in mind when looking at this new and exciting space. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Dec. 16, 2016. Dylan Lewis: If you had any doubts about Apple's interest in making self-driving cars, I think Tim Cook has been pretty coy in some public interviews about not really letting in on a lot of details, being a little cagey, the company sent a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regarding Federal Automated Vehicle Policy earlier this month. And it made it pretty clear they have something cooking there. The NHTSA can grant exemptions to certain compliance standards if that organization decides that it's important for research and investigations. Apple's letter was essentially urging the administration to expedite the exemption requests that are coming in from some new entrants, so, some people that maybe haven't been quite as ambitious as the early entrants into autonomous driving. That, I think, says all you need to hear about their interest in this space, and the fact that it's something that they're obviously putting a decent number of resources into. Daniel Sparks: Yeah, I think that Apple is definitely working on a car, as far as we can tell. Recent reports suggest that the company has hundreds of employees working on it. The transition, initially, it was referred to as Project Titan, and it initially transitioned away from building a car -- this is all speculation, keep in mind -- to really focusing on the technology, similar to Alphabet. The rumor is, now, it's going to be deeply integrated into iOS, and the company is looking for a 2017 deadline of proof of concept of something that can work. So, Alphabet and Apple, these are still really speculative things. But, at least with Alphabet, we're starting to see a direction, an actual company, and an effort to monetize the business, which is encouraging.  Lewis: And for both of those companies, these are things that are exciting. They're very attractive, they're fun to speculate on because they are nascent tech. But they are not going to be meaningful to the top line or bottom line for quite some time. That's something to keep in mind there. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

It can be used to pay for items in the real world, save you in an emergency, act as a fashion accessory and help you track down a misplaced iPhone -- to name a few. Here are 11 tips and tricks every Apple Watch owner should know: 1. Discreetly check the time Apple Watch Series 2 users can check the time without making a fuss during a meeting by slowly rotating the Digital Crown up. You'll need to enable Wake Screen on Crown Up in the Apple Watch iPhone app in General > Wake Screen. 2. Customize watch faces The easiest way to customize watch faces is through the Apple Watch app on the iPhone. Apple also offers a curated section of faces based on the apps you have installed. Instead of tapping and swiping around on the small watch screen, use the app. 3. Disable screenshots Pressing the Digital Crown and Side Button at the same time will take a screenshot on the Apple Watch. Before Apple introduced the option to disable screenshots, my camera roll was full of accidental screenshots from my wrist pressing the buttons. Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, select General > turn Enable Screenshots Off. 4. Apple Pay To use Apple Pay on your watch, add a card in the Apple Watch app on your iPhone. When you're ready to pay, double-press the Side Button to activate Apple Pay. Swipe left or right to select a different card, then hold the watch to the payment terminal. Another benefit of having Apple Pay set up on your watch is that you can use it to approve purchases on your Mac. Set up, enable and customize how Apple Pay functions on your watch in the iPhone Apple Watch app under Wallet & Apple Pay. 5. iPhone Ping Misplace your iPhone a lot? Swipe up on the face of your Apple Watch to display Control Center, and tap on the iPhone ping icon. A sound will play on your iPhone, even if it's on silent. Keep tapping to replay the sound. An additional aid in finding a lost iPhone, be it in the dark or as an accessibility feature for the hard of hearing, is to long-press on the same icon. A sound will play and the iPhone's flash will blink rapidly. 6. Empty water out of the speaker That tiny raindrop indicates the watch is locked, preventing water from getting in the speaker and interacting with the touch screen. Apple Watch Series 2 owners can go for a swim while wearing the watch, but need to clear water out of the speaker after each dip. Swipe up from the watch face, displaying Control Center, and tap on the water drop icon. Doing so will put the watch in water mode, locking the screen. Turn the Digital Crown to unlock the watch and clear any water out of the speaker. 7. Quick app switch Bouncing between apps on the watch can take a lot of taps and swipes. So the next time you find yourself going between multiple apps, or just want to get back to your watch face, double-press the digital crown. 8. Two ways to use Siri You can activate Siri by holding in the Digital Crown, or by saying "Hey, Siri" when the watch's screen is lit up. 9. An app dock With the release of WatchOS 3, Apple ditched app glances, opting for an application dock instead. Press the side button on your Apple Watch to view the dock. You can drag and drop apps, or drag an app to the top of your watch's screen to remove it from the dock. Another option for editing the dock is to open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone and tap on Dock > Edit. 10. SOS for peace of mind With the release of WatchOS 3 in September, Apple included an SOS mode on the Apple Watch. With it enabled, holding in the Side Button on the watch will prompt the watch to dial the local emergency number. (911 here in the US) You can enable or disable this feature in the Apple Watch app on your iPhone under General > Emergency SOS. Additionally, any emergency contacts you've added to the Health app will receive an alert if you have to use the SOS feature on your watch. 11. Unlock a Mac Your Apple Watch possesses a superpower capable of unlocking your Mac as you wake it. On your Mac, open System Preferences > Security & Privacy. Check the box next to Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac then enter your password when prompted. The next time you wake your Mac, magic will take place and your Mac will unlock.

Sections Search Help/Info Subscribe: Digital | Home Delivery Subscribe Help/Info     Breaking News Bar   Business posted: 12/24/2016 7:22 AM 10 minutes of play sums up Nintendo's messy Super Mario debut Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close The title screen of Nintendo Co.'s Super Mario Run mobile game is displayed on an iPhone screen. Bloomberg   Yuji Nakamura Bloomberg     Nintendo Co.'s debut game for smartphones is turning out to be anything but super. Since its release for Apple devices on Thursday, Super Mario Run has shot to the top of download charts in more than 100 countries as tens of millions celebrated the iconic video game character's arrival on iPhones. Yet problems emerged almost immediately, with thousands vigorously complaining that the three levels available with the free download were over too quickly -- in less than 10 minutes in most cases -- and the $10 price tag to unlock the rest was too steep. That backlash is now reverberating through its share price, with Nintendo's stock dropping by 11 percent in the two trading days since the game's release, wiping out more than $3.5 billion in market value. Investors and analysts are starting to second-guess the company's decisions and its ability to execute on mobile devices. "A $10 upfront cost to unlock the game is a huge ask and one that flies in the face of current mobile games being free-to-play," said Daniel Ahmad, an analyst for researcher Niko Partners. "The first three levels are not very long and the payment screen doesn't seem to make it abundantly clear what the user is getting in return for that $10 purchase." Those comments mostly echo the reaction online, where more than a hundred thousand users have posted ratings on Apple's App Stores in the U.S., Japan and elsewhere, ranking the game at two and a half stars out of five. That's among the lowest for apps at the top of download rankings, and below other games such as Clash Royale, Candy Crush Saga or Monster Strike. Besides the high price, reviewers focused on Nintendo's decision to require an internet connection, with many complaining they couldn't play during their commutes. Others said the oversimplified gameplay removed features that are a staple of Super Mario games on consoles, such as fireballs. "The negative reviews aren't necessarily because it's a bad game," said Eliran Sapir, head of Apptopia. "It's a combination of the high price tag and fans not liking the vehicle." Sapir said poor word-of-mouth could impact the game's profitability. While the game has become the highest-grossing game in most countries, it could only reach third place in Japan -- the world's third-largest app market, according to App Annie. That adds to the risk it could fall short of analysts' expectations. Nomura Holdings has estimated the game will generate 36 billion yen ($306 million) by the end of March, while Macquarie Securities sees $200 million in the same period. The negative buzz could particularly hurt sales to the much larger pool of Android users, who won't get a version until an undetermined time next year. Even among those who paid $10 for the full experience on Apple's iOS, a common complaint was the lack of incentives to keep playing for longer. The quest to rescue Princess Peach can be completed in about two hours and thereafter the game encourages users to run through already-completed levels on harder difficulties and race against other players. Items they win are ultimately used in Kingdom Builder, a never-ending game mode where players can craft a small village to call their own. The problem, users say, is that kingdom-building is a shallow affair. The small variety of items to buy and limited map size means most villages won't differ much from player to player. That's a far cry from other games such as Pokemon Go, where a high number of pocket monsters, each with unique characteristics, made catching them all a highly personalized experience. By comparison, Super Mario Run does little to make items in Kingdom Builder seem anything more than inanimate objects. All of this raises questions about whether Nintendo fundamentally understands what smartphone gamers want, even as it teams with mobile gaming specialist DeNA Co. to bring out titles. Since announcing its expansion into smartphones in March 2015, investors have pushed shares 74 percent higher on the promise the Kyoto-based company can bring its gaming prowess into the hands of the world's 2.3 billion smartphone users. The decisions that went into Super Mario Run, and the reaction from users, is making some reassess those convictions. "Right now it is near the top of rankings, but people are foreseeing that it will fall quite quickly," said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute. For analyst Serkan Toto, the real test is what Nintendo does next. To reverse the souring sentiment, the company should announce additional content to create more depth to the gameplay. While a change to the pricing model is also possible, Nintendo has avoided lowering prices on products in the past. "There will be more worlds, more stages and maybe also at some point in time a break away from the business model," said Toto, founder of consultant Kantan Games Inc. "It's just the first version of their first actual game."

Sections Search Help/Info Subscribe: Digital | Home Delivery Subscribe Help/Info     Breaking News Bar   Business posted: 12/24/2016 7:22 AM How Apple Alienated Mac Loyalists Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close Philip Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple, introduces the Mac Pro during a launch event in San Francisco. Bloomberg/October 2013   Mark Gurman Bloomberg     To die-hard fans, Apple's Macintosh sometimes seems like an afterthought these days. Mac upgrades, once a frequent ritual, are few and far between. The Mac Pro, Apple's marquee computer, hasn't been refreshed since 2013. The affordable and flexible Mac mini was last upgraded in 2014. And when a new machine does roll out, the results are sometimes underwhelming, if not infuriating, to devotees. In October, after more than 500 days without an update, Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro, with a slimmer design and louder speakers. The laptop garnered mostly favorable reviews from the technology press but grumbles from creative types, a key constituency, who said the device under-performed rival products. Interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company's software team. They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the roll-out of new computers. While the Mac generates about 10 percent of Apple sales, the company can't afford to alienate professional designers and other business customers. After all, they helped fuel Apple's revival in the late 1990s. In a stinging critique, Peter Kirn, founder of a website for music and video creators, wrote: "This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines." If more Mac users switch, the Apple ecosystem will become less sticky-opening the door to people abandoning higher-value products like the iPhone and iPad. People now have more options. Microsoft, once derided by Mac loyalists for its clunky, buggy software, offers Windows 10, which provides the tablet type functionality Apple pioneered with the iPad. Microsoft's Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality and a well-reviewed creative paint program aimed at the Mac's audience. Sensing an opportunity, Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a "disappointment" and said more users than ever were switching to its Surface laptops. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. However, the company has said the Macintosh remains one of its most important products and denies it takes a back seat to other gadgets. Four years ago at Apple's annual developer conference, marketing chief Phil Schiller pledged to keep the computer front and center in the company's product arsenal. "Nobody turns over their entire line as quickly and completely as we do at Apple," Schiller said. "We're really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick so you can get the exact product you need." Two years later, the company held a 30th birthday party for the Macintosh, a splashy event that featured a OneRepublic concert at Apple's Cupertino, California headquarters. The company also created a website celebrating the Mac's history. To be fair, Apple depends on Intel Corp., which still makes key chips for Macs. Like the rest of the PC industry, Apple's innovation and product cycles are sometimes constrained by when Intel produces new chips-a process that's getting more difficult. Making a laptop stand out is also harder these days. But when Apple has tried to leapfrog the competition, it has fallen short. Take the company's attempt to create a longer-lasting battery for the MacBook Pro. Apple engineers wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life. In the run-up to the MacBook Pro's planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The change required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job, meaning work on other Macs languished, the person said. The new laptop didn't represent a game-changing leap in battery performance, and a software bug misrepresented hours of power remaining. Apple has since removed the meter from the top right-hand corner of the screen. In the Mac's heyday, people working on new models could expect a lot of attention from Ive's team. Once a week his people would meet with Mac engineers to discuss ongoing projects. Mac engineers brought prototypes to Ive's studio for review, while his lieutenants would visit the Mac labs to look at early concepts. Those visits have become less frequent since the company began focusing more on more-valuable products like the iPhone and iPad, and the change became even more obvious after the design team's leadership was shuffled last year, according to a person familiar with the situation. In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple re-organized its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power. That's part of a broader shift toward making Macs more like iPhones. Apple prioritizes features, like thinness and minimal ports, that sell its iPhones and iPads, which generated about 75 percent of revenue this year. Those are contrary to professional needs, like maximum computing power. Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook used the iPhone's Lightning connector, although this was ditched for a more standard USB-C port. There was even a gold MacBook Pro planned, but this was shelved because the color didn't look good on such a large product. In recent years, Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning designers and engineers must work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision. Engineers are now "asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable," a person familiar with the matter said. When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end, Apple shipped the laptop in 2015, months after its 2014 goal. For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy). The update instead included a new rose gold color option alongside a standard speed increase. The internal turmoil has taken a toll. More than a dozen engineers and managers working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams or other companies in the past year and a half, said people familiar with the situation. Some were looking for a less all-consuming work environment, while others felt the future of Mac hardware was unclear in a world of iPhones and iPads. In 2013, Apple launched a redesigned Mac Pro, a black cylinder with bright white LED lights. It was a powerful desktop machine created partly to cast a halo over the entire Macintosh lineup. The Mac Pro was also the first Apple computer in years to be assembled in the U.S. Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused production headaches though. The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome beveled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on, the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. The political environment is tougher for such a move now. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump hammered Apple for building most of its products overseas and since his election he has pushed other companies to keep some jobs in the U.S. Still, Apple hasn't given up on Macs. In a recent company Q&A session, employees asked whether Mac desktop computers remain strategically important. "We have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that," Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said, according to a transcript of the discussion obtained by Bloomberg News. The latest MacBook Pro has a "Touch Bar," a thin touchscreen built into the keyboard that lets users quickly access app shortcuts, change system settings, and pick emojis. The laptop also has Touch ID to speed up online purchases and a giant trackpad for easier gesture control. Apple designers are already exploring standalone keyboards with the touch strip and a fingerprint reader for desktops. Apple will decide whether to release these based on how well the features do on the MacBook Pro. Mac fans shouldn't hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. Cue the outrage. apple Tweet This article filed under: Business Technology Bloomberg Article Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

Bloomberg   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Those expecting some extra cash this holiday season may be eyeing Apple's $160 AirPods as a present for themselves. Apple recently sent along a pair for me to test, replacing some pre-release AirPods I'd played with before and found a little too ahead of their time for most people. Many of my initial thoughts stand. I didn't notice a dip in audio quality. The AirPods never dropped a connection, and they pair easily with the iPhone. I still had no problem with the 5 hour battery life, though those on long flights may disagree. But I'm a little less worried about losing them now. Ear shape may vary results, but I had no problems. Running with them at a nearby lake wasn't a problem at all. (And I'm not a particularly smooth or elegant runner, believe me.) Ditto while jump-roping. They actually held up better during exercise than when I had tried sleeping with them in my ears. With my prime worry gone, I reveled in the freedom of not having a cord. I don't often get tangled in my headphones, but it was nice not worrying about it while pulling on a sweatshirt or doing a jumping jack -- a glimpse into a future world without wires. I still have my gripes. AirPods lack many functions I expect from headphones, such as being able to control the volume from the cord. Siri picks up the slack -- and you can ask her quietly to change the volume or skip a track -- but it takes longer than a button-press and requires me to talk to myself in public. (Not my favorite activity.) And while AirPods switch smoothly between Apple Watch and iPhone, they won't pair simultaneously with your phone and your Mac or other Bluetooth-enabled device. For me, that's a slight step down from headphones that let you connect to several devices at once. Plus, I still missed the cord as a safety blanket. Take an AirPod out of your ear, and you have to hold it -- tightly, in my case, for fear I'd drop one and lose $80 down a swan's gullet. Ideally, AirPods would always be in your ears or in their charging case, but we do not always live in an ideal world. They could easily slip into the wash in a pocket with my loose change. They do come with a one-year warranty, plus out-of-warranty service in case you lose or damage them -- but replacing a lost one would cost you $69 each. Overall, I'd say AirPods aren't a must-have product because you lose some function by going wireless. Still, I'd only really advise against them if you're prone to losing things. Losing AirPods would be much more frustrating than mislaying a $15 pair of headphones from the airport. But if you think you can keep track of them and are intrigued by their compact convenience, AirPods are an interesting step into the wireless future.

 A top Apple exec says they're 'working' with Consumer Reports on their issues with the MacBook Pro Matt Weinberger Dec. 24, 2016, 9:18 AM 8,120 facebook linkedin twitter email print Earlier this week, Consumer Reports announced that the newest MacBook Pro had failed to earn its coveted "recommended" rating — making it the first Apple laptop not to achieve the distinction.  The factor holding the MacBook Pro back, says Consumer Reports, was "battery life" that was "highly inconsistent from one trial to the next." Now, Apple VP of Worldwide Marketing says via Twitter that the company is "working" with Consumer Reports to figure out what happened, saying "[the] results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data."  Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data. https://t.co/IWtfsmBwpO — Philip Schiller (@pschiller) December 24, 2016 Consumer Reports' findings were an embarassment to Apple, right at the end of a year in which it had been criticized for possibly losing its product focus. And yet, Consumer Reports' testing methodology has been called into question by Apple fans, who find that their experiences with the MacBook Pro don't match the magazine's. A person familiar with the matter had previously told Business Insider that at the time it published its findings, Consumer Reports hadn't yet released to Apple all the system logs necessary to diagnose what caused its reviewers to experience that spotty battery performance. Still, when Consumer Reports made its announcement, it did say that it would be willing to reconsider its rating if Apple issued any kind of corrective software patch or update. Apple is clearly hoping it can get Consumer Reports to reconsider, and restore its perfect record.

As for the reason, Apple touts that the latest MacBook Pro offers users up to 10 hours of battery life, but Consumer Reports‘ tests found this to be far more inconsistent, with battery life varying widely from times including 3.75 hours to 16 hours. In response to this, Phil Schiller, Apple’s Senior VP of Worldwide Marketing, posted on Twitter that the company is now working with Consumer Reports in order to understand their testing process, adding that their results do not match their Apple’s lab tests or field data. READ NEXT: MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Review Consumer Reports acknowledges that it’s common to see battery life vary depending on how the laptops are being used, etc., but they found the performance of the new MacBook Pros to be far outside the norm. They found that the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar had battery life times between 16 hours and 3.75 hours, while the 15-inch model ranged from 18.5 hours to 8 hours of battery life. However, there has been a lot of criticism aimed at Consumer Reports for their testing methods, which included opening 10 pre-selected webpages in Safari. When they switched to using Chrome, they found battery life remained consistently high. In their review, Consumer Reports noted that it would give the MacBook Pro a fresh set of tests if Apple released a software update that improves battery performance, so there’s a chance this could all be addressed, with users getting better laptops and Apple receiving its recommended rating.

Several Withings iOS-compatible products -- mostly health-related connected accessories -- have been available at Apple Stores for nearly two years as part of a retail alliance, AppleInsider reported on Saturday. The Withings product sales continued even after the company was acquired by Nokia in April for nearly $190 million. The Withings brand was integrated into Nokia's Digital Health unit. "Now, the devices made by the Nokia subsidiary are no longer listed on Apple's website. Previously, Apple carried a wide range of iOS-compatible Withings devices in its retail stores, including the 'Body Cardio Scale' and 'Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor,'" the report added. Five years after Apple and Nokia settled a lawsuit, the tech giants have again locked horns over patents with Apple filing an anti-trust lawsuit against third-party companies Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) that act on Nokia's behalf, and the Finland-based firm suing Apple directly earlier this week. Nokia filed a suit in Europe and the US, claiming Apple is still infringing on Nokia patents. The lawsuit covers 32 patents, including display, user interface, software and video-coding technology. Nokia said that since settling the initial case, Apple has "declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other [parts] of its patented inventions, which are used by many Apple products." In its lawsuit, Apple argued that Nokia already has agreements to license its patents for fair and reasonable terms, also know as "FRAND" (Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory). "But Nokia is transferring these patents to PAEs in order to aggressively pursue money," Apple argued. According to the Cupertino-based tech giant, Nokia has been conspiring with PAEs patent assertion entities (Acacia Research and Conversant Property Management) in an "illegal patent transfer scheme" to wring money out of Apple because Nokia's cell phone business is failing. According to the AppleInsider report, Apple has now "expunged all mention of Withings and its product line from the Apple.com online retail database". "Whether or not the recent Withings removal is related to Nokia's shady legal dealings has yet to be confirmed, but Apple has in the past used its retail might as a retaliatory weapon," the report added. In 2011, the two companies settled a patent fight over smartphone technology through a licensing agreement that committed Apple to make a one-time payment to the company and to pay regular royalties in the future, media reported. The companies also agreed to withdraw complaints against each other with the International Trade Commission over the use of intellectual property.

Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Dec 24, 2016 at 11:13AM Image source: Nintendo. There's a lot of Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) going on at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) these days. Super Mario Run -- Nintendo's first mobile app devoted to its signature side-scrolling gaming franchise -- made its debut exclusively on devices running Apple's iOS last week with record-setting success. This week we saw Pokemon Go introduced for Apple Watch, also exclusively for Apple's smartwatch. Nintendo reports that there were 40 million downloads of Super Mario Run through Apple's App Store in its first four days of availability. The record-breaking pace followed a third-party report that just 25 million downloads had taken place in that time. Heavy initial activity doesn't necessarily mean Nintendo has a financial hit on its hands. Super Mario Run is a free download, and a third-party report indicates that fewer than 10% of the players downloading the game have paid over the $10 price to unlock more features and loosen up restrictions. Super Mario Run is drumming up mixed reviews, but a lot of the knocks have to do with the limitations for the free account. There's no doubt we'll be hearing mixed reviews for the Pokemon Go Apple Watch app, but in this case mostly on the restrictions of the small smartwatch screens in duplicating this summer's hot app experience. An unlikely pairing Image source: Niantic Labs. It makes sense for Nintendo to team up with Apple to make sure that Super Mario Run and a smartwatch version of Pokemon Go hit the market on Apple devices first. Android has the wider established base, but Apple fans spend money.  Aiming for iPhone and iPad owners with Super Mario Run is a bet that folks will pay $10 for a mobile game if it's iconic enough. The Apple Watch move with Pokemon Go is simply a matter of riding the only smartwatch platform that matters.  Still, it's an odd partnership, considering where this relationship stood just a few years ago. Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime had some choice words in attacking Apple back in 2010, when it seemed as if Apple's gadgetry was eating into the popularity of Nintendo's portable system. "It doesn't look like their platform is a viable profit platform for game development, because so many of the games are free versus paid downloads," Fils-Aime said at the time.  Fils-Aime also dismissed mobile gaming as a niche where gamers were treated to just snacks instead of hearty meals. A lot has changed now that Nintendo is turning to Apple gamers first, and shareholders are seeing the difference. Nintendo stock soared 29% the day Apple unveiled Super Mario Run, a big deal since it stands to make a lot more money this time than it does with its minority stake in Pokemon Go. However, we can't dismiss what Apple stands to gain here. Nintendo's preference to iOS vindicates the premium consumers pay for Apple products. The $10 price point for the premium version of the game should also educate users to pay more for their mobile diversions. Both companies have a lot riding on this month's new Nintendo iOS releases.  Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's iOS 10 Adoption Rate Sits at 63% with a Spike Likely to Occur after Santa is Finished his Run Tonight | Main | Patently Apple Wishes our Friends and Colleagues a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year » December 24, 2016 Part 1: Nokia Files an 8 Count Patent Infringement Case against Apple Primarily Focused on the H.264 Standard   On December 21, Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Files a Major Antitrust Case against Acacia Research Corporation Pointing to a Conspiracy with Nokia Corporation." I had written a report in September wondering if the EU Commission would open an antitrust case against Nokia for having their patents being behind a patent troll case that beat Apple. So it was satisfying to see Apple launch their lawsuit this week on that very basis of Nokia being behind the Acacia Research case. Even Florian Mueller of FOSS Patents weighed in and accused Nokia of being a patent troll in a report this week. He stated that "Today's announcement by Nokia shows how much of a troll it has become."   Nokia responded to Apple's lawsuit by hammering them with a series of patent infringement cases covering 40 patents in 11 countries. The FOSS Patents report noted above then noted that Apple had launched an antitrust case against Nokia in Europe as can be seen in the graphic of a docket below.   Thus far Patently Apple has been able to access two of Nokia's lawsuits filed in the Texas Eastern District Court. Both note the Plaintiff as formally being Nokia Technologies Oy and Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc. The focus of this first lawsuit is the H.264 standard. Apple is part of the AVC/H.264 patent list and pays fees to the MPEG LA patent pool for use of the technology.   The list published by this group shows the patents that make up the standard. Apple contributed to this standard and is a legal participant in this standard along with many other companies and hundreds of supporting patents. I was unable to find Nokia, Alcatel or Lucent listed as a participant or having patents regarding the standard. If Apple has a license with this patent pool, it's difficult to understand Nokia's argument. Yet with that said, below is Nokia's formal complaint.   The Complaint: Nature of the Action   Nokia states in their formal complaint before the court that "Each of the Nokia Patents-in-Suit (defined below) relates to video coding. For example, each of the Nokia Patents-in-Suit include claims directed to encoding or decoding video compliant with the H.264 Advanced Video Coding standard promulgated by the International Telecommunication Union ("ITU"). Apple's products, which support H.264 video, including the iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple Watch, Mac computer products, and Apple digital media players such as Apple TV, infringe Nokia's patents asserted in this case. Nokia's patents asserted in this suit cover fundamental and innovative contributions made by Nokia to video coding technologies, including the H.264 standard, that reduce the amount of digital data needed to represent video. Nokia's innovations allow video to be transmitted over communications networks, such as cellular networks, with high quality and dramatically lower bandwidth requirements. Nokia's innovations also significantly reduce the size of video files, allowing more efficient storage on mobile devices such as the iPhone and iPad. Apple has benefited greatly from Nokia's innovations, which have enabled Apple products to more efficiently and effectively stream video over communications networks.   Despite all the advantages that have been enjoyed by Apple, Apple has steadfastly refused to agree to license Nokia's H.264 patents on reasonable terms. Dozens of companies have licensed Nokia's patents for use in their products that support the H.264 standard at Nokia's established royalty rates. Apple, however, refuses to pay Nokia's established royalty rates. Apple's unwillingness to negotiate a license to Nokia's patented H.264 technology in good faith has forced Nokia to institute this case for patent infringement."   The Eight Counts of Patent Infringement against Apple   For those wanting to delve into this case a little deeper technically could do so by reviewing the patents that Nokia alleges that Apple Inc. has infringed upon as listed below:    Patent 7,532,808 entitled "Method for Coding Motion in a Video Sequence," Patent 6,950,469 entitled "Method for Sub-Pixel Value Interpolation," Patent 8,036,273 entitled "Method for Sub-Pixel Value Interpolation," Patent 8,144,764 entitled "Video Coding," Patent 6,968,005 entitled "Video coding," Patent 6,711,211 entitled "Method for Encoding and Decoding Video Information, a Motion Compensated Video Encoder and a Corresponding Decoder," Patent 6,856,701 entitled "Method and System for Context-Based Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding," and Patent 6,680,974 entitled "Methods and apparatus for context selection of block transform coefficients"   In addition to providing you with a full list of linked patents to review is a full copy of Nokia's formal complaint below. In here you'll be able to see Nokia's technical arguments and political posturing as it relates to Apple's alleged infringement of their intellectual property regarding the H.246 standard.   Nokia Technologies & Alcatel-Lucent USA vs Apple Inc Case 01440 by Jack Purcher on Scribd   The patent infringement case presented in today's report was filed in the Texas Eastern District Court. The Presiding Judge in this case is noted as being Judge Rodney Gilstrap.   Also see Part Two: Nokia's Second Patent Infringement Lawsuit against Apple Covers Qualcomm RF Technology, Siri and the iPhone's Design   About Making Comments on this Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

Game Day: Our Favorite Games of 2016 By John Voorhees 2016 was a good year for iOS games. The trouble is, great games can be hard to find because there are so many released every day. That's why we started the weekly Game Day column, which is dedicated to combing the App Store for fun and interesting games. We have covered 28 games since Game Day began in May. Looking back over that collection, there are certain ones that stand out more than others. Here are our six favorite games from the past year. Le Parker – Sous Chef Extraordinaire Le Parker was featured on Game Day just a few weeks ago. It's a classic platformer with beautiful pixel art and a soundtrack of over 20 songs that add to the experience. The backstory and gameplay are reminiscent of classic Mario games from Nintendo, but Le Parker brings it own style to the genre through unique characters and thoughtful level design that make you want to go back and replay parts of the game over and over to uncover all the surprises. There are a lot of retro, pixelated platformers on iOS. Too many look better than they play, which has made some players skeptical of the genre. Le Parker is different. It's the complete package with clever, challenging gameplay to go along with it's excellent visuals and sound design. F1 2016 F1 2016 is the closest to a console-level quality game that I played on the Apple TV this year. It's not surprising Apple chose to show off F1 as part of its iPhone event in September. The game, which runs on iOS devices and the Apple TV, has some of the best graphics I’ve seen on either platform. There’s incredible attention to detail and with a Bluetooth controller on an Apple TV, I nearly forgot I wasn’t playing a PS4 title. F1 is a deep game, including 21 courses from around the world and 11 real F1 teams with 22 drivers. F1 also takes advantage of some of iOS's latest features like haptic feedback on the iPhone 7. When you leave a course or bump a competitor, the iPhone 7 vibrates in response, making the game more immersive. F1 2016 sets a high bar for future iOS racing games. Mini Metro I was addicted to Mini Metro immediately and judging from what I’ve seen on Twitter, I’m not alone. The game is a transportation simulator. You build stations and deploy trains to keep the citizens of cities around the world happy and get them to their destinations on time. When train platforms become overcrowded, the game ends. The spare, colorful design of Mini Metro is beautiful. A finished game often looks like a work of art. I also like that you can replay the evolution of your rail system as a sharable GIF. Severed Severed is from Drinkbox Studios, the maker of Guacamelee!, an indie game that debuted on a number of major consoles. You play as Sasha, a one-armed warrior in search of her missing family. The game plays out in a series of dungeons where you encounter monsters that you battle with your sword. The touch-based sword slashing works well on iOS adding a sense of immediacy and action to the story. What drew me to this game initially was its unusual and striking artwork. Apple seems to have noticed too because it named Severed the best iPad game of 2016. Like many of my favorites this year, there is a depth to Severed that goes well beyond the visuals and extends to the story, gameplay, and touch mechanics that work in harmony to make Severed a standout. Reigns Reigns is a card-based adventure game with a lot of personality and a great sense of humor. As ruler of a kingdom, you are faced with a series of choices that affect the path your reign takes. Your choices are made by swiping left and right on cards. With each choice, the strength of your subjects, the church, and your army ebbs and flows. Keeping everyone happy and all the variables in balance is tricky. I was glad to see Reigns named a runner-up by Apple in its best of 2016 awards for iPhone games. In a crowded store with many similar games, Reigns struck a unique and fun chord this year. Don't Grind Don't Grind by Laser Dog Games fully embraces iOS as a mobile platform with excellent one-handed play. The game is designed around the simplest mechanic possible – tapping the screen to keep a character aloft and out of harm's way above two giant spinning blades. As you tap, lasers and other obstacles appear to try to hasten your demise. What makes Don't Grind work is a careful balance of tricky obstacle avoidance, star collecting, cute collectible characters, and a lighthearted, bouncy soundtrack. iOS is a unique platform. Games designed around thumbsticks and buttons don't usually translate well to iOS's touch-based environment. It's a fundamental difference that isn't new, but it’s one that separates the best iOS games from the rest of the pack when embraced as part of a game’s design. That's true for every one of my favorite games of 2016. Each is unique, but they share simple, elegant mechanics that aren’t a barrier to enjoying the game, focusing instead on artwork, sound design, story, and other elements that make each delightful in its own way. — Note: Game Day is taking a short holiday break, but will return January 7.

Published Fri, Sep 30, 2011  |  Justin Fritz, Executive Editor Almost a year and a half after Apple released its first iPad into the wild, its tablet lineup continues to dominate the industry. Competing devices from Research in Motion (Nasdaq: RIMM), Samsung (SEO: 005930), HTC (TPE: 2498), Motorola (NYSE: MMI), LG (NYSE: LPL), Acer (TPE: 2353) and Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) haven’t been able to derail Apple’s success thus far. But its reign could be coming to an end. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) just announced that it’s releasing what looks to be the king of the Android tablet lineup – the Kindle Fire. So what makes me – along with several analysts sounding off in the blogosphere – think this device is on the path to tablet stardom? Two reasons: price and speed. Amazon’s Gambling With a Stacked Deck With all the tablet hype this year, it’s shocking that only about 8% of adults actually own one.  It could have something to do with the fact that they’re not exactly cheap. Consider: Buying a base model iPad 2, Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, or HTC Flyer would set you back $499…  The 7-inch Galaxy Tab runs $370… and Acer’s Iconia costs around $400. That’s why consumers went crazy and scooped up all available HP (NYSE: HPQ) TouchPads when the company slashed the price to $99 in August. And it’s also why everyone was shocked when Amazon priced its 7-inch Kindle Fire at a mere $199. Piper Jaffray analyst, Gene Muster’s, says Amazon will actually lose about $50 for each Kindle Fire sold. So is this a bonehead move or a savvy business decision? I’m thinking the latter.  Fast Company says it best: CEO Jeff Bezos “isn’t concerned… [as] the world’s largest online retailer… it can use that leverage to stomach a short-term hit for a long-term future of getting more customers hooked on Amazon’s services and content.” Either way, the shockingly low price is bound to push fence sitters over the edge as we approach the holiday season. And the competition is already shaking in their boots… Immediately after Amazon announced the Fire, the price of RIMM’s Playbook tablet was dropped to $299 at major retailers. And rumor has it RIMM will soon follow HP’s lead with a $99 fire sale. But price isn’t all this tablet has going for it… Tapping into Amazon’s Cloud Services Kindle Fire’s web browser – called Silk – is where the tablet really vaults over the competition. Silk allows consumers to tap directly into Amazon’s cloud-computing infrastructure. It’s the same technology that helps companies like Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) keep web traffic and streaming content flowing even when they experience spikes in volume. As Amazon puts it: “A typical web page requires 80 files served from 13 different domains. This takes a regular browser hundreds of round trips, and adds seconds to page load times… Silk uses the power and speed of [our cloud] server fleet to retrieve all of the components of a website simultaneously, and delivers them to Kindle Fire in a single, fast stream.” Translation: It promises to be the fastest tablet browsing experience you can get right now. Granted, the Kindle Fire is fighting an uphill battle. According to a recent survey by Baird Research & Insights, 94% of potential tablet buyers are currently ogling the iPad. But once Amazon’s game-changing device hits the market in November – with its attractive price and silver bullet browser speeds – it’s certainly capable of poaching a fair share of would-be iPad buyers. As always, I’ll be tracking its progress very closely. So stay tuned.

Comments (2) Glenn says: September 30, 2011 at 4:51 pm Seriously? The Amazon Fire is no competition for the iPad. Apple has nothing to worry about here. The makers of low end Android tablets certainly should be taking notice though. [Reply] joke says: October 1, 2011 at 2:00 pm B&N is coming out with Nook Color 2 shortly that will have Netflix app among others. Kindle Fire is no more media tablet than even current Nook Color, most specs are the same, just a bit faster. Kindle Fire doesn’t have microSD slot that Nook Color has thus it is stuck with 6 GB usable internal storage unlike Nook Color that can get up to 32 GB card in. Nook Color still has the best on the market anti-glare coated screen that is better for reading/viewing outside. Also, current e-Ink Nook Simpletouch is still better designed than even the new Kindle Touch with battery lasting two months with ONE hour reading with Wi-Fi off thus it’s still twice as long as new Kindle’s two months with HALF and hour a day with Wi-Fi off. It looks like Kindle didn’t get any battery improvement in the new model. More, Kindle Touch still flashes black on each page turn while Nook Touch reduces the flashing by 80%. If you walk in with the Nook to Barnes & Noble store, you’re allowed to read ANY available eBook for free while in the store via free provided in the store Wi-Fi. Also, the prices that you hear around for the new Kindles are all for models that force you to look at advertisements. Normal units cost $30-50 more. For example, Kindle Touch goes for $139 that is the same as Nook Touch while Kindle Touch 3G goes for $189.

Nokia announced on December 21st that it had sued Apple for patent infringement in the U.S. and Germany. Since agreeing a license covering some patents from the Nokia Technologies portfolio in 2011, Apple has declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other of its patented inventions which are used by many of Apple's products. Ilkka Rahnasto, head of Patent Business at Nokia, said: "Through our sustained investment in research and development, Nokia has created or contributed to many of the fundamental technologies used in today's mobile devices, including Apple products. After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple's use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights." In retaliation Apple removed Withings products from its online store. Withings was acquired by Nokia early this year for $192 million. Additionally, Apple has also sued Nokia. FossPatents says that Apple is telling the courts: Nokia, after failing as a mobile device maker, changed its positions on FRAND licensing of standard-essential patents and conspired with various PAEs in order to bring numerous royalty demands and infringement lawsuits against Apple and other industry players and with the objective of circumventing its original FRAND licensing commitments. Nokia has since expanded its lawsuit against Apple to eleven countries. Follow iClarified Comments (7) Add Comment Nokia - What that - December 25, 2016 at 4:28pm Nokia. "An innovation leader". This is what their website claims. What the hell !!! They are still living in the 90's. They released the new Nokia 150. Who the hell is that trash for? Even my 2 year old daughter knows how to use an iPhone. Serious Nokia? Why not just bluddy sell your patents to Apple, or any other company for that matter and close your doors. There is absolutely nothing happening at Nokia. No kid today even knows or hears those words. Its sad but a fact that they, like Blackberry and Sony Ericsson lost the mobile plot. They refused to keep up with technology and take on the competition and have fallen way too far behind. My hat off to Samsung for at least giving Apple some competition - they have keep up and in many cases even have innovated way before Apple. Also hats off to Microsoft for good hardware design "Windows is still crap", and to Google for stepping up. But for Nokia to come out of the woodwork now? mmmmmm abit late.

I promise, there was never a comparison. They will fail again, as miserably as the last time.

Withings products disappear from Apple stores following Nokia patent kerfuffle Posted Dec 24, 2016 by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story Here’s how to track Santa on Christmas Eve As most of us were gearing up for a relatively quiet holiday season, Apple and Nokia were getting ready to go to battle, reigniting a war that had seemingly gone cold in 2011 with a reported $720 million settlement for the use of a number of patents. Earlier this week, Apple filed suit in California, alleging that Nokia removed certain patents from the deal for the purpose of “extorting excessive royalties.” It later added in a statement to TechCrunch that the one-time smartphone leader was “using the tactics of a patent troll.” For its part, Nokia filed suit in three German cities and ground zero for patent battles here in the States, the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas over 32 patents applying to a wide range of smartphone hardware and software. It’s probably too late to do any major sales damage ahead of the holiday, but in the wake of the myriad suits, Withings products have gone missing from Apple’s online store. Attempting to purchase the company’s fitness devices like a smart scale or blood pressure monitor will pop up the cheeky error, “Looking for something? We thought so. However, the product you’re looking for is no longer available on apple.com.” They appear to have gone missing from the company’s retail locations as well — the company’s brick and mortars don’t tend to stock anything you won’t find online. We’ve reached out to the company for comment, but the timing does seem curious, with Nokia having completed its acquisition of the French electronics company over the summer. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Nokia Founded 1865 Overview Nokia is a Finnish multinational communications corporation engaged in the manufacturing of mobile devices, network infrastructure, location-based technologies, and advanced technologies businesses worldwide.

Here’s What You Can Buy iPhone and iPad Mac Got an Apple or iTunes Gift Card? Here’s What You Can Buy Tim Brookes December 24, 2016 24-12-2016 8 minutes Got an Apple or iTunes Gift Card? Here’s What You Can Buy Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email Ads by Google Snagged an Apple Store, iTunes or Apple Music gift card this holiday season? You might be wondering exactly what you can buy with it. This of course depends on exactly which gift card you’ve received. Apple’s credit is versatile for several things. Here’s a guide to what each gift card can be used for. We also have a few recommendations for things you might want to pick up. Which Gift Card Do You Have? There are three types of gift card sold by Apple: iTunes, Apple Music, and Apple Store. These cards can only be redeemed in the same country they were purchased in. So, a U.S. gift card will only work on the U.S. iTunes Store, or in a U.S. retail location, or an online outlet. An iTunes gift card can only be used for buying software, music, and other similar downloadable products. Think of it as Apple’s credit for virtual products. iTunes gift cards credit the iTunes account associated with your Apple ID, and can be used against in-app purchases. Apple Music gift cards can only be used to redeem an Apple Music subscription. They’re only available for three and twelve month purchases. When your gift card runs out your account will be charged as normal, unless you turn off auto-renewal in your Apple Music settings. The Apple Store gift card is only good on Apple’s own website, over the phone, or in a physical retail location. It can be used against any purchase in-store, whether it’s Apple hardware, a third-party accessory, or boxed software. You can use it online or over the phone by quoting the code on the back. Ads by Google Spending Apple Store Gift Cards You don’t need to “redeem” an Apple Store gift card, just spend it at a store like cash. Unless specified, there’s no expiry date on an Apple Store gift card. Here are a few ideas for spending your store credit. A New iPhone, iPad, or Mac Even if your gift card doesn’t cover the cost of a new Apple gadget, you can use your credit against any purchase. That means a new iPhone, iPad, Mac, or other pricey Apple product will be cheaper if you use your Apple Store credit against it. The new iPhone 7 is great iPhone 7 Plus Review & Giveaway iPhone 7 Plus Review & Giveaway This year's iPhone 7 models break with convention.

If you’ve been considering a big purchase for a while, an Apple Store gift card might be the perfect excuse to go right ahead. Get an Apple Watch The new Apple Watch is waterproof to 50 meters Apple Watch Series 2 Review & Giveaway Apple Watch Series 2 Review & Giveaway It's Apple's busiest time of year.

Siri on your wrist is super-useful and it’s a powerful tool for tracking physical activity and workouts. Despite all this many users are unsure when to pull the trigger and buy one. Starting at $369, the Apple Watch Series 2 isn’t cheap. It’s also not that expensive, especially if you’ve got a nice discount courtesy of an Apple Store gift card. Maybe you’ve already got an Apple Watch, and want to buy a new band to replace your old one? You can use your gift card for that too.

Or Buy Accessories Most of what Apple sells in its physical and online retail stores is third party accessories. This includes headphones and speakers, like the new Beats Solo3 with W1 chip ($300) and Bose SoundLink II ($130) Bluetooth speaker. You can get Mac accessories like the Magic Trackpad 2 ($130) or a keyboard cover for your MacBook Pro ($25). Also, for sale are game controllers like the SteelSeries Nimbus and PXN Speedy iOS Gamepad Shootout: GameVice, PXN Speedy & SteelSeries Nimbus Review & Giveaway iOS Gamepad Shootout: GameVice, PXN Speedy & SteelSeries Nimbus Review & Giveaway It's taken a while (nearly two years, to be exact) but the iPhone and iPad are finally getting some quality gaming peripherals.

Best of all you can use your gift card against the purchase. Though the policy and price differs depending on the device you’re buying it for, it’s a pretty worthwhile investment particularly for iPhone owners. Using Your iTunes Credit To use an iTunes Gift card, you’ll first need to redeem it. Once you’ve redeemed the credit, it’s added to your iTunes account and can’t be transferred. Any purchases you make will be subtracted from that balance. You can redeem iTunes credit using an iOS device or via iTunes on a Mac or PC. Redeem on an iPhone or iPad Launch the App Store. On the Featured tab scroll to the bottom of the page and tap Redeem. Tap Use Camera to redeem by scanning the barcode, or enter your code manually using the option at the bottom of the page. Redeem via iTunes for Mac or Windows Launch iTunes and choose Music, Apps, or Films from the drop-down in the top left. Click on the Store tab and scroll to the bottom of the page. Under the Manage heading, click Redeem. You can check your balance too. On an iPhone scroll to the bottom of the Featured tab and your balance will appear alongside your Apple ID. On iTunes for Mac or Windows, you’ll find it in the top-right corner of the Store tab. Buy iOS or tvOS Apps & Games Perhaps the most common use for iTunes credit these days is to buy mobile apps and games. Considering the relatively low cost of items on the App Store, your credit will likely last you a while. As previously mentioned, in-app purchases can be made using iTunes credit too. If you’re looking for some fun games to play now, Super Mario Run (free, $9.99 to unlock) is a good place to start. Reigns ($2.99) is a cheeky roguelike adventure game of swiping left and right, perfect for quick blasts on your iPhone. Hitman GO ($1.99) is another must-play mobile game, especially if you’re a fan of the console titles. You may also want to use your credit against some genuinely useful apps. Ulysses ($24.99) is the gold standard of iOS word processors Word Processing On Your iPad? We Compare The Best Apps Word Processing On Your iPad? We Compare The Best Apps If you've got some words to be processing on your iPad, we've got the apps to help you do it. Read More , and a gift card would probably help take the sting out of its high-ticket price. CARROT Weather ($5.99) is a hyperlocal weather forecast bot that’s built on Easter eggs and snark. Tweetbot 4 ($9.99) is probably the best Twitter app you can buy, while Reeder 3 ($4.99) is the ultimate iOS RSS reader. Buy Mac Apps & Games iTunes credit also works on the Mac App Store. The apps and games you’ll find there are quite a bit more expensive than their mobile counterparts. But as they are more powerful, you can get real work done. You might be able to get a nice discount on Apple’s pro-level video editor Final Cut Pro ($300) to bring it within your price range. If you’re looking for a good image editor The Best Free & Paid Image Editors for Mac OS X The Best Free & Paid Image Editors for Mac OS X We thought it was about time we compiled a list of our favourite raster image editors for Mac OS X. Read More but don’t fancy Adobe’s subscription model, Affinity Photo ($40) is modestly priced and sufficiently powerful. Or if you’re looking for a text editor to get some serious blogging done, Desk 3.0 ($14.99) won’t break the bank. We usually recommend you avoid buying games from the Mac App Store Why You Should Avoid Buying Games From The Mac App Store Why You Should Avoid Buying Games From The Mac App Store The Mac App Store doesn't hold a candle to the same store used by iPhone and iPad users to guzzle apps, games and in-app purchases. Read More , but the selection has certainly grown over the last year or two. If you’re one for narrative-driven first person mysteries, you can’t go wrong with the beautiful Firewatch ($20) which is worth every penny. Mini Metro ($9.99) is a fun strategy puzzler about managing real life public transport infrastructure, while Steamworld Heist ($30) is a turn-based tactical shootout game with a bit of a twist. Music, Movies, TV You can also buy media on iTunes, which is what the service sold when it was first established. Buy albums from your favorite artists, or even use your iTunes credit against an Apple Music subscription (just be aware you’ll have to cough up yourself when the credit expires). You can also choose to buy or rent movies and TV programs, the latter of which is much cheaper. Once you’ve redeemed an iTunes gift card, you can also use it to buy content via your Apple TV. Don’t Forget Books If you use your iPhone or iPad as an eReader, you can also use iTunes credit in the iBooks Store on both a mobile device or Mac computer. That includes graphic novels, non-fiction, interactive books, but not necessarily audiobooks (you can find those in the regular iTunes store alongside music and TV though).

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Santa brings comfort to traumatized girl Saturday Dec 24, 2016 at 8:45 AM Dec 24, 2016 at 8:45 AM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — Wearing a wide-brimmed hat in an attempt to conceal her scars, a smiling 5-year-old Aunnaleina Medina carefully crept toward Santa Claus before giving him a hug. Wiping away tears, Lannette Medina told the Daily Press her daughter’s encounter with Santa, at James A. Woody Park in Apple Valley last week, was the first time the little girl has let down her guard after a pit bull bit into her left cheek last month. “This is the first time she’s really wanted to be out in public,” said Lannette Medina, 36, as her daughter leaned into Santa Claus, her eyes sparkling with joy as she stared at his bearded face. “She’s been afraid of almost everything until she saw Santa Claus sitting out here at the park. That’s when she asked me if she could meet him." Lannette Medina said, "Between St. Mary’s and Loma Linda hospital," Aunnaleina received 100 stitches, with her mother having to "syringe-feed her for days" during her recovery. The little girl is expected to undergo plastic surgery in six months. After Aunnaleina was attacked at a friend’s home, she began to suffer from “depression” and became somewhat of a recluse as many people stared at her scar and children mocked her appearance when they got a glimpse of her. "She's afraid of loud noises and she now has separation anxiety," Lannette Medina said. "She's progressing a little everyday." Lannette Medina said Aunnaleina wears a large hat “for comfort” and to hide her scars as she goes to the grocery store, school events and family outings with her mother. “We were dropping my other daughter off at the Apple Valley Police Activity League boxing program when my daughter saw Santa,” Lannette Medina said. “That’s when Aunnaleina came out of her shell and her entire expression changed.” Town of Apple Valley spokeswoman Charlene Engeron, who escorted Santa to James A. Woody as part of the Town’s meet “Santa at the Park” event, also brushed away tears as she listened to Lannette Medina explain to Santa what had happened to her daughter. Engeron told the Daily Press she was left speechless by the “sweet and beautiful” encounter that occurred minutes before Santa was about to leave the park. “My heart was broken when I saw how people reacted to my daughter, but she’s a fighter and that’s why I call her 'Aunnaleina the brave,'” said Lannettee Medina, as the sun began to set over nearby homes. Lannette Medina told the Daily Press the exchange between Santa and Aunnaleina was a bright moment in a dark period of time for her family which is experiencing some financial hardship. Recently, her husband lost his job, the family truck broke down and they recently discovered the owner of the dog didn't have homeowners insurance to cover some of their daughter's medical expenses. Despite all of that, though, Lannette Median said her family is blessed that Aunnaleina is recovering and the family will be together for Christmas. “It gave me great joy that I could bring a family and little girl some comfort after she was traumatized,” Santa said. “Being Santa Claus is a big responsibility and it’s important to be ready to give a listening ear and caring heart. This is why I do this every year.” The High Desert Phoenix Foundation is accepting donations to help with Aunnaleina's medical expenses.

Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Dec 24, 2016 at 11:13AM Image source: Nintendo. There's a lot of Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) going on at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) these days. Super Mario Run -- Nintendo's first mobile app devoted to its signature side-scrolling gaming franchise -- made its debut exclusively on devices running Apple's iOS last week with record-setting success. This week we saw Pokemon Go introduced for Apple Watch, also exclusively for Apple's smartwatch. Nintendo reports that there were 40 million downloads of Super Mario Run through Apple's App Store in its first four days of availability. The record-breaking pace followed a third-party report that just 25 million downloads had taken place in that time. Heavy initial activity doesn't necessarily mean Nintendo has a financial hit on its hands. Super Mario Run is a free download, and a third-party report indicates that fewer than 10% of the players downloading the game have paid over the $10 price to unlock more features and loosen up restrictions. Super Mario Run is drumming up mixed reviews, but a lot of the knocks have to do with the limitations for the free account. There's no doubt we'll be hearing mixed reviews for the Pokemon Go Apple Watch app, but in this case mostly on the restrictions of the small smartwatch screens in duplicating this summer's hot app experience. An unlikely pairing Image source: Niantic Labs. It makes sense for Nintendo to team up with Apple to make sure that Super Mario Run and a smartwatch version of Pokemon Go hit the market on Apple devices first. Android has the wider established base, but Apple fans spend money.  Aiming for iPhone and iPad owners with Super Mario Run is a bet that folks will pay $10 for a mobile game if it's iconic enough. The Apple Watch move with Pokemon Go is simply a matter of riding the only smartwatch platform that matters.  Still, it's an odd partnership, considering where this relationship stood just a few years ago. Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime had some choice words in attacking Apple back in 2010, when it seemed as if Apple's gadgetry was eating into the popularity of Nintendo's portable system. "It doesn't look like their platform is a viable profit platform for game development, because so many of the games are free versus paid downloads," Fils-Aime said at the time.  Fils-Aime also dismissed mobile gaming as a niche where gamers were treated to just snacks instead of hearty meals. A lot has changed now that Nintendo is turning to Apple gamers first, and shareholders are seeing the difference. Nintendo stock soared 29% the day Apple unveiled Super Mario Run, a big deal since it stands to make a lot more money this time than it does with its minority stake in Pokemon Go. However, we can't dismiss what Apple stands to gain here. Nintendo's preference to iOS vindicates the premium consumers pay for Apple products. The $10 price point for the premium version of the game should also educate users to pay more for their mobile diversions. Both companies have a lot riding on this month's new Nintendo iOS releases.  Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Michael H. Martin gym dedication scheduled for Jan. 7 in Apple Valley Saturday Dec 24, 2016 at 9:01 AM Dec 24, 2016 at 9:01 AM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Friends, family and community leaders will gather on Jan. 7 to dedicate the gymnasium at James A. Woody Park in honor of the late Mike Martin for “a life well played.” Martin, who was known as “Big” Mike to thousands of Apple Valley youngsters, was “a non-stop volunteer” and a 15-year employee of the former Apple Valley Recreation and Parks District. He served as a Parks and Recreation commissioner for more than 10 years and was instrumental in programming at the previously unnamed gym where he influenced the growth of the youth basketball league and implemented the first pee wee sports programs for Apple Valley. Following his sudden death on Dec. 31, 2015, the Town Council voted 5-0 in July to name the gym and place a dedication plaque at its entrance detailing Martin’s legacy, after a presentation from Parks and Recreation Manager Ralph Wright, who said, “Mike's legacy exemplified everything in the criteria required for naming." Mayor Scott Nassif told the Daily Press on Wednesday that — to his knowledge — the vote signaled the “first time we’ve dedicated an existing facility to someone.” “That says a lot about Mike,” Nassif said. “We don’t take naming facilities or parks lightly, but this was a no-brainer.” Nassif, who owns several Napa Auto Parts stores, said he first met Martin “when he was a young man.” “His father was one of my first customers in Apple Valley,” he said. “He used to come in and help his dad a lot. It was fun to watch him grow and become a part of the community over the years. I was proud of his accomplishments and how he tried to make the town better. He did a fantastic job.” At last count in September, more than $5,300 had been raised for the plaque and signage on the gym, according to Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin, Mike's wife. Mike and Kathie Martin were married 14 years and — at the July 12 meeting — Kathie Martin said she and her family appreciated the naming, but joked that her husband, who preferred to avoid the spotlight, “would be mortified over it.” Kathie Martin said in addition to the gym dedication, a bench will be placed in Civic Center Park to honor the man who molded a generation of “gym rats” through gentle guidance. Thanks to “Big” Mike, the gym was and shall remain a safe haven where the youth of Apple Valley can come to play. The community is invited to the dedication ceremony, which is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Jan. 7. The soon-to-be named Michael H. Martin Gymnasium is located at 13413 Navajo Road, next to the James A. Woody Community Center. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254. Follow him on Twitter @DP_MatthewCabe.

Mat Smith, @thatmatsmith 12.24.16 in Design Comments 465 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Engadget; Logo by L-Dopa In addition to everything else that happened in tech this year, something small, cute and unassuming wormed its way into your smartphone, your social network and even your MacBook keyboard. While emoji have been around a while, this was the year these pictographs firmly lodged themselves into our lives. It's become less like immature shorthand and more like another language. Apple and Google both showed they were both taking the tiny icons seriously. The iPhone's iOS 10 added search and predictive features for emoji to its keyboard, making it even easier to inject winks and explosions into everything you type. (Apple also added emoji functions to the OLED Touch Bar on its new MacBook Pro.) Google took it even further, with its latest Android keyboard and gBoard on iOS both including predictive emoji. The company even baked them into its new AI assistant, Allo. The assistant can play emoji-based movie guessing games. In fact, the internet juggernaut has a real emoji crush: In early December, its main Twitter account even started offering local search results if you tweeted an emoji at it. Granted, the results are ... mixed. It won't be replacing Yelp anytime soon, but it demonstrates how emoji are moving beyond their quick-and-dirty text-message roots. Quicker access to emoji on your phone also comes at a time when most of our digital interactions (or at least mine) happen through smartphones. It's become easier to use emoji, and new uses are introduced all the time. GoDaddy launched a service that allows you to create and register website addresses written purely in emoji. It could open a new wave of easily memorable sites -- and there's no shortage of emoji combinations available. Perhaps the biggest challenge in use of emoji is how open to interpretation many of the pictograms are. More than the written or spoken word, emoji can be easily misunderstood -- a fact compounded by the subtle visual differences between identical symbols in different emoji fonts. Send an iPhone emoji to someone using Google hangouts on a PC, and they might not pick up the exact same meaning. They can also deliver entirely new uses, beyond the simple word was once meant to represent. There's a reason for the popularity of the eggplant emoji and it has nothing to do with moussaka. This vagueness and playfulness is part of their charm; some things are just funnier or easier to say in emojis. Occasionally, they can be haunting: It's not all frivolity and euphemisms. Updates to the emoji series attempt to better represent modern culture and society. Unicode's latest character set for 2016 had a strong focus on gender and jobs, offering dancing bunny-boys and female police officers in an effort strike a better balance between the sexes. It even added the option of a third, gender-neutral option -- although that's apparently proved more difficult to visually express. This year, Sony Pictures announced that it's making a CGI feature film based entirely around emoji. It sounds like a terrible idea, but the studio believes it can make money from it. (There might even be more than one movie.) The effect of emoji has even been noted by one of the world's most prestigious design museums, with the Museum of Modern Art inducting emoji earlier this year. The debut set of symbols, designed for Japanese phone carrier Docomo back in 1999, is now filed under the same roof as the works of van Gogh and Dali. Used at the time to convey the weather and other messages (in a character-frugal way), the symbols were soon copied by other Japanese carriers, but it took another 12 years before they were translated into unicode in 2010, which Apple then expanded when it launched the original iPhone the following year. So have we reached peak emoji? The initial set of low-pixel characters totaled 176. Now, at the end of 2016, there's over 1,300 of them -- and no shortage of new suggestions.

(photo courtesy of Fitbit) Relaxnews Published Saturday, December 24, 2016 12:52PM EST The fitness tracker trend has shown no signs of slowing down throughout 2016, with this year seeing a variety of new brands and products launching with innnovative new ways to improve our well-being. Here we round up our pick of some of the most interesting launches to come out of 2016 that will help you have a healthier and happier 2017. Remember to breathe In keeping with this year's trend for mindfulness, Fitbit launched a new version of its number-one selling fitness tracker, the Charge 2, with guided breathing sessions. As well as including the same features as its predecessor -- tracking steps, distance, pace, floors climbed, and calories burned -- the Charge 2 also uses your heart rate for its new feature, which is designed to help reduce stress and promote calm to look after both mental as well as physical health. This year Apple also released its Apple Watch Series 2 with a new Breathe App. Designed to quiet your mind and relax your body, Apple's mindfulness app offers a series of beautifully designed, soothing animations and gentle taps that guide users through a series of deep breaths. Time to Breathe reminders also help remind users to make some time for mindfulness every day. Precision for different sports and activities A new swim edition of Misfit's existing Shine 2 fitness tracker, the Speedo Shine 2 by Misfit offered swimming fans a high quality and waterproof way to track their activity with Misfit also teaming up with Speedo's Aqualab to ensure accurate tracking.

For those who prefer to get their exercise outdoors TomTom released its Adventurer fitness-tracking watch with a tougher design to handle sports such as hiking, trail running, skiing and snowboarding. Although the watch can still be used for sports such as running, cycling, swimming, and gym, the Adventurer offers added features for those who want to explore the great outdoors, including a compass, Route Exploration, and live stats for skiing including altitude, descent and gradient.

The National Security Agency can read your email. Verizon knows where you are at all times. Amazon is confident you're in the market for a new printer. We know these things about the weird world we live in, but few of us ever stop to think about what they really mean. Recently, a group of artists got together in New York City to change that. Apple doesn't have a retail store on Mulberry Street in New York City, but at a glance, you might think it does. The Glass Room exhibit borrows heavily from the Apple Store design aesthetic: white walls, white ceiling, white podium, and even helpful "inGenious" staffers in matching white hoodies (see the photo below). But nothing is for sale in The Glass Room. It's a collection of art pieces designed to make you think of how you're selling yourself, maybe without even knowing it. The exhibit is curated by Tactical Technology Collective along with The Mozilla Foundation, maker of the Firefox browser. The subjects addressed in The Glass Room are digital: online privacy, location tracking, psychographic profiling, the gamification of security, and so on. But the pieces themselves are grounded in the real world; you can see them, touch them, and in one case, smell them. Here are a few that stood out to me. Forgot Your Password? (Aram Bartholl): We're so used to massive password hacks that we barely even notice them. In fact, Yahoo recently disclosed that it had compromised at least 1 billion more of its users' passwords. Back in 2012, LinkedIn held the record for the biggest password hack—a paltry 4.6 million. For this exhibit, Bartholl printed all 4.6 million of those passwords alphabetically and bound them into volumes. (I looked for mine; it wasn't in there.) Subscribe today to the PC Magazine Digital Edition for iOS devices. Random Darknet Shopper (!Medien-gruppe Bitnik): This artist collective created an online shopping bot and gave it a budget of $100 in bitcoins. They set it loose on the dark Web to make random purchases and have them mailed to the exhibition space. No drugs or pornography arrived; just random stuff. A copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking, a Hungarian passport photo, and—featured in the Glass Room—a pair of fake Kanye West Nike Air Yeezy 2 sneakers. Online Shopping Center (Sam Levigne): Amazon does a great job of identifying what you want to buy and getting it to your quickly. As a logical (perhaps inevitable) next step, in 2014, the company was granted a patent for "predictive shopping." Levigne's art takes the concept even further. As a Glass Room "shopper," you strap on a brainwave monitor and allow an algorithm to determine what your brain looks like when you're shopping. When Levigne first conducted this experiment, he had his bot shop for him on Amazon and Alibaba whenever his brain was in the "shopping state." I tried it, but so far, Amazon hasn't sent me anything. Not all the exhibits at The Glass Room are art. Some are demos of real-world products and services. The Texas Virtual BorderWatch, for example, was a real-time camera system (live from 2008 to 2012) that let volunteers monitor the United States–Mexico border from their homes and alert authorities of infractions. Another, the Silver Mother ($299), is a monitoring solution for seniors that gives medication reminders, tracks sleep, and gives front-door alerts. And then there's Churchix, a facial-recognition system that enables churches to track attendance automatically—a whole new meaning for "witnessing." Finally, at the back of the room was a "data detox" center. For those who were moved by the exhibit and wanted to make a change in their digital lifestyle, experts at the counter explained their options. We've reviewed a lot of the tools used to manage your privacy, including Signal, Ghostery, Tor, and more. If The Glass Room made anything clear, it is that technology is the dominant force for change in the world right now. It is affecting our jobs, our home lives, our relationships, our environment, and even our bodies. I'm a big believer in technological progress, but not all of these changes are for the better. PC Magazine is committed to getting you the tools, techniques, and information you need to thrive in this new world. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go clear my browsing history.

As Hayley Platt reports, the move is a strike back at the iPhone maker's own legal action a day earlier. Video Transcript It no longer makes handsets after selling that part of the business to Microsoft two years ago. But Finnish firm Nokia still has its patents to protect. In what looks like a tit for tat spat - Nokia has accused Apple of violating 32 patents including user interfaces, software and video coding technology. And it's taking legal action. It comes a day after Apple also took legal action against Acacia Research Corp and Conversant Intellectual Property Management. Apple says they colluded with Nokia to unfairly extract and extort exorbitant revenues. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, CEBR, VICKY PRYCE, SAYING: "The smartphone market is becoming terribly competitive but of course there is also the whole issue of them becoming quite global, are they paying the right amount of tax? which of course is worrying everyone. Cleaning up their act of course is going to be quite important but for the moment they're all vying for market share." Nokia handsets once dominated the global market. But it was slow to transition to smartphones. Leaving the way clear for Apple with the iPhone in 2007. Nokia is now looking to re-enter the handset market. It's signed a 10-year licensing deal with HMD after they bought Nokia's feature phone business from Microsoft earlier this year. Nokia plans to introduce a number of new smartphone models sometime next year.

Laptops by Michelle Meyers December 24, 2016 11:24 AM PST @meymichelle Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them Apple's Phil Schiller talks up the new MacBook Pro models at an October event.Photo by CNET Apple is working with Consumers Reports to figure out why the reviews site's battery test results for the new MacBook Pro do not match the gadget giant's lab tests and field data. Consumer Reports published a surprise report Thursday saying it could not recommend any new MacBook Pro model due to its erratic, if not bad battery life. "The MacBook Pro battery life results were highly inconsistent from one trial to the next," Consumer Reports said. This is the first time a MacBook hasn't received a "recommended" designation from Consumer Reports. Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller followed up with a tweet late Friday saying Apple is "working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data." In his tweet, Schiller linked to a story from iMore that says Consumer Reports was just going for a pre-Christmas headline and should have done more testing. Consumer Reports' review says that in-house testing revealed wild fluctuations in battery life for unplugged MacBook Pro computers. In the case of the 13-inch model without a Touch Bar, for example, battery life ranged from 19.5 hours to just 4.5 hours. Apple says the devices should operate for up to 10 hours between charges. "The laptops did very well in measures of display quality and performance, but in terms of battery life, we found that the models varied dramatically from one trial to another," Consumer Reports said in a blog post about its MacBook Pro rating. It ended up giving the 15-inch MacBook Pro a score of 56 points out of 100. The 13-inch versions with and without a Touch Bar got 40 and 47, respectively, out of 100. "For the battery test, we download a series of 10 web pages sequentially, starting with the battery fully charged, and ending when the laptop shuts down," the Consumer Reports post reads. "The web pages are stored on a server in our lab, and transmitted over a Wi-Fi network set up specifically for this purpose. We conduct our battery tests using the computer's default browser -- Safari, in the case of the MacBook Pro laptops." The MacBook Pro laptops, released in the fall, haven't been as well-received as Apple would have hoped for due to issues ranging from battery life, cost, dongles required and even alleged staleness. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for more information about battery life tests and Schiller's tweet. Consumer Reports also didn't immediately respond to a requests for comment and confirmation that it's working with Apple.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Del Taco helps local family pay it forward Saturday Dec 24, 2016 at 12:43 PM Dec 24, 2016 at 12:43 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — Good Samaritan Seth Burrell said his family were in joyous shock when Del Taco officials decided to help them “pay if forward” as the family prepares to feed the homeless on Christmas Day. Burrell said Del Taco officials gave his family $100 in restaurant gift cards after the Irvine-based company read the Daily Press’ story “Pay it Forward,” which detailed how a total stranger paid for Christmas toys at the Apple Valley Wal-Mart when the Burrells came up short. During the exchange at Wal-Mart earlier this month, the stranger told Burrell to continue being humble and to “pay it forward” because, "You never know when you might need it again." “Jackie Lytle (field marketing manager) at Del Taco headquarters told me the company wanted to help us feed the homeless on Christmas Day,” Burrell, 29, said. “I was totally speechless and in shock after I spoke to her and she said they were going to give us $100 in gift cards.” Every Christmas Day, for the last nine years, the Burrell family have distributed Del Taco food and personal items to the homeless through the High Desert, the Daily Press reported. Burrell said his wife, Sandy, didn’t believe him when he delivered the "Del Taco good news," adding his entire family went into “wow mode” once the truth sunk in. According to Burrell, his 8-year-old daughter, Marissa, was “beyond excited” to find out that the family will be armed with $100 worth of Del Taco to “feed hungry bellies” this weekend. “You know Marissa, she was so excited,”Burrell said. “My other kids were excited, but they also said, ‘Let’s get a milkshake.’” Burrell said Christmas Day plans for his family include enjoying Christmas dinner, visiting family members throughout the High Desert and handing out the gift cards and warm clothing to the homeless in Apple Valley and Victorville. “It says a lot when a big restaurant chain reaches out to a family that wants to help others,” Burrell said. “We want to thank Jackie and her colleagues at Del Taco, and we want to wish everyone a Merry Christmas.” Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at 760-951-6227, RDeLa Cruz@VVDailyPress.com or on Twitter @DP_ReneDeLaCruz.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple In wake of Nokia lawsuit, Apple promptly removes Withings products from its stores Yoni Heisler BGR NewsDecember 24, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Earlier this week, the tech world experienced a blast from the past when Nokia announced that it was suing Apple for patent infringement. In a series of lawsuits that span jurisdictions across the globe, Nokia is suing Apple for infringing upon 32 distinct patents that encompass a wide swath of mobile-related areas, including UI design, antenna technology, chipset technology and more. Don't Miss: This is why you should really encrypt your iPhone Apple of course responded with an anti-trust suit of its own, alleging that Nokia was “colluding” with patent assertion entities in order to extract licensing terms from Apple at prices that are much higher than what the fair market would otherwise demand. From the looks of it, Nokia and Apple will not be settling this dispute anytime soon and we can likely look forward to a long road of litigation ahead. In the meantime, we’ve already seen some minor casualties from Apple and Nokia’s burgeoning patent dispute. Originally spotted by Mac Rumors, Apple on Friday began removing Withings accessories from its online and retail stores. Apple appears to have pulled the accessories in the last day or two, eliminating Withings products like the Body Cardio Scale, the Smart Body Analyzer, and the Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor. When searching for these products on Apple’s site, they are no longer listed as available for purchase. The reason for the removal stems from the fact that the Withings brand falls under the Nokia umbrella. Recall that Nokia acquired the France-based digital-health oriented company earlier this year for $190 million. That Apple would make this type of move should hardly come as a surprise. For starters, Apple views the ability to sell products on its online store and in its worldwide chain of retail stores as a privilege that it won’t hesitate to take away in a heartbeat. Second, we’ve already seen Apple do this before, most notably in 2014 when it removed all Bose products from its stores following a settlement of a patent dispute pertaining to noise-canceling headphone technology.

Don’t believe the hype: The 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros (Touch Bar) are the best products Apple has put out in years. The 13-inch version is a portable dream machine, and the 15-inch version, in particular, is a technological marvel. It weighs only four pounds, but is one of the most powerful 15-inch laptops available. The 15-inch Pro with Touch Bar has received excellent reviews. Laptop Magazine gave Apple’s device four-and-a-half stars. “If you’re willing to pay a premium for it, the Touch Bar-enabled MacBook Pro ($2,799 as reviewed) is the best version of Apple’s high-end notebook yet. The innovative LED strip already has a variety of practical (and plain fun) uses for creators, and it has the potential to get even better once third-party developers embrace it. It doesn’t hurt that the latest Pro is also thinner, faster and more vibrant than before.” Because of all the power in such a thin device, the battery life isn’t the most ideal on both the 13-inch and 15-inch Pros, which this author has used extensively. In all of this author’s tests (with more than one device) the battery has lasted about six hours on the 13-inch single charge with heavy use. Normal use has produced more than eight hours of use. The 15-inch MacBook Pro has averaged five hours of use with heavy use, and more than seven with average use. The new MacBook Pros certainly aren’t the type of notebooks where you can leave the charger behind. However, battery life certainly isn’t the “defect’ that some are making it out to be. Consumer Reports unleashed an anti-Christmas gift for Apple on Dec. 22. Are the MacBook Pro’s “battery problems” nothing more than clickbait? [Image by Daryl Deino] “Apple launched a new series of MacBook Pro laptops this fall, and Consumer Reports’ labs have just finished evaluating them. The laptops did very well in measures of display quality and performance, but in terms of battery life, we found that the models varied dramatically from one trial to another.” The article adds that tests revealed as little as 3.5 hours of battery life and, as a result, the new MacBook Pro series is the first not to receive recommended ratings from Consumer Reports. However, some have called foul play on Consumer Reports‘ “test.” Rene Ritchie from iMore is just one of them. “Those results make very little sense and I’d take apart my chain, link by link, until I found out what was going on. I’d check and re-check my tests, I’d watch the systems like a hawk, and I’d do everything possible to find what was causing the variance. I’d even — gasp — try testing different machines and something other than web pages to see if that revealed more information,” Ritchie points out when referring to the strangely varied results Consumer Reports claimed to test. The most interesting thing about the Consumer Reports test is that it claims that the use of the Safari browser leads to poor battery life, while the use of Chrome, a browser that has proven to be a battery life killer for every other device, leads to decent life. This could very well mean that, perhaps, something is wrong with Consumer Reports’ tests. But don’t expect most of the mainstream media to admit this. What has become known as “fake news” is a hot commodity of the mainstream media these days, where page clicks are more important than news accuracy. This isn’t to bash the credibility of Consumer Reports, which has been an amazing and mostly unbiased source for 80 years. However, even the best outlets make mistakes. The 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is overpriced but excellent. [Image by Daryl Deino] Apple bashing is the new orange these days, which used to be the new black. And Apple certainly deserves some of the backlash. For the past five years, the Cupertino company has coasted on its groundbreaking success with Steve Jobs, even though they haven’t made anything that’s exactly groundbreaking. The fact that the media used to bash products from non-Apple companies (see first 2013 Surface Pro) that would have earned high praise if made by Apple has led to the anger and backlash. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are great smartphones, but can’t compare to Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge and the Galaxy Note 7 (which was unfortunately recalled). The 9.7-inch iPad Pro is a perfectly built tablet, but there is no way it can compete with far better tablets such as the Surface Pro 4 when it comes to replacing a laptop. The Apple Watch is a useful product, but not even close to being the groundbreaking device Apple touted it as. However, the new MacBook Pro notebooks shouldn’t even be mentioned with these other products. Both the 13- and 15-inch versions are compelling in design, display, and keyboard. The main problem is that they are severely overpriced. And even though the Touch Bar is cool, it hasn’t proven anything beyond a gimmick (at least for now). But the MacBook Pros are not even close to being defective or victims of bad quality control. It’s a shame that fake news has traveled from the political arena to the technology industry.

Nokia reignites Apple patent battle with a spate of new lawsuits Posted Dec 21, 2016 by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story Apps for holiday shopping Five years after burying the hatchet with Apple, Nokia’s back at it again. The one-time phone-making juggernaut announced this week that it’s ready to go back to court in a big way, filing multiple lawsuits aimed squarely at Cupertino. The company celebrated the filings with a press release detailing the claims, which stem from 32 patents related to a wide range of related technologies, including software, video coding, chipsets, display, UI and antenna, among others — from the sound of it, just about everything apart from the big shiny Apple logo on the back of the iPhone. According to Nokia, Apple has refused to play ball with subsequent patents following the 2011 settlement, which marked the end of a two-year fight. “Since agreeing [to] a license covering some patents from the Nokia Technologies portfolio in 2011,” the company said in a statement issued today, “Apple has declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other of its patented inventions which are used by many of Apple’s products.” Nokia filed suits in three German cities, along with the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the Walt Disney World of patent litigation. For its part, Apple also filed a suit this week in California, alleging that Nokia removed certain patents from the previous deal for the purposes of “extorting excessive royalties” — an alleged breach of contract. The previous settlement was reportedly valued at $720 million. Update: We’ve since spoken with Apple in regard to the suit by the company yesterday in California, in which it suggests that Nokia is working with a number of companies on the aforementioned royalty “extort[ion].” “Apple is about innovation and our teams are dedicated to making the best products on earth,” the spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We respect intellectual property and we’ve always been willing to pay a fair price to secure the rights of patents covering technology in our products.  Unfortunately, Nokia has refused to license their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple’s own inventions they had nothing to do with.  We are standing up for inventors everywhere by fighting this flagrant anticompetitive practice.” We’ve also reached out to Nokia for a comment about what’s shaping up to be another fierce battle stemming from some unfinished business between the two big tech names. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Nokia Founded 1865 Overview Nokia is a Finnish multinational communications corporation engaged in the manufacturing of mobile devices, network infrastructure, location-based technologies, and advanced technologies businesses worldwide.

It seems that according to reports, Apple has pretty much pulled all of Withings’ accessories from the Apple Online Store following the lawsuit with Nokia. For those wondering how Withings is part of this, it is because earlier this year Nokia announced that they would be acquiring the company, which essentially makes any Withings product a Nokia product by extension. Apple did not disclose why they pulled the products, but given the recent lawsuit it’s not hard to connect the dots. If you’re unfamiliar with Withings, the company makes quite a few health-related tech gadgets. For example they make smart thermometers, smart and connected weighing scales, smartwatches, and so on. You might call Apple’s move “petty” but this isn’t the first time the company has retaliated in this manner. A couple of years ago, Bose’s products were similarly removed from Apple’s stores after the company had sued Beats (which was owned by Apple) over its noise-cancelling patents. However Bose’s products were eventually returned once the lawsuit was over and done with, and we can only assume (and hope) it is the same for Withings. Filed in Apple >General.

At one point in time, Oculus had support for OS X in the pipeline; in fact previous Rift dev kits supported Macs. As time went on, however, it was decided that the Oculus Rift would be Windows-only, at least initially. It’s with Luckey’s comments, and the lack of initial OS X support in mind, that I’ve decided to put together a Hackintosh machine that meets the minimum requirements outlined by Oculus, yet can still run OS X. In theory, this machine could support the Oculus Rift if the necessary software was made available for OS X. It can run the Rift now if you install a Windows partition on it… Minimum hardware requirements for Oculus Rift Here are the minimum requirements as outlined by Oculus: Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater NVIDIA GTX 970 or AMD 290 equivalent or greater 8GB of RAM HDMI 1.3 (or higher) video output Two USB 3.0 ports Hackintosh build hardware As you can see, the hardware that I’ve selected below meets the requirements outlined above. My goal was to build a Hackintosh for under $1,000 that met the requirements for Oculus. You can feel free to substitute other hardware in to save money. For instance, if you already have a USB 3.0 drive with at least 8GB of capacity, you can use that instead of purchasing a new USB drive. Keep in mind, however, that some items on this list were specifically selected because they meet the minimum requirements outlined for the Oculus Rift. In other words, you don’t want to stray too far, because compatibility issues can arise. Video overview Read Part II In the future, I plan on improving this build with additional RAM, better SSD, etc. Of course, I could always go with a faster graphics card as well, likely something from AMD since those cards provide noticeable performance increases for apps like Final Cut Pro X. It can be tedious, but the beauty of building your own PC is that it’s totally customizable and can be upgraded over time. Intel Core i5-4590 (6M Cache, 3.3 GHz) – $198.99 I opted for an Intel Core i5 processor, because it was relatively inexpensive and still packed a nice punch. Although quite a few in the Hackintosh community have adopted Skylake CPUs to work in their builds, I wanted something that has been tested through and through. More importantly, the Core i5-4590 meets Oculus’ recommended specs. Gigabyte H97 Extreme Multi Graphics Support UEFI DualBIOS Micro ATX DDR3 1600 LGA 1150 Motherboard – $82.99 The folks over at Tonymacx86 recommend this board, which is good enough for me. I decided to go with mATX for expandability, but I almost wish I would have stuck with my first inclination of going Mini-ITX, since it results in a smaller footprint. That said, it’s nice to know that the video card I selected would fit with no issues, and I have lots of room for additional RAM. Crucial Ballistix Tactical 8GB DDR3 1600 MT/s (PC3-12800) – $47.87 Ballistix Tactical RAM is proven to work well in Hackintosh builds. I opted for 8GB, which is Oculus’ minimum requirement. EVGA GeForce GTX 970 4GB SC GAMING, Silent Cooling Graphics Card – $337.99 The GTX 970 meets Oculus’ minimum spec for video cards. It’s also a card that works well in Hackintosh builds. I do plan on at least trying an AMD card since those cards work so much better for Final Cut Pro X. Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD –  $86.99 I didn’t need a huge amount of space for a boot drive, so I opted for the 250GB Samsung 850. It’s a proven drive that plays nice with Hackintosh rigs. If you want to spend a more for a larger drive, there are 500GB and 1TB options available as well. TP-LINK TL-WDN4800 Dual Band Wireless N900 PCI Express Adapter,2.4GHz450Mbps/5Ghz 450Mbps – $36.95 Although the TP-LINK works well, it features an Atheros chipset which doesn’t work with OS X’s Continuity features. That’s not a huge deal in my eyes, but there are other options that I plan on considering sometime down the road. IO Gear Bluetooth 4.0 USB Micro Adapter – $11.29 This little guy is cheap, and works out of the box with my Hackintosh build. It lets me connect my Magic Mouse to my Hackintosh with ease. Sentey Xplus Power Supply 725 Watt – $44.99 I went with this power supply because it was cheap and outputs plenty of power for my rig. I cheaped out on this, but I wish I would have gone with a modular power supply that was a bit quieter. This supply works well, but there are cleaner and quieter options available that I plan on investigating in the future. Thermaltake CORE V21 Black Extreme Micro ATX Cube Chassis –  $59.90 There is a ton of room inside of this case and plenty of room for multiple 2.5″ and 3.5″ drives. That being said, this case is a little larger than I expected. Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo CPU Cooler – $29.40 I wanted a CPU cooler that would keep my processor nice and cool, and I didn’t want to opt for the stock cooler that Intel included with the Core i5. The Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo has great ratings, and does a good job of keeping the CPU nice and chill. PNY Turbo 32GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive – $9.99 The flash drive is used to house the software tools that you’ll need to get your Hackintosh going. I like these, because they include LED activity lights. Of course, if you already have USB flash drives with at least 8GB of storage, you can skip out on this. Case Speaker for POST – $5.49 The Thermaltake case lacks an on board case speaker, which is a necessity in my opinion. Having a speaker lets you hear beeps for POST, which helps you to troubleshoot the boot process. Since Hackintoshes usually require some granular tinkering, you should definitely add a case speaker to your repertoire if your case lacks one. AmazonBasics Wired Keyboard – $14.64 Unless your Bluetooth keyboard setup has access at the BIOS/UEFI level, chances are you’ll need a hard-wired keyboard. Amazon makes a cheap keyboard, but if you have a USB keyboard somewhere around the house, then just use that one instead. Approximate total hardware cost (as of this post): $968. I’ve created a full wish list that allows you to see all of the products outlined above on a single page. Keep in mind that hardware costs do fluctuate, so it’s entirely possible that the price may be a little bit higher or a little bit lower. Generally speaking, the price should lessen as time goes on. Software OS X El Capitan – Free for Mac users. Note: you will need access to a Mac to create the UniBeast boot disk. UniBeast – Free (Registration required) MultiBeast – Free (Registration required) More to come My main motivation behind this build was to create a workable Mac that featured internal components capable of driving an Oculus Rift. While it’s true that Oculus isn’t planning on supporting the Mac at this time, the point is that there are “Macs” that feature the hardware required to drive the Rift, they just aren’t Macs in the traditional sense. We’re publishing this now, ahead of the build post, so that you can buy the parts needed for building your own and have them ship in time for the next video. In the next post in this series, I’ll walk you through the software install of this Hackintosh build, including any issues or errors that I encountered during the process. As it stands now, I’m fairly happy with this build. It takes patience, but building your very own Hackintosh is a doable feat. Keep in mind that you can also dual boot Windows, which makes for a more than capable gaming rig that can outright drive the Oculus Rift with no issues. Stay tuned for more posts in this series, including a software how to, and additional exploration into the exciting world of Hackintosh.

First, apple machines may not have the most powerful components you can find, but they tend to use newer components than what is on the market. Sure you might find more powerful broadwell chips out there, but using skylake is just going to bump up the price. Second, compare apple’s prices to what sony used to offer and you’ll find that apple was on par if not cheaper. No wonder why vaio went out of business. Third, look at the resale value. No custom build or pre-built rig gets the same return 5+ years later when compared to an apple product. With apple you don’t have to compromise, you just get what you pay for.

However I do like the implied purpose of this news story: Apple had better release a real desktop computer, not a laptop wrapped in a screen, or it is going to lose market share fast. VR is not some passing fad. It is going to be huge and you can’t do it on a Mac. LikeLiked by 1 person Rich Davis (@RichDavis9) - 10 months ago Reply I’m sure Apple will release new products that will have the proper GPU to run this, it’s just a matter of time. As far as VR? Right now, it’s a small market. I don’t really see it as taking over the world type of product. Look at the failure of GoogleGlass. It failed. Even Sony’s version hasn’t done anything. It’s just not needed by everyone. It’s a novelty gaming device, it reminds me of 3D TV, it was exciting in the beginning, but the reality is that people simply don’t really use 3D glasses when watching TV. I see it as a POTENTIAL device for engineering people, but for anything else? it’s more of a novelty type product. As far as Apple’s concerned, having the GPU is just a matter of time. Right now, Apple is just caught in that time period where they don’t have a computer with the GPU that Oculus requires, but that doesn’t mean they won’t. I’m sure the upcoming MacPro upgrade, when that hits the market, it will will. I also see future laptops and iMacs having powerful enough GPU’s to run things like this, but it’s just a matter of time on when they’ll release those products. It’s not like people are lining up to buy these things. So, there is time, it’s not the end of the world by any stretch of the imagination. Well all see what new Macs are released in the upcoming months. Apple is in the middle of clearing out inventories of current Macs which happens right before a new product refresh. And if it makes you feel any better, I believe Apple is in R&D of their own similar product. When and if they make that announcement is anyone’s guess, but based on recent Tim Cook remarks, they might have something next year. Remember, all of this stuff is very much in it’s infancy. Even Microsoft is only taking orders for $3,000 Development versions of Halolens, and there really aren’t that many games to actually run, so it’s got many years until this market matures. I personally don’t have a NEED for these things. I also don’t know anyone that’s really that interested in them either. Gamers? They will buy anything they can brag about to their friends as that goes with the territory. What cracks me up is they are only using an i5 processor, how special is that? It’s just the GPU, which is forth coming. That’s the ONLY thing that Apple doesn’t have currently. By the end of the year, probably most, if not all, of their products will have been refreshed and we’ll see which ones have the GPU’s to run this specific device, which is only one brand. To say that Apple doesn’t have a REAL computer is just nonsense. They have REAL computers, they just don’t have one with the GPU requirements of this specific device. They have computers with much better CPU’s than this thing needs, so that’s not the issue. It’s just the GPU and nothing else.

I would say that of ALL of the current PC’s that are owned and in use, that only less than 1% have the requirements to run this thing. That’s not saying much about the PC market either. Most PC’s don’t come with a proper GPU to run this device either, and there are a ton of PC’s that can’t run it. How many laptops are there that have the GPU requirements to run this device? Do you have a list of them? if there are, there’s not a lot of different models and they are most likely very expensive laptops that most people aren’t buying. Has anyone tried to use a PCI card GPU card with a Thunderbolt 2 PCI chassis? I wonder if that would work. Maybe they should try that.

(Photo by Jason Miller/Getty Images) By Anthony Slater | aslater@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: December 25, 2016 at 4:55 pm | UPDATED: December 26, 2016 at 3:07 am var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([’embed’]); CLEVELAND — The Warriors had 3.4 seconds to avoid a Christmas Day collapse. They drew up a simple play, forced a LeBron James switch and inbounded it to Kevin Durant, isolated in a favorable matchup on Richard Jefferson.

Durant lost his balance and stumbled to the floor. Golden State’s hopes of a tiny slice of Finals revenge went crashing with him: Cavaliers 109, Warriors 108, a fourth straight Cleveland win in this rich NBA rivalry. “I fell,” Durant said. “And I didn’t fall on my own.” Leading up to this showdown, the Warriors promised the result didn’t mean anything. This season will be defined in May and June, not on Christmas Day. But frustration filled the locker room postgame, not just because they lost, but how it went down. A team so accustomed to crunch time domination crumbled down the stretch. The Warriors outplayed the Cavs much of the night. They fought off some early Draymond Green foul trouble, led at halftime and entered the fourth quarter with a seven-point cushion. The lead was upped to 14 with 9:34 left. It felt over. Then Jefferson mashed a dunk on Durant’s head, winked at the Warriors star and the script flipped. “We had control of the game,” Steve Kerr said. So what happened in those nine nightmare minutes? How did this morph from a commanding, impressive road win to an embarrassing, stunning loss? Let’s trace the steps. Reading this on your iPhone or iPad?

Jefferson’s first poster dunk — yep, the 36-year-old who contemplated retirement this summer had more than one — sliced the lead to 12. His wink drew a technical and gave Golden State a free point. But the Cavs knocked it down to 11 on a Kevin Love dunk two possessions later, set up by an Iman Shumpert offensive rebound. Cleveland had 18 offensive rebounds and 17 second chance points on Sunday, exploiting one of the Warriors’ few soft spots. “That’s mostly on us guards,” Klay Thompson said. “We got to come back and help the bigs.” Kyrie Irving then nailed a deep right-wing 3 over Green to cut it to eight, a shot LeBron James said reminded him of that huge wing 3 in the Finals this past June. Irving struggled the first three quarters, but exploded in the final minutes. Twenty-one seconds after the 3, Irving zipped by some lazy Warriors transition defense for a layup to slice it to six and force a Warriors timeout. Out of the timeout, Kerr set up a backdoor screen for Shaun Livingston. He sprung free for a second, but Green’s pass was a bit behind. James picked it off, springing a fast break that led to two Jefferson free throws. The lead had been sliced from 14 to four in less than three minutes. “I take a lot of blame for that,” Green said. “Turning the ball over down the stretch when we could’ve had easy baskets.” In all, the Warriors finished with 20 turnovers. Six came in the fourth quarter. Two came from Green. One came in the most crucial of situations by Andre Iguodala, who entered the game with the league’s best assist-to-turnover ratio. Iguodala has always been so crucial in this Cavaliers matchup. He won Finals MVP two years back. But he had a rough Sunday. Iguodala went scoreless and bumbled a trio of fastbreaks. From the 6:45 mark of the fourth to the 1:14 mark, the teams played relatively even. In that five-minute spurt, the lead was only cut from four to three. The Warriors led 108-105 when Richard Jefferson clanged a contested 3 with 49 seconds left. The rebound went to Iguodala. Durant zipped free for what should’ve been a backbreaking dunk. But Iguodala’s pass was short-armed, Irving picked it off and made a layup to slice it to one. The Warriors had a shot-clock violation on the next possession, their 20th and final turnover. Then Irving sent them ahead with a tough fadeaway over Thompson with 3.4 seconds left. The Warriors had one final shot. But Durant tripped and the game was over. Cleveland closed on a 29-14 run. “It’s a great tape to look at,” Kerr said. “It’ll be quite valuable for us to look at that tape. Because we know we let it slip away.” Durant was ticked by the no-call late. Green gave a 75-second answer about the game and then refused to answer any other questions, referee related or not, saying he was going to unload about it later on a personal video. There was some obvious anger toward the officiating. But the frustration mostly stemmed from the self-inflicted collapse. “We’re mad, man,” Thompson said. “The way we lost that game, we gave them a gift.” Merry Christmas.

(Nati Harnik/AP) In this Monday, May 4, 2015, file photo, Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett speaks during an interview with Liz Claman on the Fox Business Network in Omaha. (Nati Harnik/AP) ASSET MANAGEMENT Is Warren Buffett still calling the shots at Berkshire Hathaway? Add to ... George Athanassakos Special to The Globe and Mail Published Sunday, Dec. 25, 2016 5:56PM EST Last updated Wednesday, Dec. 28, 2016 6:10PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print George Athanassakos is a professor of finance and holds the Ben Graham Chair in Value Investing at the Richard Ivey School of Business, University of Western Ontario. There has been a lot of speculation over the years about when investment icon Warren Buffett will retire, whether he is preparing for transition (which he has been) and, if so, when he will announce his successor. There is also concern in the markets about what will happen to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. stock after Mr. Buffett retires. Mr. Buffett has kept his cards close to his chest. He has recently said that his successor has been chosen and that it is someone who already works for the company. But that is all he has said. Should we believe it, as Mr. Buffett always leaves the door slightly open for changing his mind? This time, however, it may be different. In my opinion, not only has Mr. Buffett truly found a successor, but he has already passed a lot of Berkshire Hathaway’s stock-picking decisions on to this person. The recent investments in Apple Inc. and four U.S.-based airlines do not appear to be Buffett-like investments. Read more: The stars and dogs of 2016 Read more: How to make profitable investment decisions in 2017 Read more: How meditation can make you a better investor Why the “shocking” reversals? It is because, in my opinion, Mr. Buffett is not making them. I truly believe that Mr. Buffett had passed on the torch to his successor. It is the end of an era. But let’s examine more closely Berkshire Hathaway’s recent investments. First, there is the purchase of a stake in Apple. One of the key principles that Mr. Buffett has discussed over the years is that one should invest in companies which are within one’s circle of competence. An investor should understand a company’s business, and if they don’t, they should stay away from investing in the company’s stock. Mr. Buffett has repeatedly said that he does not understand technology. But even if he did, Mr. Buffett likes to invest in companies that possess sustainable competitive advantage. Does Apple have what it takes? In my opinion, the competitive advantage for Apple was the late Steve Jobs. Mr. Jobs is difficult to replicate. And so, there is a management impairment in Apple after his passing. Value investors believe that excellence in management has already been discounted in the stock’s price, and the only direction for the stock price is down, unless the company has rigorous and well-thought-out succession planning and transition planning programs in place. Transition planning was not one of Apple’s strong suits when Mr. Jobs was around. Maybe Apple is a value stock, as its price-to-earnings ratio (PE) is around 13 times, very close to what value investors would consider a stock to be possibly undervalued. But as old hands say, the riskier technology companies are those with low PE when the spark is gone, and to me the spark for Apple was Steve Jobs. Apple did not invest, it innovated. The driver of innovation was Steve Jobs. Consumer tastes are fickle. Consumers will gravitate towards the sexiest and cooler products irrespective of the brand. Can Apple continue to be in the forefront of technology and innovation without Mr. Jobs? I doubt it. Second, there is the purchase of a stake in four major airline companies – American Airlines, United Continental Holdings, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines. Mr. Buffett has shunned the airlines industry for decades following his disastrous investment in US Airways back in 1989. In 2007, he explained his reasoning against investing in airlines. “The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, then earns little or no money. Think airlines. Here, a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive since the days of the Wright brothers. Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favour by shooting Orville down.” In another interview he gave to The Telegraph in 2002, which was discussed in a 2010 Bloomberg BusinessWeek article, Mr. Buffett summarized his dislike of airlines as follows: “You’ve got huge fixed costs, you’ve got strong labour unions, and you’ve got commodity pricing.” He went on: “I have an 800 number now that I call if I get the urge to buy an airline stock. I call at 2 in the morning and I say, ‘Hi my name is Warren and I’m an aeroholic,’ and they talk me down.” But beyond Mr. Buffett’s comments, in general, airline stocks are not investments that value investors would readily make. Airline companies have high business and financial risk – a deadly combination. As a result, during recessions, the question is not if an airline will go bankrupt, but which one. So is Mr. Buffett still making Berkshire Hathaway’s stock-picking decisions? You should be the judge.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     The Latest Apple MacBook Pro Is The First Apple Laptop Available Without A Consumers Report Posted: Dec 25 2016, 9:55am CST | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     The latest release of Apple MacBooks is an absolute hit. The Touch bar was a new addition in the line –up and it received mixed reactions. Forbes even went on to say it wasn’t good enough. The latest criticism comes from the Consumer Reports. Don't Miss: Top 100 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 Photos It did not really choose to recommend the new MacBook series. In the report the performance and display quality is lauded but the battery life is identified as a major issue. Consumer Reports has tested all the three devices. The 13’’ MacBook Pro with Touch bar lasted for 16 hours in the first round of testing. However in the third trial it only gave 3.75 hours. The non Touch bar 13’’ inch device started up from 19.5 hours and ended up on 4.5 hours. Lastly the 15’’ MacBook Pro jumped from 18.5 hour to 8 hours. Battery life is an essential part of Consumer Reports. Therefore it assigns a major portion to it in the overall score. This is why it did not reach the minimum level to give ‘Recommended’ sticker to the Apple MacBook Pro.

AI, self-driving cars and cyberwar – the tech trends to watch for in 2017 The Guardian 12/25/2016 Alex Hern © Riot Games League of Legends Oceanic Pro League grand final in Brisbane, Australia. In some ways, tech in 2017 will be a steady progression from what came before it. Time marches on, and so too does the advance of technology. In other ways, though, it will be just as upended as the rest of the world by the unprecedented disruption that 2016 has left in its wake. ere are the trends to watch out for in the coming year: Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 115.82 -0.91 -0.78% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 749.87 -15.28 -2.00% Nissan Motor Co Ltd NSANY ▼ 20.00 -0.16 -0.79% Yahoo! Inc YHOO ▲ 38.67 +0.03 +0.08% More AI, less data The artificial intelligence revolution is well and truly upon us, but so far, the biggest players are venerable Silicon Valley titans such as Google, Amazon and Apple. That’s partially because they have the money to hire teams full of PhDs at seven-figure salaries, but it’s also because they have the data. That could change. One of the key areas of research for 2017 is data efficiency: the problem of trying to teach machine-learning systems how to do more, with less. Think about how many times your average three-year-old needs to see a particular animal before they can correctly identify it, compared with the thousands of images a neural network needs to ingest to perform the same basic task. Solving the problem of data efficiency could dramatically open up the industry, letting new startups compete on a level playing field with those who have access to petabytes of customer data. And it could also change what an AI can do for you, letting an assistant become far more sensitive to your personal quirks and foibles, or a photo-tagging service recognise specific locations, objects, or situations. Mostly-self-driving cars Self-driving cars exist on a scale. At one end, you’ll find technologies that are barely more than fancy cruise control: lane-assist features ensure your car doesn’t drift out of lane, while adaptive cruise control will maintain a steady distance from the car in front. At the other end is full automation: a car that can drive from a parking space outside your house to a parking space outside your office with no-one touching the steering wheel, or even sitting in the car at all. The story of 2017 will be car companies racing almost all the way to that final hurdle, but just stopping short. Not only the tech companies, either (although expect Tesla’s own models to lead the way, closely followed by Google’s sister company Waymo’s alliance with Fiat Chrysler). Conventional manufacturers the likes of Nissan and BMW are jumping into the field with both feet, and their systems will only get smarter. And who knows what Apple’s plans are? But don’t expect anyone to make the difficult jump to full self-driving capability any time soon. Not only are the regulatory and liability hurdles immense, but the tech just isn’t there for the vast majority of journeys. There’s a reason Google tested its first ever fully automatic trip in Texas, land of wide lanes, huge highways, and car-centric development. Drop that car in the middle of a busy London backstreet and it won’t do so well. The big question is whether all this automation will actually make things safer. On the one hand, cars don’t get distracted, drunk, or tired, all of which lie at the root of most fatalities on the road. On the other hand, if people are told to supervise a car which mostly drives itself, they tend not to be prepared to take over if it actually does need assistance – a problem that lay behind the first self-driving fatality in May. Cyberwar Let’s not mince words: cyberwar has already begun. If it didn’t start in 2008, when (probably) the Israeli and US intelligence services used the Stuxnet virus to destroy Iranian nuclear centrifuges, and it didn’t start in 2015, when the US Office of Personnel Management was hacked by (probably) China, stealing the personal details of millions of government employees, then it certainly started in 2016, when (probably) Russia hacked in to the Democratic National Congress, exflitrating emails which were released with the intention of altering the outcome of an election. Those “probably”s expose part of the appeal of cyberwar for nation states: attribution is hard, and rock-solid attribution to not just a nation but a chain of command is almost impossible. The incoming US administration is already making aggressive overtures about its desire to get on the attack, which will inevitably also make it a bigger target, according to security expert Hitesh Sheth, head of cybersecurity firm Vectra. “US businesses and the US government should expect an increase in the number and severity of cyber-attacks, led by select nation states and organised political and criminal entities,” he says. The ghost of Christmas data breaches past It feels like data breaches are everywhere. But that’s often not the case; while companies are indeed compromised on a regular basis, modern security practices usually ensure that not much is stolen, and what does get taken isn’t easy to exploit. Instead, the more dangerous trend is old breaches surfacing, like an unexploded second-world-war bomb, to wreak havoc on the present. That’s what happened to Yahoo, twice in one year, when data breaches from 2013 and 2014 resurfaced. The breaches were huge, containing a billion and half a billion accounts respectively, and the information within them was barely secured. Passwords were obfuscated with a standard which has been known to be insecure since 2005, while other info, including security questions, was in plain text. Because data breaches can happen undetected, fixing your cybersecurity in 2016 isn’t just locking the stable door after the horse has bolted; it’s locking the stable door without even realising the horse made its escape years ago. The information in historical breaches has often been traded on the darknet for some time before their existence surfaces, meaning the damage comes in two waves: first, slowly, and then all at once. Meet eSports, the new sports Competitive video gaming is a huge business. In 2016, investment bank GP Bullhound estimated it hit a global audience of over 250 million people, and amassed a total annual revenue of $493m – and in 2017, that’s predicted to more than double, making eSports a billion-dollar sector. The scale of the eSports industry is down to a number of factors, from increased broadband penetration making online multiplayer gaming accessible to most of the world to online streaming allowing budding eSports stars to skip conventional media and go straight to their fans. But it’s now big enough to warp the very industry that spawned it, with major games publishers courting the eSports community from the inception of their latest releases. Blizzard, a Californian company best-known for its online game World of Warcraft, has been one of the leaders in the field, with games including Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch and Hearthstone all having online viewerships in the millions, but the standout success is Riot Games, whose sole title League of Legends had more viewers in its 2015 world championship than the final game of 2016’s NBA Finals. GP Bullhound says the next big wave is going to come from mobile, with games like Clash Royale and Vainglory representing the fastest growing segment of the global $37bn games market. Of course, this might all pass you by: over half of eSports fans are millennials, by far the youngest skew of any group of sports supporters. The great privacy divide The world’s most advanced surveillance operation will shortly be under the direct control of a far-right demagogue who routinely attacks critics on social media and uses the office of US president-elect to bolster his commercial interests. That has left some people worried. As a result, many are re-examining their online privacy, switching to encrypted messaging services, locking down social media accounts, and limiting the amount of information they put online. Signal, an encrypted messaging app recommended by Edward Snowden, saw a huge spike in downloads following Donald Trump’s election, while hundreds of tech workers signed a pledge to never implement the president-elect’s proposed registry of Muslims. At the same time, though, trends in AI and online monetisation have pushed other tech firms to slowly chip away at the amount of privacy their users have, data-mining ever more aspects of their online lives in an effort to offer better services and create smarter software. Google, for instance, will now train a machine-learning system on your photos, read your emails to find useful information to add to your calendar, and save everything you say to it to improve its voice recognition. Over 2017, this divide will only increase: companies like Apple and Signal on the one side, and Facebook and Google on the other. In the end, the market will decide. Are people willing to give up the latest and greatest fruits of machine-learning to limit their exposure to surveillance, or do they not really care about online privacy and want everything as soon as it’s technologically possible? Chinese tech goes west The likes of Foxconn may build the world’s most premium tech, but in the west, Chinese brands are still largely associated with cheap electronics: no-name flat panels and cheap smartphones that spy on you. As for software, the entire country can feel as if it’s seen through analogues to Silicon Valley, from “China’s Google” (Baidu) to “China’s Twitter” (Sina Weibo). But an increasing number of Chinese companies have their eyes set on the richer markets of Europe and America, without giving up on the customer base in their own country. Shenzhen-based OnePlus, for instance, has slowly carved out a niche for itself with its high-quality, low-price range of smartphones, which aim to match the flagships from Apple and Samsung while offering price-sensitive users savings of hundreds of pounds. Huawei, already a fairly well-known brand in the west, is pushing its Honor brand as a way to drop the budget image for a new demographic. And software firms are getting in the game too. Tencent, makers of WeChat (that’s “China’s WhatsApp”, for those playing along at home), is pushing hard into the west, taking on Facebook at its own game. The service is currently most popular with Chinese expats, but it’s clear that Facebook is watching closely: a number of features in Messenger are ripped wholesale from the hugely influential service.

This is the first notebook the firm couldn’t recommend due to inconsistent battery life during their test. Now, Apple marketing head Phil Schiller says that the company is working with Consumer Reports to “understand” the tests. Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data This is a bit strange, however. While Consumer Reports’ test results did yield some 3.5 hours of battery life, which is totally plausible under load, the firm was also able to get 18-19 hours of battery life in other tests. Which, as we all know, is more than Apple’s claimed 10 hours of battery life. If anything, these tests are in Apple’s favor. Consumer Reports says that it’s normal to see battery life vary within 5 percent between tests, however the MacBook Pro battery life performance is something strange. In a series of three consecutive tests, the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third. The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for 19.5 hours in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours. In the meantime, Apple has removed the battery remaining indicator in macOS 10.12.2 because the company deemed it inaccurate.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Yucca Loma Bridge opening slated for May Sunday Dec 25, 2016 at 10:34 AM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — With construction on a nearly mile-long stretch of Yucca Loma Road progressing, town officials have tentatively scheduled an opening date for the long-anticipated bridge to which the road leads. Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin told the Daily Press the Yucca Loma Bridge will open to traffic May 22, almost two months ahead of schedule. A ribbon-cutting ceremony and community bike ride — scheduled for May 19 and May 20, respectively — will precede the official opening, though all dates remain open to change, according to Martin. “Of course, this is a major construction project,” she said, “and there could still be unforeseen issues that impact the schedule, but we are working toward that date as of now.” Initial completion for the more than $8 million Yucca Loma Road widening project was set for July 14; however, Martin said several factors sped up construction, including use of an alternative material for the storm drain that runs underground from Apple Valley Road to the Mojave River. “The bid originally called for a product that is cast in place, and which then has to cure,” Martin said. “The contractor, Riverside Construction, suggested rectangular precast concrete sections. They are just set in place and connected, which takes much less time.” Meanwhile, Yucca Loma Bridge construction wrapped up in July after more than two years of work. At the time, Town Manager Frank Robinson said the project came in on time and under budget, costing $28.7 million, not including $3.9 million in construction management costs. Although the bridge opening is finally in sight, the saga for the three-phased Yucca Loma Corridor is not yet over. In November, the Victorville City Council approved an amendment to a services agreement with Dokken Engineering for additional work related to final design of the Green Tree Boulevard Extension project. That $45 million project will eventually stretch Green Tree Boulevard about a mile from Hesperia Road to Ridgecrest/Yates roads and will include a bridge over the BNSF railroad tracks, creating a third arterial connection to Interstate 15 in the High Desert via the Yucca Loma Bridge. Construction is expected to start in late 2018, according to Victorville City Manager Doug Robertson. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

Only around 10% of people voted in favor of the wireless headphones and things get only slightly better for the Apple-branded headphones if you include the wired EarPods. It seems that the vast majority of our readers buy non-Apple. And it wasnt a purely anti-wireless attitude either, its just that the AirPod form factor didnt appeal to many. Some were worried about battery life, some about others thought that the in-box options are good enough (the iPhone 7 is bundled with wired EarPods and an Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter). Naturally, price is a major consideration, exasperated by the possibility of losing one but and having to buy a replacement from Apple. This wasnt going to be an easy battle for Apple to win, audiophiles are a fickle crowd - their favorite brand of headphones is a deeply personal thing and they are not easily seduced by new technology (of course, some people swear that vinyl > FLAC).

Good luck with the headphone situation. It's really not so bad once you get used to it. Thankfully, no matter how Apple changes the hardware, the iPhone still has beautiful, useful apps, many of which are available on no other platform. I picked a few of my favorites. It's going to be great, trust me. Dongles are a small price to pay for this sweet ecosystem. We've rounded up our favorite and most-used apps and utilities for the technology we use every day. Check out our other picks for Android phones, PCs, and Macs. We've also listed our favorite games for iOS and Android from this year. NOISE Roli launched this weird modular "Block" music hardware this year, but it's all powered by your iOS device... and the app is free! Thanks to 3D Touch, you can do everything you'd do on the blocks hardware for 0% of the price. Congrats, you're musical now. Reddit I spend a lot of time on Reddit, and the recently released official iPhone app is just excellent. It's small, fast, and in my opinion preferable to the desktop web experience. Netflix I know, you were probably going to download this without my prompting. But were you aware Netflix now has offline playback? Because that changes the whole game. You just pull up whatever you want to watch, tap a bunch of episodes for download, and enjoy them at your leisure. Not everything is available for offline. But Terrace House is. I guess I'm saying you should watch Terrace House. Khan Academy Wanna be more smart about math and science and stuff? Khan Academy has been learning me good for years, but recently the iPhone app has gotten a lot better. You can watch lessons and even take quizzes offline. And there is so much to learn, all for free. H__r This one is hard to describe. Basically, imagine the soundscape from a scene in a movie where somebody is concussed, or in a dream sequence, or maybe in heaven. Now imagine that happens in real-time. H__r doesn't just play a soundscape, it turns the sounds around you into that soundscape, and it's the best. Simplenote There are at least one million ways to take notes on an iPhone. You'll probably want to pick whichever one blends the best with the other tools you like to use. Dropbox? Outlook? iCloud? Evernote? There are apps for all of those. I like to use Simplenote. It syncs everything I write to the cloud as I write it (to Simplenote's own servers), and I've found it to be stable, trustworthy, and non-note-destroying over the many years I've used it. Audible I love audiobooks. Audible gets me audiobooks. It's a little annoying on iOS (and completely Apple's fault) that you have to do all your book shopping in the web browser, then pop back to the Audible app to download the book. But it's fine, whatever. Books! I have lots of them. comiXology My exposure to comics is limited, but I've been reading a few classics lately and comiXology is the best way I've found to do it. Unfortunately, buying comics (in your web browser, just like Audible) is an expensive habit. But on an iPhone screen, comiXology's method of zooming and panning on comic panels is indispensable. Motion Stills I'm not really a photo taking kind of person, but everyone I know raves about Motion Still so I thought I'd include it here in case you are a photo taking kind of person. Apple's default Live Photos are confusing and kind of useless (you typically need to press hard on a photo to see it animate), but Google's Motion Stills app takes those Live Photos and turns them into cool, easy to share GIFs.

Here's why he can't invest it all, and a few acquisition ideas to put some of those dollars to work. Alex Dumortier, CFA (TMFAleph1) Dec 25, 2016 at 9:25AM Image source: The Motley Fool. $84.8 billion. That's the total amount of cash and cash equivalents on Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) had quietly amassed on its balance sheet by the end of September. No publicly traded U.S. company has a larger cash hoard. Not Apple, nor Google parent Alphabet  -- no one. (Strictly speaking, that isn't true, but the only companies that are ahead of Berkshire on this measure are a few large banks, including Bank of America and Goldman Sachs Group. We should exclude banks from the comparison, because they have a very specific business model that demands a lot of leverage.) Free money: Understanding insurance float In fact, Berkshire's cash is not entirely unencumbered: Remember that one of the company's significant business lines is insurance. At the end of September, Berkshire's insurance operations had invested assets totaling nearly $190 billion, of which $50.2 billion were in cash and cash equivalents. Part of these invested assets represent shareholder capital, including retained earnings, but approximately $91 billion derive from insurance float, i.e. liabilities. If you're not familiar with the concept of float, here is how Warren Buffett defined it in his 2004 shareholder letter: [Float] is money that doesn't belong to us but that we temporarily hold. Most of our float arises because (1) premiums are paid upfront though the service we provide -- insurance protection -- is delivered over a period that usually covers a year and; (2) loss events that occur today do not always result in our immediately paying claims, because it sometimes takes many years for losses to be reported (asbestos losses would be an example), negotiated and settled. As such, float is a "net liability" -- basically, the liability created by an open insurance contract net of the premiums received. However, it's an unusual form of liability that has some attractive properties for the company that bears them. As Buffett explained in his 2015 shareholder letter (emphasis is mine): So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire's book value is calculated, the full amount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think of float as strictly a liability is incorrect. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims and related expenses -- a huge $24.5 billion to more than six million claimants in 2015 -- and that reduces float. Just as surely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding to float. If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this liability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises -- because new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute -- is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out the door tomorrow and not be replaced. The elephant gun is loaded The very fact that float dollars "will never leave the premises" is what has enabled Berkshire to invest some of the float. The bulk of its public equities portfolio is housed within its insurance operations, for example. Nevertheless, Buffet has said repeatedly that he would not allow Berkshire's cash position to fall below $20 billion -- an amount he considers sufficient to cover large, unexpected insurance losses. Even after you account for that buffer, however, Buffett's "elephant gun" is well-loaded, with ammunition to spare. (In his lingo, "elephants" are large acquisitions.) Subtract $20 billion from the $84.8 billion cash position leaves you with $64.8 billion -- an amount that is greater than the individual market capitalizations of more than 85% of the companies in the S&P 500. Ready, aim, ... wait. What are some possible acquisition candidates? Earlier in the week, I profiled 3 "Warren Buffett" companies: Infant formula manufacturer Mead Johnson Nutrition (market capitalization: $13.3 billion), lubricants specialist Valvoline ($4.2 billion) and ceiling products manufacturer Armstrong World Industries ($2.3 billion). However, they aren't elephants and they might not all be cheap enough for Buffett's taste. (He has to pay a premium for control, after all.) For size and quality, industrials Parker-Hannifin ($19.1 billion) and FANUC ($35.2 billion) fit the bill, but they don't look quite cheap enough, either. With equity valuations looking a bit rich, it's no surprise that Berkshire Hathaway's war chest has continued to grow. For Buffett-watchers like this Fool, it's great fun to try and anticipate how he will next deplete it (and try to understand his choices, once they are known).  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

AI, self-driving cars and cyberwar – the tech trends to watch for in 2017 The Guardian 25/12/2016 Alex Hern © Riot Games League of Legends Oceanic Pro League grand final in Brisbane, Australia. In some ways, tech in 2017 will be a steady progression from what came before it. Time marches on, and so too does the advance of technology. In other ways, though, it will be just as upended as the rest of the world by the unprecedented disruption that 2016 has left in its wake. ere are the trends to watch out for in the coming year: More AI, less data The artificial intelligence revolution is well and truly upon us, but so far, the biggest players are venerable Silicon Valley titans such as Google, Amazon and Apple. That’s partially because they have the money to hire teams full of PhDs at seven-figure salaries, but it’s also because they have the data. That could change. One of the key areas of research for 2017 is data efficiency: the problem of trying to teach machine-learning systems how to do more, with less. Think about how many times your average three-year-old needs to see a particular animal before they can correctly identify it, compared with the thousands of images a neural network needs to ingest to perform the same basic task. Solving the problem of data efficiency could dramatically open up the industry, letting new startups compete on a level playing field with those who have access to petabytes of customer data. And it could also change what an AI can do for you, letting an assistant become far more sensitive to your personal quirks and foibles, or a photo-tagging service recognise specific locations, objects, or situations. Mostly-self-driving cars Self-driving cars exist on a scale. At one end, you’ll find technologies that are barely more than fancy cruise control: lane-assist features ensure your car doesn’t drift out of lane, while adaptive cruise control will maintain a steady distance from the car in front. At the other end is full automation: a car that can drive from a parking space outside your house to a parking space outside your office with no-one touching the steering wheel, or even sitting in the car at all. The story of 2017 will be car companies racing almost all the way to that final hurdle, but just stopping short. Not only the tech companies, either (although expect Tesla’s own models to lead the way, closely followed by Google’s sister company Waymo’s alliance with Fiat Chrysler). Conventional manufacturers the likes of Nissan and BMW are jumping into the field with both feet, and their systems will only get smarter. And who knows what Apple’s plans are? But don’t expect anyone to make the difficult jump to full self-driving capability any time soon. Not only are the regulatory and liability hurdles immense, but the tech just isn’t there for the vast majority of journeys. There’s a reason Google tested its first ever fully automatic trip in Texas, land of wide lanes, huge highways, and car-centric development. Drop that car in the middle of a busy London backstreet and it won’t do so well. The big question is whether all this automation will actually make things safer. On the one hand, cars don’t get distracted, drunk, or tired, all of which lie at the root of most fatalities on the road. On the other hand, if people are told to supervise a car which mostly drives itself, they tend not to be prepared to take over if it actually does need assistance – a problem that lay behind the first self-driving fatality in May. Cyberwar Let’s not mince words: cyberwar has already begun. If it didn’t start in 2008, when (probably) the Israeli and US intelligence services used the Stuxnet virus to destroy Iranian nuclear centrifuges, and it didn’t start in 2015, when the US Office of Personnel Management was hacked by (probably) China, stealing the personal details of millions of government employees, then it certainly started in 2016, when (probably) Russia hacked in to the Democratic National Congress, exflitrating emails which were released with the intention of altering the outcome of an election. Those “probably”s expose part of the appeal of cyberwar for nation states: attribution is hard, and rock-solid attribution to not just a nation but a chain of command is almost impossible. The incoming US administration is already making aggressive overtures about its desire to get on the attack, which will inevitably also make it a bigger target, according to security expert Hitesh Sheth, head of cybersecurity firm Vectra. “US businesses and the US government should expect an increase in the number and severity of cyber-attacks, led by select nation states and organised political and criminal entities,” he says. The ghost of Christmas data breaches past It feels like data breaches are everywhere. But that’s often not the case; while companies are indeed compromised on a regular basis, modern security practices usually ensure that not much is stolen, and what does get taken isn’t easy to exploit. Instead, the more dangerous trend is old breaches surfacing, like an unexploded second-world-war bomb, to wreak havoc on the present. That’s what happened to Yahoo, twice in one year, when data breaches from 2013 and 2014 resurfaced. The breaches were huge, containing a billion and half a billion accounts respectively, and the information within them was barely secured. Passwords were obfuscated with a standard which has been known to be insecure since 2005, while other info, including security questions, was in plain text. Because data breaches can happen undetected, fixing your cybersecurity in 2016 isn’t just locking the stable door after the horse has bolted; it’s locking the stable door without even realising the horse made its escape years ago. The information in historical breaches has often been traded on the darknet for some time before their existence surfaces, meaning the damage comes in two waves: first, slowly, and then all at once. Meet eSports, the new sports Competitive video gaming is a huge business. In 2016, investment bank GP Bullhound estimated it hit a global audience of over 250 million people, and amassed a total annual revenue of $493m – and in 2017, that’s predicted to more than double, making eSports a billion-dollar sector. The scale of the eSports industry is down to a number of factors, from increased broadband penetration making online multiplayer gaming accessible to most of the world to online streaming allowing budding eSports stars to skip conventional media and go straight to their fans. But it’s now big enough to warp the very industry that spawned it, with major games publishers courting the eSports community from the inception of their latest releases. Blizzard, a Californian company best-known for its online game World of Warcraft, has been one of the leaders in the field, with games including Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch and Hearthstone all having online viewerships in the millions, but the standout success is Riot Games, whose sole title League of Legends had more viewers in its 2015 world championship than the final game of 2016’s NBA Finals. GP Bullhound says the next big wave is going to come from mobile, with games like Clash Royale and Vainglory representing the fastest growing segment of the global $37bn games market. Of course, this might all pass you by: over half of eSports fans are millennials, by far the youngest skew of any group of sports supporters. The great privacy divide The world’s most advanced surveillance operation will shortly be under the direct control of a far-right demagogue who routinely attacks critics on social media and uses the office of US president-elect to bolster his commercial interests. That has left some people worried. As a result, many are re-examining their online privacy, switching to encrypted messaging services, locking down social media accounts, and limiting the amount of information they put online. Signal, an encrypted messaging app recommended by Edward Snowden, saw a huge spike in downloads following Donald Trump’s election, while hundreds of tech workers signed a pledge to never implement the president-elect’s proposed registry of Muslims. At the same time, though, trends in AI and online monetisation have pushed other tech firms to slowly chip away at the amount of privacy their users have, data-mining ever more aspects of their online lives in an effort to offer better services and create smarter software. Google, for instance, will now train a machine-learning system on your photos, read your emails to find useful information to add to your calendar, and save everything you say to it to improve its voice recognition. Over 2017, this divide will only increase: companies like Apple and Signal on the one side, and Facebook and Google on the other. In the end, the market will decide. Are people willing to give up the latest and greatest fruits of machine-learning to limit their exposure to surveillance, or do they not really care about online privacy and want everything as soon as it’s technologically possible? Chinese tech goes west The likes of Foxconn may build the world’s most premium tech, but in the west, Chinese brands are still largely associated with cheap electronics: no-name flat panels and cheap smartphones that spy on you. As for software, the entire country can feel as if it’s seen through analogues to Silicon Valley, from “China’s Google” (Baidu) to “China’s Twitter” (Sina Weibo). But an increasing number of Chinese companies have their eyes set on the richer markets of Europe and America, without giving up on the customer base in their own country. Shenzhen-based OnePlus, for instance, has slowly carved out a niche for itself with its high-quality, low-price range of smartphones, which aim to match the flagships from Apple and Samsung while offering price-sensitive users savings of hundreds of pounds. Huawei, already a fairly well-known brand in the west, is pushing its Honor brand as a way to drop the budget image for a new demographic. And software firms are getting in the game too. Tencent, makers of WeChat (that’s “China’s WhatsApp”, for those playing along at home), is pushing hard into the west, taking on Facebook at its own game. The service is currently most popular with Chinese expats, but it’s clear that Facebook is watching closely: a number of features in Messenger are ripped wholesale from the hugely influential service.

You just unwrapped a brand-new iPhone! Once you finish going through Apple’s walkthrough to set everything up, you’ll probably want to get some apps installed on your new pocket supercomputer! So we’ve put together a list of some of the most important ones to start you off. Looking for games? Check out our list here. We've rounded up our favorite and most-used apps and utilities for the technology we use every day. Check out our other picks for Android phones, PCs, and Macs. We've also listed our favorite games for iOS and Android from this year. Facebook Facebook You use Facebook. Your friends use Facebook. Your family uses Facebook. Like it or not, you’ll want the Facebook app on your phone to keep up with the latest in the lives of friends from high school you don’t talk to and relatives you haven’t seen in years. Make sure to grab the separate Facebook Messenger app too, so that you can chat with them. Tweetbot Twitter has its own app for iOS, but Tweetbot is better. With powerful muting tools and a far more focused user-experience than Twitter’s app, Tweetbot is the best way to Tweet on the go. Snapchat Snapchat has grown a lot in the last year, adding cloud photo storage, groups, and of course, a hardware product in the form of Spectacles. But the app itself is still what you’ll need to watch all your friend’s stories and send your own snaps. WhatsApp Messenger One of the most popular messaging apps in the world, that you’ll definitely want (especially for chatting with non-iPhone friends). Outlook Look, Apple’s built-in email app just isn’t that great. But Microsoft’s Outlook app is. So download that instead and experience fast, great email. Instagram Rounding out the major social networking apps is Instagram. The world needs your square-cropped, filtered photos. The Instagram app will let you send them to your heart’s content (and of course, let you see everyone else’s perfect breakfast photos.) YouTube Chances are, if it exists in video form, it’s on YouTube. So whether you’re watching the latest viral meme or a video from your favorite vlogger, you’ll want the YouTube app. Dark Sky Don’t wonder if you’ll need an umbrella — know you’ll need an umbrella. Dark Sky offers hyper-local weather alerts that let you know if it’s going to rain or snow exactly where you are, with up to the minute accuracy. Motion Stills One of the best apps of 2016, Google’s Motion Photos app is perfect for any new iPhone 6s or 7 owners, turning Apple’s Live Photos into animated GIFs that are way more fun to share with friends. Netflix If you’ve got a Netflix account, it’s never been a better time to have the Netflix app. The company just added the ability to download shows offline to your phone, making it perfect for stocking up on movies for your flight home. Deliveries Sure, you just finished getting all your holiday gifts, but Deliveries is a great package tracking app that offers tons of features and a simple, intuitive interface for seeing when your next batch of stuff will arrive.

Regardless, those who are already jailbroken know that there were a small number of jailbreak tweak releases this week, and this roundup will put the spotlight on those. We’ll show you our favorites first, and then move on to the rest afterwards. Our favorite release this week TwitterThemeToggler – FREE TwitterThemeToggler is a new free jailbreak tweak that lets you toggle Twitter’s Night Mode on and off with fewer taps. In fact, rather than having to tap on the screen four separate times to enter the Twitter settings menu and then find the Night Mode option and turn on the toggle switch, this tweak lets you toggle the feature on with a single tap and hold on the Twitter app’s navigation bar. The tweak works very well and provides users with a quicker way to reduce eyestrain when they’re staring at their Twitter news feed at night. If you’re interested in learning more about TwitterThemeToggler, you can read our full review to see how it works. Other releases this week SnapchatNoClickbait: Removes all the clickbaity links from the Snapchat app (free – review) Although that wraps it up for this week, there are sure to be more releases in the next coming weeks. With an iOS 10 jailbreak just over the horizon, we might just see an awakening in the jailbreak community that we haven’t seen in months. Of course, it probably won’t explode much until the jailbreak comes out of beta first and more people start using it.

J.C. Rice More On: cuddling Here's what actually happens at 'cuddle parties' Dogs really don't like to be hugged 'I'm the cuddle star': The man who has snuggled with 10K people Would you pay $60 an hour for a cuddle? She’s New York’s most coveted paid companion. Lisa VanArsdale, 27, has cuddled her way to the top of the snuggling business as the Big Apple’s only five-star snuggler. “I just f–king love cuddling,” she said of her G-rated sessions with lonely men. “Plus, the money is good.” The cozy companion, who works for The Snuggle Buddies service, sees business grow during the holidays. “I saw a huge increase in clientele right after Thanksgiving,” VanArsdale said, noting that she has received 15 snuggle requests in the past two weeks alone. “One reason is that Christmas is a time of year to spend with family, and if you don’t have that, it can be very lonely,” she said. VanArsdale’s clients are mostly men between 40 and 60 who “have a hard time finding companionship organically and lack human connection and touch,” the petite brunette explained. One client wrote on his request form: “[I’m] a widower of four years . . . longing for the much needed presence of a woman in my life.” ‘I just f–king love cuddling … Plus, the money is good.’ VanArsdale carefully vets clients: “I always size them up over the phone first to see if they ask any inappropriate questions, if they’re looking for more than just cuddling,” she said. But things do not always go according to plan. She made tabloid headlines earlier this year after a rendezvous with actor Taye Diggs went beyond mere snuggling, admitting she broke it off when she learned he had a girlfriend. Some men wine and dine VanArsdale, she explained. “I went on an outing last week with a guy who comes to the city from a small town in the South,” she said. “We went to check out a Cuban restaurant in Hell’s Kitchen, then went on a walk around the Christmas market at Columbus Circle.” Lisa VanArsdale, a professional cuddler J.C.

VanArsdale collected a $330 fee for the no-sex session. The married client “said he loves his wife, and they have great sex, but she never just wants to lay and be with him,” VanArsdale said. “I think we’re oversexed because we’re undertouched.” At a recent “in-call” appointment, VanArsdale invited a man to her brightly colored Harlem bedroom. VanArsdale smiled at her client, a college student, and made small talk. “I needed comfort after a breakup I had and was feeling very lonely,” the client told her.

Get Extra Apple-Certified Lightning Cables for Just $6 Sunday December 25, 2016 12:01 am PST by Joe Rossignol For those lucky enough to find a new iPhone, iPad, or AirPods under the tree today, now is the perfect time to outfit your home, car, work desk, bedside table, or elsewhere with extra Lightning charging cables. Apple charges $19 for its 1-meter Lightning to USB charging cable, but you can save yourself $13 by purchasing an Apple-certified 0.9-meter Anker Lightning to USB charging cable for just $5.99 on Amazon. The cable qualifies for free two-day shipping in the United States for Amazon Prime members. Without a Prime membership, free standard 6-8 days shipping in the U.S. is available on orders over $49 in total. While counterfeit Apple cables and chargers on Amazon are common, and potentially dangerous, Anker claims its cable is certified by Apple under its MFi Program. MFi-certified products have been certified by the developer to meet Apple performance standards. The Wirecutter, owned by The New York Times, said Anker has the best Lightning cable.

Rating: 12 Votes chr1s60 1 week ago You can find lightning cables for cheaper than Apple charges pretty much any day. And didn't Macrumors recently posted an article saying something like 90% of non Apple chargers fail or don't work properly? Rating: 12 Votes Fiestaman 1 week ago Anker's a great brand for stuff! But is it really necessary to get Apple-certified cables? I can understand making sure you have genuine power adapters but cables don't seem necessary, you're just over paying. I got a very hand, very short lightning to USB cable from Tiger for £3. Yes. Most definitely. You must not have many Apple devices or are new to them. If they aren't certified, then yes you can charge with them, but at an insanely reduced speed. You'll get the error saying they aren't certified and charging gets reduced to a paltry speed to protect the device. There's a chip in the MFi cables that does data/power management and makes sure nothing is out of wack. Some say it's simply so Apple can make more money, which they do, but with situations like Samsung's Galaxy Note 7, maybe tighter restrictions aren't so bad. I guess the question is, with all the horror stories about fake chargers exploding and cables fraying and causing fires, why would you risk your $800 device just to save a couple bucks? Anker's USB battery packs are phenomenal, too. I have several and they are well worth the money. Anker is definitely a brand I support and trust. Rating: 8 Votes andigital 1 week ago Great cables and amazing battery cases at a decent price. Hands down to their customer service as they sent me a Christmas present just for being their customer! Rating: 8 Votes Weaselboy 1 week ago Who came to MacRumors for this ad? Looks like you did. Rating: 8 Votes ryanwarsaw 1 week ago Not sure why you would need these because you found a new iDevice under the tree? They all come with the charging cable in the box. About the only thing you might want if you got Airpods as a gift is a charging plug for the wall.

Resend activation e-mail Staff / From the minds of Ars The most talked about stories on Ars Technica in 2016 There's almost no overlap between the highest number of comments and pageviews. by Eric Bangeman - Dec 25, 2016 12:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 64 Aurich Lawson On Christmas Eve, we revealed the top 10 news stories and features published on Ars Technica in 2016, with a couple of surprising entries. But pageviews only tell part of the story. There were several stories on Ars this year that, while not among the top in pageviews, got our readers talking. Here are the top stories of 2016 by number of comments. (Comment counts are as of December 21.) 20. Through the Ars lens: Looking at Justice Scalia's opinions, dissents, by David Kravets Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Shawn Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly while on a hunting trip in Texas in February. Like him or not, the man left an immense legacy on the Supreme Court, and some of his opinions covered areas that are near and dear to Ars readers. Those included TV-antenna service Aereo, video games, GPS tracking, thermal imaging, drug dogs, Second Amendment rights, Obamacare, and DNA. Ars readers had plenty to say about Scalia's legacy, as evidenced by the 21-page comment thread. 809 comments 19. “Trek against Trump” urges voters to choose Hillary Clinton, by Cyrus Farivar Enlarge / Actor Levar Burton gestures after attending Ubisoft news conference about the new video game Star Trek: Bridge Crew VR before the start of the E3 Gaming Conference on June 13, 2016 in Los Angeles. Kevork Djansezian / Getty Images News From the primaries on, the 2016 United States presidential campaign was heated on all sides. As it became apparent that Donald Trump would be the Republican Party nominee, opposition arose from some unlikely places. Just over a month before Election Day, a group of more than 100 Star Trek cast members and crew posted an open letter to Facebook, citing the values of the Star Trek universe as antithetical to those of the GOP nominee (and now president-elect). Decrying Green and Libertarian Party candidates as viable alternatives, "Trek against Trump" asked voters to cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton on Election Day. Readers used the comment section for a freewheeling discussion on the candidates and campaigns, as well as the appropriateness of the "Trek against Trump" letter. 824 comments 18. (tie) Apple defends decision to remove 3.5mm headphone jack, cites “courage", by Sam Machkovech Enlarge / The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Andrew Cunningham Apple product announcements and reviews are always near the top of the leaderboard when it comes to traffic, but they don't get readers talking. But the launch of the iPhone 7 was different, as Apple axed the headphone jack in order to make a thinner device. Apple VP Phil Schiller called the company's move courageous, saying it couldn't justify the continued existence of a "single-use" port like an analog headphone jack. You guys used the comment thread mostly to call bullshit on Apple. 841 comments 18. (tie) Dallas deployment of robot bomb to kill suspect is “without precedent”, by Cyrus Farivar Enlarge Bill Word In July, five Dallas police officers were killed by a gunman who was angry about police shootings of unarmed African-American men in the US. After firing the shots that killed the officers, Micah Xavier Johnson holed up in a parking garage and continued shooting at the responding officers. After negotiations broke down, a bomb-disposal robot was used to carry in and detonate an explosive device that killed Johnson. Bomb-disposal robots have been used for some time, but this was the first time one was used to kill a shooter. The decision, and Cyrus' story looking at how it was made and its ramifications, was the impetus for a lively discussion. 841 comments 16. The Google/Oracle decision was bad for copyright and bad for software, by Peter Bright Enlarge / Former Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, pictured here speaking at a conference in 2006, was one of many execs to take the stand in Oracle v. Google. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images Trial of the century? It's only 2016 and way too early to make that call. But Oracle v. Google was definitely the trial of the year for the tech community. Google won, Oracle lost, and there were lots of opinions on whether software code could be copyrighted. Ars Technology Editor Peter Bright weighed in on the controversy with a well-reasoned op-ed in which he argued that the jury's verdict was not good for the developer community as a whole. Commenters used the 22-page thread largely to litigate the trial all over again. 844 comments Expand full story Page: 1 2 3 4 Next → Reader comments 64 You must login or create an account to comment.

Photograph: Riot Games Alex Hern @alexhern Sunday 25 December 2016 07.00 EST Last modified on Sunday 25 December 2016 17.00 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close In some ways, tech in 2017 will be a steady progression from what came before it. Time marches on, and so too does the advance of technology. In other ways, though, it will be just as upended as the rest of the world by the unprecedented disruption that 2016 has left in its wake. Here are the trends to watch out for in the coming year: More AI, less data The artificial intelligence revolution is well and truly upon us, but so far, the biggest players are venerable Silicon Valley titans such as Google, Amazon and Apple. That’s partially because they have the money to hire teams full of PhDs at seven-figure salaries, but it’s also because they have the data. That could change. One of the key areas of research for 2017 is data efficiency: the problem of trying to teach machine-learning systems how to do more, with less. Think about how many times your average three-year-old needs to see a particular animal before they can correctly identify it, compared with the thousands of images a neural network needs to ingest to perform the same basic task. Solving the problem of data efficiency could dramatically open up the industry, letting new startups compete on a level playing field with those who have access to petabytes of customer data. And it could also change what an AI can do for you, letting an assistant become far more sensitive to your personal quirks and foibles, or a photo-tagging service recognise specific locations, objects, or situations. Mostly-self-driving cars Self-driving cars exist on a scale. At one end, you’ll find technologies that are barely more than fancy cruise control: lane-assist features ensure your car doesn’t drift out of lane, while adaptive cruise control will maintain a steady distance from the car in front. At the other end is full automation: a car that can drive from a parking space outside your house to a parking space outside your office with no-one touching the steering wheel, or even sitting in the car at all. The story of 2017 will be car companies racing almost all the way to that final hurdle, but just stopping short. Not only the tech companies, either (although expect Tesla’s own models to lead the way, closely followed by Google’s sister company Waymo’s alliance with Fiat Chrysler). Conventional manufacturers the likes of Nissan and BMW are jumping into the field with both feet, and their systems will only get smarter. And who knows what Apple’s plans are? But don’t expect anyone to make the difficult jump to full self-driving capability any time soon. Not only are the regulatory and liability hurdles immense, but the tech just isn’t there for the vast majority of journeys. There’s a reason Google tested its first ever fully automatic trip in Texas, land of wide lanes, huge highways, and car-centric development. Drop that car in the middle of a busy London backstreet and it won’t do so well. The big question is whether all this automation will actually make things safer. On the one hand, cars don’t get distracted, drunk, or tired, all of which lie at the root of most fatalities on the road. On the other hand, if people are told to supervise a car which mostly drives itself, they tend not to be prepared to take over if it actually does need assistance – a problem that lay behind the first self-driving fatality in May. Cyberwar Let’s not mince words: cyberwar has already begun. If it didn’t start in 2008, when (probably) the Israeli and US intelligence services used the Stuxnet virus to destroy Iranian nuclear centrifuges, and it didn’t start in 2015, when the US Office of Personnel Management was hacked by (probably) China, stealing the personal details of millions of government employees, then it certainly started in 2016, when (probably) Russia hacked in to the Democratic National Congress, exflitrating emails which were released with the intention of altering the outcome of an election. Those “probably”s expose part of the appeal of cyberwar for nation states: attribution is hard, and rock-solid attribution to not just a nation but a chain of command is almost impossible. The incoming US administration is already making aggressive overtures about its desire to get on the attack, which will inevitably also make it a bigger target, according to security expert Hitesh Sheth, head of cybersecurity firm Vectra. “US businesses and the US government should expect an increase in the number and severity of cyber-attacks, led by select nation states and organised political and criminal entities,” he says. The ghost of Christmas data breaches past It feels like data breaches are everywhere. But that’s often not the case; while companies are indeed compromised on a regular basis, modern security practices usually ensure that not much is stolen, and what does get taken isn’t easy to exploit. Instead, the more dangerous trend is old breaches surfacing, like an unexploded second-world-war bomb, to wreak havoc on the present. That’s what happened to Yahoo, twice in one year, when data breaches from 2013 and 2014 resurfaced. The breaches were huge, containing a billion and half a billion accounts respectively, and the information within them was barely secured. Passwords were obfuscated with a standard which has been known to be insecure since 2005, while other info, including security questions, was in plain text. Because data breaches can happen undetected, fixing your cybersecurity in 2016 isn’t just locking the stable door after the horse has bolted; it’s locking the stable door without even realising the horse made its escape years ago. The information in historical breaches has often been traded on the darknet for some time before their existence surfaces, meaning the damage comes in two waves: first, slowly, and then all at once. Meet eSports, the new sports Competitive video gaming is a huge business. In 2016, investment bank GP Bullhound estimated it hit a global audience of over 250 million people, and amassed a total annual revenue of $493m – and in 2017, that’s predicted to more than double, making eSports a billion-dollar sector. The scale of the eSports industry is down to a number of factors, from increased broadband penetration making online multiplayer gaming accessible to most of the world to online streaming allowing budding eSports stars to skip conventional media and go straight to their fans. But it’s now big enough to warp the very industry that spawned it, with major games publishers courting the eSports community from the inception of their latest releases. Blizzard, a Californian company best-known for its online game World of Warcraft, has been one of the leaders in the field, with games including Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch and Hearthstone all having online viewerships in the millions, but the standout success is Riot Games, whose sole title League of Legends had more viewers in its 2015 world championship than the final game of 2016’s NBA Finals. GP Bullhound says the next big wave is going to come from mobile, with games like Clash Royale and Vainglory representing the fastest growing segment of the global $37bn games market. Of course, this might all pass you by: over half of eSports fans are millennials, by far the youngest skew of any group of sports supporters. The great privacy divide The world’s most advanced surveillance operation will shortly be under the direct control of a far-right demagogue who routinely attacks critics on social media and uses the office of US president-elect to bolster his commercial interests. That has left some people worried. As a result, many are re-examining their online privacy, switching to encrypted messaging services, locking down social media accounts, and limiting the amount of information they put online. Signal, an encrypted messaging app recommended by Edward Snowden, saw a huge spike in downloads following Donald Trump’s election, while hundreds of tech workers signed a pledge to never implement the president-elect’s proposed registry of Muslims. At the same time, though, trends in AI and online monetisation have pushed other tech firms to slowly chip away at the amount of privacy their users have, data-mining ever more aspects of their online lives in an effort to offer better services and create smarter software. Google, for instance, will now train a machine-learning system on your photos, read your emails to find useful information to add to your calendar, and save everything you say to it to improve its voice recognition. Over 2017, this divide will only increase: companies like Apple and Signal on the one side, and Facebook and Google on the other. In the end, the market will decide. Are people willing to give up the latest and greatest fruits of machine-learning to limit their exposure to surveillance, or do they not really care about online privacy and want everything as soon as it’s technologically possible? Chinese tech goes west The likes of Foxconn may build the world’s most premium tech, but in the west, Chinese brands are still largely associated with cheap electronics: no-name flat panels and cheap smartphones that spy on you. As for software, the entire country can feel as if it’s seen through analogues to Silicon Valley, from “China’s Google” (Baidu) to “China’s Twitter” (Sina Weibo). But an increasing number of Chinese companies have their eyes set on the richer markets of Europe and America, without giving up on the customer base in their own country. Shenzhen-based OnePlus, for instance, has slowly carved out a niche for itself with its high-quality, low-price range of smartphones, which aim to match the flagships from Apple and Samsung while offering price-sensitive users savings of hundreds of pounds. Huawei, already a fairly well-known brand in the west, is pushing its Honor brand as a way to drop the budget image for a new demographic. And software firms are getting in the game too. Tencent, makers of WeChat (that’s “China’s WhatsApp”, for those playing along at home), is pushing hard into the west, taking on Facebook at its own game. The service is currently most popular with Chinese expats, but it’s clear that Facebook is watching closely: a number of features in Messenger are ripped wholesale from the hugely influential service.

New tablet, novel uses, from tuning your guitar to showing off photos. (Photo: Spencer Platt Getty Images) It’s hard to believe the first iPad was released in 2010. We use tablets for entertainment, work and even to pay for a mocha at the local café. The device that once looked like science fiction is now a staple of American homes. But most of us don’t realize how many different ways we can use tablets. Switch around a few settings or download the right app, and you can perform all kinds of digital magic tricks. Here are five things you didn’t know your tablet could do. 1. Use your computer from your tablet Desktops are a double-edged sword: They’re powerful and have large screens, but they also tend to sit in one place. What happens when you’re on the road and you need to nab some files off your desktop back at home or the office? It’s not a problem if your tablet and PC or Mac is loaded with Splashtop. Simply download and install the free Splashtop Streamer software on your computer, get the app for either iPad or Android, create an account and then log into both target devices for instant remote access. This way, you can be holding your tablet on a beach in Maui, but the display shows your desktop just as if you were sitting in front of it back home in Minnesota. The app costs $9.99, and an annual subscription costs $16.99. For folks who travel a lot or need regular access to files and software that aren’t portable, Splashtop Personal is a great way to go. Click here to learn more and get the direct download link for Android and iOS tablets. 2. Transfer files wirelessly from your tablet to your computer Have you ever emailed a file, such as a photo or a document, to your Mac from your iPhone or iPad, even as you sit right in front of your Mac? Yes, I've done it, too, just like nearly every other Apple user on the planet. That's because using email to move files around works pretty well as long as your file is small enough to be attached. There's a better way to move files among your gadgets or even among friends' devices. Apple AirDrop is a built-in app that lets you seamlessly move files back and forth between nearby desktop Macs and iOS gadgets like iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. It’s a quick and convenient way to transfer files from an iOS gadget to a Mac using a Bluetooth connection. This is particularly handy for iPad owners, who can start AirDropping in a matter of seconds. To enable AirDrop on an iPad, swipe up on the Home screen to access the Control Panel. From here, you can set AirDrop to receive from Contacts Only, Everyone, or Off. Newer Mac computers also have this ability, and you can find AirDrop in Finder. Not to be outdone, Android tablets have a nearly identical system in a third-party app called Airmore. You can move music, movies, photos and apps from your Android tablet to any compatible device, along with your call logs and text messages. Click here to get more steps on how to use AirDrop and Airmore. 3. Turn your tablet into a powerful TV remote Tablets are designed to be intuitive, and sometimes they’re even more intuitive than a time-tested gizmo like a TV remote. With the right system in place, you can replace your remote entirely. Some tablets are designed with television in mind. The Galaxy Tab, for example, has a built-in IR transmitter, which you can use as a universal TV remote. As with your old-fashioned remote, you’ll have to aim the Tab directly at the TV. iPads and Androids don’t have an IR transmitter, but if you’re feeling handy, you can buy an external transmitter that attaches to the audio jack, just like your ear buds. There’s a more sophisticated way to control your television from a distance. You can invest in a Harmony Home Hub or the Bluemoo, which are designed to turn your smartphone or tablet into a remote control. Not only can you change channels on your TV, but you activate any Bluetooth gadget in your home, including speakers, smart lamps and security devices. The best part: You don’t have to aim your tablet at anything, you just have to be within the Bluetooth’s range. Click here for details on controlling your TV and gadgets from your smartphone or tablet. 4. Show your photos and videos on your TV Many smart TVs already give you access to YouTube, Vimeo and Flickr, so you can easily upload your online content, including home videos, and watch them on your TV. But with your tablet, you don’t have to use these services. For example, if you have an iPad and Apple TV, you can use Airplay to project your tablet’s display on the big screen. Just swipe upward from the bottom, and you’ll see the Airplay icon. If you don’t have Apple TV, or you’re not near a Wi-Fi signal, you can find a VGA adapter and plug your iPad directly into the set. For Android users, there’s another option: You can use an app called AllCast, which will connect your Android to many different services, including Amazon TV, Apple TV and Roku, among others. Here’s a link to how to use it. 5. Tune your guitar Professional musicians tend to carry electronic guitar tuners. But if you’re a weekend strummer who wants a quick tuneup, or you want a backup device during your concert tour, look no further than Guitar Tuna, a free app for iOS and Android. Using your iPad or Android tablet’s built-in mic, Guitar Tuna is fast, accurate and easy to use. What’s more, it works with all popular string-based instruments, from guitars and basses to ukuleles and mandolins. The app also has advanced tools, like a metronome, guitar learning tools and alternative guitar tunings. Click here so you never play out of tune again.

Idaho Business Health Nation/World Elections Photos Business US companies want to play China’s game. They just can’t win it. SUNDAY, DEC. 25, 2016 By Emily Rauhala and Elizabeth Dwoskin Washington Post Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS BEIJING – Netflix has a nifty new China strategy: Skip it. In January 2016, the video-streaming service announced an ambitious global expansion. The goal was to beam American hits such as “House of Cards” around the world including, eventually, in China. “Today you are witnessing the birth of a new global Internet TV network,” said chief executive Reed Hastings at a large tech conference. Sending racy American content into a country that censors almost everything may have seemed like a leap, but Netflix was confident. The China plan, Hastings said, was on a “slow and steady path.” Less than a year later, having launched just about everywhere else, Netflix shelved the streaming project. It opted instead to license some content to Chinese providers for “modest” revenues, according to a quarterly letter. (Representatives of the company declined to comment.) For some high-flying U.S. Internet businesses, the China dream is fading; for others, it looks radically different from what they had hoped. California’s Internet companies once dreamed of liberating China with technology, thinking that the system of censorship known as the Great Firewallwould inevitably crumble like the Berlin Wall, paving the way for their advance in the world’s most populous nation. But President Xi Jinping has tightened, rather than loosened, control of the Internet and increased restrictions on foreign companies. Six years after Google retreated from China’s search-engine business over censorship and hacking concerns, U.S. firms seem more willing than ever to play the Communist Party’s game – they just can’t win it. Even if they can gain a foothold, which is hard enough, there is practically no way they will be able to overtake the Chinese companies that have comfortably established themselves. Facebook’s China charm offensive, which included Mark Zuckerberg studying Mandarin, has yielded little. Google’s search business and Twitter remain blocked. LinkedIn and Microsoft censor – and still, neither is a major player in China’s online space. Amazon.com is sputtering along against the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. After great initial success, Apple is being overtaken by local upstarts. Still, tech companies are pushing, and they are looking to the incoming Trump administration for help breaking in. When executives from the major U.S. technology companies met with President-elect Donald Trump on Dec. 14 at Trump Tower, they complained about a Chinese proposal that would require foreign technology companies to deposit the source code for their software with the government, according to a person who was familiar with the discussions. Bill Bishop, a tech consultant who writes Sinocism, an influential China newsletter, said he has seen waves of confident California firms humbled by efforts to crack the China market. “Each generation believes they can find a way, but the Chinese Communist Party has upped their game in terms of censorship, and these companies that nobody has heard about 10 years ago – now they are the biggest companies in the world,” he said, referring to corporate behemoths such as Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi and Baidu, sometimes called the Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google of China. “U.S. companies are going to make a Chinese play, but not the way they imagined.” U.S. companies considering a China move often talk about the “LinkedIn model” – a model that means close local ties and full cooperation with the government. Acting local – or, indeed, operating at all – means playing by local rules, even when those rules run counter to the idea of free expression and association. LinkedIn’s Chinese site censors content and puts limits on forming groups. LinkedIn chief executive Jeff Weiner has described the company’s introduction of a Chinese-language version as involving “compromises that are far from ideal and can be very painful.” LinkedIn did not agree to an interview for this article. Unlike when Google and Yahoo were hauled in to testify before Congress for censoring content a decade ago, LinkedIn’s censorship has earned the company a small amount of bad press, but has not been treated as a major story. LinkedIn’s bigger challenge is competing in the Chinese market. Its Chinese site has more than 20 million users – fair by U.S. standards, but diminutive for a Chinese social network, analysts said. To better connect with young workers, it launched an app called Chitu which promises to be “real and fun.” The app sounds millennial-friendly – it hosts livestreams with celebrities, for instance – but faces fierce competition from home-grown challengers with a head start. Staying relatively small, saying the right things and complying with authorities seems to be the only option. Evernote, an organizational app, launched a China-specific version in 2012. In 2014, the app shelved a feature that Hong Kong protesters had used to share information in China. Like many U.S. companies doing business in China, Evernote has agreed to store Chinese citizens’ data on Chinese servers, where authorities can access it. It runs its China operation in a bright, foosball-equipped office in Beijing’s tech district. The business is chugging along but remains small, employing a couple of dozen people. That fact that both firms are cited as China success stories shows just how tough it is for U.S. businesses. Jeremy Goldkorn, director of the media and consulting firm Danwei, summed up the best-case scenario for U.S. Internet start-ups as “not getting kicked out, but not making a lot of money.” Many large U.S. tech giants, from semiconductor companies to Apple, have made impressive profits in China, but it’s getting harder now, said Scott Kennedy, who directs a project on Chinese business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “This is a market that makes or breaks companies.” The titans of U.S. technology are facing some of the toughest challenges yet. Google and Facebook remain at the periphery, reduced to selling ads while they angle for a Communist Party-brokered compromise that could get them in. Over the past few years, Facebook has made a high-profile push to win over China’s leaders. When China’s former web czar, Lu Wei, toured Facebook’s office in 2014, a copy of Xi’s book, “The Governance of China,” was visible on Zuckerberg’sdesk. Last March, Zuckerberg braved Beiing’s toxic air to take a notorious “smog jog” through Tiananmen Square. Despite recent reports that Facebook is building a “censorship tool” to help secure access to the Chinese market, the social network remains blocked, with little chance of that changing anytime soon, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to be identified because of its sensitivity. To comply with Chinese law and regulations, Facebook would need to drastically change its product, experts said. If the company were to secure the requisite permits to operate – and that’s a big if – it’s not clear that it would succeed. In the years that Zuckerberg has been studying Mandarin, China’s government has ramped up its focus on innovation and helped build an alternate universe where local technology rules. Facebook would need to compete, for instance, with Tencent’s WeChat, a chat service with more than 800 million active users that has morphed into one-stop shopping for socializing, news and e-commerce. “When I think about Facebook in China, I think, ‘What’s their advantage?’ ” said William Bao Bean, a Shanghai-based partner at SOSV Ventures and the managing director of Chinaccelerator, which invests in start-ups. “Their product is so outpaced by the local companies.” That does not mean Facebook won’t try. Tim Sparapani, who was Facebook’s first director of public policy and is now principal at SPQR strategies, said entering China was part of Zuckerberg’s vision and he “wouldn’t bet against Mark.” “If Mark says he is going to connect the world, he is going to connect the world. It’s about fulfilling that vision of ubiquitous worldwide connectivity.” Facebook declined a request for comment. Carmen Chang, a partner at the Silicon Valley firm New Enterprise Associates and a longtime China dealmaker, said that ambitious companies such as Facebook will take the long view in China – strengthening their ties and waiting for new opportunities. “China is too important a market for these companies to settle for a Plan B,” she said. “They will take what they can get and keep probing. Some companies will never give up.” Others wonder why Silicon Valley stays optimistic. “The people at the top are used to moving forward at cyber-speed, not to being pushed aside, blocked, for reasons that are not based on the technology or based on somebody having a better idea – it’s just foreign to their way of thinking,” said Lester Ross, a managing partner at Wilmer Hale in Beijing, who advises U.S. and Chinese companies. “If you can afford it, it’s patience and hope that things change. I don’t see signs of that in front of us in the near term,” he said. “It is very hard to be optimistic.” Published: Dec. 25, 2016, midnight  Tags: business, china, Technology Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Well, it could say a lot about you, apparently. If you boast an iPhone, from Apple, then you're more likely to be young, extroverted - and female. That's what a team of psychologists at Lancaster University who analysed over 500 smartphone users to determine clues about who they are say, anyway. If you opt for a Samsung, or maybe an Android device, researchers say you are more likely to be more honest, agreeable and less interested in wealth and status. Those involved in the study used either iPhones and Android devices. They then answered several questionnaires about themselves and their attitudes towards their phone. Black Friday 2016: Where to find the best deals on Apple products © Provided by Birmingham Mail "In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that an individual's choice of smartphone operating system can provide useful clues when it comes to predicting their personality and other individual characteristics," said Dr David Ellis from Lancaster University. Lancaster researchers were able to craft an innovative computer program that was able to predict the type of phone somebody would have, based on these differences. "It is becoming more and more apparent that smartphones are becoming a mini digital version of the user, and many of us don't like it when other people attempt to use our phones because it can reveal so much about us," Heather Shaw, the co-lead on the study from the University of Lincoln, toldScienceDaily. The full research study appears in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behaviour and Social Networking.

He also appears regularly on Comcast SportsNet. He previously wrote for the Washington Post and Newark Star-Ledger, and was a contributor for the New York Times.  More by Zach Berman Carson Wentz reflects on his season Jan 2 Eagles win season finale over Dallas as Ertz scores twice Jan 1 Doug Pederson, Howie Roseman will return next season, Eagles source says Jan 1 More from Zach Berman Arrow icon Eagles coach Doug Pederson said it was part of the play design for Carson Wentz to block on a reverse in the fourth quarter of the Eagles' 24-19 win over the New York Giants, even after Wentz left the game earler to be evaluated for a concussion. Wentz was cleared to return to action, and Pederson had no hesitation to call the play. "We talked on the sideline, and we talked . . . before the series," Pederson said. "He was good. He was cleared. So I had no hesitation." Wentz blocked Giants cornerback Eli Apple and hit his head against left tackle Jason Peters' ankle. Apple and Peters suffered injuries on the play. Wentz said that the concussion scare "really didn't affect my decision in doing that," and once he was cleared he would play like normal. "Obviously our goal in everything we do is to try to win a football game," Pederson said. "I think the second that you sort of hesitate in any situation is a time you get beat." Risky throw Wentz threw his 14th interception of the season in the first half after scrambling in the pocket, escaping pressure and trying to connect with Bryce Treggs on a deep pass. It was a risky throw for Wentz to make, but it appeared Treggs could have been more aggressive returning to catch the ball. Giants cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie jumped in front of Treggs for the interception. "You never like to throw late deep, but at the same time, Bryce was open," Pederson said. "Carson did everything he could to avoid the rush and the sack, and he spun out of it. As a receiver you are always taught to come back towards the ball and things of that nature." More fourth downs? The Eagles attempted their 26th fourth-down conversion on Thursday. Pederson has pledged to be aggressive, but he's hoping the Eagles don't approach that number in future seasons. "I'm hoping in the future we do better on first, second and third down, where we're not putting ourselves in a lot of makeable fourth downs," Pederson said. "But at the same time, if it benefits our team and we can stay aggressive with it and it's smart and it's a good decision, then I will continue to do that and go for those fourth downs." The Eagles are 13 of 26 (50 percent) on fourth downs. Injury update Linebacker Jordan Hicks sprained his ankle, but he is expected to be ready to play next week against the Dallas Cowboys. . . . Safety Jaylen Watkins suffered a concussion and is in the league-mandated concussion protocol. . . . Pederson said offensive lineman Allen Barbre's hamstring "got tight on him," which was why Barbre exited the game. Barbre has missed time because of hamstring injuries at different points this season, including last Sunday against Baltimore. . . . Tackle Halapoulivaati Vaitai was inactive for the fifth consecutive game while recovering from a knee injury, but he went through an "extensive workout" before the game and should be able to contribute more next week. . . . The players are off until Tuesday, when they will begin preparing for Dallas.

The Encryption Working Group The EWG was set up by the House Judiciary Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee to (re)study the subject of encryption. Much of the group’s work represented in this report was precipitated by the epic fight in 2016 between the FBI and Apple over access to a locked iPhone used by a dead terrorist in late 2015. Membership of the 10-member group is half Republican and half Democrat, and their job is to do a deep dive into encryption on behalf of their committees. Their work would, in theory, be used to help develop legislation coming out of either committee. In other words, the EWG is sort of a focus group tasked with doing the heavy lifting in understanding encryption. You can read the full report on Patently Apple, which posted the full document to Sribd. The Good in the Report There was a lot of good stuff in this report. Specifically, it openly embraced the reality that if governments have backdoor keys to encryption, it’s worthless. Here’s a representative quote: Cryptography experts and information security professionals believe that it is exceedingly difficult and impractical, if not impossible, to devise and implement a system that gives law enforcement exceptional access to encrypted data without also compromising security against hackers, industrial spies, and other malicious actors. That is about as accurate as you could possibly hope for. Here’s another, which was the headline piece for what the EWG called “Observation #1:” Any measure that weakens encryption works against the national interest. That’s an important point, one that General Michael Hayden and members of the intelligence community have said publicly for years. While you, dear reader, and I might be most concerned about keeping our own data safe from hackers and thieves, the national interest and national security will weigh more heavily on Congress. There is much more about the importance of encryption in the full report. The Not So Good in the Report Also on the accurate side of the report (from my perspective) is direct acknowledgment that, “the widespread adoption of encryption has had a profound impact on the law enforcement community.” This is true, absolutely. From there, however, we get into mixed messages. For instance, the next quote includes one of the most powerful statements on the need for encryption, but it’s followed by a completely contradictory statement about law enforcement. Congress should not weaken this vital technology because doing so works against the national interest. However, it should not ignore and must address the legitimate concerns of the law enforcement and intelligence communities Heretofore, legions of people far smarter than me have concluded there’s no compromise on encryption. It’s hard to see how, when it comes to encryption, you can “address the legitimate concerns” of law enforcement. There are other similarly contradictory statements throughout the report. Proposals from the EWG To be fair the report does outline some steps that would help law enforcement, but those steps don’t specifically address encryption. They include: Creating unspecified “tools” to help law enforcement know what they can and can’t do Possibly modifying warrant procedures in an unspecified manner Clarifying warrant procedures Reminding law enforcement that there are a crap ton of tools already at their disposal that don’t require screwing the nation (and the planet) on encryption “Modernizing the National Domestic Communications Assistance Center” in an unspecified manner Those proposals are solid and common sense—if vague. And, they don’t address the friction between law enforcement and encryption. As noted above, that’s because there is no addressing that friction. If we’re to be safe from the bad guys, law enforcement is going to have a harder job. That’s all there is to it. A New Hope Reading this report gives me new hope that Congress won’t mess encryption up. While some members of Congress steadfastly side with the “Of course law enforcement should be able to get at encrypted data” camp—Trey Gowdy (R-SC) and Jim Senssenbrenner (R-WI) spring to mind—the EWG appears to have listened to the people who actually understand this stuff.

However, it should not ignore and must address the legitimate concerns of the law enforcement and intelligence communities [/quote] Perhaps your Congress can address this without weakening encryption by devising a law that allows a “higher court” (not a lower court) to order a suspect to “unlock” their encrypted device or the court will “assume” that the suspect has something to hide in as a far as particular charge is concerned ? (This is along the lines of “Done nothing wrong, then you have nothing to fear by unlocking”) December 23, 2016 at 11:15 EST PM furbies December 23, 2016 I meant to also say: This sort of law would only be applicable to the most serious charges/crimes. December 23, 2016 at 11:16 EST PM Lee Dronick December 23, 2016 “Reading this report gives me new hope that Congress won’t mess encryption up” It could change drastically when President Elect Trump gets sworn in, I hope not. December 23, 2016 at 11:27 EST PM gGrant December 25, 2016 Somebody is making the mistake that law enforcement wants devices unencrypted for a particular crime. They want it -all the time- for everyone, suspect or not. They’ve had it since the telephone was invented (ref: Enemy of the State, a decade before Snowdon) and they want it even more badly now that they think they can store and mine this data. Not because there’s any particular reason for it, simply because THEY CAN. The rest is politics and rationalisation. Encryption can be broken (more quickly than anyone wants to admit), and for a specific crime, that’s all that needs to happen. All the breast beating, brow wiping and public anguish is merely softening the public up for government overreach. Law enforcement just don’t want to have to work that hard when communications were previously open to them at all times. FBI has a publicly admitted history of using information to blackmail people and a law was passed to limit the director’s tenure to prevent such abuses becoming institutional. That law was repealed by… not Bush… Obama. Congress has ignored Working Group reports before. Hate to burst that particular bubble. This report is to give the appearance of doing the right thing. The legislation will be entirely different. Study it carefully. FBI never worried about the terrorist Android phone (destroyed or not) because everything that ever went through that phone is stored on Google’s servers. Being destroyed, it seems, that is the phone that might have had any evidence on it, but nobody bothered/wanted to go there. Attacking Apple was always a rationalisation. FBI are used to open slather and Apple stands in their way. December 25, 2016 at 9:01 EST AM bbh December 27, 2016 Who defines “serious”.

The product-testing publication said it did so because of the laptop’s “highly inconsistent” battery life. In three consecutive tests, one 13-inch MacBook Pro model ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second and just 3.75 hours in the third, the publication said of the recently released line, which starts at $1,499. It added that battery life for the 15-inch laptop it tested ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours. “This is a real departure from past MacBooks,” CR reported. “Most Apple laptops have scored well in our battery test, typically lasting much longer than the manufacturer has claimed.” By way of example, the product tester said an earlier MacBook Pro model lasted 19 hours. Apple didn’t comment to CR or The Post about the erratic performance of batteries in the new MacBook Pro series. The Apple Store website assures would-be buyers of the laptop of “up to 10 hours of battery life” between charges. CR added that a laptop’s battery life typically varies from one trial to another by less than 5 percent. But the batteries in the new MacBook Pros generated such “widely disparate” test figures, CR said, it opted to use only the lowest in calculating final scores. “It’s the only time frame we can confidently advise a consumer to rely on if he or she is planning to use the product without access to an electrical outlet,” CR said in a blog post published late Thursday.
