This is particularly encouraging news as a recently leaked schematic of the iPhone 8 seemed to indicate otherwise. As it turns out, the leaked iPhone 8 schematic we highlighted yesterday is in the EVT (Engineering Validation Test) phase, which is to say that it’s just one of many prototypes Apple was busy exploring. Indeed, it’s no secret that Apple often tests a handful of different iPhone models before choosing a final design and sending it off for mass production. Once a final design is approved, it goes through DVT (Design Validation Test) phase. In other words, there’s still plenty of reason for iPhone enthusiasts hoping for a radical new redesign to get excited. Don't Miss: Galaxy S8 sales are already explosive That said, iDropNews, citing a source working within Foxconn, writes that Apple is currently testing two different iPhone 8 designs but that the design likely to enter mass production will be the sleek-looking device with an embedded Touch ID we’ve been dreaming of. [The] informant divulged there are two iPhone 8 prototypes currently being tested. The first model features Touch ID on the rear, however the second model does in fact feature Touch ID underneath the display. There are a few major differences between the two prototypes listed below. Based on the following information, we’re hoping this version becomes the official design for the iPhone 8, and the source is confident that it will be. According to the report, the iPhone 8 will feature 4mm bezels around the entire OLED display. Additionally, the report relays that the device will feature an ‘invisible’ front-facing camera along with a larger power button. Helping us envision what this mythical iPhone 8 might look like, iDropNews yesterday published some eye-popping new renders which provide us with clearer idea as to what the final iPhone 8 design will look like. Read More Placing the Touch ID sensor on the back of the iPhone 8 would certainly make life easier for Apple engineers, but such a design would undoubtedly be a huge step backwards with respect to usability. An edgeless display is certainly something most everyone wants to see, but sacrificing easy access to Touch ID — a feature most people use dozens of times a day at the very least — would be a net negative as far as the overall design is concerned. Design issues aside, an analyst report recently disclosed that the iPhone 8 will include 3GB of RAM and will come in 64GB and 256GB storage options. Additionally, Apple’s next-gen device will reportedly include improved water resistance, fast-charging capabilities, and incredible battery life.

The permit allows it to conduct test drives in three vehicles with six drivers, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said on Friday. The vehicles are all 2015 Lexus RX450h, according to the DMV. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts in recent years, and the permit pulls the curtain back a bit on any possible plan. "This does confirm what's long been rumored: that Apple is at least toying with the idea of getting into the autonomous game in some capacity," said Chris Theodore, president of consultancy Theodore & Associates, and a former vice president at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler. The permit does not mean Apple is definitely building a car. "This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumored, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology," Theodore said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement the company made in November when it wrote to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on the subject of regulating self-driving vehicles. "The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation," Apple's director of product integrity, Steve Kenner, wrote in that five-page letter. Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California - all vying to be the first to have commercially viable vehicles on the roads. Companies that have been issued permits also include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. Many companies have said the first cars will launch in 2020 but some experts believe it may take much longer due to regulatory challenges.

The Cupertino titan has purportedly assembled a small – but highly qualified – team of biomedical engineers to develop sensors that can non-invasively monitor blood sugar levels to more efficiently treat diabetes, CNBC reports. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY The technology was initially conceived by the now-deceased Steve Jobs as part of a “super secretive initiative” aimed at designing a “breaktrhough” technology to accurately measure glucose levels without piercing the skin. Citing people familiar with the matter, the publication claims Apple has already been conducting feasibility trails at clinical sites across the Bay Area, with consultants working out regulatory obstacles in the meantime. The medical tech, which has been in the making for at least five years now, is expected to offer tracking solutions for crucial vitals like “oxygen levels, heart rate and blood glucose” – much like Jobs first envisioned it. An insider told CNBC the Big A has tasked about 30 people to work as part of its medical tech squad, which brings together biomedical experts from companies like Vital Connect, Masimo Corp, Sano, Medtronic, and C8 Medisensors. While details about the diabetes sensors are still scarce, CNBC says “Apple is developing optical sensors, which involves shining a light through the skin to measure indications of glucose.” The Cuprtino behemoth is hardly the only company in the field. Google health tech subsidiary Verily has similarly been working on bleeding-edge solutions for diabetes patients, including a smart contact lens that tracks blood levels through the eye. Back in 2010, researchers from MIT were reportedly developing a biometric tattoo that could track glucose levels without the need for finger pricks. Unfortunately, most attempts have been unsuccessful. The breakthrough could potentially save millions of people suffering from diabetes and significantly reduce the inconvenient process of measuring blood sugar levels multiple times a day. Still, chances are the tech will take years to polish – and the medical trackers might not always be as accurate as they claim to be.

Taylor, visionary in birth of personal computing and internet, dies at 85 UPDATED: Sat., April 15, 2017, 9 p.m. Bob Taylor in 2008 (Gardner Campbell / Creative Commons) By Michael Hiltzik Los Angeles Times Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS In 1968, Robert W. Taylor made a prediction that would guide the course of computer science for decades to come. “In a few years,” he wrote, “men will be able to communicate more effectively through a machine than face to face.” Taylor, who died Thursday at the age of 85, became the single most important force in making his own vision come true. As a civilian official at the Pentagon’s Advanced Research Projects Agency in the 1960s, he approved the funding to launch the government computer network that would ultimately evolve into the internet. And as one of the original laboratory chiefs at the fabled Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, he supervised the work that produced the first personal computer; the graphical user interface that was the model for Microsoft Windows and the Apple Macintosh display; the laser printer; the Ethernet local network; and many more advances. Taylor, who suffered from Parkinson’s disease and other ailments, died at his home in the San Francisco Bay Area town of Woodside, according to his son Kurt. Taylor may have been little known to the general public, but he was a revered figure among computer scientists and designers – many of whom received their earliest funding or developed their pioneering concepts with his help. Taylor’s lab at PARC spawned companies and concepts that would help to place California’s Silicon Valley at the center of the digital business world. “From the early 1960s, Bob always had a very clear vision of the potential of the computer at a time when very few other people had really grasped it,” recalled Butler Lampson, one of the designers of the Alto, PARC’s groundbreaking personal computer. “He certainly was the one with the overarching vision of what we were trying to accomplish.” Born in 1932 in Dallas, Taylor never lost the West Texas twang he acquired during his Depression-era upbringing as the adopted son of a Methodist minister and his wife. He earned a master’s degree in psychology at the University of Texas, and eventually joined the Pentagon as a research official. His superior, psychologist J.C.R. Licklider, was devoted to “finding ways to make computers easier to use” – and especially making them interactive, Taylor recollected years later. At that time, computers were room-size monstrosities that operated on the “batch” principle. A user would write an entire program on punch cards or spools of punched tape, feed it into the machine, wait for it to be processed, and then correct or rewrite it and feed it all back in. “It was an unbelievable rigmarole,” Taylor recalled. Moreover, every brand of computer ran on a proprietary language that made them all mutually unintelligible. At the Advanced Research Projects Agency, Taylor witnessed the drawbacks of this arrangement firsthand. He had three terminals in his office, each linked to a computer project he was funding at three separate academic institutions. They could communicate with him, but not with one another, which prevented rather than fostered collaboration among ARPA’s researchers. “You don’t have to be half-smart to see that this thing ought to be designed such that you just have one terminal and you can go wherever you want to go,” Taylor explained many years later. In 1966, he proposed such a system to ARPA’s chief, Charles Herzfeld, who saw the point immediately and approved the “million dollars or so” Taylor told him he needed to get the project off the ground. “That,” Taylor remembered years later, “was literally a 20-minute conversation.” From that conversation was born the ARPAnet, which over the ensuing decades evolved into the internet. By 1969, Taylor had become disaffected with ARPA, which was losing its independence as a civilian research unit and becoming more focused on military projects related to the Vietnam War. He left the agency, and soon after received an invitation from Xerox, which was launching a research outpost on the West Coast. Xerox hoped to diversify beyond its enormous franchise in large-scale office copiers and develop technologies for what it called the “office of the future.” The new operation, founded in 1970 as its Palo Alto Research Center – a year before the term “Silicon Valley” first appeared in print – became better known as Xerox PARC. Shortly after arriving in Palo Alto, Taylor stopped by the desk of a secretary who was showing off her new IBM Selectric typewriter, which used a distinctive golf ball-shaped mechanism to imprint letters on paper. He tapped it with his finger and said, “We’re going to make this thing obsolete.” He was right. Taylor assembled a brilliant team of resourceful computer designers in part by raiding the academic programs he had funded at ARPA. He passed on his vision that the computer should be an interactive device, which responded command by command to its users’ needs. In their 1968 manifesto “The Computer as a Communication Device,” Licklider and Taylor asserted that the “programmed digital computer . can change the nature and value of communication even more profoundly than did the printing press and the picture tube.” The goal was “making the response time short and the conversation free and easy” in a network of computers – not just in one machine. The problem was that the hardware and software necessary to make this vision real didn’t exist yet. Taylor’s lab at PARC invented it. His hand-picked team included Lampson and Charles Thacker, who were brilliant at computer design, and Alan Kay, a seminal thinker who perceived the computer as a device to enhance individual creativity. They believed the computer should be endowed with a high-quality display, on the principle that the most efficient path to the human brain came through the eyes. Kay, Butler Lampson, and Thacker designed and built the first personal computer, the Alto, following a path that Taylor laid out in rough strokes: “He would set down broad goals and coax us into working on them,” Lampson recalled. The Alto was equipped with a screen about the size and orientation of a paper page, and a graphical display that became the precursor of Microsoft Windows and Apple’s Macintosh screen. The Alto was a genuinely personal device – every PARC computer scientist soon had his or her own – and began to approach the computing power to fulfill Kay’s dream of a computer that could not only perform calculations, but allow “the communication of the owner with himself.” Lacking formal training in computer science or engineering, Taylor created the environment for his scientists – typically willful, intellectually self-confident, and self-absorbed – to do their work. It may have been his greatest accomplishment. He instituted weekly team meetings known as “Dealer,” after the book “Beat the Dealer,” which described a winning blackjack system. At Dealer, the scientists would sit on hideously upholstered beanbag chairs to subject a presenter’s work or theory to ruthless, sometimes rude, but invariably incisive critiques. The idea was to create the sense of an extended family amid the unfettered testing of ideas – with the ideas the key element. “If somebody tried to push their personality rather than their argument,” Taylor recalled, “they’d find that it wouldn’t work.” “He knew how to get lone wolves to cooperate so there was maximum synergy in the room,” Kay said. Taylor also expended enormous energy building a wall around his team to fend off constant pressure from Xerox to align their work with the corporation’s most immediate goals. This generated friction not only with corporate management, but with other labs at PARC that were competing with his computer scientists for corporate resources. “He showed maximum pugnaciousness upward,” Kay said, “and maximum nurturing downward.” Taylor’s “key idea,” Kay added, was to “fund people, not projects” – bringing together the best scientists in the world to solve the problems they thought were the most important. In time, Taylor and his team became frustrated by Xerox’s inability or unwillingness to commercialize their work. In December 1979 the first breach in PARC’s wall occurred after Apple’s Steve Jobs accepted an investment from Xerox on condition that he get a look inside the research center. During two separate demonstrations, Jobs and his associates were shown the Alto and much of its key software. Many of the concepts made their way into the Lisa, Apple’s first large-scale product. Some Apple engineers would try to minimize how much they gleaned from these visits, but there was little doubt that both Apple and Microsoft took PARC’s display and other features of its work as a model for their own software. According to Walter Isaacson’s 2011 biography of Jobs, Microsoft’s Bill Gates answered Jobs’ accusation that Microsoft had stolen the Windows graphical display from Apple by observing, “It’s more like we had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had already stolen it.” Taylor’s determined defense of his team eventually led to his unhappy departure from PARC. In 1981, new management arrived at the research center determined to align the center, especially Taylor’s team, with corporate goals. Within a year Taylor was goaded into resigning. Taylor moved to Digital Equipment Corp., where he presided over more advances, including the early search engine Alta Vista. But he never matched the accomplishments of his PARC years, in part because the advances there had seeded so many other new technologies that it became difficult for any single lab to remain in the forefront for long. Indeed, after Taylor’s departure, the trickle of resignations by PARC scientists seeking new outlets for their work turned into a flood – and his influence is visible in almost every corner of the digital world today. Software designer Larry Tesler moved to Apple; Hungarian immigrant Charles Simonyi, who had developed Bravo, a word-processing program on what-you-see-is-what-you-get (or WYSIWYG) principles to take advantage of the Alto’s display, took his program to Microsoft, where it became the kernel of Microsoft Word. Robert Metcalfe, the co-inventor of Ethernet, founded 3Com Corp. to commercialize the technology, and programming aces Charles Geschke and John Warnock left to found Adobe Systems. “He was one of those unique people,” Kay said, “who was a central factor in a deep revolution of ideas.” Updated: April 15, 2017, 9 p.m.  Tags: Apple, computer, computing, interface, internet, mac, Macintosh, Obit, obituary, robert w. taylor, science, Tech, Technology, Xerox Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Here’s how to downgrade from 10.3 or 10.3.1. Apple released the iOS 10.3 update in mid-March and the iOS 10.3.1 update in early April. You can no longer downgrade from iOS 10.3.1 to either 10.3 or 10.2.1. Do not attempt this process. Unfortunately, there is no way to go back to iOS 10.2, which you can jailbreak. Officially Apple does not support a way to downgrade iOS updates, but there is an easy way to do this in iTunes for a short time after Apple releases an update. Apple closed the option to downgrade to iOS 9 long ago, but you can still downgrade to iOS 10.2.1. In order to downgrade iOS 10.3 to iOS 10.2.1 you will need to download the file and Apple still needs to sign the file. This normally only happens for a week or two after Apple offers a new update. How to downgrade from iOS 10.3 to iOS 10.2.1. Apple’s upgrade system includes a check to make sure that Apple is still activating, or signing, the software you want to install. If Apple is no longer signing this update you will not be able to install it. How to Downgrade iOS 10.3 to iOS 10.2.1 Here are the steps you need to downgrade from iOS 10.3 or IOS 10.3.1 to iOS 10.2.1. You cannot downgrade to iOS 9.3 or to iOS 9.2, which is frustrating for some users. You cannot downgrade back to a jailbreak-able version of iOS 10 either. Backup Your iPhone Before you start you should make sure that your iPhone or iPad is backed up to your computer. You can’t restore a iOS 10.3 backup to your iPhone after you downgrade to iOS 10.2.1, but it is important to make sure you have a backup in case something does go wrong. Make sure you have a backup before you start the iOS 10.2 downgrade to iOS 10.1.1. When you downgrade you will need to completely erase your iPhone. If you have a backup from iOS 10 you can restore to that. Download the iOS 10.2.1 Update To do this you will need to plug into your Mac or PC using a Lightning cable and you will need to make sure that you have the iOS 10.2.1 update file for your device. Here’s where you can download iOS 10.2.1 ipsw files for any of the iPhone or iPad devices that runs this update. If the row is green and there is a check in the Apple Signing Status, then you know that you can continue. If Apple is no longer signing iOS 10.2.1 you should stop. In a surprise move, Apple is still signing iOS 10.2.1 as opf April 10th. Start the iOS 10.3 Downgrade to iOS 10.2.1 Once you have the file downloaded to your computer, and unzipped if needed, you will want to plug in your iPhone to Mac or PC with a Lightning cable. Start the downgrade to go back to iOS 10.2. Open iTunes and click on your iPhone or iPad to launch the device summary page in iTunes. Make sure you turn off Find my iPhone before you start. You will need to special click on “Restore iPhone…”. That is a alt/option click on Mac or a Shift click in Windows. Hold the key and then click. This will open up a prompt so that you can search for the iOS 10.2. ipsw file you downloaded.   Complete the iOS 10.3 downgrade to iOS 10.2.1 Find the file and click Open to start the downgrade process. You will see a message on the screen that iTunes will erase and restore your iPhone to iOS 10.2.1 and will verify the restore with Apple. Click Restore to start.

The permit means that Apple can now test self-driving prototypes on California's public roads, but the company could have been testing prototypes in private facilities before that. Apple issued the letter because it is "investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems", an Apple spokesman said in an email to AFP at the time. In August, Apple CEO Tim Cook told the Washington Post, when asked about an Apple vehicle project: "I can't answer a question about something we haven't announced". This is the most likely case for Apple right now, as it is definitely not in the car-making business. Buying an autonomous vehicle only to have tell you "Hold the wheel" when you cross a state line sounds like a major no-no. Apple's secretive vehicle program came grinding to a halt previous year, but the tech giant never gave up on the self-driving auto race. In early 2016, CEO Tim Cook fielded a question at the company's annual shareholder meeting about developing a vehicle, to which he provided a cryptic response that neither confirmed nor denied the project. Do you think there are high chances that Apple will release a self-driving vehicle in the future? Apple is the 30th group to receive a permit in California, alongside carmakers Ford, Volkswagen and General Motors, suppliers including Delphi and Bosch and start-ups such as Zoox, Drive.ai and Plus.ai. Waymo, the Google subsidiary that's seen as the self-driving leader, is taking such an approach. Apple began to focus more on the self-driving technology previous year after rehiring former hardware executive Bob Mansfield to lead the project. The new development goes against a report in late 2016 that said Apple's so-called Project Titan was shifting focus to on software for vehicles.

Firms/companies > A > Apple More reports on: Automotive, Cars Apple receives permit to test self-driving vehicles on California roads news 15 April 2017 The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) on Friday allowed Apple to test self-driving vehicles in the state, confirming long-rumoured plans of the company's foray into driver-less vehicles, code-named "Project Titan". Apple's move into AV technology was not unexpected and the company was supposed to have ''Project Titan'' connected to vehicles in the works, but had not confirmed it. ''This absolutely verifies that they are going to do something in this space,'' Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead said of Apple. ''This is likely Titan.'' The DMV yesterday provided confirmation that not only was Apple working on automotive technology, it also had plans for autonomous vehicles. The department had issued permits to 29 firms to test self-driving vehicles on California roads with Apple being the latest. ''The permit covers three vehicles, all 2015 Lexus RX450h, and six drivers,'' the DMV said in a statement yesterday. The DMV did not provide further information. With the move, Apple has joined Google, Tesla, Ford, BMW, Subaru, General Motors and other major automakers and tech companies in developing driver-less technology. According to Moorehead, Apple was probably not building its own car, however, and Project Titan might only be a code word for the firm's work on vehicle technology. Apple had met with the DMV as far back as 2015, but despite this, testing had continued in private. The most public the project had ever been was in November 2016, when Apple submitted a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, expressing interest in the autonomous field. The company was also at one point thought to be designing a top-to-bottom vehicle, but the company had reined in the project due to a number of obstacles and switched to the more narrow focus of a self-driving platform. The company was also later this year, expected to decide whether to resume building a full-fledged car or partner with an existing automaker.  search domain-b    go Legal Policy | Copyright © 1999-2017 The Information Company Private Limited.

About us Our staff Contacts Home Business Health Science Tech World Apple gets permit to test self-driving cars in California April 15, 2017 Paul Smedley Leave a comment The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has released an updated list of companies with the ability to test autonomous vehicles in the state, and at the bottom of that new list is Apple, Inc. Apple would have loved to keep this under wraps, but unfortunately, they have to get a permit before they begin testing. But by last October, many in the team had reportedly left or been reassigned as a result of a strategic shift by the company to focus on the software side of self-driving technology. For quite a while, rumors swirled that Apple was creating a self-driving vehicle under Project Titan, but past year, it was reported that the company gave up on this plan in favor of developing a software-based autonomous drive system. An Apple spokesman declined to comment beyond a statement issued in December when the company filed paperwork with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regarding safety practices for self-driving cars. “Applying for the permit also doesn’t necessarily mean Apple will start actively testing immediately, as some companies apply for the permits, but take a bit longer to actually start driving their autonomous vehicles on the roads”, said Akshay Anand, an analyst with Kelley Blue Book. The permit covers the registration of three Lexus RX450h SUVs, and allows six drivers to operate them. While GM is already testing autonomous vehicles through its Cruise Automation unit in California, Arizona and MI, the new initiative will ramp up those efforts. It seems that Apple’s overall strategy is still up in the air. A quarter of all miles driven in the USA may be traveled in shared, self-driving electric cars by the end of the next decade, Boston Consulting Group said this month. This is not the first time Apple has leapt into the automotive space. The company is only testing components of a self-driving auto. And in July, the company brought in Bob Mansfield, a highly regarded Apple veteran, to take over the effort. Others said Apple was more likely focusing on software that could be used to control a vehicle, or to upgrade a auto by injecting it with autonomous capabilities.

Read now to get all the details about the Apple's autonomous technology. Written By: Sukesh Suvarna Updated: Saturday, April 15, 2017, 10:56 [IST] US tech giant Apple plans to test autonomous cars on the roads of California. The technology firm wants to design and develop a self-driving technology. California Department of Motor Vehicles granted Apple an official test permit to test autonomous driving technology. The self-driving technology will be tested in three 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs. The permit also authorises six people to take control of the vehicle if necessary. Although, Apple was reluctant to reveal details about the project. Internally, the project was code named as ‘Project Titan'. The tech giant declined to respond on the California permit or about its future automotive plans. The self-driving car segment is one of the most bitter areas in the emerging technology. Now Apple has joined the group of 29 companies, which have obtained test permits in California. The pioneer of the autonomous driving technology, Google considers self-driving cars to be the potential new market. Ride-hailing giant Uber is also on the centre stage to develop self-driving cars to eliminate the need for human drivers. Auto giants such as General Motors and Ford consider autonomous vehicles as an extension of their business.

⌂ Contact us Money Arts&Culture Tech Research Sports Global Media Medicine U.S. Apple to begin testing on self-driving cars April 15 18:26 2017 By Antonio Miles As per information released by California DMV, Apple has been granted permit for three vehicles for autonomous driving. According to Apple spokesperson, test drive should improve artificial intelligence systems that must learn the ways to interact with an unpredictability of human drivers. The company was also at one point thought to be designing a top-to-bottom vehicle, but the company had reined in the project due to a number of obstacles and switched to the more narrow focus of a self-driving platform. The group includes BMW, Ford, Honda, Nissan, Uber and others. The Cupertino, California, company instead pointed to a statement that it issued in December. The Cupertino, Calif. -based tech giant has always been rumored to be working on its own autonomous vehicle as part of an initiative called Project Titan, but has never officially confirmed its plans. Apple has remained secretive about its self-driving project. Some predicted that the company would itself be producing drivable vehicles. Apple's move into self-driving cars has been hotly anticipated for years, and Friday's news is the latest indication that it is serious about the space. A 2015 hiring spree at Apple for automotive engineers prompted another wave of rumors. Google and Uber have them, and the latter also started testing self-driving cars with its Pittsburgh customers late previous year. Most other companies holding the testing permit are technology start-ups. Despite the permit, it's still unclear what specific aspect Apple is working on. Apple reps didn't respond to requests for comment. Perhaps a clearer sign of Apple's concrete movements in autonomous vehicles is when Apple's director of product integrity, Steve Kenner, wrote a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2016 stating the company's substantial investments in the study of machine learning and automation, and expressed the company's excitement in the potentials of automation, including the area of transportation. With its permit, Apple is leaping into an increasingly competitive race to build the world's first mainstream self-driving vehicle. General Motors this week announced that its autonomous driving efforts, investing $14 million and adding 1,100 jobs in a new research center in San Francisco. Apple believes that self-driving cars can save lives and accidents along with easing congestion. "Applying for the permit also doesn't necessarily mean Apple will start actively testing immediately, as some companies apply for the permits, but take a bit longer to actually start driving their autonomous vehicles on the roads", said Akshay Anand, an analyst with Kelley Blue Book. As per California DMV, "The California Autonomous Vehicle Testing Regulations require every manufacturer authorized to test autonomous vehicles on public roads to submit an annual report summarizing the disengagements of the technology during testing".

Apple was granted a permit Friday to test self-driving vehicles in California, Automotive News reports. This is the first time Apple has received approval for such testing. A person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that software tests with existing vehicles will kick off soon. They asked not to be identified because the plans aren't public. Recent reporting suggests that the company is no longer attempting to build its own autonomous, electric vehicle to compete with companies like Tesla, but is instead focused on developing self-driving software it can deploy in partnership with existing carmakers. Apple does not test a full self-driving vehicle. A quarter of all miles driven in the USA may be traveled in shared, self-driving electric cars by the end of the next decade, Boston Consulting Group said this month. In terms of timelines, you'd have to argue Apple is a long way behind the eight ball here - Google for example has been developing this technology for a very long time, Tesla have got vehicles on the road of their own making running live and development technology. This week, Apple was granted a permit for the testing of its autonomous vehicle, or self-drive auto, in California. Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo and Uber Technologies Inc.'s self-driving test cars also have people behind the wheel during tests. To date, the tech giant has been infuriatingly secretive about it's efforts to build a self-driving vehicle, code named Project Titan. At last, the company's secretive efforts was crowned by the success. So, Apple's vision for autonomous systems clearly extends beyond transportation, but for now, they appear to be getting ready to burn some rubber (um, hopefully not) in California with their latest self-driving software. Now out of nowhere there is proof that Apple is working on self-driving cars. Apple's Project Titan, at one point was believed to have over 1000 employees that were working on it.

⌂ Contact us Money Arts&Culture Tech Research Sports Global Media Medicine U.S. Apple joins race to design self-driving cars April 15 18:52 2017 By Kerry Garner Apple has received California DMV permit for testing self-driving vehicles in California. Apple Inc.is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars. Examples of companies holding autonomous testing permits in California include Google, Tesla, and Bosch. They released those statements in November 2016 with regard to their application to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Apple is set to begin testing as the state government becomes more welcoming to self-driving vehicles. While this state of affairs probably won't change anytime soon, the company recently gained entry into California's list of companies allowed to test self-driving vehicles, serving as the biggest confirmation yet of its intentions. Chinese tech giant Baidu, which is working on autonomous driving at its California research center, this week announced the acquisition of xPerception, a U.S. startup that provides visual perception software, along with services and devices for people who are visually impaired. A Lexus spokesman told The Post he had no "specific information" on why Apple chose its model, but added that its hybrid crossover SUVs "are a popular choice among companies looking to test future technologies". Apple Inc, the manufacturer of iPhone and other electronic devices, joined Friday more than a dozen of companies to be allowed to test self-driving vehicles on public roads in California. It represents a rare, definitive public step for the company, whose plans for the autonomous and connected vehicle arena had grown unclear. Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving auto market, but wouldn't discuss it. Many companies have said the first self-driving cars will launch in 2020, but some experts believe it may take much longer due to regulatory challenges. While other companies working on self-driving technology have shared their plans, Apple has remained silent about its project for self-driving vehicles. It wasn't the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo and Uber Technologies Inc.'s self-driving test cars also have people behind the wheel during tests. Apple has been working on Project Titan for several years, but has never formally acknowledged it. Stay on topic - This helps keep the thread focused on the discussion at hand.

Digital Trends Home > Cars > Apple just got permission to test its self-driving… Apple just got permission to test its self-driving cars in California By Lulu Chang — April 15, 2017 10:23 AM Subscribe Share Jimmy Baikovicius/Flickr Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you While Apple has long been tight-lipped about its plans around self-driving technology, it appears that things are moving forward now that the tech giant has secured a permit to test the tech in California. California has well and truly opened the floodgates. We’re not talking about Governor Jerry Brown’s recent announcement regarding the end of the drought emergency. Rather, we’re referring to the Department of Motor Vehicles’ decision to grant Apple an autonomous vehicle testing permit on Friday, allowing the iEmpire to use California’s public highways in testing self-driving technology. Apple joins the ranks of numerous competitors also seeking to produce autonomous vehicles en masse — Alphabet, Tesla, and Uber all already have permission from California to conduct their own tests. So really, what’s the addition of one more company? This marks the first time Apple has been given a permit for its autonomous cars, and suggests that the company is well and truly on its way to expanding its horizons. Soon, Apple’s hardware could be decidedly larger than the laptops and phones we’ve become so accustomed to. The permit allows Apple to test three 2015 Lexus sport-utility vehicles, all of which would be retrofitted with the necessary hardware and software that would allow them to operate without a driver. That said, the permit requires human operators to be present whenever the cars are on the road. While Apple has been consistently cagey about its plans to delve into self-driving territory, the company did pen a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last year offering their support for autonomous technology. But even now, the firm is remaining tight-lipped — on Friday, an Apple spokesman declined to comment on the newly won permit. Regardless, it seems like we’ll soon be seeing Apple cars on the road. “I’m not sure they know what their play will be, but they do sense there’s an opportunity and they can bring value to it,” Ben Bajarin, an analyst with technology-research firm Creative Strategies, told the Wall Street Journal. “The question is: How big is this commitment? And how much money are they throwing at this commitment? It’s hard to know where this lands on their priority list.”

As much as I use my Apple Watch as a fitness tracker I'm continually reminded how much more there is to it. Beyond even Apple Pay, notifications, and Siri and HomeKit. It's only when I see things like this — the built in SOS feature from watchOS 3 literally saving lives — that I appreciate just how important having a connected computer strapped to my wrist can be. From The Daily Mail: Casey Bennett, from Laytonsville, Maryland, was driving home from school the night of April 6 when he was struck by another vehicle – sending him and his Jeep Patriot flying through the air. Bennett, 22, found himself hanging from the driver's seat by just his seat belt, but his iPhone was too far out of reach to call for help. However, he remembered the Apple Watch included the SOS Emergency feature – he held the side button down and contacted 911 for help, who were on the scene in six minutes. If you're not already familiar with SOS, please take a moment and read this: How to use SOS on Apple Watch: The ultimate guide SOS exists on iPhone as well, and thankfully so. But Apple Watch has the advantage of permanency of place. It could be smashed or otherwise rendered non-functional, certainly. But, as long as it's working, you never have to worry about remembering which pocket, bag, or cup holder it's in, or if it got dropped or was sent flying away. It's right there. On your wrist. Where you can reach it. Always. Right after WWDC 2016, my colleagues Georgia Dow and Serenity Caldwell and I discussed how important a feature SOS would turn out to be. I can't wait to see what Apple has in store for watchOS 4 at WWDC 2017.

The US firm plans to financially support Taiwan’s Hon Hai, which has reportedly bid some 3 trillion yen ($27.6 billion) in the initial tendering round for the memory chip business, the Mainichi Shimbun said. Apple, which uses Toshiba’s memory chips for its iPhone, hopes to secure stable supplies of the key parts by supporting Hon Hai’s bid, the daily said. Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, is separately asking SoftBank to join the team, the daily said. The Japanese telecom company may help Hon Hai negotiate with local banks currently supporting Toshiba, it said. Among other bidders are Google and Amazon as well as US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom, news reports have said, quoting unnamed sources. Local media said any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba’s memory chips. Toshiba is the world’s number two supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea’s Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67 trillion yen in revenue last fiscal year. But it plans to sell-off the chip business, seen as crucial for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around, after suffering huge cost overruns and construction delays at its US nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection late March.— AFP About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← US labour market tightening, inflation trending higher GCC risk premiums will rise as credit downgrades continue: Fisch → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent HM greetings to Queen of Denmark Flouting safety norms risk workers’ lives FTAs contribute to economic and trade ties development Over 7,500 housing plots allotted Read More ...

According to an internal memo obtained by 9to5 Mac, users who need service on that model could walk out of the store with a shiny new iPad Air 2. Image: Apple According to the US report, the memo simply states, "Starting March 30th, iPad 4th generation whole unit repairs may be substituted to iPad Air 2." The fourth generation iPad was discontinued in 2014, but Apple tends to support its devices for up to 5 years after their debut. Customers who bring in a device for repair at locations that don't offer that service will often be given a new device for the sake of convenience. Now that supplies of the fourth generation are dwindling, Apple has apparently freed its employees to substitute an iPad that's two generations newer. The iPad Air 2 has also been discontinued but that move only occurred last month, so this is a relatively current tablet and it's still dang good. The iPad Air 2 did not offer the 16GB and 64GB models, so you'd likely be getting a storage upgrade along with the overall more advanced tech. So, just FYI, if you take your old fourth-gen iPad in for service and they try to replace it with the same model, maybe shop around to see if you get something better. We don't recommend intentionally breaking the tablet, you never know what Apple might say and you could end up with nothing.

Approved government agencies can access that data without a warrant. It's not private information, either.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Where Are My iCloud, iTunes & App Store Options After iOS 10.3 Update? By Uzair Ghani Apr 13, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit If you are wondering where iCloud and iTunes & App Store options went from Settings app after iOS 10.3 update, we’re here to help. Apple Shuffled a Few Things After iOS 10.3 – Moves iCloud and iTunes & App Store to a New Location iOS 10.3 introduced a bunch of new features to iPhone and iPad users. But perhaps the most noticeable change lies in the Settings app, where you’ll see for yourself that the iCloud and iTunes & App Store entries are not where they supposed to be. In fact, they are still there, but Apple moved them to a dedicated location making things easier to manage when it comes to your Apple ID. Related iOS 11 Will Reportedly Drop 32-bit App Support This Fall If you launch the iOS 10.3.x Settings app right now, you’ll notice at the very top there’s an entry for Apple ID, iCloud, iTunes & App Store. Simply tap on it and you will see everything there is pertaining to your Apple ID in one place. Tapping on the iCloud entry will take you to what was once accessible by going to Settings > iCloud. Same goes for iTunes & App Store as well. As a long time iOS user myself, I find the change rather odd since I’m used to the old position of the entry more in the Settings app. But over time, I’ve managed to get used to the new change, and quite frankly, it’s a change for the better as well. Putting everything Apple ID related under one roof was an excellent move from Apple’s end. Advertisement Using the iCloud page, you can turn certain features on or off such as email, contact syncing and whatnot. Most importantly, this is the place where you can toggle Find My iPhone on or off. Therefore it’s highly recommended that user get to grips with this new change immediately. Related You Can No Longer Downgrade to iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 iOS 10.3.x is a nice little upgrade that promises speed improvements as well. And apart from that, there are a ton of bugs that have been fixed. Therefore it’s highly recommended that users go ahead and update their devices right away.

Study Watch is meant for research and will be put to work in several studies including a multi-year study to identify patterns in the progression of Parkinson’s disease, according to a blog post by Verily team members David He, Tushar Parlikar, and Harry Xiao. “The ability to passively capture health data is critical to the success of continuous care platforms and clinical research,” the post from the Google sister company said. “Study Watch represents another step in our targeted efforts to create new tools for unobtrusive bio-sensing.” Study Watch appeared styled after a traditional wrist-worn timepiece, and boasted features including long battery life and encryption for stored data. “Multiple physiological and environmental sensors are designed to measure relevant signals for studies spanning cardiovascular, movement disorders, and other areas,” the blog post said. “Examples include electrocardiogram, heart rate, electrodermal activity, and inertial movements.” Verily was part of the Google X lab known for big vision projects such as self-driving cars and internet-service delivered by high-altitude balloons, but was spun into an independent unit at Google-parent Alphabet in mid 2015. The debut of Study Watch comes as Apple continues to enhance capabilities of its smartwatch along with supporting Health Kit and Research Kit software for use by researchers and care providers as well as individuals interested in fitness. A secret team is working on enhancing Apple Watch sensors to monitor the blood sugar levels of wearers in what would be considered a diabetes breakthrough, according to a report this week by CNBC news. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Alphabet’s Verily makes smartwatch for health research Google’s AutoDraw aims to make art of your doodles (VIDEO) Nintendo to release mini-size Switch in 2019, Citigroup predicts Gary the parrot may hold secrets to advanced drones (VIDEO) US takedown of Russian botnet won’t end pernicious spam, say experts Project Scorpio: Five consoles that won with less power, and one that didn't That fingerprint sensor on your phone is not as safe as you think Facebook looking at behaviour to weed out fake accounts This prototype flight suit brings you that much closer to your Iron Man dreams (VIDEO) US takedown of Russian botnet won’t end pernicious spam, say experts Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Greek Orthodox Patriarch leads Holy Fire ceremony in Jerusalem Reuters Video: Beating climate-change odds, a wolverine is born in Belgium Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Related Articles Wearable computing market grows as gadgets evolve, says IDC Discounts, advertising spur brisk Apple Watch sales Apple Watch sales to consumers set record in holiday week, says Tim Cook Toms launches Apple Watch wrist bands How accurate are fitness trackers when it comes to heart rate readings?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Gabor Balogh Dubious report claims iPhone 8 hype is already stifling Galaxy S8 sales Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 12th, 2017 at 7:38 PM Share Tweet A new research report from TrendForce argues that growing demand and excitement for Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 will have an adverse impact on Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus sales. According to the report, the S8 will not have a major impact on Samsung’s bottom line due the hype for Apple’s next-gen and completely revamped iPhone model. “Major brands such as Samsung, LG and Huawei have begun to ship their flagship devices for the year,” the report notes, “but the market demand going into the second quarter is expected to remain relatively weak as consumers are holding off their purchases in anticipation of the 10th anniversary iPhone devices that will arrive in the third quarter. Don't Miss: Now other airlines are brutally trolling United Airlines, and it’s hilarious TrendForce’s report about Samsung’s prospects with the S8 and S8 Plus is a tad curious given that demand for the company’s upcoming flagship devices appear to be incredibly strong. In a statement released just a few days ago, a Samsung spokesperson relayed that “pre-orders of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ in the US are outpacing those of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge with strong double digit growth.” Additionally, we’ve also seen reports that demand for the premium-priced S8 Plus has been stronger than what Samsung was expecting, even prompting the company to boost S8 Plus production as a result. All that said, it’s probably far too early to accurately gauge how the impending iPhone 8 vs Galaxy S8 battle will play out. While the iPhone 8 will likely usher in the largest refresh cycle in iPhone history, it remains to be seen if the device will be compelling enough for traditional Android users beholden to Samsung to make the switch. While the number of Android to iPhone users seemingly increases each and every year, we have no data as to whether or not those users are leaving premium or more budget-friendly Android devices behind. Further, we still have to wait and see what the iPhone 8 brings to the table and when it might actually see the light of day. Indeed, there have been a few reports claiming that the iPhone 8 release might get pushed back a few weeks. More ominous reports have relayed that the device might not even hit store shelves until November.

By Shirley Leung Globe Staff  March 31, 2017 It’s probably not completely fair to say that a deer changed the course of one of the world’s great companies, but one might assume that as Jeff Immelt stared out the window of his office in suburban Connecticut, he saw one too many. He didn’t want to see deer. He wanted to see engineers, techies, kids with big ideas and sharp minds out to change the world. Advertisement Immelt didn’t want or need to change the world. He just wanted to change General Electric Co. and to change just about everything about it. Which in no small way explains why the chief executive officer of a famously staid conglomerate now works in a suite with exposed brick smack in the middle of the crowded Fort Point Channel district of Boston. In the makeshift headquarters, the executive dining room has been replaced with common space that features free Jack’s Abby craft beer on tap. Get Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here You see, the company cofounded by Thomas Edison in 1892, that made its proudly generic name by producing achingly reliable light bulbs, refrigerators, and microwave ovens, now wants to be a tech company — an Apple for modern industry, bringing smarts and the power of the Internet to hulking gear like jet engines, turbines, and MRIs. Immelt, Harvard MBA and a second-generation GE man, is close to completing a corporate transformation that is as radical as it is methodical, as essential to the company’s survival as Steve Jobs’s iPhone was to Apple’s. After 16 years at the helm, the GE Immelt has built is unrecognizable from the one he took over from his legendary predecessor, Jack Welch. Immelt has sold off signature parts of the company — plastics, appliances, NBC, and the bulk of a finance division so big it rivaled Wall Street banks. Consumer lighting — yes, those light bulbs — could be next. Advertisement It is a brazen reshaping of one of America’s most stalwart companies, yet outside of business circles, Immelt is hardly a household name like Welch was. The Salem native was one of America’s first celebrity CEOs, presiding over GE during the frothy ’80s and ’90s. He earned the admiration of Wall Street by producing predictable profits and the antipathy of Main Street by ruthlessly cutting jobs. Immelt has been the anti-Jack: the Midwestern math major who is partial to sweater vests, the guy who likes to drive his own car to work and park in public garages at night, the industrial titan whose subdued public persona exudes extreme competence more than charisma, and who has a talent for bringing out the best in the people who work for him. On top of it all, he has had the unglamorous job of steering the company through sobering times, including cataclysmic events such as Sept. 11 and the Great Recession. In uprooting the headquarters to Boston last August, Immelt might finally get to have as much fun running GE as Welch did. In May, the company will break ground on a $200 million futuristic complex overlooking the Fort Point Channel. Immelt gets giddy over what many Bostonians take for granted, marveling how one city can be home to some of the world’s leading life sciences companies and teaching hospitals. He is beside himself when he thinks about the brainpower at the universities from MIT to Harvard, and the fact that all of this is just a 10-minute drive from his office door. “That just kind of lets you see why being here matters,” he said in an interview at GE’s Boston office. Or, put it another way, he was lonely out amid the tranquil lawns of GE’s Fairfield, Conn., compound, where the company had been headquartered since the ’70s. Kathy Willens/Associated Press Jack Welch, left, spoke during a news conference in 2000 as Jeff Immelt looked on. Impatience on Wall Street “He would say you would walk out of the building, and there’s no one to play with,” said Sue Siegel, who oversees GE Ventures, the arm that invests and collaborates with startups. “When you think about innovation, you want access. You want to feel it.” Life would be great for Immelt — if not for Wall Street. His vision banks on a long-term payoff, but shareholders are growing impatient. While Welch notched astronomical returns over two decades, investors in Immelt’s GE would have made more by putting money in a plain-vanilla index fund. Immelt recently said the company would tie executive bonuses to the performance of GE’s industrial operations, a step taken after discussions with Nelson Peltz, a big shareholder who is pressing GE for better returns “He’s been down there fighting the gators for a long time,” said Nick Heymann, an analyst who follows GE for the investment banking firm William Blair. “If he can climb the wall, on the other side is finally going to be Jeff’s promised land.” The real question: Is Boston that promised land? When Immelt took the reins from Welch on Sept. 7, 2001, among the rookie CEO’s biggest concerns was getting out of his predecessor’s shadow. Neutron Jack was legend, Fortune magazine’s “Manager of the Century.” Love or hate him, everyone knew who Welch was — and who would want to be measured against his record? But four days later none of that mattered after terrorists turned planes into weapons attacking the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Two GE employees were killed, a recession kicked in, and the company’s stock plummeted. GE’s aviation businesses — jet engines and commercial aircraft leasing —took a big blow with the world not knowing if flying would ever be the same again. Later, when the 2008 recession hit, GE Capital, which had been producing more than half of the company’s operating profit, was battered just like the big banks it competed against. Along with companies such as Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, GE took a government lifeline to stabilize its finances and restore the confidence of investors and customers. A lesser executive might have cratered, but Immelt came to the top job having been groomed from the day he landed at GE after graduating from Harvard Business School in 1982. He was a rising star at GE Plastics when Welch himself plucked him in 1989 to become president of consumer service for GE Appliances. It was Immelt’s first big test, landing right in the middle of a massive recall of 3 million refrigerators with bad compressors. “I was like 32 years old. I had 7,000 employees, and it was a crisis,” he recalled. “I grew up a decade in two years. It taught me about managing people in a crisis. How you communicate, how important showing up was. . . . It taught me a lot about how to be a good operating leader and how to be methodical in how I did things.” He passed the test and bigger assignments came his way, eventually returning to the plastics division as general manager and later running GE’s health care business before being named at 45 years old as Welch’s successor. “I think Jeff is as skilled in crisis management as anyone in the country,” said New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. How would he know? The billionaire owner is among a cadre of Boston business power brokers Immelt has gotten to know through the years, including State Street CEO Jay Hooley, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and Bain Capital chairman Steve Pagliuca. Kraft formed a bond more than a decade ago with Immelt back when GE still owned NBC. Kraft headed the league’s broadcast committee, and Immelt wanted the network to air NFL games on Sunday nights. The two stitched a deal together. But that’s not how Kraft came to know Immelt’s crisis management prowess. As Kraft and the Patriots became embroiled in the Spygate and Deflategate scandals in recent years, advice came from an unexpected place. “On a personal level, he has been a great friend to me,” said Kraft. “Jeff called me literally from the other side of the world — one time was the Middle East, the other time was Asia. When everyone was coming after us, he gave support, advice, and counsel. That has meant so much to me and endeared me.” Immelt, who played football at Dartmouth College, makes it out to a Pats game with Kraft at least once a year. “In today’s world of CEOs of public monolithic companies, he’s a real people person,” said Kraft. Frank O’Brien/Globe Staff Dartmouth College offensive lineman Jeff Immelt, center, wore a pained expression in the fourth quarter against Harvard in 1977. Innovation for survival Every CEO talks about making his or her company more innovative, but for GE it’s a matter of survival. GE is a corporate mainstay, the only original stock left in the Dow Jones industrial index, which began tracking the performance of large public companies in 1896. It must succeed now in a world in which the only constant is change. His task is monumental because GE is nothing like a startup; it’s a behemoth. Immelt has to find a way to bring along some 300,000 employees in 180 countries at a company that generated almost $124 billion in revenue last year. Immelt’s first decade as CEO was spent fixing the house that Jack built. Immelt knew a lot of Welch’s tactics to drive growth would no longer work. The hardest breakup would be with GE Capital, which required shedding some $500 billion in assets. Still, Immelt hasn’t been afraid to reshape GE through dramatic deals. He bought the power and grid business of French multinational Alstom in 2015 to expand GE’s holdings in that sector, and last year announced a deal for Houston oil services company Baker Hughes, doubling down on GE’s oil and gas business. “He doesn’t accept the status quo. He doesn’t accept the easy way,” said Brackett Denniston, who was GE’s longtime general counsel until he retired in 2015. “He refocused the place completely on its inventiveness and its strength in innovation.” Coming to Boston was a way to show the world how serious GE is about transformation. When Bain cochairman Pagliuca first visited the new headquarters, he thought he was in the wrong place. “I was shocked,” said Pagliuca, who was a Harvard MBA classmate of Immelt’s and has done business with GE through the years. “This felt like Silicon Valley.” Immelt hasn’t done all this solely by imposing his will. Ben Shapiro, one of Immelt’s faculty advisers at Harvard Business School, recalls how his easygoing nature put classmates at ease. Immelt wasn’t the academic star of his class, or the hardest worker in that workaholic realm, but he was notably good with people. “What impressed me the most about him is that he was a very good listener,” said Shapiro, now an emeritus professor of marketing. “Jeff had this good mixture of emotional IQ.” He also, from an early age, recognized that success requiredunleashing the creative energies of everyone around him. “He is not the type of person you would lock up in a closet and ask to come up with an answer in six months,” said Shapiro. These days, as he tries to cement GE’s new image, Immelt at times can act more like a student of business than the leader of one of the biggest companies in the world. Since moving to Boston, he has asked Siegel, the GE Ventures CEO, to convene dinner salons at the headquarters attended by local and national players. The first one, in October, was on the future of work and was anchored by a presentation from the cofounders of Catalant, a Boston startup that received funding from GE Ventures in 2015. Catalant, which began as a class project at Harvard Business School in 2013, has created an online database of business expertise that helps companies find talent for specific projects. Immelt invited about 15 senior executives from major companies, as well as Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria and Cambridge venture capitalist David Fialkow, whose General Catalyst firm is also an investor in Catalant. Fialkow works with other big-name CEOs but had never met Immelt until that evening. What impressed Fialkow was Immelt’s command of the many GE businesses, while also knowing what his company is good at and what it isn’t. He “does not have any N.I.H. — Not Invented Here. That’s really important,” said Fialkow. “Let’s get the best solutions whether inside or outside GE.” Fialkow, who has been actively finding ways to help Boston keep its young talent, also recognized the moment as a huge opportunity for Catalant and other local startups Immelt may take under his wing. GE Ventures has invested in 10 Boston-area companies since it was founded in 2013. “For the CEO of GE to bring his peers to this dinner,” said Fialkow, “was the greatest business development event you can ever imagine.” Beyond the dinners, GE has hosted other local events to establish itself as a thought leader, including a hack-a-thon to dream up new ways to attack the opioid crisis and a forum to showcase its advanced manufacturing. The company has also become a sponsor of startup accelerator, MassChallenge, formed an alliance with MassRobotics, and swiftly inked partnerships with MIT and Northeastern. Siegel, who has spent most of her career working in Silicon Valley, was wary about coming to GE nearly five years ago and wrestled with whether Immelt was committed to changing the company’s culture. She has no doubts now. He routinely brings in new economy founders, such as Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, to talk at leadership meetings. More surprising is that Immelt carves out time to regularly meet entrepreneurs who aren’t household names. Take Catalant, which only has 130 employees, but the three cofounders have been meeting with Immelt twice a year. “He is wildly innovative, entrepreneurial and willing to try to new things,” said Pat Petitti, the CEO and one of the cofounders of Catalant. “You wouldn’t expect that to be the case.” Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff Patriots Owner Robert Kraft, left, was on hand with Jeff Immelt at a Boston College luncheon in 2016. Massachusetts has stake It’s not just GE shareholders who are anxious to see Jeff Immelt deliver results, but Massachusetts taxpayers. The state’s relocation package is worth as much as $125 million while the city agreed to give GE a $25 million break on property taxes. Critics have lined up, wondering why GE, a company with a stock market value of about $255 billion, needs any taxpayer help. Besides, the company has a reputation for taking advantage of laws to minimize its tax bills. In his public appearances, Immelt is acutely aware of the need to show a return on investment for his new hometown. Upon its arrival, GE pledged $50 million in philanthropy over the next five years to community health centers, Boston public schools, and workforce training throughout the state. But Immelt sets the bar even higher than that. In his mind, Boston can lead the next digital revolution, the same one GE is trying to engineer. It’s as if he is willing us to think bigger. Immelt has seen firsthand what the right company at the right time can do. One of his first jobs at GE in the early ’80s was in the plastics division, which required him to spend time in Silicon Valley. He would call on Steve Jobs and other computer titans to persuade them to buy GE casings for their processors. Immelt saw how anchor companies like Hewlett-Packard became what he has called a “centrifugal force” in transforming that region into the tech powerhouse it is today. GE, he believes, can play that same role for Boston in building the industrial Internet, a world in which software and data analytics govern jet engine performance and MRIs as so smart they will know when to replace a part or how to sift through images. “It’s real, and it’s going to happen,” Immelt told business leaders gathered at a Boston College Chief Executives Club lunch last year. “If Boston isn’t the headquarters of that flow, shame on both of us.” Keith Bedford/Globe Staff Jeff Immelt, right, shared a laugh with Governor Charlie Baker, center and Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh in April 2016. Shirley Leung can be reached at shirley.leung@globe.com. Follow her on Twitter @leung. Loading comments...

Kodi's open-source media center is a perfect way to bring that first generation Apple TV you have stuffed in a cupboard back to life: It's not officially available on the App Store, but it's still a perfectly legal app to install it on your first-generation Apple TV. What is Kodi? A brief explainer from the official Kodi website: Kodi (formerly known as XBMC) is an award-winning free and open source (GPL) software media player and entertainment hub that can be installed on Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS and Android, featuring a 10-foot user interface for use with televisions and remote controls. It allows users to play and view most videos, music, podcasts, and other digital media files from local and network storage media and the internet. Our forums and Wiki are bursting with knowledge and help for the new user right up to the application developer. In the very early days, Kodi — or XBMC as it was first known — was a hack to add true media center functionality to the original Xbox console. As it has evolved, it has turned into one of the most powerful systems available. Kodi itself is perfectly legal: It's a piece of media center software and does not provide nor condone piracy; there are also a number of legal add-ons that can be attached to Kodi, as well as connecting live TV and your own media library. What you need There's not a lot of supplies needed to get this little project rolling. Besides your first-generation Apple TV — 40GB or 160GB, it doesn't matter which — you need a PC or Mac to download the files you need, along with an 8GB or larger USB flash drive. You'll also need an Ethernet cable to hook up your Apple TV to your local network during the install process. If you want to further upgrade your Apple TV, you can even swap out its Wi-Fi card for an HD decoder in its place. (More on that below.) Before you begin: Visit your Apple TV's settings and find the option for RGB High. Make sure this is enabled, otherwise you risk issues with your picture quality — no one wants their screen covered by a pink tint, and if you forget this step, you'll have to restore the original Apple TV operating system and start again. How to download Kodi to the first-generation Apple TV Get your weekly dose of Rene Ritchie on Kodi! For the first generation Apple TV you can go one of two ways with your Kodi install: OpenElec or OSMC. Both are custom builds of Kodi that work great on older or less powerful hardware; they're popular with Raspberry Pi fans. For the purposes of this guide, we'll be using OSMC. It's a great Kodi build with a really nice custom user interface that works great on a TV. You can run it solely from a USB flash drive if you wish, but for this guide, we're installing it directly to the internal HDD. Grab your PC or Mac and your flash drive, then follow these steps: Head over to osmc.tv/download in your browser. Select the installer for the operating system you're currently using. Download the installer and launch once complete. Connect the flash drive to the computer. Select Apple TV from the drop down box. The next stage is to select the build. Choose the latest version from the dropdown box for HDD. The next step will ask you where to install, but it won't let you change the options. So just click next. Select your flash drive location. Accept the license agreement and the install can begin. How to install Kodi to your first-generation Apple TV Plug the USB flash drive into the back of the Apple TV. Boot your Apple TV. After a small delay, you'll see a Linux-style boot screen (OSMC is based on Linux). If everything went to plan, the OSMC installer will begin: Go make a coffee and wait. If you didn't boot into the installer, reboot the Apple TV and try again. How to customize Kodi on your first-generation Apple TV From here on out, Kodi is yours to build out into the media center of your dreams. Kodi itself has no content pre-filled, but you can download any number of legal add-ons; these include well-known names like YouTube and Twitch, along with clients to hook into your own cloud media from sources like OneDrive and Dropbox. You can also plug your Plex server directly into Kodi and your HDHomeRun tuner for live TV. Both services have official add-ons. Best legal add-ons for Kodi What if I need a remote? Good news: You already have an awesome physical remote with your Apple TV, assuming you didn't lose it. The stock Apple white IR remote will work just fine with Kodi, allowing you to navigate the interface and control playback without the need for additional hardware. You can also get additional remotes easily on your iPhone or iPad by downloading one of the Kodi remote apps from the App Store. There are a few to choose from, but I recommend Blue Remote and Armchair Remote, which both Apple Watch companions; Blue Remote is totally free, while Armchair has a paid upgrade to unlock everything. Download Blue Remote from the App Store Download Armchair Remote from the App Store How to restore Wi-Fi to your Apple TV Kodi disables your internal Wi-Fi antenna, but you can get it back if you need with a USB wireless dongle. (Note: If you're running Kodi from a USB stick, you'll need a USB hub to add a wireless dongle.) If you're looking for the right Wi-Fi adapter, the Kodi/OSMC forums are a great help. We also recommend the OSMC Wi-Fi adapter; it's been certified for all OSMC compatible devices, including the first-generation Apple TV. See at OSMC How to add a hardware HD decoder Since you won't be able to use the internal Wi-Fi card with Kodi, if you're feeling brave enough for a hardware project you can swap that card out for a Crystal HD decoder; there are things that old hardware just can't do. It's a pretty inexpensive card and a simple swap — as long as you have a bit of free time and patience for the stubborn screws on the bottom. The OSMC folks have put together an in-depth guide on how to tackle this upgrade: How to install a Crystal HD decoder in your Apple TV Your tips?

She is scheduled to fly back to her southern California base Tuesday, trainer John Sadler said. "She looks good," Sadler said Saturday. "She ate up. Everything looks tip-top." Sadler, who trains Stellar Wind for Hronis Racing, said Stellar Wind likely will make her next start at home, in the Grade 1, $400,000 Beholder Mile on June 3 at Santa Anita. The race is the former Vanity. Editor's Picks Stellar Wind returns strong in Apple Blossom The champion Stellar Wind started her 5-year-old season in stirring fashion on Friday, taking down the Grade 1, $600,000 Apple Blossom Handicap at Oaklawn Park. Stellar Wind on Friday ran a powerful race in the Apple Blossom, stalking the pace from the rail, moving outside of horses, then running down a stubborn pacesetter in multiple Grade 3-winner Terra Promessa. Stellar Wind covered the 1 1/16 miles in a sharp 1:42.75, winning by 1 1/4 lengths in her first start since finishing fourth to Beholder in the Breeders' Cup Distaff in November. "You're always concerned about fitness when you're shipping out of town, and we did a little bit more with her this year because we knew we'd be running on a surface we weren't quite as familiar with, and so she's good and fit. "She'd been training really well and we thought she'd run well. We're just glad everything worked out." Stellar Wind was the champion 3-year-old filly of 2015. Last year she distinguished herself by twice defeating Beholder in Grade 1 races in southern California. Sadler said he is looking forward to the season ahead with Stellar Wind. "We're hoping she can be a little better this year than even last year," Sadler said. "So, she's definitely in the top group in her division. You know, there's Songbird out there and she's coming back, so there's always a lot of really good horses. But she's one of the best ones out there."

Trainer Steve Asmussen said Terra Promessa will head to Churchill Downs on Monday. Plans for her will be determined, he said, after discussions with Stonestreet Stables. Asmussen said he was pleased with the race from Terra Promessa. "Nothing but respect for Stellar Wind and the champion that she is," Asmussen said. "Terra Promessa, I thought it was a new level of effort for her. Very proud of her effort, and she came out of the race in great shape." Streamline, a Grade 2 winner who was third in the Apple Blossom, will be part of a division of horses trainer Brian Williamson said he plans to send to Churchill. Sadler was winning his first Apple Blossom. He had sent out Switch to a runner-up finish to Havre de Grace in 2011.

Earlier this week, Jordan outlined a variety of new features that could potentially be headed towards macOS. Now, we’re curious: What feature would you moist like to see added to macOS at WWDC this summer? Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Apple’s next version of macOS will likely be macOS 10.13 and be released to developers in the summer and to the public later this fall. The update comes following last year’s release of macOS 10.12, which included new features such as Siri support, picture-in-picture support in Safari, moving third-party menu bar icons, and the move to iCloud Drive for Desktop and Documents files. This year, Apple is likely to make a host of changes with macOS 10.13. As Jordan previously explained, there are a quite a few possibilities for new features. For one, Apple will ideally further expand Siri throughout macOS. Most notably, we’d hope for support for “Hey, Siri” which currently a notable feature discrepancy between macOS and iOS. Furthermore, we’d expect any of the new Siri features that come with iOS 11 to also come to macOS 10.13. Moving past Siri, we hope that Apple continues to improve the disaster that is iTunes. This could be via a standalone Apple Music app, or just a better iTunes app. Nevertheless, iTunes improvements are always welcome when it comes to new macOS releases. There’s also the possibility that Apple will bring its TV app to Mac, especially if it is indeed working on a “premium” cable TV package. There’s also the possibility of other new apps for macOS, including Apple News and Podcasts. With Apple recently rebranding iTunes Podcasts to Apple Podcasts, it’s almost seems like the company is planning just that: a standalone Podcasts app for Mac. Last but not least, HomeKit support is currently a major missing feature from macOS. Support for both controlling HomeKit accessories and having a Mac act as a hub is missing and we’re hoping Apple improves upon this with macOS 10.13. What are you most excited to see with macOS 10.13– or whatever it may be called– when it’s released later this year? Let us know in the comments and poll below.

The analysts say Apple has the money to take over Disney, and such a merger would create a company worth $1 trillion with “almost limitless opportunities in content and technology.” Although it's all speculation at this point, analysts say it could happen. “Recently, investors have increased their expectations that Apple could seriously consider acquiring Disney,” analysts Steven Cahall and Leo Kulp wrote in the note. Read: Apple Reportedly Developing Its Own Power Management Chips For Its 2019 iPhone Lineup Apple could repatriate $200 billion from overseas to take over Disney — with the help of tax proposals from the Trump administration. Apple would need a “tax holiday” to repatriate the cash. Acquiring Disney Could Help Apple Acquiring Disney would help Apple back away from its dependence on the iPhone, which makes up most of its revenue. Disney could help Apple compete with streaming companies, such as Netflix and Amazon, and provide worldwide streaming sports rights for ESPN. “Content is a major focus for Apple, target size is not an issue, and Disney offers an avenue to diversify away from hardware without diluting the strong Apple brand,” analysts said. A possible acquisition of Disney could also do well for Apple shareholders, analysts said. Rumors of a possible acquisition started last October when Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was “open to acquisitions of any size” during the company’s 2016 fourth-quarter conference call. Another reason for talk about Disney and Apple is Cook’s interest in television. Apple executives approached Time Warner about a possible merger in 2015, however, talks didn’t go past the preliminary stage.

The largest deal Apple made was for its Beats $3 billion acquisition for in 2014. Speculation from analysts boosted Disney shares, sending them to a 16-month high Thursday while  Apple shares fell.

PHOTO: REUTERS Published10 hours ago More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/4XFJ Copy SAN FRANCISCO • Apple plans to start testing self-driving cars on California roads, the clearest signal yet that the world's most valuable technology company wants to design or build autonomous vehicle technology. On Friday, the California Department of Motor Vehicles granted Apple an official test permit that the agency said would allow the company to test autonomous driving technology in three 2015 Lexus RX 450h luxury hybrid sport utility vehicles (SUVs). The permit authorises six drivers to take control of the vehicles when necessary. Apple has been coy about its self-driving car project, known internally as Project Titan. The iPhone maker has not officially acknowledged the existence of the project, which appeared to be adrift last year. The company laid off dozens of people in the fall and brought in one of its top troubleshooters, Mr Bob Mansfield, to reinvigorate the effort. In October, Mr Timothy Cook, Apple's chief executive, told investors: "We are always looking at new things, and the car space in general is an area that it's clear that there are a lot of technologies that will either become available or will be able to revolutionise the car experience." Mr Neil Cybart, an independent analyst who writes about Apple at the site Above Avalon, said the company appeared to have moved away from plans to build and sell cars in the way that Tesla does. Instead, he said, "they are working on a transportation platform". The self-driving car segment is among the most bitterly contested areas in emerging technology, with Apple joining 29 other companies that have received test permits in California alone. The competition for talent in the sector is intense, with top employees receiving millions of dollars in compensation a year. The ride-hailing company Uber is locked in nasty dispute with Google's former car division, now known as Waymo, over Waymo's accusations that a former company executive stole crucial technology that was later used by Uber. Google, an early developer of the technology, considers self-driving cars to be a potential new market, while Uber hopes to eventually eliminate the need for human drivers to shuttle its customers. And traditional automakers like General Motors and Ford Motor view the self-driving car as a natural extension of their existing businesses. "Every company will have to have some solution for transportation," Mr Cybart said.

Although I listened to my own music a good 80% of the time, I considered the equivalent of one album purchase a month to be decent value to have access to other music when I felt like something new. But while Spotify didn’t much change the way I listened to music, Apple Music really has. Its ‘For You’ recommendations – especially the playlists – are so good that the 20% streaming I used to do has now grown to 50%. As I mentioned in my Apple Music Diary series, the service has introduced me to more new artists I really like than Spotify did in all the years I used it – despite my initial concerns that it wouldn’t do so. But the very effectiveness of Apple Music in introducing me to so much new music has thrown up a couple of problems … NordVPN The first is that I miss having on-demand access to those playlists when I don’t have a data connection. I spent Christmas in Hong Kong, which involved two 11-hour flights. I’m not much of a TV or movie guy, so I listen to a lot of music when travelling. I’d saved a few For You playlists to my iPhone, but of course couldn’t access new ones. I’d love it if Apple Music auto-downloaded the most recent For You playlists whenever I’m on Wi-Fi so that they were available to me when I don’t have access to mobile data. It could work just like subscribed podcasts, where we specify the number of playlists to keep. Apple’s Podcast app, for example, lets us choose between the 2, 3, 5 and 10 most recent. In that way, we have access to them when we need them without taking up lots of storage. And by limiting the downloading to when we’re on Wi-Fi, it wouldn’t use any mobile data. The other issue I really wish Apple would solve once and for all is lyrics. There have been a wide range of third-party solutions for adding lyrics to music on Apple devices, both for iTunes on the Mac and the Music player on the iPhone. MusixMatch, for example, displays lyrics in the Notification Center. But third-party apps suffer from three issues. First, they don’t offer lyrics for every track. It depends on whether Apple includes the data in the track, or whether they can be matched from independent sources. Second, they sometimes have a clunky UI – like having to view the Notification Center rather than staying in the Music app. Third, it’s not unusual for an iTunes update to break a lyrics plugin on the Mac. I’ve had several over the years that worked well for a time but stopped working temporarily or permanently following a new version of iTunes. Apple says that it cares deeply about music, and to me lyrics are fundamental to much of my favorite music. Apple is in the perfect position to solve the problem once and for all: agree with the labels that they provide embedded lyrics, and make lyric display a standard feature in both Music and iTunes. Would either feature be of interest to you? Please let us know by taking our poll. If you have Apple Music feature requests of your own, please share them in the comments.

Ben Lovejoy - 1 year ago Reply Apple has the negotiating clout and cash to offer this. Thanks for the Lyrics Mania suggestion – I’ll check it out. Greg Kaplan (@kaplag) - 1 year ago Reply I miss pandora’s write ups on artists for the now playing screen. There is hardly any information about artists, even if you dig down from the my playing. It was a feature I really liked when I heard a new band and wanted to know more about them. friedmud1 - 1 year ago Reply I’m just now trying Apple Music (been a happy Spotify customer, but decided to try out AM anyway) and the biggest thing that I have a problem with is the lack of auto-downloading. Offline (downloaded) music is important to me because I spend a large part of my commute in the subway, where reception is spotty. On Spotify I can set any playlist to auto-download to my phone. If that playlist is updated/extended with new songs then those songs are automatically downloaded to my phone. This works for the hand curated playlists (of which, Spotify has MANY more than AM) and auto generated playlists (Top 100 Indie, “Discover Weekly” (which is essentially “For You”), etc) I love having an always up to date library of Music synced to my phone. When I travel I don’t Sven think about the music I have downloaded… because at any one I have several hundred good, fresh songs to listen to all without me doing anything. AM is the exact opposite. You can’t even download their curated playlists (the “stations”). For instance, I wanted to load all of the songs currently in the “Dance Workout” station onto my Watch (Watch capability is the main reason I’m even trying AM). I had to manually skip through the station and save each song to an offline playlist of my own making. What a pain! At this point… I’m still sticking with Spotify. The ONLY thing that AM does better is allowing me to load music on my Watch. Everything else is worse. Glen George (@glen_george) - 1 year ago Reply Huh, why are you trying to download a “station”. You know you can’t do that right? U can only download playlists for offline use. Not sure what you are trying to say here because offline playlists work fine the way you described friedmud1 - 1 year ago That’s exactly what I’m saying. Where are the curated playlists that are updated weekly that I can set to download automatically? I understand that the stations can’t be downloaded… but the stations are the closest thing to the “Top 100 Indie” and such playlists that are on Spotify. It’s completely possible that I have simply missed the weekly updated AM playlist section. On Spotify there are literally hundreds that are kept up to date constantly. Where are those on AM? On Spotify I would go to Music->(Pick a Genre) and then have access to dozens of up to date playlists I can set to sync for offline use… all of which are constantly updated. In particular I listen to “Happy Hipster”, “Top 100 Indie” and “Electro Workout”. Where can I find analogs to those on AM? The closest I’ve been able to find is the “Radio” stations… Which, like you said, can’t be saved for offline use. friedmud1 - 1 year ago Ok – I did some more exploring and found some interesting playlists. It’s a little harder to find playlists I’m interested in… but the ones I found look good. I’ll continue to give it a shake. Thanks for rebutting me :-) chrisl84 - 1 year ago Reply I use the lyrics feature in Amazon Prime Music a lot….its quite nice really Martin Jr Powlette - 1 year ago Reply I just want Handoff with Apple Music Ben Lovejoy - 1 year ago Reply Yes, that’s a great idea. Greg Kaplan (@kaplag) - 1 year ago Reply Handoff is an interesting idea for Music and bluetooth headphones. Like you get into the office and just click on handoff and it switches over the headphone connection too. Alain Fleitas (@AlainFleitas) - 1 year ago Reply Great article i totally agree that missing these features is a major set back theres one other feature in addition to these that i miss like crazy from spotify… and its the ability to use one of the best and most touted (By apple) music apps on the app store.. djay / djay pro i find it funny that apple would promote an app so much that its own music application doesn’t support.. with spotify you are able to use their music library to mix your favorite songs and even host parties while being the djay however now that ive made my move to Apple im left in a strange state.. and possibly debating going back to Spotify its sad that theres no developer API for access to Apple Music (to the best of my knowledge anyways) but Beats had one and Spotify definitely has one uniszuurmond - 1 year ago Reply My biggest wish is to stay in a country where For You works, not the poor implementation we got that caused me to cancel my subscription. Especially annoying was the limited genres and matches to the non-commercial, non-local music in my library. So much for curated music… hdort - 1 year ago Reply I’d also like to get the complete credits to a song and/or album, I like to know who plays what, who produced it, who wrote it. triankar - 1 year ago Reply I’d be more interested in the Radio features: – give us the ability to delete stations – give us the ability to mark a song as suitable for a radio station – give us the ability to start a radio station from a given playlist (e.g. relaxed jazz or salsa Cubana) – maaaaybe give us the ability to merge stations, though the “AI” behind this may not be as happy about this suggestion Jamison.IO (@Jamison_IO) - 1 year ago Reply Couldn’t agree more on the playlists and “for you”. I went 2 hours the other day liking every song that came on. Unfortunately, I listen to almost all my music through Sonos and one thing that I could do on Spotify that I can’t do (yet) on Apple Music is add those songs to my Apple Music “my music” and/or playlists while in the Sonos app. I hope that is coming soon., vamseenunna - 1 year ago Reply Apple cares so deeply about music and the experience people have with it, that, it doesn’t have any direct way for me to go back to songs that I personally ‘hearted’. But there’s an entire ‘For You’ section dedicated to stuff Apple thinks I should like. But I’m sure they’ll include ‘Favourites’ as an auto-generated, auto-updated playlist in 2020. eric lake (@lakeaem) - 1 year ago Reply Offline playlists need some definite work with Apple Music – in addition to what youve said here, I really wa.tn to see them add the ability to copy offline tracks to the ipod nano, I dont want to do anything but copy them to the nano from one itunes instance, so they can block the rest. Similarly, I still want the ability top copy local music files from the machine hosting the primary itunes library to the phone. You cant do this now with apple music enabled, you have to download them to the phone over wifi and it will only copy those tracks that are in your icloud library. Robert Haslam (@RobertpHaslam) - 1 day ago Reply Once you add a playlist to your library and set it to download, it will download new songs whenever they are available, or that playlist gets changed. I think you need to have automatic music download turned on in settings. I’ve got it already set with For You and New Music.

(Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette) Molly Duffy The Gazette More stories from Molly Apr 15, 2017 at 3:32 pm | Print View ELDON — Just miles from the simple farm house that inspired Grant Wood’s “American Gothic,” a small school district has outfitted itself with state-of-the-art technology and a forward-thinking curriculum. Visitors to the rural, 800-student Cardinal Community School District don’t expect its high-tech classroom or lounge area, Superintendent Joel Pedersen said. “They oftentimes think it looks like a college classroom or like a Fortune 500 (company’s) room,” Pedersen said. “ ... They’re really shocked when they walk in — how nice and inviting it is and how much technology is infused in our buildings.” The “21st Century Classroom” in the district’s shared middle and high school building has whiteboard walls and desktops for students to scribble on, wheeled desks and chairs they can rearrange and multiple TVs that can display class assignments. The space, paid for with funds from the state’s penny sales tax, is meant to promote student collaboration, administrators said. More and more of those types of spaces — known to educators as “student-centered” classrooms — are being built in Iowa schools. Laura Wood, a 21st Century Learning specialist for the area education agencies that oversee much of southern Iowa, has helped advocate for those spaces. “That is the shift — when teachers and educators talk about ‘the shift,’ it’s that student-centered model,” Wood said. “I think it’s just a matter of time before we move from small pockets of things happening to (having them) scaled and happening all over.” Similar student-centered spaces have popped up in Cedar Rapids, Waukee, Mount Pleasant and Hamburg, she said. “I think if we promote student agency,” Wood said, “then I think you’re going to see more of those open floor plans happening.” While students can collaborate in traditional classrooms, 21st century spaces treat group work as the default, said Cindy Green, Cardinal’s director of curriculum and instruction. “Our focus and our push is to get kids collaborating,” she said, “because when they leave and go out into the workforce, they’re going to need to be cooperating with their peers.” For the Cardinal district, Superintendent Pedersen said he thinks the spaces also have helped turn around falling enrollment trends. Six years ago, more students were leaving the school district than coming in through open enrollment, which allows students to enroll in a district other than their home district. Since then, the trend has flipped — in 2016, open enrollment netted a total of 172 students for the district. “I’d like to think that facilities matter,” Pedersen said. “But our focus is on relationships, and one thing we do is letting our parents know that we do care about their kids, first and foremost, and then we really work on quality instruction.” The fancy facilities have led to more school pride among students, too, and Pedersen said he hopes that feeds into academic performance. “Especially in an area where we’re at about 58 percent free-and-reduced lunch rate,” Pedersen said, referencing an indicator of poverty, “I’m really proud we can give our kids some of the nicest learning spaces in Iowa.” High school student Madison Langford, 15, said she and her classmates enjoy using the redesigned spaces. This winter, they created Christmas tree ornaments using the 21st Century Classroom’s computers and 3D printers. “I think we just like to do different stuff that we wouldn’t get to in a normal classroom setting,” she said. “There’s so many different things to do in there. It’s better than a normal classroom — because in a normal classroom, you’re at a desk.” l Comments: (319) 398-8330; molly.duffy@thegazette.com Molly Duffy / The Gazette Your next K-12 Education articles Small Iowa school district embraces big ...

The DMV updated its list of manufacturers testing self-driving cars on Friday, with Apple becoming the 30th company to be granted permission. Few details have been revealed about Apple’s plans for self-driving cars, according to Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs. But she said Apple could be a “major player” in the autonomous vehicle industry. A spokesperson for Apple did not immediately return ABC News’ request for comment. Household names like Google, Tesla and Ford are also on the California DMV’s list. Volkswagen Group of America was the first company to be granted a permit. Regulations require every manufacturer authorized to test self-driving cars to submit an annual report “summarizing the disengagements of the technology during testing,” according to the DMV. The state of California also requires that a human be behind the wheel of autonomous vehicles during testing. California regulations for the technology became effective in September 2014.

Is Making an Apple Watch for Diabetics (AAPL) Apple Inc. Scores Higher Global Mac Sales Amid Broad PC Declines View All Posts Companies compete hard to be an Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone supplier. Winning a contract to supply iPhone components can be a big deal — after all, AAPL sold more than 210 million finished devices last year alone. But there’s a dark side to being a a link in the iPhone supply chain. Source: Yanki01 via Flickr (Modified) Because Apple boasts the highest profit margins in the business, the company is always squeezing suppliers for lower prices. And if a component is deemed critical to the iPhone’s success, AAPL may take it in-house. In just the past several weeks, three suppliers have learned their iPhone business is at risk, with reports that Apple may move to designing their components itself. The latest to be singled out is Synaptics, Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA), maker of the iPhone’s display driver chip. Companies Go to Great Lengths to be an Apple Supplier There are dozens of primary components that make up an iPhone and hundreds of smaller bits, from screws to camera lenses. With the kind of volume an AAPL order offers, companies are willing to go to great lengths to win a contract to produce iPhone components. For example, last year Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) was reportedly spending $6.82 billion to expand its OLED production capacity by 50% in order to meet the volume AAPL will need for iPhone 8 displays. British chipmaker Imagination Tech. (OTCMKTS:IGNMF) saw its stock increase nearly 1,500% in three and a half years after signing a 2008 deal to design a graphics chip for AAPL’s iPhone. Its business as an Apple supplier now generates more than half of Imagination’s total revenue. Supplying iPhone Components Can be Risky Business Being an Apple supplier is not without risk, and recently it’s become even more so. Some companies implode under AAPL’s demands. GT Advanced Technologies Inc (OTCMKTS:GTATQ) is a classic example of this problem. Tapped to produce sapphire glass for the iPhone, the company signed a $578 million dollar contract with Apple in 2013. Under pressure to rapidly expand its operations and unable to meet Apple’s aggressive demands, GTAT was forced into bankruptcy by 2014.

The US technology giant is considering investing at least several billion dollars to take a stake of more than 20% as part of a plan that would have Toshiba keep a partial holding so the business remains under the US and Japanese control, NHK reported, citing unidentified sources. The idea would be to allay Japanese government concerns about any transfer of sensitive technology to investors it deems a potential risk to national security, the broadcaster said. Apple was not immediately available to comment. Taiwan’s Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, declined to comment. A Toshiba spokesman said he could not comment on specific transactions. Foxconn, which participated in the first round of the chip sale auction, has been considered a national security risk due to its ties with China. The bulk of Apple’s iPhones are made at Foxconn’s extensive manufacturing base there. NHK said Apple wants Foxconn to own a stake of around 30% of Toshiba’s chip business. Global manufacturer An investment by Apple would be its first direct stake in a major global memory chipmaker, as it seeks to secure a stable supply of key components. Samsung Electronics is the biggest maker of flash memory chips, followed by Toshiba, SK Hynix and the US-based Micron Technology. The NHK report comes as Western Digital Corp, Toshiba’s partner and one of the bidders for its chip business, warned this week that the Japanese firm's plans to sell its chip unit violates a joint venture contract. Western Digital wants to be given exclusive negotiating rights.

During the day you sleep in a shared dorm room, and in the evening you wake up and start all over again. That’s the routine that Dejian Zeng experienced when he spent six weeks working at an iPhone factory near Shanghai, China last summer. And it’s similar to what hundreds of thousands of workers in China and other emerging economies experience every day and night as they assemble the gadgets that power the digital economy. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 141.05 -0.75 -0.53% Pegatron Corp 4938 ▼ 88.40 -0.20 -0.23% Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd HNHPF ▼ 6.35 -0.05 -0.78% Unlike many of those workers, Zeng did not need to do the job to earn a living. He’s a grad student at NYU and he worked at the factory, owned by contract manufacturing giant Pegatron, for his summer project.Dejian Zeng spent 6 weeks in the summer of 2016 at a Pegatron facility on the outskirts of Shanghai for his summer project. He told us:  He was paid 3100 yuan ($450) and housing for a month of work, including overtime. He slept in a dorm room with 7 other people. What happens when a factory starts producing an unreleased iPhone. Factory workers usually cannot afford new iPhones.  There's an Apple-promoted app that the factory wants all the workers to download. Why it can get stinky in the factories.  Why he believes iPhone manufacturing will never come to the United States.Like many tech companies, Apple makes nearly all its computers and phones in China, using contract manufacturers like Pegatron. That's become a contentious political issue recently, with President Trump calling for Apple to bring manufacturing  — and the jobs that come with it — back to the United States. At the same time, Apple's overseas manufacturing has long been a target of criticism among some some groups, which point to long hours and low wages.  Leaders in the tech industry say that Apple has shifted its practices to address previous controversies over its factory workers in China. In March, Apple released its most recent annual report looking at its manufacturing operations. To see what the situation was like firsthand, Dejian Zeng went to work undercover in Pegatron's ChangShuo factory last summer, armed with a fellowship from NYU. The factory he worked at was profiled by the BBC in 2014 and Bloomberg in 2016, with the reporting focusing on whether some workers are forced to work overtime shifts.  Apple employees are on the ground at the Pegatron facility every day, an Apple spokesperson told Business Insider. Apple performed 16 audits at the ChangShuo Pegatron factory, finding 99% of workweeks were under 60 hours, with the average workweek for people assembling Apple products clocking in at 43 hours. Wages at Pegatron have increased more than 50% over the last five years, and they are higher than the Shanghai minimum wage, the spokesperson said. Pegatron didn't comment.  Zeng, who plans to work at a Chinese human rights nonprofit when he graduates, believed a strike was imminent at the Pegatron plant when he went to work there. No strike ultimately happened, but Zeng did get a look into the daily lives of factory workers who assemble iPhones. Here's what he told Business Insider about his experience (edited for length and clarity):  © Provided by Business Insider Pegatron Campus BI: So what did you do? I'd love to hear about your day. Dejian   Zeng:  At the beginning I was assigned to the assembly line in the department called FATP, final assembling testing packing. We put the iPhone together. One line might have about a hundred stations, each station does one specific thing. At the beginning I work on iPhone 6S. And then after August we are working on iPhone 7. When I’m working iPhone 6S I do two stations. One station at the beginning I did fastening speaker to housing. What I did is that I put the sticker on the case and I put a screw on it. The [iPhone] housing — we call it the back case — is moving on the assembly line and that's when we pick it up and now we get one screw from the screw feeder and then we put it on the iPhone and then put it back and it goes to next station. BI: You were in charge of one screw?© Provided by Business Insider Pegatron factory dorm It’s like, that's the work. I mean it's simple, but that's the work that you do. Over over over again. For whole days. BI: Did it drive you nuts? The first couple of days you're very concentrated, because you couldn't catch up the speed of the assembly line. You need to be very quick to catch up. So you're very, very focused. It makes you very tired but it keeps your mind on it. You have no time to think about things. I need to get quicker and quicker. And then after a while you get more familiar to it, and that in the end I can even do this screw by closing my eyes. It's is just like that. So after that you get a lot of time that you have nothing to do. That's when people feel very annoyed. Because in the Pegatron factories any kind of electronic devices are not allowed to be inside the factories. It makes you very boring there because you can’t listen to music. Sometimes workers talk with each other, random chats, but sometimes your line manager get very upset by that. They say, “keep your voice low.” BI: So when and where did you wake up every day? I wake up in a dorm shared by eight people. The dorm is not on the factory campus, it’s in a place about 10 minutes drive, and they have shuttle bus for us. At the beginning, I would have work on the night shift. I wake up at 6:00 p.m. or 6:30 p.m. The assembly line starts working at different time. Some coworkers start working at 7:30 p.m., some workers at 8 p.m., some like 8:30 p.m, some at 9:30 p.m. I started at 8:30 p.m, so I take the shuttle bus at 7:00 p.m. and then we start getting to the factory about 7:15 p.m. After roughly two hours you have a 10 minute break. During the break many people sleep. And it's kind of a struggle because this is not a very long time. And if you want a drink of water or if you want to go to the restroom you need to walk out a huge workshop. And then go to the restroom, and then come back in takes about 10 minutes.© Provided by Business Insider "I mean it's simple, but that's the work that you do. Over over over again. For whole days."© Provided by Business Insider Pegatron bathroom BI: So the bathrooms are not around? It becomes a struggle when you're very sleepy but also you need to drink some water. You can only do one thing. It's just go to the restroom or come back and take some sleep. BI: You just came back from a 10 minute break. What do you do now? After another two hours we got a 50 minute break for lunch. Generally there are vegetable, meats, and sometimes it's like buns or noodles and then basically it's like three vegetable, one meat, with rice. That's generally a meal. Sometimes they have apples, pears — some fruits — as additions to the meal. The whole factory eats there. It’s a huge canteen room. If you have finished the meal earlier [than 50 minutes] you can take some sleep also. Sleep is really a thing in the factory. You can see that in the lounge we have a lot of like long sofas but it's not really very comfortable sofa. It's like you can feel the iron. People just sit there and sleep. But you can’t lay down. There are people walking around. If they see you lay down they will swipe the ID and take a record on it. And they put the record in your profile. And then they will publish it to your whole assembly line. So your manager would come and yell at you later. Sometimes if it happens multiple times they deduct money. BI: How much money would they take if they caught you sleeping? It’s not catching you sleeping, it’s catching you laying [down]. There are certain behaviors that you can’t do. The same thing happens if you accidentally bring a phone into the factories. It's not even getting inside. It's like when you're past the metal detectors and it sounds and you pulled out your phone. You’re on the record. Or your lighters. Any metal.© Provided by Business Insider BI: Did you like the food and were you charged for it? Yeah we get charged for it and it depends on what kind of food you choose. There are 5 yuan meals, 8 yuan meals. But that was inside the factories. There are also restaurants inside the campus that people generally go eat [at] after they finish their work. Sometimes, if you're working on day shift, then that was more expensive. That was like up to 20 yuan, something like that. BI: Was the food high quality? I wouldn’t say that. The chicken that I get...I never see the breasts or thigh. The chicken that I get...I never see the breasts or thigh. It's always the neck or certain parts that you can't identify. It's always the neck or certain parts that you can’t identify. So I wouldn’t say that's a very good meal. But it keeps you full and you’re very hungry so it keeps you full anyway. It's reasonable. Not very good, but you have no other choice. BI: Do you talk with people at lunch? If you are eating with your friends sometimes you do. A lot of people just eat by themselves. You go get your meal and then you eat. Because it's like, if you can eat it faster you get more sleep. After the lunch break you work for two hours — two hours and there is another 10 minutes in the middle of it. &amp;lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&amp;gt; BI: And by this point you've worked six hours. After two more hours and about eight hours total working, then it depends on whether you need to do overtime or not. If you don't need to, you're off. Everybody is off. But generally if you need to do overtime, it depends on if it's Monday to Thursday or it's Friday. Friday only work two hours overtime, Monday to Thursday is 2.5 hours overtime work. And then you do one whole day, 8 hours, on Saturday also. So total, the time workers spent in the factory is 12 hours total, generally including the breaking times and lunchtime. Does that also include you waiting in line to go through a metal detector and that kind of stuff? Doesn't include. If you included those or you should include 30 minutes more. BI: All right. So you're done. It's 7:30 in the morning. What do you do? I would generally go have another meal afterwards. Then you take the shuttle bus, go back to your dorm, take a shower, if you're lucky if there is hot water. Sometimes there's no hot water or there's no water at all. After a shower...people either go to Internet cafe, play video games, watch videos something like that or you lay down watch videos on your phone. BI: Pretty much everyone has a phone? You have a phone. The dorms provide Wi-Fi. But to access the Wi-Fi you need to do something. You need to either download some apps for them. Or click something, commons, or something, to earn some virtual coins. You use the coins to get on the Wi-Fi. 24 hours is 20 coins. And then, downloading apps sometimes are into like 20 to 30 coins or something. So is it you can buy coins like I remember it's like 100 coins about five yuan. Something like that. But a lot of people just keep downloading, it's like a business. You need to need to do that to get access to Wi-Fi. In that same platform that you earn coins. There are free videos still available. So I think there's something good that workers can watch video for free. I would like to go to bed about 10. You don't have a lot of time, you get very tired. And then most you can watch one movie and then you really need to go to bed. And then the other day you wake up at 6:30. Again. And that's just a routine. BI: Did you have any friends? I made friends with my roommates and also my coworkers on the same assembly line. But it's like the station around me. So we're sitting together. So those are very good friends. And I also make some friends at the first couple of days when we do some training. But during the training you are together, later you get distributed. BI: Your dorm roommates aren't going to be the same people. No, we don't work on the same assembly or nearby and sometimes we work on different shifts. So sometimes I never see my roommates for a month because we are on a different shift, and they shift it every month. BI: Do you know anyone there with a family? Yeah they are with their girlfriends or their wives. Sometimes they rent an apartment outside the campus. You can choose to do that but it's very pricey. But if you have to, that's the only way. There are no dorm rooms there for a couple. BI: So when you were on the assembly line with you with your mates what did you talk about. That's where I find that the stereotypes about workers is not right. I had thought they [would be] uneducated. Wrong. They are talking about a lot of things. They talk about, China-U.S. relationship, foreign relations in South China Sea, because at that point there is news on that. Most talk about movies, horror movies and then sometimes they talk about their lives. They need to support their families back in the rural area. They want to send their kids to do some dancing classes. So it's like being a parent kind of thing. And sometimes entertainment news, celebrities, all the things that young people talk about. And they know other things, they even talk about American history sometimes. BI: Did your coworkers like their jobs? So I would say we don't we don't like it and we don't hate it. We just consider it a job that can give us money. Nobody enjoys the process because the purpose of getting to work is waiting to get out. The only thing that we're thinking about is really money, money, money. I need to get some money from my family, I need to support my life, support my kids. That's the only thing in their mind, sometimes they don't even care how tired they are. Some workers have worked at different factories and think Pegatron has stricter management --- you can't use your phone in their factory, you can't listen to music. Sometimes there are people walking around that don't allow you talk too loud. So some workers have comparison and think Pegatron has stricter controls. That's something that gets them annoyed. BI: Is it a respected job? Is it a job that people go ‘Oh, that's a decent way to earn a living’? I don't think so. People working the factories are also working on becoming a security guard, delivery man, housekeeper. So it's the same kind of level of position. You don't see it as better. I think the only way to look at the factory job is that you really keep people from being homeless. Because you need no skills, you just get into the factories. They don't even ask you any questions. During the interview, you can just get in that day. And then they take care of your meals and your dorm. So it's like, if you really have nowhere to go. If you're in the city alone and have no relatives to support you. Go to the factory. You might earn some money, a little bit, and then gradually you can get your life together. BI: Did anyone see it as a career? I don't think people really see it as a career. The turnover rate is very high. It's very normal for workers to leave after two weeks or a month. Some workers get there and if they don't like it, they quit very quick. But some people can stick there longer. And after one year you can get promoted to become the line manager. There are different structures. At the lowest level, you're an operator, and then you get into the multitask worker [position]. The third level is group leader and then it's line manager. Then above is section manager and then there's the division manager and then there is the factory director. There are workers that can really move up this chain. But we think that at most you can become a line manager. But there are people who could get promoted by that chain, but not a lot of people can sustain that kind of life for that long time. And then the pattern of Chinese migrant workers is that they go out to the city and do jobs for a year and then they quit then they go back home to stay one month for a new year or something like that and then go out or find another job. BI: Did your coworkers use Apple products? Some workers have iPhones. But not very many because of the monthly wage. If they are affordable for workers, then they will buy Apple. But they are saying “I really want that?” Can they save two month’s wages to get an iPhone? They won't do that. The phones they generally use are Chinese productions like Oppo or something like that. BI: Do the people working there at Pegatron know they’re assembling Apple products? They know. We all know that we are assembling Apple products. We even know “this is the iPhone 6” or “this is the iPhone 7 that’s coming out.” Everybody knows. BI: So what did you know when production switched from the iPhone 6 to the iPhone 7. Did people know that this was an unreleased product? Was there additional security around it? The controls gets more strict. They increased the sensitivity of the metal detectors. So you know some girls they have bras? And so they couldn’t pass the door because they had the metal in the bra. And so a lot of the girls had to change all of the sudden that day because they increased the sensitivity. And then you passed two security checks. There's a lot of security checks. Here’s how it works. Our factory, when we got to working they are already assembling the infrastructure of the assembly line. They have this curtain circling it it so you can't even see how the infrastructure is, right? We were working at the same workshop. But there are people doing construction there. And then after they've finished construction and need to move people in, we were moved out and working in another building of the factories. And then they prepare everything and everybody moved back in. And then, producing iPhone 7 at that point it was a trial production. That kind of experience is totally different from when we produced iPhone 6S. Because that’s a whole day, and I consider it as torture. Because one day for 12 hours you only produce five phones. You sit there and have nothing to do, waiting for two hours. Sometimes they don't allow you to speak. You just sit there quietly and have nothing to do and wait until the next phone comes in. You're trying to assemble it, and then you put it back and you wait for another few hours for the next one to come in. When we were producing the iPhone 7, they have Apple staff there every single day to monitor the process because it’s a new product they want to see if there are new problems. The management of the factory becomes very, very careful. It needs to be very, very clean. All the case holders need to be in the exact position of where they should be. The process changed a lot because it used to be just an assembly line. They made it a clean room, like they want to keep the dust out. So every time you get in you need to have a roller to clean all the dust, and then you get it and all of these procedures, you need to do that. Management is very careful, constantly walking around. You’re not allowed to talk or sleep. When you don’t talk, and are just sitting there for a couple of hours, you get sleepy. I was falling asleep three times one day, and every time when the multitask workers, the assistants of the line manager, would walk out and would spot me sleeping, they would say “no no no” and wake me up. The third time he caught me sleeping, he said “you, stand up.” And so I was standing next to the assembly line, not even allowed to sit. BI: Were you doing the same screw for the iPhone 7? No. At the later part of producing the iPhone 6S I was switched to another station called camera cowling. So they have a protector on top of the camera, and I need to have the cowling fastened. It also was putting in two screws so the camera would be where it is.   BI: Cowling. That is a word I’ve never heard before! There’s a lot of terms, there’s a lot of terms. BI: Do the factory workers — they obviously work for Pegatron — but do they think they work for Apple at some level? They definitely know they are producing Apple products, and consider themselves a part of that process. © Provided by Business Insider BI: How did you know that there was Apple staff?  They tell you. They say "the client is here." They call Apple "the client." Sometimes Apple staff come to do an audit or something like that, they walk around the assembly line. They say “the client is here.” They call Apple the “client.” Sometimes Apple staff come to do an audit or something like that, they walk around the assembly line. They were always very serious about it, and we would be told "the client is here."    BI: Do people who work for Foxconn, Pegatron know the Apple story? Here in the United States, Apple is seen as one of the important companies, something that drives us. You know there's this whole legend about Steve Jobs and its current CEO Tim Cook. Are they aware of that?  I don't think they understand Apple that much. I think the general concept is they know that Apple sells a lot of iPhones, that a lot of people consider it as something fancy. I think that's their understanding. It depends on the worker. Some workers I know are real tech fans. There’s one worker who sat next to me, he was 18. He had just gotten out of high school and was trying to get into college after his summer job. He was a big fan of Apple, so he could talk a lot about Apple. BI: And did he think it was so cool that he was working on an iPhone that hadn’t come out? Yeah, people sometimes considered it as a very cool thing. Typically when they they were working on an iPhone 7 and know it's not yet out. BI: Overtime pay seems to be the big issue. It’s the one China Labor Watch [an activist labor group that worked with Zeng] pushes — they had all these paystubs, and it seems to be, you know, a quality of life issue. But it's also hard to explain. Apple has really been following the rules. They do pay 1.5 times pay when overtime is during your workday, and they double it when it’s on Saturday. All the payments are legit. I would say they're following the policy.   [Editor's note: Apple told Business Insider that Pegatron had 99% compliance with workers working under a 60 hour workweek, and Pegatron workers who make Apple products work for 43 hours per week on average.] But the overtime thing, from my experience, it’s involuntary. You can’t leave easily. And then every time you ask “can I leave” they would just say “you have to work on the assembly line.” And so you know that every station needs to have somebody doing it. And if you leave, who is going to do it?   It’s not easy to ask to not do overtime. It’s involuntary. I would say that’s the issue. Workers don’t have a choice. If I don’t want to work, if I’m really tired today and I don’t want to work, I can’t do that. I think that’s the issue. The overtime thing is also complicated because sometimes you hear about a worker who demands that “I want to work overtime. I want that money.” But they are being pushed to that path because the base salary is just too low. I can’t make a living without doing overtime, that’s why I “volunteer,” quote unquote, to do that. The factories know it also. The workers too. They know that when you get into the factory, you need to do overtime to get your payment. BI: So when you say overtime, does that mean over 60 hours a week? Over 8 hours a day, that was overtime. Another thing is that when I was there, most of the time, it wasn’t a busy season. A lot of the time shifts over 60 hours [a week] are when it’s a busy season. After I left factories they started a massive production of iPhone 7. And I still have a connection with workers there. They said that they start working on Sunday. And one worker who I talked to said he had been working for 11 days straight.  BI: 11 days in a row? Yeah, consistently for 11 days. It’s obviously over 60 hours when you start working on Sunday also. So I think they have [a] different standard during busy season and not busy season. I don’t know how the factory gets past the system where workers need to record their working time. Because when you go to work, you swipe your card. And my friend said they do swipe their cards when they work on Sunday. And I think it’s an obvious violation of Apple policy. I don’t know how the factory gets past that. [Editor's note: Apple told Business Insider that it conducted 34 audits covering Pegatron workers, including 29 at facilities in China, including 16 at the ChangShou factory. Apple found 99% compliance with a 60-hour workweek.] BI: Did you notice any negative effects from people working too many hours besides just sleep. I don’t think you give workers enough time to do other stuff. The time left in your life is very, very limited. It’s just a couple of hours. And then there's not much you can do. I consider that a problem. In the new report they said a lot of workers get opportunities for training in some programs, they can develop their careers and stuff like that. But when you are working 12 hours, you are exhausted. And the only thing you want is some rest, and there’s not enough time for that.  BI: What if someone wanted to take a vacation? My friend said that when it’s busy season you can’t take it. They just don’t allow it. And even if it’s not a busy season, when you request it they will ask “so what are you doing?”  But when it’s not very busy, they sometimes grant it. I would say that the attitude is not very good. It’s always like you are trying to make trouble for them, whether you’re asking for overtime or to not work overtime or are asking for leave. They will have a very bad attitude towards you.  BI: Who was your boss?  In the assembly line, the power structure is very clear. The person you receive direction from the most is your group leader. They give you demands. They are the ones who hold meetings after work to summarize today’s performance. They are the ones who keep pushing you, saying “we have 500 pieces left, keep working!” The person you receive direction from the most is your group leader. They give you demands. They are the ones who hold meetings after work to summarize today’s performance. They are the ones who keep pushing you, saying “we have 500 pieces left, keep working!” The capacity of the whole campus, I think, is 100,000 [workers]. When I was there there were about 70,000 workers. In Pegatron they are building new buildings. They are expanding.  BI: Why don't Pegatron workers unionize? I understand obviously China has a different union system than the United States. There are a couple of reasons. As I mentioned, the only thing the worker thinks about is money. If unions can bring them money, they might want it. That’s why in 2010 there’s a big case in the Hainan auto factories. And then they had a big movement and requested “we need to have a union, we need to have our own elections” and stuff like that. But, in that movement, you see that once workers get their money back, when they got their wages increased, they didn’t care about the union thing. “As long as I get my money back. I don't, I don't care.” And the workers couldn’t strike for 7 days. These people need the money every single day. They can’t afford to do a strike by themselves. Another thing is that I see there's no structure for being on strike or unionized. There's no leader. You need leadership for those people who go to the factories. They're just very, very ordinary people. You go to work and then you work 12 hours and then you get out. If there’s nobody saying “we need to do this stuff” then they just keep working. Another point to point out is that the turnover rate is just so high. People react to disappointment by walking out. "I just leave the factory. I hate this place. I just go. There's other factories and other jobs. I just go."  So the high turnover rate plays a role. It’s very hard for people to have that kind of unity. It’s like “I’ve worked with these people for a month, this guy is leaving tomorrow, and this guy arrived yesterday.”  BI: Are there any open secrets at Pegatron? So we know that there are some stations on the assembly line where we know the jobs are easier than on other stations. There are some stations that you just need to put a sticker on.  There are some positions, for example doing a trash recycling, you don't have nothing to do. You just sit around for a while there until there's some trash to pick up and classify.  And so there are some stations that are easy and those stations go to people the managers like. Sometimes they’re girls. Most of the cases they go to girls and that men is always doing the screwing. Yeah it's always the screwing. BI: Is there anything that Pegatron knows is like a bright red line. Like underage workers? I think they care about underage workers. I can see that they're doing stuff trying to control it.  They are very careful about safety training. That’s part of training they do well, but that's just about safety. They only do two days of trainings and the focus is on safety.  "We know that there are some stations on the assembly line where we know the jobs are easier than on other stations."  © Provided by Business Insider BI: What’s the mobile platform called? I only remember the Chinese one. It’s called 掌知识 (Zhang Zhishi). It’s an online platform where Apple uploads a lot of security trainings, sometimes about careers. BI: And it’s uploaded by Apple? I think they said that they developed this platform with Apple. Workers can log in to learn about the material. They scare you. The first day they said “OK everybody gets this QR code. Scan it on your phone and download this app. And if you don’t download this app you won’t get distributed to the assembly line tomorrow." So everybody downloaded it, and sometimes when you’re working on the assembly line the manager would say “has everybody downloaded this? Remember you need to download this.” After that second training, we got our clothes. Our hats. Our slippers. They're pink. And the hat is blue. The pants are blue and then the slipper is dark. BI: And you only get one of those? I only got one of those, so on the weekend you need to wash it. And sometimes people don’t wash it for a whole week. You get sweaty, you get very stinky. Some peers get very stinky. But you only get one set, that’s the thing. I only got one of those, so on the weekend you need to wash it. And sometimes people don’t wash it for a whole week. You get sweaty, you get very stinky. Some peers get very stinky. But you only get one set, that’s the thing. And you need to have the full set when you get into the factory. They’re very, very strict about it.   Here’s one detail I remember: when the subfactory’s leader comes, they say “Listen, are you pregnant? Raise your hand.” And then nobody did. And then he said “if you think you are going to be too tired standing up, you can come up to me now.”  And he said “if you are a student worker, if you are going to work here less than three months, please stand up.” And then nobody stood up. The reason he did it is that if somebody stood up, they lost their job.  BI: Oh wow. We also needed to get injections. We had to get vaccinated. But before we got vaccinated they asked “if you have any serious diseases or if you have something going on with your immune system,” which was intended for HIV patients, “please stand up.” And he asked a few questions before we got the injections. I saw it as a violation of privacy, because we were in a big room with more than 100 people. The fourth day we came back and did more trainings. Those trainings are more about Apple’s standards. They said “here are a few things that our client cares about,” including involuntary overtime, and child workers. They listed the four or five core violations that Apple cares about. There’s all kinds of different trainings. Even about building personal relationships and how to manage your money. All kinds of things. But I could see that the training was required by Apple. Because after that training we had to do a written test, and the answers were all from the trainings.  We did a couple of tests because there are different trainings that are supposed to be done over several days. But we did them all at once and then took the exams. There’s one exam that was very difficult. The first question was about translating terms from Chinese to English. And I didn’t even understand some of the English. BI: Your English is fantastic though. For the very hard test, they give you the answers and just said to write down what they told you. After all the tests, we have an evaluation on the training. They gave us an evaluation: “How did you feel about the training?” They are very careful with that piece of paper. They said “Don’t make any mistakes. We need this paper to be very clean with no modifications on it.” It was a scale where 1 was the worst and 5 was the best. They said we could do 4 or 5. And so everybody did 4 and 5 and they submitted it.  Another thing to mention is the bonded labor. I still say that there are contractors of the suppliers who are holding workers IDs. In Pegatron the workers come in different ways. Some workers are directly recruited. Some are referred by a subcontractor — Pegatron has a relationship with them. When they refer people, if those people can work in Pegatron over 20 days, Pegatron pays a certain amount of money for that referral. So it’s a huge business. All the stores nearby [the factories] are referral companies.   I know all of the workers, some of my close friends are my roommates. I come from that kind of channel.   They were recruited by the subcontractor. You need to give your ID to them. And then if you are able to stay in the factory over 20 days, you get 800 yuan or something. It's a huge amount for them [the workers] but it's the one-time payment.  So they get extra money by going that [referral] channel. It's a very complicated issue there. BI: But people do have their I.D. held by the agents, by the subcontractors. Do you think they're spotting all violations? Pegatron has a survey system that accepts complaints from workers directly. That is a good system but it has not been implemented in Pegatron factories, at least factories I worked at. They have a complaint system, but who is handling those complaints? A factory worker. So you are submitting complaints of the factory to the factory staff. I submitted my complaint saying that I had been forced to do overtime. I don't want to do that but my manager didn't allow me to leave earlier.  And they don't want me to file a complaint here. So I don't see the system there is working. But I would say that if Apple does have [a] system that is directly reporting to Apple, that might be better, like what they have in Foxconn. It's a very concrete recommendation to Apple. [Editor's note: Apple told Business Insider that it has employees on the ground at Pegatron every day, to support its own operations in addition to monitoring whether the factory is complying with Apple's standards.] © Provided by Business Insider BI: Tell me about your first day at Pegatron. You show up in front of the factories and see a lot of people waiting in line with their luggage. There’s two members of the staff sitting at a table with their computer. You just walk up to them and they ask you for your ID, they swipe it and record it in their computer, and then later on they ask for your hand. They look at your hands to see whether they are intact, and then they ask you to recite the English alphabet. BI: Why? Because you use English letters on the assembly line. For example, my station was called E26. Sometimes they need to use English letters. BI: Do most Chinese people know the English alphabet?  Some of them do. And if they really want to get this job they will ask their peers to teach them. It’s just 26 letters. Sometimes people get it wrong, but it’s just a procedure. Even if you can barely finish it they still let you in.  After, people take your fingerprints. And then you need to do a physical examination. You pay 70 Yuan for the physical examination. BI: You have to pay? What if you show up without money? You borrow money from other people. They're looking for tattoos, blood, and other things. If your blood tests positive for HIV, or you’re pregnant, I don’t think you’re allowed.  For pregnant people I’m sure you’re not allowed. For HIV I’m not sure. The doctor was very explicit, even before we paid. They said “Listen, if you are pregnant or if you have a tattoo over 10cm you’re not allowed to get in the factory, so don’t bother to do the physical examination.”  The next day there’s a lot of paperwork, for your bank account and stuff. And then we also need to do facial recognition. Because when you get inside the factories, they do facial recognition in addition to swiping your card. You record that information and they prepare your ID card for you. On the third day you start getting paid. After you sign the contracts they start training you. BI: So what are the main safety things?  They let you know that if you are injured you are able to go to the hospital and get reimbursed. So that was good. And they consider a lot of things to be “occupational injuries.” For example, if you spill hot water when you are getting water from the fountain and then you get burned, they pay for it. If you break your leg when you are working downstairs inside the factories they pay for it. And that's a good thing.  After the safety training, there was another training about your salary. It was about overtime, about social security, and about the mobile, the union WeChat platform. So they covered all those things, but the speaker goes very, very quickly. I mean, I can tell he wasn’t even in the mood to do it. I paid 100% attention trying to take notes, but I couldn’t. It was too fast. The whole slideshow was finished in 20 minutes or something. BI: And that was about your money. It’s about my money! It’s very important, it’s about how I get paid. I learned about my overtime pay later on, on the mobile platform that had the slides on it.  © Provided by Business Insider BI: How much did you make for your six weeks there at Pegatron?  I stayed there for one and a half months, or six weeks. So one day they pay you monthly. And then so I get the first month is about 3100 yuan. So that's about $450. BI: Not enough to buy an iPhone. Definitely not. And that is for a month’s production. And then I get that half month is like 1500 yuan.   BI: And do you think that was in line with your coworkers there? Yeah people are pretty much getting the same rate. But the number I’m giving to you is the base salary plus the overtime payment.  [Editor's note: Apple told Business Insider that the base wage at Pegatron has increased more than 50% in the last five years and is higher than the Shanghai minimum wage.]  The base salary is very low. The pay salary is 2320 yuan, which is set by Shanghai city government. So that is just meeting the minimum wage. And then the over time, the payment is added on that.  That minimum wage is the same for everyone around the city. They always meet the minimum wage required by law. BI: Here in the United States, we have President Trump now, and one of his big themes is bringing manufacturing back to the United States. From the labor perspective I don't think it's very realistic for bringing labor intensive manufacturers into the U.S. Why I'm saying that? Just think about wages. Chinese people are getting 2320 yuan which is about $400 per month.  How much are you going to pay for the U.S. workers in terms of base salary? If it really happened, if factories actually really moved to the U.S., I won't see it create lot of jobs. I would see workers getting replaced by a lot of machines, because a lot of the work I see in the factory can actually be done by machine. If it really happened, if factories actually really moved to the U.S., I won't see it create lot of jobs. I would see workers getting replaced by a lot of machines, because a lot of the work I see in the factory can actually be done by machine. The only reason why we do it is because the labor is even cheaper than the machine. BI: What would you recommend for an American, a European, a customer who is worried about these human issues, how can they create change?  This is a very tricky issue because I personally think boycott, or stop the customers who are buying Apple products. It's very hard to mobilize that much people to stop buying Apple. Talk more about it. You do more posting [to] your social media and be aware that every day when you use your iPhone, just think that there are a lot of people working day and night to produce this kind of piece, [holds up his iPhone SE] right now you're using.

Video Transcript Doors open to the New York International Auto Show Friday and in the Big Apple - that means luxury models are on full display. Including two new Porsche's that have enough style to make the ordinary man feel like the next James Bond. Ford's upscale Lincoln nameplate turning the Navigator Raptor - a concept of a few years ago into a real-life luxury mega-SUV. Another in the bigger is better category: The Infiniti QX80, which is ditching shiny paint in favor of a matte look. The hottest selling category right now? - compact suvs, where Hyundai is looking to get a piece of the action through the Genesis luxury brand. But it's not-yet ready to hit the road. What is ready? Mercedes-Benz and the GLC63. Mercedes hoping to regain lost ground in the premium side of the market, which is clearly much more crowded than it used to be. I'm Conway Gittens in New York. Behind all this shiny chrome is more concern than there was at the auto show in Detroit only a few months ago. That's because U.S. auto sales have started to stall after a record sales boom.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Armed man at Apple Valley Wells Fargo alarms customers; arrested on weapons charges Thursday Apr 13, 2017 at 3:17 PM Apr 13, 2017 at 5:10 PM Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker APPLE VALLEY — Authorities arrested a man after he was seen with a loaded gun at a local bank Thursday, prompting concerns that he may have been an armed robber. Steve Tinker, 60, of Hesperia, was arrested following the incident, which occurred at the Wells Fargo bank near Apple Valley and Bear Valley roads on Thursday afternoon. Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station spokeswoman Trish Hill said Tinker was seen getting out of his vehicle with a gun in the bank’s parking lot by another customer. Afraid that Tinker may have been planning to rob the bank, the customer reported the incident to bank officials, who then contacted authorities. While Tinker didn’t have the firearm when he went inside the bank, Hill said “a loaded .22-small-caliber concealed derringer-style gun” and a crossman-style black BB gun were found inside his vehicle. “The BB gun didn’t have the orange tip, so a layperson looking at it would think it was an actual gun,” Hill said. Tinker was arrested on suspicion of carrying a loaded firearm in a public place and carrying a concealed weapon. No further booking information is yet available. The incident remains under investigation by the Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station. Paola Baker may be reached at 760-955-5332 or PBaker@VVDailyPress.com. Follow her on Twitter at @DP_PaolaBaker.

Twitter Facebook Apple said to be targeting a stake in Toshiba's memory chip business The deal faces potential opposition from the Japanese government Martyn Williams (IDG News Service) 14 April, 2017 13:53 - - - - print email Comments Apple is the latest company to be linked with a possible bid for an investment in Toshiba's sizable computer memory business, which is up for sale. The iPhone-maker is prepared to make a direct investment of several billion dollars in Toshiba Memory for a stake of "several tens" of percent, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported in its lunchtime news.Â The report said Apple is also considering a joint bid with Foxconn Technology, which manufactures the iPhone. Toshiba is a major supplier of components for the iPhone. Apple could not immediately be reached for comment. The memory chip business is one of the Toshiba's jewels, butÂ is up for sale as part of Toshiba's attempts to dig itself out of a multi-billion dollar hole caused by the collapse of Westinghouse. Cost overruns and delays on projects in South Carolina and Georgia incurred billions of dollars in losses. Earlier this week, Toshiba finally released its first financial report in nine months, reporting a US$5.9 billion dollar loss due to the problems at nuclear power business Westinghouse. The memory chip business reported a profit of $934 million on sales of $5.8 billion. The release came without the blessing of auditors -- a highly unusual move for a Japanese company -- and with a warning that the entire company could collapse. AnyÂ acquisition of the memory chip business faces hurdles. The business is run as a joint venture with Western Digital under a deal that is said to give the U.S. company exclusive negotiating rights over any acquisition of Toshiba's stake. Also, Japan is hesitant to allow a foreign company to acquire the business, because it doesn't want key Japanese semiconductor technology to fall into foreign ownership. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

"I came offstage and ... was like, 'This is my life forever! I can do this forever now!' " Zamata is now an SNL cast member, and before that, did improv with the Upright Citizen's Brigade. She has her own stand-up special, Pizza Mind, which is available on NBC's comedy streaming site Seeso. She also appears in the film Deidra & Laney Rob a Train, which just premiered on Netflix, and the film Sleight, which will be released later in April. Looking back, Zamata says her path from beginner to working comic happened in the best possible way: "I just followed the fun. I just followed the things I was really interested in, and it turned out to be what I needed to do." Interview Highlights On pursing comedy as a career The Upright Citizens Brigade Theater has a touring company and they go to colleges and a group came to my college at UVA [University of Virginia] and there was a talk back ... and someone asked how you get a career in comedy, and Bobby Moynihan, who happened to be in the group said, "Move to New York, go to UCB, and work really hard." So I did that. When I moved to New York I didn't know how much improv and comedy would play into my life. I thought I was going to do theater and Broadway and stuff. But I kept going to see UCB shows and was such a fan I was like, "I should really just try this." [I] dove in hard, starting taking classes back-to-back, started taking sketch classes, and started doing stand-up all at the same time, and then eventually I was like, "Oh this is all I want to do." ... Eventually my mangers and agents saw me perform and signed me and then I started getting money for it and ... it turned into my career. On getting hired after a public controversy about how few black women have been on SNL It was mostly odd because it was so public. ... I had been auditioning for the show for a couple years before this point and then they asked for a rushed showcase of black women in LA and in New York, and I was in the New York one, and then they chose people from those pools and then I found out after the holiday break. This was all in December and yeah, it was very stressful. I didn't love that it was so public. On a coworker at SNL mixing her up with former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams As soon as that person realizes that they have made a mistake that may be construed as ignorant or even racist, the conversation gets so awkward, and they may be a nice person, they may even be my friend, so there's like a little part of me that's like, "No, no, no, no, it's OK, I don't want you to feel bad." ... Like trying to coddle a scared kitten ... But then it's like, no, I don't have to do that. You should learn. You should just learn from your mistakes. You should feel that emotion. And it feels awkward, and then don't do it again and actually be conscious of what you're saying next time. I really am over trying to make sure other people are comfortable in this conversation when they're making me uncomfortable. It's not my fault. Radio producers Lauren Krenzel and Heidi Saman and web producers Bridget Bentz, Molly Seavy-Nesper and Beth Novey contributed to this story. Copyright 2017 Fresh Air. To see more, visit Fresh Air. TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Our next guest, Sasheer Zamata, has been a cast member on "Saturday Night Live" since 2014. Now viewers have a chance to see her own comedy act on a new stand-up special called "Pizza Mind," which is on NBC's comedy streaming site, Seeso. She also appears in the film "Deidra And Laney Rob a Train," which just premiered on Netflix, and the film "Sleight," which will be released later this month. Zamata has a background in improv and performed with the Upright Citizens Brigade in New York City, where many comics have gotten their start. Listeners of "This American Life" might also know Zamata from her appearances on that show. FRESH AIR producer Ann Marie Baldonado spoke with Sasheer Zamata. They started with an excerpt from her stand-up special in which she's telling the story behind her first name. (SOUNDBITE OF COMEDY SPECIAL, "PIZZA MIND") SASHEER ZAMATA: My name's not actually from any island or African culture. It's from "Star Trek." (LAUGHTER) ZAMATA: My parents are Trekkies. (CHEERING) ZAMATA: Technically Trekkers. That's what the fans were called when the show first came out. And they were watching an episode together, season 2, episode 50. And... (LAUGHTER) ZAMATA: ...Captain Kirk was flirting with this alien princess, as he does. And he gave her a rose. And she goes, oh, we have something like this on my planet except it's made out of crystal and it's called Sasheer. And my parents were like yes... (LAUGHTER) ZAMATA: ...That'll be our daughter. And they gave each other a Vulcan high-five and called it a night. (LAUGHTER) ANN MARIE BALDONADO, BYLINE: That's from the stand-up special "Pizza Mind." Sasheer Zamata, welcome to FRESH AIR. ZAMATA: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. BALDONADO: You started in comedy doing improv, you even did it in college. But when you moved to New York, you did improv, you did sketch and you started doing stand-up. What made you want to start doing stand-up comedy? ZAMATA: People in my improv classes were talking about trying stand-up. And the way they described it, they were all scared. They thought it was a big endeavor. And I like doing scary things, so I was like, well, I'll give it a try. And I did, I went to a open mic by myself, didn't tell anybody, wrote some jokes. And I didn't do awful, so I remember, like, going on stage during my five minutes. And then I came off stage and, like, sat next to another woman. And she's like great job. And I was like thanks, that was my first time. She was like, well, I couldn't even tell. And I was like, this is my life forever (laughter). I can do this forever now. I just wanted to keep going and get better and learn how to tackle this thing that was new to me. BALDONADO: Your stand-up special, "Pizza Mind," deals a lot with issues like racism and sexism. And I want to play another scene from "Pizza Mind" about an interaction you had with someone else who works on "SNL" who mistakes you for another African-American female comedian. Let's take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF COMEDY SPECIAL, "PIZZA MIND") ZAMATA: People also have a hard time telling black actresses apart. I was talking to somebody who works at "SNL" who's seen my face for years. And he asked me, didn't you work at "The Daily Show" before you worked here? He was talking about Jessica Williams. Exactly, yeah. OK, she's not here. (LAUGHTER) ZAMATA: No, she's great. Yeah, she was a "Daily Show" correspondent. She is my friend and not me. She's not me. (LAUGHTER) ZAMATA: But I wanted to help this guy out. I was like, oh, well, I was in a Apple commercial, maybe an Apple commercial aired during an episode of "The Daily Show" and you got confused? Which would have made him an idiot if that's what he thought but I was still reaching. And he just looks at me and goes no, I don't think that's it, and walks away not knowing his mistake. And I got so mad at myself. I was like why am I doing this? Why am I hemming and hawing trying to make the situation less awkward for the person who made it awkward? It's not my fault that he can't tell the difference between black women, that's on him. So I'm dead. I'm not doing that anymore. (APPLAUSE) BALDONADO: That's from the stand-up special "Pizza Mind." I'm not sure if this exact thing happened but I'm sure variations of this happen all the time. Did that really happen with a "SNL" co-worker? ZAMATA: Oh, that's a real conversation, yeah. I don't want to call out the person who said that but yeah, it was surprising 'cause it was like, really? You see my face all the time here (laughter) and you thought that I worked at "The Daily Show"? I mean, yeah. And I really did try to dig him out of that hole for him. I was like yeah, maybe an Apple commercial is where you saw me and you got confused. All of that was true. And I don't think he ever really realized what his mistake was. BALDONADO: What do you think that instinct is to try to make it easier for the person who's saying this to you? I mean, it's totally on the other person who made the mistake but there is this instinct to try to make it nicer, easier for the other person. ZAMATA: I think because you - as soon as that person realizes that they have made a mistake that may be construed as ignorant or even racist, the conversation gets so awkward. And they may be a nice person. They may even be my friend. So there's like a little part of me that's like, oh, no, no, no, no, it's OK. I don't want you to feel bad. And it's kind of like, you know... BALDONADO: You're not racist. ZAMATA: ...Yeah, yeah, trying to like coddle a scared kitten or something and be like no, it's fine. We're all friends here. We're all OK. But then it's like no, I don't have to do that. You should learn. You should just learn from your mistakes. You should feel that emotion. And if it feels awkward, and then don't do it again and actually be conscious of what you're saying next time. But yeah, I'm really am over trying to make sure other people are comfortable in this conversation when they're making me uncomfortable. It's not my fault. That's something they need to work on. BALDONADO: Now, you were cast on "SNL" in 2014. And it may be one of the most visible "SNL" castings ever because it was at this time when "SNL" was criticized for a lack of diversity and particularly for not having any women of color on the cast for a couple years. What was the casting process like for you from your perspective? ZAMATA: It was mostly odd because it was so public. Like, I had been auditioning for this show for a couple years before this point. And then they asked for a rushed showcase of black women in LA and in New York. And I was in the New York one. And then they chose people from those pools. And then I found out, like, after the holiday break. This was all in December. And yeah, it was very stressful. I mean, I didn't love it. I didn't love that it was so public. BALDONADO: Well, had "SNL" been a goal of yours? Like, as a kid, did you watch the show and think that's what I want to do, I want to do that? ZAMATA: Yeah. I watched "SNL" and "MADtv" and "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" and didn't know how to get there at all, didn't even know how the people who were there got there. And then when I got to college, I started doing improv. And then the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre has a touring company. And they go to colleges. And a group came to my college at UVA. And there was like a talk back between the college groups and UCB team. And someone asked how do you get a career in comedy? And Bobby Moynihan, who happened to be in the group, said move to New York, go to UCB and work really hard. And so I did that. And then (laughter) - and when I moved to New York, I didn't know how much improv and comedy would play into my life. I thought I was going to do theater and Broadway and stuff. But I kept going to see UCB shows. And I was just such a fan that I was like, I should just really try this and dove in hard, started taking classes back to back, start taking sketch classes and started doing stand-up all at the same time. And then eventually I was like, oh, this is all I want to do. This is all I want to dedicate my time to. And then eventually my managers and agents saw me perform and signed me. And then I started getting money for it. And I was like, oh, this is even better (laughter) now that I'm getting paid for it. And yeah, and then it turned into my career. BALDONADO: Do you have a favorite "SNL" sketch that you've worked on or that you loved performing in or writing? ZAMATA: This season, we did a sketch that was a "Stranger Things" parody. And I watched "Stranger Things" when it came out and loved it. And by the end of it, the biggest question I had was where were Lucas's parents? The little black boy, he - his parents were nowhere (laughter), at least not anywhere searching for him. And I was like if I was running around the woods looking for monsters late at night, my parents would be freaking out and they would try to find me. I think - I remember my mom, like, ripped me out of a Steak 'n Shake 'cause I was out too late. So if I was like in danger, the consequences would be much greater. So I just wanted to put that in sketch form. And we have the performers for it. And Kenan and Leslie, like, made wonderful harsh parents. And yeah, I was so happy with the way that it came out. BALDONADO: Well, let's take a listen to that sketch, it's really funny, a sketch from earlier this season which was a parody of the Netflix show "Stranger Things." And you're playing the little African-American boy. ZAMATA: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE") LESLIE JONES: (As character) Lucas? ZAMATA: (As Lucas) Oh, no. Oh, God. It's my parents. JONES: (As character) Lucas, where the hell have you been? We haven't seen you in days. KENAN THOMPSON: (As character) What makes you think you can be out this late? Kids in this town are getting snatched up by kidnappers. LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: (As Dustin) But it's not kidnappers, Mr. Sinclair. KYLE MOONEY: (As Mike) Yeah, it's the Demogorgon. THOMPSON: (As character) A Demo-what? MOONEY: (As Mike) It's a monster, and we're looking for it. JONES: (As character) Lucas, I told you not to hang out with these little white kids. (LAUGHTER) ZAMATA: (As Lucas) But we have to find the Upside Down. THOMPSON: (As character) The what? (LAUGHTER) ZAMATA: (As Lucas) It's like the normal world but it's scarier and there's danger at every turn. JONES: (As character) Baby, people who look like us already live in the Upside Down. (LAUGHTER) THOMPSON: (As character) Let me put it to you this way, Lucas. You don't have to go looking for scary stuff. It's going to find you. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: That's a sketch from "Saturday Night Live" featuring Sasheer Zamata. We'll hear more of her interview with our producer Ann Marie Baldonado after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview our producer, Ann Marie Baldonado, recorded with Sasheer Zamata, who has been a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" since 2014. BALDONADO: Now, radio and podcast fans may also know you from your appearances on "This American Life." You've been on a bunch of times. ZAMATA: Yeah. BALDONADO: And - yeah. Some of them funnier, some of them poignant, but all great pieces that you worked on. And one great piece you did was for an episode where the theme was It'll Make Sense When You're Older. And in it, you talk to your mom about race. It's about your relationship. It's about how she was one of the first black students to integrate a white junior high school in a small town in Arkansas during the civil rights era. I want to play a bit of the piece. Here your mother is describing to you what it felt like to be one of those kids. And she talks about how she felt like she didn't ask for it, she didn't ask to be a trailblazer. And she felt really alone, like, she didn't have anyone to talk to about the experience. And here you ask her to describe what her first day was like. And then that sort of cuts to - at the end of what she's saying - it cuts to a bit of your stand-up act. So let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, "THIS AMERICAN LIFE") IVORY STEWARD: There was a lot of cussing at us while we were sitting on the bus. And momma had told us sit in the front of the bus so in case something happens, the bus driver is a witness. Well, he was just a witness to us getting cussed out every day. He did nothing. When we got off the bus, we stood outside the window of the office. So if there - anything happened, then they could witness something happening to us. The person we were - I remember standing in the window was coach Collier (ph), who later became principal. So he witnessed the kids throwing rocks at us. I remember I had on a white blouse, a houndstooth vest and a black skirt and had on my cute little white bobby socks. And I remember looking down at my legs and how the rocks had pelted them. And one had broke blood. And some kid, I guess he pulled out a banana. He threw a banana. And it landed on my houndstooth vest. And I never got that stain out. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZAMATA: Being in junior high, no matter who you are is hard. Like, it just sucks. People are mean. And so I started asking her questions about this like what was it like? And my mom said think of it like "Mean Girls," but they're racist. And I was like no. (LAUGHTER) ZAMATA: Like, that's the analogy where I fully understood. I was like, oh, my God. That's too mean. BALDONADO: That's an excerpt from a piece from "This American Life" by my guest Sasheer Zamata. Was it hard to hear that from your mom, not only because she seemed still really hurt about the experience, but how - because she was so conflicted about her role in the civil rights movement? ZAMATA: Yeah. It was interesting. She was totally on the side of I didn't ask for this, I didn't want to be a part of it. If I had a choice, I would have stayed in the schools that had all black kids. There was a lot of responsibility on her shoulders just to exist. Just her existing and being in an environment that did not want her was now a responsibility. And, yeah, it was hard to hear because I can't even imagine doing that. She did that for years. She had a like a full ulcer by the time she left high school. She was under so much stress, and I really can't even compare anything in my life to that. I wouldn't - I also wouldn't want that, so I'm proud of her. I'm glad she did it. I'm glad she talked about it. BALDONADO: Now, in your stand-up special "Pizza Mind" you say that your mom has started acting, too. Let me play a clip from the special. (SOUNDBITE OF COMEDY SPECIAL, "PIZZA MIND") ZAMATA: My mom just recently told me that she's getting into acting which is so cool because I'm an actress, and we get a new thing to talk about. And it's fun to see her try a new thing and be really excited about it. It makes me very happy, but I felt bad because when she first told me about it, a little part of my brain was like that, bitch, better not take my parts. (LAUGHTER) ZAMATA: And I don't want to feel that way. But there's only so many roles for black women these days. And I'm sure some of you are like you guys are in different age groups, you're not going to compete for the same roles, but casting directors can't tell how old black women are. (LAUGHTER) ZAMATA: They can't. And there's evidence of this because Gabrielle Union has played a teenager for three decades. BALDONADO: That's from this stand-up special "Pizza Mind." I don't know if she's still interested in acting, but was that something that your mother had always been interested in or did you inspire her? ZAMATA: She definitely wanted to be onstage. She was in a bunch of pageants when she was younger, and, like, after the "This American Life" story, I think she was inspired to do more of that and start taking acting classes. And now she's straight up signed with a agency in Indianapolis. And I'm so excited for her. I would love for her to be like a late in life successful actress. I would love for that to be the main way she makes money, like just books commercials and does a little bit parts or maybe does leading roles. I don't know. Whenever I get control of something and I start making movies, I'm going to put her in as much as I can. BALDONADO: Sasheer Zamata, thank you so much for joining us. ZAMATA: Thank you for having me. GROSS: Sasheer Zamata spoke with FRESH AIR producer Ann Marie Baldonado. Zamata is a cast member of "Saturday Night Live." Her new comedy "Pizza Mind" is on the NBC streaming site Seeso. She's also in two new movies - "Deidra And Laney Rob a Train" which just premiered on Netflix and "Sleight" which will be released later this month.

The team works out of a nondescript office in Palo Alto, according to three sources. The project is far along enough that Apple has been conducting feasibility trials at clinical sites and hired consultants to help it navigate regulatory pathways. Achieving a reliable way to track glucose levels without piercing the skin is viewed as a 'holy grail' for life sciences. The effort was initially envisioned by Steve Jobs who wanted smartwatches to monitor important vitals such as oxygen levels, heart rate and blood glucose. One source there were 30 people working in the group a year ago. The glucose team is said to report to Johny Srouji, Apple SVP of Hardware Technologies. It's believed that Apple is developing optical sensors which shine a light through the skin to measure indications of glucose. To succeed would cost a company "several hundred millions or even a billion dollars," DexCom executive chairman Terrance Gregg previously told Reuters. The breakthrough would be a boon for millions of people with diabetes, spur new medical research and open up a potential market for consumers to track their blood sugar for health and wellness insights. It could turn the Apple Watch into a "must have" rather than a "nice to have" for people who would benefit from an easier way to track their blood sugar. Hit the link below for more details...

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Apple gets permit to test autonomous cars in California Apple Apple gets permit to test autonomous cars in California By Bindu Nair - Apr 15, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Apple has been pretty cloak and dagger about Project Titan, its autonomous car undertaking of many secretive years. While this state of affairs probably won’t change anytime soon, the company recently gained entry into California’s list of companies allowed to test self-driving vehicles, serving as the biggest confirmation yet of its intentions. California requires firms to apply for an Autonomous Vehicle Testing Permit to allow self-driving cars to be tested on public roads. Apple has so far been conducting its evaluations privately, so applying for and getting a permit is a big step in realizing its vision. What that vision is still isn’t entirely clear. Project Titan supposedly started off as a means to build a self-driving Apple car. However, this didn’t work out as planned and the company reportedly decided to shift into developing software for existing carmakers instead. It’s apparently going to make a final decision on the direction of the platform by the end of 2017. Also See: Qualcomm strikes back at Apple with a lawsuit of its own Till then, Apple will probably be busy taking its autonomous cars to the streets. A person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that software tests with existing vehicles will kick off soon. The publication reports that the company’s permit covers three 2015 Lexus RX450h SUVs and 6 drivers who will be behind the wheel. Going public also means that Apple is required to disclose traffic incidents which occur during testing within 10 days of the event. The brand’s first report could finally provide some proper insight into its plans. Other than California, the company is also said to be working on a car operating system to power its autonomous vehicle platform.

Apple receives patents for self-driving cars in California Smartphone giant Apple had been secretly working on a self-driving car codenamed Project Titan for a number of years. The company never formally acknowledged it, and now it appears to be dead. However, recent reports indicate that instead of developing its own electric car, it is focusing its efforts on developing self-driving software. Such software can be deployed in various other cars. This was, on 14 April, confirmed by California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Here's the list of permits issued: Apple is testing autonomous vehicles in California https://t.co/BOWryzcNOH pic.twitter.com/f2ZxneV9qb— kif leswing (@kifleswing) April 14, 2017 A Bloomberg report had said, back in October 2016, that Apple had switched to focusing on software instead of hardware. At that point, Apple's 1,000 strong team was "reassigned, let go, or have left of their own volition".Armed with the permit, the company will commence testing of its software on the streets of California. Multiple reports say that Apple will begin testing 'soon' but none have a firm date. Armed with the permit, the company will commence testing of its software on the streets of California.

Apple has three vehicles registered under this permit - all three of which are 2015 Lexus RX crossovers - and in addition to this, the company has also employed six drivers. The law requires a person to be present in the self-driving vehicle who is able to take control, if something goes wrong.

In December 2016, Apple had strongly hinted about its ambitions in this sector. "The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation," Apple said in a letter submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Late to the party Littered with companies - 29 of them to be precise - Apple's arrival is indeed late. The likes of Google's Waymo, Uber, Elon Musk's Tesla Motors and Mercedes-Benz are far ahead in the world of autonomous driving. No one knows the extent of Apple's software development and hence no one can predict how fast the company will mark its presence. That will be known, once Apple reports their 'disengagement rates' to the DMV who in turn will make the numbers public. A lot of companies apply for the permit but don't report any miles driven. NOTE: Mercedes-Benz has teamed up with Bosch to introduce a self-driving taxi service by 2020. This is a year earlier than other companies such as General Motors, Ford, BMW and Google's Waymo. Apple's reason for joining the party was that it believes autonomous technology can help ease congestion and help avoid many yearly accidents. On the other hand, Apple, as always, is thinking about money. Self-driving cars are expected to be a gold mine for companies in the near future and as Apple's core businesses - phones, tablets and personal computers - saturate, the company needs new revenue streams. Apple with a fast track record catching up to its rivals, and billions of dollars in cash, will be nothing short of a force to reckon with. It also re-hired former hardware executive Bob Mansfield to lead the project. One of the most recurring speculations is of Apple buying Tesla. This is highly unlikely, but nonetheless a constant reminder that Apple is within reach of the top competitors in the self-driving sphere. Read More Apple's self-driving technology, according to reports, is being developed in secret in company offices Sunnyvale, California, not too far from its headquarters. Bloomberg also reports that Apple has a team in Canada that is "working on a car operating system that would power the platform". The final decision on the project will be taken before the end of the year. Another byte of the Apple In some outrageous news this week, Apple might just pull off an audacious $200 billion-plus takeover of Disney. If this acquisition goes through, a company worth $1 trillion would be created and as a 'speculative' report from RBC Capital Markets says, “almost limitless opportunities in content and technology.” A combined company would be a direct competitor and a threat to the likes of Netflix, Amazon and HBO. Apple would be landing global streaming sports rights for ESPN and Disney's theme parks among others. “Content is a major focus for Apple, target size is not an issue, and Disney offers an avenue to diversify away from hardware without diluting the strong Apple brand,” RBC’s Cahall and Kulp wrote. Last fall, Tim Cook, Apple's chief, said that the company is open to "acquisitions of any size". On the other hand, Bloomberg is reporting that Apple is looking to invest in Toshiba's semiconductor business. In this regard, Apple might join hands with Foxconn - Apple's major supplier - to make a bid. Apple is considering an investment of a several billion dollars to take more than a 20% stake. The plan would have Toshiba keeping a partial holding so that the business is kept under Japan and US control. Toshiba is the world's second largest supplier of flash memory chips. Apple has a cash balance of $241 billion as of December 2016 so either of these moves is quite realistic in the near future. With Apple spreading its wings, one thing is for certain. The company isn't going to keep depending on its core business for much longer. Planning for the future is the name of the game for Apple in 2017 – the year of the tenth anniversary of the iPhone.

That figure is larger than Sri Lanka's estimated 2016 gross domestic product, but smaller than Denmark's, according to the CIA World Factbook. If Apple's cash pile was its own public company, it would be the 13th largest in the world. The tech giant also reported earnings that beat Wall Street expectations on Tuesday and said it sold more iPhones than expected. The stock jumped more than 3 percent in after-hours trading as more than 6.8 million shares changed hands. The company's cash reserves have long fueled speculation of acquisitions that Apple might make. Apple keeps most of its cash outside the U.S. for tax reasons, but President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress are expected to change rules on repatriation of cash stored overseas, which could make it easier for Apple to spend some of the money on acquisitions without taking a major tax hit. Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC, "Repatriation is front and center. That is good for the country and Apple." —CNBC's Juan Aruego, Anita Balakrishnan and Josh Lipton contributed to this report. Correction: This story was revised to correct that the amount of cash on hand was as of the fiscal first quarter.

Apple has assembled a team of biomedical engineers from various companies to work on the project, according to the report. Cor, a company Apple acquired in 2010, has been working for more than five years on a way to integrate noninvasive glucose monitoring into a wearable like an Apple Watch device. Glucose monitoring traditionally has required that diabetics use lancets to pierce their fingertips at least four times daily, measuring blood glucose levels before and after meals, when waking up, and before going to bed. Many Type 1 diabetics wear pumps to deliver insulin, and they sometimes test up to 16 times a day. One of the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring, or CGM, is to warn diabetics when blood glucose is rising or falling rapidly. Hypoglycemia can result when glucose levels fall below 70 milligrams per deciliter. Hyperglycemia, a rapid rise of blood glucose, can lead to ketoacidosis or, worse, a diabetic coma. Apple reportedly has begun feasibility studies in the Bay Area and has retained consultants to help with regulatory issues. Lucrative Market Managing diabetes has been a rapidly evolving focus in both the smartphone and wearable device markets. Integrating glucose sensors into wearable devices is a difficult challenge, but the market potential is very great, noted Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst for WW mobile device trackers at IDC. "Today most wearables are consumer products, but there's an untapped opportunity in the medical community," he told TechNewsWorld. The overall diabetic testing market will reach US$17 billion in 2021, up from $12 billion in 2016, ABI has estimated. Revenue from CGM devices is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 41 percent. More than 9 million wearable CGM devices are expected to ship by 2021, and wearable device makers like Apple and other competitors want to get a bite of that market. Existing Products Apple has an existing partnership with Dexcom, which offers the G5 continuous glucose monitor. It allows Apple Watch users to monitor their blood sugar using an app that syncs with iPhone. Many CGM devices have accuracy issues and require frequent calibration with blood glucose sensors. However, regulators last year found the G5 readings were accurate enough to require calibration just once every 12 hours. Abbott's Libre blood testing system has a sensor worn on the upper arm up to 14 days at a time, which measures interstitial fluid under the skin every minute. The system originated in 2014 in Europe and now is available in 30 countries worldwide; it is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Medtronic, one of the leading makers of diabetic insulin pumps and continuous glucose sensors in the U.S. last year received approval in Europe, Latin America and Australia for its Guardian Connect device, according to company spokesperson Danielle Swanson. The device currently is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. "CGM is extremely valuable to people with diabetes, as it allows them to see current glucose levels at any time on their phone without a fingerstick," Swanson told TechNewsWorld. "People with diabetes can also receive alerts to help them avoid high and low blood glucose levels." The app, which is being rolled out on a country by country basis, initially was made for the iOS system. Medtronic will release an Android version at a later date. Under a partnership announced last year, Medtronic will offer glucose tracking on Fitbit's iPro2 mLog mobile app, using data from Medtronic's iPro2 professional CGM system, to give patients a record of their exercise and blood glucose levels. The app is available for both iOS and Android mobile devices. UK-based Nemaura Medical has developed the sugarBEAT system, a glucose monitoring device that uses a noninvasive, disposable patch. The 10mm coin-sized device measures molecular amounts of interstitial fluid using an electric current . The same technology is being developed for a variety of other uses, such as taking measurements related to athletic performance and measuring oxygen depletion in patients. The patch would last up to 14 days before needing to be changed. The company signed a letter of intent with a China-based Shenzen CAS Health Corp. in a joint venture to manufacture and distribute the sensors in China, pending regulatory approval. "We have designed sugarBEAT around the needs of the user," Nemaura Medical Director Bashir Timol told TechNewsWorld. "Accordingly, the primary interface is the app accessible on users' existing smart device." David Jones is a freelance writer based in Essex County, New Jersey.

Re: Apple May Transform Diabetes Care and Treatment: Report jescott418Posted 2017-04-15 So obviously this is not big news for me because its not really news. Apple has yet to announce anything close to replacing the test strip for diabetics. This is speculation and more hype for Apple as if pricking a finger is the worst thing a diabetic endures. Being type 2 for 15 years I can tell you, the last concern is having to check my glucose with a lancet and test strip. I've seen attempts before and much like the trouble with monitoring pulse through a wrist device. The ideal of a optical system able to accurate check every human's glucose level is also something elusive to technology. Apple may indeed be working on a solution, but we may find the costs and procedures to get this approve through the FDA will be long and full of people who simply won't benefit from it. Personally as a diabetic when ...

It’s been another thrilling week across the tech world, with some exciting announcements, a few spicy rumors, some big surprises, and some bigger disappointments. But don’t worry about missing anything, for once again, 7 Days is here to walk you through what’s been happening. Our journey begins this week in the world of fast food, as Burger King created a TV ad designed to trigger Google's Home speaker hub and digital Assistant in people's homes, by ending with "OK Google, what is a Whopper burger?" That should then have got Google Home and Assistant to read out the description of the Whopper from Wikipedia - but the Wikipedia entry was quickly edited to suggest that the Whopper contains "rat meat" and "toenail clippings". In the end, it wasn't Burger King that killed the ads, but Google, which wasn't too happy about its devices being used in that way without its blessing, and blocked its Assistant from responding to the ads. Google's got much bigger things on its mind anyway - next week, it's planning to introduce "the new Google Earth" with a "brand new experience". Lineage OS added support for more handsets, including Samsung's Galaxy S III, and the OnePlus One. And Canonical released Ubuntu 17.04 'Zesty Zapus', bringing a new kernel and removing the default swap partition - although it hasn't yet made the recently-announced switch from Unity to GNOME. At CES in January 2016, Dell unveiled its stunning 30-inch OLED monitor with 4K resolution. Priced at $4,999, it was due to go on sale in March 2016, but never appeared. Now, over a year later than planned, it's finally available to order - and its price tag has shrunk by 30%. The US Federal Aviation Administration has given the green light to Boeing's use of 3D-printed titanium aircraft parts for use on its 787 Dreamliner. The move is set to save millions of dollars in production costs for the company. Image: Digital Trends Meanwhile, the FCC has abandoned plans to enable cellphone calls during flights. Given how obnoxious fellow passengers can be, even without license to scream into their mobile phones at 37,000ft, this seems like a sensible move. Over in the UK, Virgin Media is turning its home broadband customers' routers into public Wi-Fi hotspots. Kodi, frustrated by its software being misused for content piracy, is now considering adding DRM support to its products. A new strain of ransomware has been doing the rounds lately, demanding that you play a game and unlock your data by reaching a high score. Hacking group Shadow Brokers published a range of tools used to exploit vulnerabilities in Windows versions all the way back to Windows 2000 - but Microsoft said that it had already patched most of those security flaws. Image: Shutterstock Microsoft published its latest transparency reports, including details on law enforcement requests for information about its customers. Microsoft and Chinese tech giant Tencent were among the investors in the latest $1.4 billion funding round for Indian online retailer Flipkart. More significantly, Flipkart is now taking over eBay India, while eBay is taking an equity stake in Flipkart as part of a $500 million investment. Microsoft released a new Office Insider Preview for Windows users in the Slow ring, bringing new features such as collaborative editing in Excel. It released a new Outlook for Mac preview for Office Insiders in the Fast ring too, adding support for email templates. But separately, it also launched another Outlook for Mac preview, available to everyone. The standalone preview program does not require an Office 365 subscription, unlike the Office Insider Program. Rumors in recent months suggested that Apple had abandoned its self-driving car project in favor of working with existing manufacturers to develop software for use in their vehicles. It's still not clear exactly what Apple has planned, but this week, the company received a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California. Meanwhile, Apple is reportedly working on a secretive project to expand the healthcare benefits of its Watch. The company is said to be developing sensors that can non-invasively monitor blood sugar levels for diabetics, similar to the heart-rate sensors on its existing wearable devices. In rather more mundane news, Apple also released its second developer betas for iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1; followed by the second public betas of those iOS and macOS versions. Apple is being sued by Qualcomm, which alleges that the iPhone-maker deliberately limited its chips' performance so that they wouldn't outperform those sold by Intel. Qualcomm didn't have a great week, as it was ordered to refund $815 million to BlackBerry, which was found to have overpaid the chip-manufacturer. The ruling came after a period of arbitration, and cannot be appealed, so while Qualcomm made it clear it "does not agree with the decision", it has no choice but to pay up and shut up. The latest smartphone sales market share data from Kantar Worldpanel shows further gains for Android in many key markets, with iOS holding steady in most parts of the world - except in China, where demand for iPhones plummeted year-over-year. Windows phone sales remain in freefall, unsurprisingly. After months of leaks and rumors, HTC officially unveiled its new One X10, a mid-range handset with a 5.5-inch 1080p display, octa-core processor, and a very generous 4000mAh battery. There was very surprising news from Samsung this week. After it became clear that its new 'intelligent assistant' Bixby would be far more limited at launch than Samsung had implied on stage at its Galaxy S8 announcement, the company has now admitted that its new flagship will launch in the US without support for Bixby voice controls. Samsung also tweeted that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will launch in India on April 19, before deleting that tweet. It also seems that AT&T will be exclusively launching a Galaxy S8 active, following similar 'rugged' versions of the S6 and S7. If you've ever found yourself asking "what's the point of a smartwatch?", you're not alone. In fact, Huawei's CEO made the same point this week - shortly after launching his company's two new smartwatches - saying: "I am confused as to what smartwatches are for when we have smartphones." ZTE unveiled an affordable Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch with a 1.4-inch AMOLED display, priced at $192. Unfortunately, it doesn't have NFC support, which means no Android Pay. That seems like a bit of a missed opportunity. And while LG updated its first-gen Watch Urbane to Android Wear 2.0 last week, the company said the update won't be available for its second-gen model until next month. Nearly eight months after Google released Android 7.0, its long, slow rollout continues, reaching more devices this week: Google updates Nexus 6P beta testers to final build of Android 7.1.2 Android 7.1.1 now available for Nokia 6 Samsung Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ get Android 7.0 on AT&T Samsung Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ get Android 7.0 on Verizon Android 7.0 rolls out to Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge on Sprint HTC One M9 finally gets Android 7.0 on Sprint... with February security update While the February security update reached the One M9 on Sprint, HTC rolled out the March security patches for unlocked models of that device. Wileyfox began its migration away from the now-defunct Cyanogen OS to Android 7.1.1 Nougat, starting with its Spark 2X handset. Intriguingly, Wileyfox also revealed that it's making a Windows phone, saying that "Windows is much better for security than Android". That might comes as a surprise, until you realize that Wileyfox was funded by the same company that owned UK handset brand KAZAM, which also made Windows phones, until it was "absorbed" into Wileyfox last year, although they're still both registered as separate companies. Speaking of which: Someone should probably also mention to KAZAM's directors they're overdue on filing latest Companies House paperwork https://t.co/CL7Vmyglub pic.twitter.com/eh6b9oeJ0e — Andy Weir (@gcaweir) April 10, 2017 HP's pricing for its Elite x3 Windows 10 Mobile flagship in the UK has made absolutely no sense over the last few months. In the last two months, the handset and Desk Dock have been priced at £673, then £707, £757, £702, and back to £673 again - and now, that bundle is available for £583, with a £90-off voucher code. In the US, T-Mobile has ended sales of Alcatel's Windows 10 Mobile flagship, just six months after its launch, and two months after slashing its price by a third. While Microsoft is continuing to sell the unlocked Alcatel IDOL 4S with Windows 10 for $400, Amazon is now offering it for just $284.99. Two weeks after WhartonBrooks launched crowdfunding efforts for its "most disruptive" "radical" fairly ordinary mid-range Windows 10 Mobile phone - the Cerulean Moment, priced at $299 - the Indiegogo campaign has so far reached just 2% of its $1.1 million target, with one month remaining. But WhartonBrooks is already looking to the future, planning a virtual reality headset, and four more Windows phones targeting a range of different users. That's ambitious, given how poorly the company has managed expectations so far, and how far removed the Moment is from the absurd promises and astonishing hype that WhartonBrooks generated around the device before it was finally unveiled, months later than planned. The Lumia 750 - one of several Windows phones that Microsoft cancelled when it ripped up its mobile strategy - made an appearance in an unofficial video this week. On April 25, Microsoft will release the Windows 10 Mobile Creators Update - but as feared, it won't be made available to all handsets currently supported by the OS. Microsoft confirmed on Friday that just thirteen handsets will officially receive the update, leaving many devices - including some that are still on sale today - unable to upgrade to the newest version of the OS. Those older phones will still be able to install the Creators Update via the Windows Insider Program Release Preview ring - but they will not be officially supported. Microsoft also released build 15204 for Windows 10 Mobile - its first build from the Redstone 3 development branch - but its build number is much lower than that of the latest build for PCs, raising further questions about the future of the smartphone version of the OS. Microsoft insists that the reason for the divergence in build numbers for Windows 10 Mobile compared with PCs is because it's 'converging code into OneCore', which has left many people scratching their heads. Meanwhile, Microsoft dropped key features that it announced for the Windows 10 Mobile Creators Update, and it's far from clear if they'll ever make it to devices. Indeed, with only 13 handsets supported, and its development now lagging far behind that of PCs, it's starting to look an awful lot like Windows 10 Mobile is being switched to a Windows Phone 7.8-style 'maintenance' branch, leading nowhere but a dead end. The latest Redstone 3 preview for PCs rolled out on the same day that Microsoft made its unwelcome Mobile announcement. Build 16176 is now available for PCs in the Fast ring, and you can see the fixes and known issues here. On Tuesday, Microsoft began its rollout of the Windows 10 Creators Update (developed under the Redstone 2 codename) for PCs: Overview of new features and improvements How to install the Creators Update right now A closer look at changes to privacy settings How to download and read e-books from the Windows Store in the Creators Update Windows 10 Creators Update: Microsoft Edge beats rivals in battery performance yet again Evaluation ISOs for Enterprise customers now available New firmware available for Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 running Creators Update Microsoft released updates for every version of Windows 10 this week, on PCs and phones: build 15063.138 (cumulative update for the Creators Update / Version 1703) builds 14393.1066 and 14393.1083 (Anniversary Update / Version 1607) build 10586.873 (November Update / Version 1511) build 10240.17354 (the original Windows 10 release, also known as Version 1507) Microsoft confirmed that it will officially end support for Version 1507 on May 9, 2017. Microsoft has also started blocking updates for older versions of Windows running on PCs with newer processors, as it tries to force those users to upgrade to Windows 10. Microsoft is reportedly working on a new 'Tabbed Shell' for a future Windows 10 update, which would allow users to run multiple instances of the same app in a single window, with tabs to switch between them, much like a web browser. Microsoft sent out invitations for its next big event, which will be held on May 2 in New York City. With the hashtag '#MicrosoftEDU', it seems that it may have a focus on education - but it's widely expected to also discuss its new Windows 10 Cloud edition at the event. However, it's not expected to unveil the much-anticipated Surface Pro 5 there. Microsoft is including a free Surface Dock worth $199.99 with purchases of any Surface Pro 4 tablet in the United States, including the $799 entry-level model, which has an Intel Core m3 CPU, 4GB RAM and 128GB - but no Surface Pen. Leaked images revealed a new family of Windows 10 devices on the way from Huawei... ...while HP officially announced its new range of affordable Windows 10 notebooks and convertibles, with support for Windows Hello facial recognition, and active pens. Amazon is making it easier for companies to use its microphone and voice recognition technology to build devices that use its Alexa digital assistant, by making its reference design available to hardware partners. We've known for a while that Harman Kardon is working on a new speaker powered by Microsoft's Cortana digital assistant. This week, it emerged that that device will be called the 'Invoke', and will feature Skype integration - and it seems that Microsoft may be planning to invite select Windows Insiders to provide feedback on the device. Microsoft is making it a bit easier for users to share their feedback with the company. Starting with those in the Windows Insider Fast ring, it's now adding the ability to directly share content from across the OS to the Feedback Hub, making it simpler to report issues. Last year, Microsoft shipped the Windows 10 Anniversary Update with the half-baked 'Skype Preview' app as its default communication experience. After months of development - and months of endless frustrations for its users - Microsoft finally dropped the 'Preview' tag with the rollout of the Windows 10 Creators Update. It says the new Skype app is now "ready for everyday use". The "all-new Skype app" - in reality, just the newest update of the UWP version that's been in preview on PCs and phones since last year - is now available on the Xbox One too. Microsoft said that its interface has been "redesigned to put gamers first." Microsoft is introducing "self-service refunds" for apps and games on Windows 10 and the Xbox One. On Thursday, Microsoft released the Version 1704 update to all Xbox One users, bringing numerous "fan-inspired" features to its consoles. And after offering early access to its new Xbox Game Pass for the Xbox Insider Alpha and Beta Rings, Microsoft has now expanded preview availability to Ring 3. Xbox Game Pass will offer unlimited access to over 100 games for $10 a month when it launches this spring. Microsoft's Project Scorpio dev kit was revealed on Wednesday, with a similar design to the Xbox One S. The dev kit is even more powerful than the final console will be, and has some distinctive features, including double the RAM of the production model, and an OLED display on the front. Microsoft confirmed that Project Scorpio, which it calls "the most powerful console ever", will be officially unveiled at the E3 gaming expo in June. It also revealed this week that Scorpio will support FreeSync and HDMI 2.1 Variable Refresh. Call of Duty: Black Ops II was the latest (and very welcome!) addition to the list of Xbox 360 games playable on the Xbox One through the Backward Compatibility program. Microsoft is launching an official store for "community-made goodies" in Minecraft with curated content from nine professional partners, which players will pay for with new Minecraft Coins. And this news will probably come as no surprise, given that Minecraft is pretty much everywhere else - but Microsoft is launching its blocky, world-building game on the Nintendo Switch on May 11. Perhaps the most shocking news of the week was that Nintendo has officially ended production of its wonderful NES Classic Edition console. Despite enormous demand for the retro machine, Nintendo has apparently decided that it just doesn't want your money. Perhaps this guy has the right idea: a gamer built his own tiny console that squeezes into a tin of mints, powered by the brilliant Raspberry Pi micro-computer. Check out Zelda and Donkey Kong on that dinky screen! And if you think that's cool, make sure you check out HoloLems, bringing virtual reality Lemmings to your living room! But our odyssey across the tech world ends this week as it began: with fast food. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to find me some nuggs. Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a couple of extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Rich Woods put HP's new Spectre x360 through its paces. The Windows 10 convertible device earned itself an exceptionally high score in his review, making it one of the best devices we've ever tested - thanks in no small part to its 4K display and active pen support. And Justin Luna took a trip down Memory Lane with the help of Timi Cantisano, as Microsoft terminated its extended support for Windows Vista this week. Vista was pretty, but went largely unloved, and never achieved the popularity of its successor, Windows 7. RIP. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend!

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, Apr 16, 2017 - Page 16　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Apple allowed to test self-driving cars PROJECT TITAN:Independent analyst Neil Cybart said Apple seems to have shifted gears toward developing a ‘transportation platform’ rather than manufacturing cars NY Times News Service, SAN FRANCISCO Apple Inc plans to start testing self-driving cars on California roads, the clearest signal yet that the world’s most valuable technology company wants to design or build autonomous vehicle technology. The California Department of Motor Vehicles on Friday granted Apple a test permit that the agency said would allow the company to test autonomous driving technology in three 2015 Lexus RX 450h luxury hybrid SUVs. The permit authorizes six drivers to take control of the vehicles when necessary. Apple has been coy about its self-driving car project, known internally as Project Titan. The iPhone maker has not officially acknowledged the existence of the project, which appeared to be adrift last year. It laid off dozens of people in the fall and brought in one of its top troubleshooters, Bob Mansfield, to reinvigorate the effort. “We are always looking at new things, and the car space in general is an area that it’s clear that there are a lot of technologies that will either become available or will be able to revolutionize the car experience,” Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook told investors in October last year. Neil Cybart, an independent analyst who writes about Apple at the Web site Above Avalon, said the company appeared to have moved away from plans to build and sell cars like Tesla Motors Inc does. Instead, he said, “they are working on a transportation platform.” Apple declined to comment on the California permit or on its broader automotive plans, instead referring to a statement released in December last year, when it submitted comments about autonomous vehicle technology to the US National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. “Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” the company said in the comments. The self-driving car segment is among the most bitterly contested areas in emerging technology, with Apple joining 29 other companies that have received test permits in California alone. Google considers self-driving cars to be a potential new market, while Uber Technologies Inc hopes to eventually eliminate the need for human drivers for its service. Traditional automakers like General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co view the self-driving car as a natural extension of their businesses. Start-ups are also vying to enter the market: Udacity Inc — an online education company cofounded by a pioneer of Google’s self-driving car initiative — is building an open-source autonomous car and offers a training course to people who want to become self-driving car engineers. “Every company will have to have some solution for transportation,” Cybart said.

That technology can be great for runners, cyclists and hikers. But what about those of us who prefer a wetter workout? A map of my one-mile Bay swim in San Francisco’s Aquatic Park on March 18, charted by the Apple Watch Series 2. The yellow sections are where I was swimming at my average pace, green is above and red is below. In open water mode, the Apple Watch also tracks how far you swim and how many calories you burn.  Related Articles What the experts say about swim gadgets Swimming has been my sport of choice for the past 15 years. I practice three or four times a week with the Temescal Aquatic Masters in Oakland and compete in open water races in local lakes and the Bay. After seeing a few of my Teme lane-mates sporting fancy gear on their wrists, I wondered if there was a device out there that would help me improve my workouts. I tried out five devices marketed to swimmers and spent a few weeks testing their accuracy, usefulness and how enjoyable it was to wear them. I even took them to the Bay for a mile-long swim in San Francisco’s Aquatic Park to see how they did in the open water. All the devices had shortcomings. None of them counted my laps when I was kicking, swimming “drills” or doing anything else that wasn’t clearly identifiable as freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke or butterfly. The odd length of the pool I swim in also gave them trouble. While most pools are 25 yards, mine is 33.3. Many of the devices let me enter 33 yards as a custom pool length, but didn’t record the decimal, making their readings a bit off. Despite these shortcomings, the devices can be a fun way to track how far you’re swimming, how fast, and whether you’re improving over time. But there were clear winners and losers. The Apple Watch was my favorite, while I found Mio’s Alpha 2 to be completely useless. The Apple Watch Series 2 (courtesy of Apple).  Apple Watch Series 2 Rating: 4.5 out of 5 Price: $369 With its sleek design and bright, colorful display, this one was the most fun to use. You just flick your wrist during your workout to see a real-time counter of how many laps and yards you’ve done, how many calories you’ve burned and how long you’ve been in the water. While it doesn’t provide the detailed data some of the others do, it was among the most accurate at tracking how far I swam. What makes Apple Watch even better is you can download third-party swimming apps that offer additional features. MySwimPro, for example, guides you through pre-written workouts on your wrist, even telling you how long to rest between sets. The watch worked great in open water mode too, keeping tabs on how many yards I swam in the Bay. Using its built-in GPS antenna, it tracked my route on a map, which I enjoyed looking at after my swim. The watch doesn’t look waterproof (and the original Apple Watch is not), but it works well underwater. When you start a swimming workout, it goes into a “water lock” mode that prevents water from activating its screen and accidentally texting your friends. Water can also interfere with heart rate readings in many wrist-worn devices. But Apple says the Apple Watch’s heart-rate monitor should still accurately measure your average heart rate, because it takes readings when your wrist comes out of the water. The Garmin Forerunner 920XT (courtesy of Garmin).  Garmin Forerunner 920XT Rating: 4 out of 5 Price: $449.99 While not as sexy as the Apple Watch, Garmin’s Forerunner 920XT keeps track of a wide range of information, including your pace, average stroke rate, average number of strokes and even your swim golf score, which is the sum of the time and number of strokes it takes to swim a particular distance. If you buy the $100 HRM-Swim monitor accessory, which straps to your chest, it will also track your heart rate. The Forerunner was great in open water too, tracking my distance in real time and giving me a map of my route similar to the Apple Watch map. Like the other devices, the Forerunner can’t track kicking or drills, so to get credit for those laps, you’re supposed to enter them into a special drill section during your workout. But that was way too much of a distraction from my swimming, so I didn’t bother. And the watch seemed to over-count my yardage slightly, giving me credit for more than I really swam. The Moov Now (courtesy of Moov).  Moov Now Rating: 4 out of 5 Price: $59.95 I was underwhelmed by the Moov Now when I first saw it — it’s just a flimsy rubber strap that holds a plastic sensor to your wrist. There’s no fun display to look at while you’re swimming. And connecting it with your phone is a bit of a pain — before and after each workout I had to stand awkwardly in the locker room for about two minutes, waiting for the device to sync. But once I started using it, I was impressed by the data it gathered and loved its light-weight feel on my arm. It was the only device to give me detailed information about every individual lap — it sensed which stroke I was swimming, tracked my time for each lap and timed every flip turn. I found myself trying to make my flip turns faster during practice because I knew Moov Now was watching. The gadget won’t track your open water swims because it doesn’t have GPS. But on the other hand, it’s a fraction of the cost of its rivals. The Suunto Ambit3 Sport (courtesy of Suunto).  Suunto Ambit3 Sport Rating: 3 out of 5 Price: $194.99 The Ambit3 Sport is a smartwatch that can track your distance, average and maximum speed in miles per hour, your average pace per 100 yards and your swim golf score. It can also keep track of how you swim in open water, and seemed to do so accurately. And you can train the watch to recognize your different strokes. For $269.40, you can buy the watch and a heart rate monitor that straps to your chest. But the Ambit3 Sport was the heaviest and clunkiest of all the devices I tried. It felt like it was weighing down my arm while I was swimming. It’s also less intuitive to use than other devices, and its display isn’t as easy to read.  And like the Garmin, the Suunto tended to give me credit for more distance than I actually swam. Most disappointingly of all, I couldn’t get the watch to sync with my iPhone, despite multiple attempts over several days. I may have had a faulty watch — the company assured me connectivity problems are rare. The Mio Alpha 2 (courtesy of Mio).  Mio Alpha 2 Rating: 1 out of 5 Price: $119 The Mio website advertises this watch with a picture of a triathlon swimmer in the water, but I found it to be utterly useless for swimmers. The watch’s main selling point is that it measures heart rate without a chest strap — but not in the pool, as it turns out. It’s “safe” for swimming, the fine print on the company’s website says, but “we cannot guarantee its accuracy under water.” There’s no swimming setting, so it can’t measure distance in the pool. Oh and the company “strongly advises” that you don’t press any buttons on the watch while in the water, because they might stick or break. The first time I used the Mio, it kept beeping at me and flashing different colored lights. I finally figured out how to turn the beeping off and learned the lights indicate your heart rate levels — blue is low, yellow is moderate and red is maximum. But I gave up when it was still flashing blue after a few hard sets that left me winded.

Here’s how to fix iMessage syncing issues between your iOS and OS X devices. iMessage has changed the way that many people communicate with their family and friends on a daily basis. With iMessage being available on all of your iOS devices, it makes it even more convenient to use. We’ve discussed many common problems with Apple products in the past, but iMessage is something that deserves some special attention, considering that many users come across all sorts of problems with the messaging service on a regular basis. One of the biggest issues that we’ve seen with iMessage is syncing the service across all of your various Apple devices, including iOS devices and Mac computers running OS X. Sometimes, there are many problems that can arise when dealing with multiple devices and getting iMessage synced across all of them. If you’ve been having this kind of trouble with iMessage lately or are just preparing for those inevitable problems to arise, read on to learn how to fix iMessage syncing problems. Set Up iMessage Correctly It’s possible that you didn’t set up iMessage properly, which could be why the service may not be syncing up correctly. iMessage should sync up with all of your Apple devices together as long as all of them are signed in under the same Apple ID, but surprisingly, it doesn’t work that smoothly sometimes. Follow these steps to properly set up iMessage. On your iPhone and/or iPad, open up the Settings app. Tap on Messages. Tap on Send & Receive. Make sure your email address shows up at the top next to Apple ID. If not, tap on this and sign in with your Apple ID. Also, make sure your main phone number is selected under the section titled Start New Conversations From. Repeat these steps on all of your other iOS devices. This will allow you to send and receive iMessages not just between your iPhone and Mac, but you’ll be able to add in an iPad that you might have lying around as well. Read: 3 Common iMessage Problems & How to Fix Them To set up iMessage on Mac, follow these simple steps. Open up the Messages app. Click on Messages in the menubar in the top-left corner and then select Preferences (or just hit Cmd + comma on your keyboard). Next, click on the Accounts tab and you should see your Apple ID email address in the sidebar. If not, click on the + sign at the bottom and add your Apple ID. Once added, click on it and you’ll see some similar settings that you did on your iOS device. Simply make sure that Enable this account is checked, along with your phone number further below. At the bottom of the Preferences pane, make sure your phone number is selected from the dropdown menu under Start new conversations from. After that’s set up, you should be good to go, and any iMessages you receive on your iOS device will also show up on your Mac, and vice versa. However, if you’re still having problems, there’s a quick fix. Turn Off iMessage & Turn It Back On If you set up iMessage correctly but are still coming across syncing issues, there’s a quick fix that you can perform to sort of reset iMessage and knock it back into proper position. Essentially, you’re just disabling iMessage on all your iOS and OS X devices that have iMessage, and then re-enabling it on each device one at a time. To do this on your iOS devices, go to Settings > Messages and toggle iMessage off on all of these devices. On Mac, you’ll open up Messages and then click on Messages > Preferences > Accounts. From there, uncheck Enable this account and close out of Messages and then open it back up. At that point, go back to your iOS devices and re-enable iMessage, and then head to your Mac and do the same thing. Give it a few minutes for your devices to communicate with each other and eventually iMessage will be ready to go. From there, you shouldn’t have anymore problems. 23 Responses 07/14/2015 christina Reply Thanks for this article! It fixed the issue I was having and was super easy to follow. 08/06/2015 kristiporter Reply I’m still having an issue on my MBP. It’s not letting me freely text people. For a few friends, it’s saying they don’t have iMessage accounts, and therefore won’t send the message. That just started happening this week. Do you know what that might be? 09/21/2015 SEO Reply Thank you for you great explanation. I follow up and it is working!. Can I sync past messages so I can have them as an Archive? 09/30/2015 thatscharles Reply Even after verifying all these steps and making sure everything is alright both on my iPhone 5s and my Macbook Air and it still won’t receive the messages I receive on my phone and it won’t send my texts. Help ! 10/20/2015 Draco Reply There is no option on my iPad 2 (running the latest iOS 9) to add a phone number under iMessages. It only gives an option to add an email address. If you try to add a phone number it just says “this email is not recognized.” 10/27/2015 Spartacus Reply Didn’t work for me either. When I send texts from my iPhone and MBP, people get two separate message threads as if two different people are sending them messages, and their replies are similarly segregated to phone or computer as well. 11/18/2015 someone867someone Reply that u this helped a lot 11/26/2015 Deidre Brown Reply Thank you! This worked perfectly! 12/01/2015 Guy Incognito Reply Hi, I was frustrated by my MB not even showing my phone number (already set on my iPhone) as an option in Messages. I tried adding an “email” to the account – but entered my phone number instead. Then, after a series of popups on my phone and MB – success. My phone number appeared as an option to “Start New Conversations From…”. Hope this helps. 12/16/2015 Laura Tucker (@LauraATucker) Reply Thank you! Somehow my Apple ID logged out of iMessage on my phone. Drives me nuts, but I love texting and messaging from my computer! 01/08/2016 Aka Reply Great, but not very reliable service/app. Wish Apple could fix this, can’t be too difficult? 02/05/2016 Dimas Reply Im using two iphone (5 & 6+), and my iphone 5 stop receiving imessage, and i cant send imessage from that device either.

Can you help me? 02/19/2016 colleen macaddino Reply I am getting my iMessages on my work computer and would like to disable it, suggestion above isn’t helping. 02/24/2016 Tish Downs Reply My MacBook Air will receive all the messages that are texted to my iPhone 6, but when a message is deleted from the iPhone, it will stay on the MacBook Air. Messages deleted from the MacBook Air will stay on the iPhone 6. I would like for them do sync with each other when deleting. 03/29/2016 Shirley Andrews Reply I’m just now having a problem with my iPad syncing with my iPhone. Last week I could send iMessages from iPad to anyone in contact for 2years now I can only send to a few people. It’s very disturbing specially when I was enjoying how can be working a message come across an I could respond but now I need my cell phone to catch messages. I notice the change after I downloaded my update. I wish Apple would fix this problem. 04/05/2016 Nicole Reply Thank you, this fixed my problem! 06/02/2016 Christopher Triolo Reply Thank YOU!!!!

Apple has made a name for itself in the tech world for always launching innovative gadgets. In fact, Apple’s devices were always revolutionary such as the original Mac for example which shipped with the first ever mass produced mouse. We should also mention that Apple’s iMac, iPad, iPod and iPhone have change the way people use their technology. Sadly, now that 2017 is here it looks Apple has lost its touch. Innovation No one is saying that the technology world has stopped from innovating, we’re just saying that Apple is not behind any of it. Other companies have stepped in Apple’s place and they are doing quite a great job at that. For example, Amazon has managed to take the market by storm with its Echo speaker that can be controlled only through vocal commands. Microsoft and Samsung have been competing against Apple in the tablet and smartphone category for over a decade now. The problem is that Apple has started losing the fight against the aforementioned companies. Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 directly takes on iPad Pro while Samsung’s Galaxy S8 rules the smartphone market and overshadows iPhone 7. Steve Jobs The late Apple CEO was considered as being responsible for all of Apple’s technological advancements and now that he is gone, people are wondering if Apple will be able to strive once again. Tim Cook stepped into Steve Jobs place and while he is doing a great job, it just isn’t the same. When Steve Jobs was Apple’s CEO, no one ever knew what to expect from Apple. Culture Change In fact reports are showing that Apple employees are stating that ever since Steve Jobs has passed away in 2011, the company’s culture has changed completely. Bob Burrough who is an Apple employee that worked under Steve Jobs has claimed that the late CEO always used to push everyone to look for different ways in order to innovate Apple’s gadgets. Bob Burrough stated the following “It was all about we’re all working towards the same goal”.  Let’s just hope that Tim Cook manages to get Apple on the right track so that we can enjoy innovative Apple products once again.

The fourth generation iPad was originally released in 2012 and replaced with the iPad Air 2 in 2014. Apple will typically replace models brought in for servicing, and as available stock dwindles, the company has told its service employees that the unit “may be substituted to iPad Air 2”, according to a memo obtained by 9to5Mac. The memo also instructs employees to note inform customers that the iPad had some slightly different storage options — 32GB and 128GB, while the fourth generation 16GB and 64GB options were discontinued, meaning that users might get an upgrade. In March, Apple discontinued the iPad Air 2 in favor of a new 9.7 inch version.

Easter egg hunts and other events in the Lehigh Valley area LV Business Cycle Tech and Innovation From The Morning Call archives: In 1999, Robert Taylor talked about the changing face of technology Robert Taylor THE MORNING CALL/FILE PHOTO Bob Taylor, outside his home in Woodside, Calif., in 1999. Bob Taylor, outside his home in Woodside, Calif., in 1999. (THE MORNING CALL/FILE PHOTO) Katie WangOf The Morning Call PUBLISHED ON NOV. 21, 1999 —It is a land of gold, where dreams are digital, money is plentiful and dotcom is a way of life. Millionaires abound, money talks and gridlock traffic, a daily yet accepted nuisance, crawls slowly every day along the threads of freeways that stitch San Francisco to San Jose. Nestled between the two cities is a treasure chest of high-tech companies in homogeneous glass offices set against naked, sun-baked mountains. The company names are familiar: Intel, Cisco Systems, Apple Computers, Lucent Technologies, Hewlett-Packard. And every day, new, unfamiliar start-up enterprises join the veteran giants of this 50-mile stretch known as Silicon Valley, the epicenter of the technological world. The region, once dotted with prune and apricot trees, is the heart of the transistor and microprocessor industries, devices that have made people's lives move faster and easier in the 20th century.

(Kristine Phillips) During the 1980s, a decade where Americans shifted toward the Reagan right, greed and yuppies raged and corporations downsized, microprocessors spurred a technological surge that produced wonders such as the fax machine, voice mail and videocassette recorder. The sleek compact disc, with a smoother, digital sound, replaced muffled audio cassettes. Cellular phones provided convenience and accessibility to a society always on the go. Atari, a Silicon Valley-based company, sold tens of millions of colorful video games for home, creating a generation labeled "X" with an appetite for fast, flashy entertainment.

Taylor, one of the most important figures in the creation of the modern computer and the internet, has died. He was 85. According to his son Kurt Taylor, the scientist died Thursday at his home in the San Francisco Bay Area town of Woodside. He suffered from Parkinson's disease and other... (Esmeralda Bermudez) The defining moment of the technology boom occurred in 1984, when Apple Computers, a Silicon Valley company, introduced the Macintosh personal computer. Life hasn't been the same since. The user-friendly Macintosh connected people to computers in a way they had never been linked before. Instead of using complicated programming language, people could use a palm-size tool called a mouse and click on desktop images on their monitor. Americans were transported into a world of spreadsheets, word processing and computer games. The personal computer revolutionized the workplace, creating new skills for employees to master, but making it easier for them to perform daily tasks. Budget reports, address lists and memos could be typed, saved to a disc and faxed to another office thousands of miles away. E-mail provided a new means to keep in touch, replacing phone calls and handwritten letters for some. But there was a price to pay. The accelerated pace made the workplace and society more stressful, cutting into family time, said Keith Gardiner, a Lehigh University professor. While technology blossomed, the 1980s was also the decade America witnessed its worst space disaster, when the space shuttle Challenger exploded into a fireball, killing all seven people aboard. It was a somber reminder that even with all the technological advances, man was not invincible. Still, Americans churned ahead, embracing as many new gadgets as they could. Technology's magic touched everything from entertainment, with hit movies such as "Back to the Future," to the medical world, where the first artificial heart transplant took place. At the center of the boom is Silicon Valley, a hotbed for tech companies. The region, with its fusion of brains, money and energy, set the benchmark for technological growth in one area. Other places, including the Lehigh Valley, have tried to emulate its success. Today, Silicon Valley is a destination point for ebullient, fresh-faced entrepreneurs who arrive with an Internet start-up plan in one hand and a Palm Pilot in the other. A 1980s spirit of greed prevails in this area where people ask when you will make your first million, not if. Transiency is accepted, if not encouraged, as people such as John Lilly, a 28-year-old former Apple employee, break away from their companies to start their own. Lilly is one of the lucky ones. His company, Reactivity, a consulting firm that spins out start-ups, is up and running in less than two years since its conception. Chances are, though, that most start-ups will not succeed because of intense competition. But failure is hardly a blemish in the valley of opportunity, where 19,400 jobs were added in 1998. Nearly every day, a new company shapes the landscape, drawing more people to the area, outpacing residential development and making the valley one of the most expensive places to live. "We're in the richest county in the richest state in the richest country of the world," said Tod Browndorf, chief operating officer of Pacific NetSoft, a Silicon Valley head-hunting firm. "If you want to be part of the way the world turns, this is where you need to be." ALL WIRED TOGETHER, PORTOLA VALLEY residents Kaiti Malloy and her husband, Scot, own three lap top computers, a personal computer, a fax machine, two cell phones that also double as pagers, a digital satellite dish and a portable MP3 player. Kaiti plans on purchasing a Palm Pilot, a hand-held computerized version of a daily planner, and Scot, a Bethlehem native, is going to trade his cell phone for one with a PDA, or Personal Digital Assistant, the equivalent of a personal computer on a telephone. Their home, as wired as an electronics store, is typical in Silicon Valley. It's filled with enough gadgets to guarantee they will never lose touch with the world. "With the exception of when I'm on vacation, I feel lost without at least one PC and Internet access," said Scot Malloy, who works at Reactivity. Tiny gadgets are what make the valley spin. Drivers chat on cell phones while zipping along freeways in their daily commute. A trip to Fryes Electronics, a technology superstore, is a family outing. It would be rare to find someone without a cell phone, pager or Palm Pilot. "When people work in the industry that produces the technology, they're much more likely to have that technology," said June A. English-Lucek, an anthropology professor at San Jose State University. But the gadgets have created a frenetic society. "There's more pressure to deliver, there's more deadlines," said Gardiner, who only recently purchased an answering machine. The pressure could grow as technology becomes smarter and more sophisticated. General Motors has announced it will equip cars with voice-activated Internet access, which could connect drivers to e-mail even behind the wheel. In San Francisco, some taxis are furnished with a lap top computer so passengers can surf the Web while stuck in traffic. Browndorf, of Pacific NetSoft, spends at least six hours a day connected to some sort of electronic device. Relatively speaking, he is barely wired, but has the basics -- cell phone and personal computer. "I hate the feeling that someone wants to inform me of something and I can't be reached," he said. Even with all their gadgets, the Malloys say they aren't nearly as wired as some of their friends who also own digital cameras, scanners and multiple personal computers. The couple uses the personal computer to bank, pay bills, shop and send e-mail. This year, Scot Malloy, 34, plans to purchase all of his Christmas gifts online. His latest techno gadget is the "Diamond Rio," a portable MP3 player, a personal music player that is smaller than a cigarette pack and plays sound files from computers. The fax machine, once considered revolutionary, gets the least use. "Usually it's only needed when dealing with old, established and somewhat out-of-date companies that haven't discovered e-mail yet," he said. BUILDING BLOCKS The one-car garage sits 10 feet behind a brown-shingled Palo Alto house, sectioned off by a chain and a tiny sign warning people to "Keep Out." In the front yard is an inconspicuous plaque, marking the garage as the birthplace of Silicon Valley. The garage, where Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard started their computer company, is symbolic -- a testimony that great things can grow out of small places. It is an entrepreneurial spirit that generations of Silicon Valley technology companies have adopted since Hewlett-Packard formed in 1938 -- each company building upon each others' innovations. These building blocks paved the way for the personal computer revolution. "HP has always been innovation-oriented and organized in small work groups that are fast and flexible like start-up companies," said John Young, Hewlett-Packard's chief executive officer from 1979 to 1992. Despite the plaque at the garage, Hewlett-Packard never worked with silicon in the 1930s, the material used in most semiconductors, but the garage is the model for so many entrepreneurs. Unused, it is a draw for gawking tourists who visit daily. A management company owns and rents out the house. The last set of renters moved out because tourists barraged them from dusk until dawn. Palo Alto also is considered the heart of Silicon Valley, because it is home to Stanford University, which feeds hundreds of graduates to the tech world annually. Hewlett and Packard are two of the school's most famous alumnae. The university also was a reason why so many tech companies moved to the region during the '50s and '60s. In 1968, Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce launched a business called Intel. The company carved computer chips out of silicon, a grainy, sandy material that, next to oxygen, is the most abundant element on earth. Intel designed the microprocessor, a complex chip that could perform 60,000 calculations in one second, in 1971. By the end of that decade, engineers were able to squeeze more transistors, a tiny switch that is almost invisible, on a chip. These transistors make microprocessors operate faster and more efficiently. THE BOOM Jamis MacNiven, a boisterous, animated contractor was working on a renovation job in 1980 at a two-story house in Los Gatos. MacNiven asked the homeowner what he did for a living. "I own a computer company," the man replied. "What's that? MacNiven asked. "Punch cards or something?" The homeowner was Steve Jobs, a 25-year-old, bespectacled computer geek who started tinkering with computers, also in his garage, in the 1970s. The company was a burgeoning enterprise called Apple Computers. During the 1980s, it topped the personal computer industry, tumbled, and is now trying to stage a comeback. Today, Jobs and MacNiven are both entrenched in the Silicon Valley scene -- Jobs by choice, MacNiven by circumstance. MacNiven owns Buck's, a popular Woodside family-style restaurant where venture capitalists strike million-dollar deals over breakfast burritos and silver dollar pancakes. The restaurant is a watering hole for entrepreneurs. Jobs is back in charge of Apple, after being ousted in 1985. Apple recently introduced a colorful new line of personal computers called the iMac, a long way from the primitive single-board computers that the company first built. The legendary garage where Jobs and Steve Wozniak, a former Hewlett-Packard employee, started their company in 1976, sits unmarked on Crist Lane in Los Altos. But like the Hewlett Packard garage, it is a magnet for tourists. Jobs "is an authentic genius," MacNiven said, sitting in his restaurant before the dinner rush. "He really did good." The story of how Apple began is well documented. Jobs and Wozniak started with pocket change and an order to manufacture 50 single-board computers at $500 apiece. Around this time, in 1981, IBM introduced its personal computer using Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system. The company formed a partnership with Bill Gates, who like Jobs, was trying to make his mark in the computer world. Apple released three computers before unveiling the Lisa computer in 1983, the first commercially sold computer with a graphical user interface. The Lisa computer was unique because of its icons and pop-up menus, making it easier for people to use, but it flopped because it cost an unaffordable $10,000. The company was looking to rebound. Coincidentally, Jobs was invited by managers at Xerox to visit the company's premier research center, called Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. The center is the birthplace of the laser printer and the first work station, the Alto. Xerox never sold the Alto commercially. Legend has it that Jobs conceived the idea for the Macintosh after seeing the Alto. Xerox officials had invited Jobs there because it was interested in investing in promising small companies. Jobs asked to see the computer science laboratory, but Xerox PARC researchers objected out of fear of giving away trade secrets. Corporate managers in New York ordered the employees to allow Jobs in. "It was a stupid thing to do -- I couldn't believe it happened," said Bob Taylor, director of the computer science division at that time. As fate would have it, Taylor was out of town the day Jobs visited. Otherwise, he said, he would've refused to let the Apple CEO in. The Mac made its debut in grand fashion as a Super Bowl commercial, single-handedly igniting the personal computer revolution. The spot played off George Orwell's "1984" and featured the destruction of Big Brother with the Mac. That year, at least half a million units sold at $2,500 each. The Mac was the first computer to put text and graphics on the same page. Today, the iMac costs $999. Office dynamics changed. The service sector -- people who typed letters and compiled budget reports -- were no longer in as high demand because the computer made it easier for middle management to handle those tasks. "Ask any secretary what her work is like (compared to) the 1980s," English-Lucek said. "There was a massive shift in organizations about what happened at work." People transformed their homes into offices to save on commute time, smudging the distinction between work and home. And as predicted, society became more reliant on computers. At the end of the '80s, more than 45 million PCs were in use, more than double the 19 million in 1984. In the shadows of the personal computer revolution, another major breakthrough in technology unfolded: the continual strengthening of the microprocessor. The concept is simple -- increase the numbers of transistors on a silicon chip and the capabilities will multiply. By 1989, Intel produced a chip that allowed users to run desktop publishing and color computing simultaneously at significant speed. The microprocessor is still the driving force behind today's technology boom that is sweeping the nation faster than society can absorb it. It is the reason computers are getting smaller and flatter and equipment from the phone to the camera will continue to integrate. "This is the engine that drives the advancement of everything you know today," said John Gage, chief scientist at Sun Microsystems. "We'll get to 2010 using what we do now, but it'll be 1,000 times smaller." THE REVOLUTION Today, billboards promoting Internet companies fan the eight-lane freeways that cut through the heart of Silicon Valley. The entrepreneurial spirit set by Hewlett-Packard more than 60 years ago still drives the Valley like a furious engine, churning out more companies nearly every day. But instead of starting in a garage, today's new tech company is likely to start on the Internet -- the tool driving the nation's economy. "There's no place else on the planet where so many ideas can be turned into prototypes and working models, where you find expertise in everything you need to make a company," said Tim Lenoir, who teaches a class on Silicon Valley history at Stanford University. Every day, at least hundreds of people will come up with the same great idea. The real test, though, is successfully packaging that idea before others do. In 1997, John Lilly came up with the biggest idea he could think of -- a company to spin out other start-ups. The company creates, develops and consults start-ups on how to launch their business. The Stanford alum called it Reactivity to symbolize the blend of intelligent, energetic employees he wanted to hire. Reactivity launched in 1998 with three people and $30,000 in capital. By the end of that year its revenues reached $1 million. "Everybody seems to be starting up these days," he said. "No one wants to work in a large company." Today, their Redwood City office, a converted bank, is a typical valley workplace. A colorful mesh basketball hoop is in one corner, diagonal from a shelf topped with Legos, a Curious George and other toys. Across the room are Nerf guns and more toys to relieve stress and engender creativity. Two miles down the road is the Buck's Restaurant, the hunting ground for entrepreneurs waiting to be discovered like actors in a Hollywood restaurant. "People come in now every day and say, `I've got this great Internet idea. I need $20 million, do you know where I can get it,'" said MacNiven, the owner, who has heard nearly every offbeat idea. Secluded from the flurry of activity is Bob Taylor, a mastermind of the ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet, who predicted the Internet explosion 30 years ago. Taylor, who lives five miles from Bucks in a house overlooking Stanford University, is surprised it has taken this long to happen. In the '60s, Taylor and J.C.R. Licklider, who is regarded as the father of the Internet, prophesied that "in a few years, men will be able to communicate more effectively through a machine than face." The U.S. government developed ARPANET out of its agency, Advanced Research Projects Agency, which was the country's response to the Sputnik launch in 1957. Taylor expects there is more to explore in cyberspace. "I think it's clear today that the Internet is one of the most important innovations of this century," Taylor said. Many more innovations are on the horizon. Last week in Las Vegas, Bill Gates opened a technology trade show insisting in his keynote remarks that personal computers are here to stay. Gates outlined his vision for homes to have Web-connected flat-panel screens in every room. Samsung just released a Dick Tracy-like cellular phone that straps to the wrist like a watch and is voice operated. And Frigidaire unveiled a refrigerator of the future with a touch-screen and bar-code scanner built into the door. People running low on an item will be able to scan the code, adding them to an electronic grocery list. The list would be zapped to an online grocer. "The blur between life and different technologies is going to get blurrier and blurrier," English-Lucek said. "It is making it easier to play at work or to work at home because the technologies you have will allow you to do both of those."

Not so fast, warn experts at Wharton. “The popular press is enamored with the connected home, but we’re only seeing a glimmer of what’s ultimately possible,” says Wharton management professor David Hsu. “It’s very early, and we have to see tighter integration between all of the players.” Since Amazon launched the Echo in 2014, the $180 device has garnered positive reviews from users and was listed as a best-seller on its site during the holidays. (The company has not released official sales figures.) Amazon recently added two new devices, the Dot and the Tap, to the Echo line of products. The $130 Tap is a portable version of the Echo, while the $90 Dot is a tiny version of the product designed to hook up to a speaker. These devices can be used to order a pizza, adjust the lights and temperature in your home (through partnerships with home automation companies including Samsung, Wemo, Hue, Wink, Nest and ecobee), read an audiobook and give a weather report, among other tasks. But Amazon isn’t the only tech giant vying to become the glue that connects various devices in your home. Apple has a platform for software developers called HomeKit that can interoperate with security systems, appliances, locks, shades and lighting to control a home. Samsung has a product called SmartThings that controls home functions using an app that works on Apple’s iOS or Android devices. Samsung’s platform, which connects via multiple standards, works with everything from speakers to doors and locks, security systems and lighting. Microsoft is working on an operating system called HomeOS which is still in the research stage. Google last year announced Brillo, a smart home operating system built on the company’s Android mobile operating system. Google parent company Alphabet owns the Nest smart thermostat. Apple, Amazon and Samsung have the most traction among developers and an ecosystem of partners, but no clear winner has emerged, nor has any one company managed to solve all the challenges necessary to provide the foundation for a seamlessly connected home. “There are too many standards and no one platform to go across all of the devices,” notes Saikat Chaudhuri, executive director of Wharton’s Mack Institute for Innovation Management. “The concern I have is interoperability.” “The popular press is enamored with the connected home, but we’re only seeing a glimmer of what’s ultimately possible.” –David Hsu Currently, the smart home landscape is a series of technology silos. Entertainment systems can be connected, even though many vendors may prefer to bind the consumer to a single platform, such as Apple’s iOS or Android. The ultimate vision for the smart home would connect all appliances, home entertainment equipment and control systems as well. Forrester analyst Frank Gillett noted in a blog post that “consumers are implementing connected home activities one gadget at a time.” About 13% of U.S. online adults use one or more smart home devices, according to Forrester. The research firm also said that emerging smart home devices will perform tasks in a variety of categories including home access, automated background activities such as environment controls, and safety and engagement functions such as cooking, entertainment and health management. Future Proofing How should a homeowner approach the smart home? Peter Fader, a marketing professor at Wharton, is figuring it out on the fly. Fader is wiring his new home to be connected. His biggest concern: How do you put home infrastructure in place today so it will be relevant in the future? “We’re in spring training and hoping to build something that doesn’t have to be completely replaced by the third inning,” quipped Fader, who is also co-director of the Wharton Customer Analytics Initiative. “I have no confidence that the infrastructure today will get us far. That’s what makes it so exciting.” Sponsored Content: Fader’s bet is that Wi-Fi will be an enduring standard. Today, home systems can be networked using Bluetooth, a popular wireless connectivity protocol; Zigbee, which is similar to Bluetooth; and Z-Wave, to name just a few. “Right now it’s wishful thinking to pick a winner” in the smart home race, Fader notes. “No one thought Amazon would have an early leadership position.” Tim Courtney, vice president of sales and strategy at Further Enterprise Solutions, is an informal advisor to Fader in his smart home effort. Courtney has consulted for Samsung’s SmartThings unit, which aims to connect appliances and smart home end points. “The smart home is a mess, but I think the platform that is most open will ultimately win,” says Courtney. “There are a lot of smart things for the home, but they aren’t integrated.” For instance, a consumer with Ring, which is a tool that can be used to see who is at the door remotely via an app, and Nest, the smart thermostat, would need two applications for home control. At present, the more smart home devices a person has, the more apps he or she needs, too. “I have no confidence that the infrastructure today will get us far. That’s what makes it so exciting.” –Peter Fader Can You Hear Me Now? There also has yet to be clear consumer consensus over whether the preferred method of controlling a connected home is a voice assistant, like Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri, or simply tapping instructions into a smartphone or tablet. While voice recognition programs are often the butt of jokes, artificial intelligence technology is only going to improve, Hsu says. “Voice is the natural way into the home and fits in with social norms,” he notes. “The digital assistant approach makes a lot of sense, and people will ultimately carry on a conversation to control things in the home that matter.” Voice controls can be easily learned and consumers may prefer it over constantly having to reach for their phones to complete a task, he adds. Chaudhuri disagrees, arguing that a smartphone is the obvious control point. “You’ll want multiple devices to connect to [a smart home system], and the phone is everywhere,” says Chaudhuri. “That reality means that Apple is well placed with its concept of apps.” Fader also expects that a smartphone or tablet will be the primary entry to smart home controls for the foreseeable future. Tech Headaches The current clunky connections between smart devices mean smart home deployments will largely remain with hobbyists for now. “I’m not going to be my own systems integrator,” says Chaudhuri. “Right now, we have all of these individual devices that may be useful. We have a bunch of digital devices in a home. We don’t have a digital home system.” And Chaudhuri doubts that any of the current players can create that system. “We won’t get the full benefit of the smart home until there’s a platform that brings it all together,” he notes. For instance, a company like Honeywell that already makes control systems could take on the integration role, says Chaudhuri. Indeed, Honeywell has a product line focused on the smart home and has grown the business organically and through acquisitions. Honeywell’s Lyric products integrate with Apple’s HomeKit, Samsung’s SmartThings as well as the company’s own smart home platform, dubbed IFTTT (If This Then That). Honeywell’s products include a smart thermostat, a water leak detector, a security system and fire prevention devices. Honeywell is also integrating its connected home products with its line of health care products and services. At a March 2 investor meeting, Honeywell officials said the company is focusing on software for industrial customers as well as the smart home to grow revenue and profit margins. Honeywell’s software strategy in part revolves around connecting front-end devices in the home to applications and analytics for contractors and utilities. “The smart home is a mess, but I think the platform that is most open will ultimately win.” –Tim Courtney Honeywell’s home platform revenue has had a 25% compound annual growth rate over the last three years. The firm has three units — aerospace, automation and control solutions, and performance materials and technologies. Smart home products are lumped into the automation and control solutions unit and account for 19% of the division’s $14.1 billion in sales for 2015. Honeywell reported 2015 revenue of $38.6 billion. Another approach would create a layer of software that rides on top of the various smart home systems. Chaudhuri says a company that is a successful smart home integrator is likely to be agnostic relative to devices and operating systems. In addition, companies like Best Buy could begin offering smart home implementation services. Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly has said that the company is eyeing the smart home as part of a broader growth strategy. “The increase in complexity and interoperability of technology products and the advent of the Internet of Things are making Best Buy’s operating model increasingly relevant as customers want and need more help selecting, installing, connecting, integrating, using, maintaining and taking full advantage of their products,” said Joly in August. Courtney says that telecom giants like AT&T, Verizon and Comcast are likely to edge in the market via security systems and then offer to manage customers’ smart homes for a monthly subscription fee. Many smart home items are going to need battery backups, says Courtney. Telecom providers are used to installing battery backups and other redundancy systems. “One big challenge is that if the power goes out, so does your Internet and smart home hub. You lose control of the house,” he says. With standards and technologies for the smart home still being sorted out, it’s a bit early to ponder integration efforts, but it is clear most consumers will need help. “This isn’t plug-and-play today, and the smart home is a market for the tech hobbyist,” Courtney notes. “You almost need to have a mini-IT guru at your house.” Supports K@W's Technology Content Citing Knowledge@Wharton Close For Personal use: Please use the following citations to quote for personal use: MLA "How Smart Homes Can Unlock the Mainstream Market."

 One year later, I’d still take the iPhone SE over the iPhone 7 Jeff Dunn Apr. 15, 2017, 11:00 AM 15,582 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Apple iPhone SE. Business Insider/Steve Kovach The truth is there’s no such thing as an objectively “best” smartphone. There's a fastest smartphone, and a phone with the best screen, and maybe a phone with the best camera. But, so long as it hits a baseline of good enough performance, the best total package is the one that works best for you. I say this because over the past year I have come to appreciate Apple’s iPhone SE much more than I anticipated. I am someone who cycles through phones like it’s my job (because it is), and I only bought Apple’s small-screen handset on a lark last April, after shattering the screen on my old Moto X. Nothing about the iPhone SE’s spec sheet is particularly impressive. It runs on Apple’s A9 chip, which is more than a year old. Its screen isn’t anything special by modern standards. There’s no 3D Touch. Its back camera is easily outclassed by today’s flagships, and its front camera is entirely average. Most notably, its whole design is a total rehash of the iPhone 5s, which launched in 2013. What the phone lacks in originality, though, it also lacks in size. It has a 4-inch screen, which is tinier than any other major phone to launch in the past two years. Business Insider/Steve Kovach But that, for me, is a very good thing. The smartphone industry is always following itself. When one company puts two cameras on the back of a phone, they all start to do it. When one company shrinks a phone’s bezels, that suddenly becomes the thing everyone needs to prove they’re on the cutting edge. It’s a state of rapid commoditization. Much of the time, this is great — a sign that competition begets cool things for you and me. If the iPhone SE has an irredeemable flaw, it’s those engorged bezels, which are just unpleasant next to a Galaxy S8. Other times, though, that persistent need for Progress™ leads to good things getting left behind. The death of the small phone may be the best example of that. It’s not that companies weren’t justified in making phones bigger — people kept buying them, then they kept spending more and more time glued to those large screens. The jump in display size with the iPhone 6 brought Apple to new heights. It’s more that the industry  turned it into a binary, almost totally killing small phones as a concept, even as those phones remained useful in ways that aren’t as easy to flaunt in a press release. The small-screen phones that have stuck around are almost always cheap and mediocre. Today, there remains exactly one Android phone maker building handsets that could be seen as “small,” and that’s Sony. Even then, its Xperia Compact series would’ve been called huge earlier in the decade. They’re totally fine phones, but they still give you a good bit more to handle than the iPhone SE. Sony's Xperia X Compact is smaller than most quality Android phones, but it's still a good ways bigger than the iPhone SE. Jeff Dunn/Business Insider The iPhone SE doesn’t make any concessions or compromises like that. Most people can reach across its screen with one hand. It knows it’s a small phone, and everything about it is designed to that end. The design is dated, but it’s iconic. It’s supremely light, its boxy shape gives you plenty of room to grip, and its aluminum frame never gets slippery. Being small already makes it difficult to drop; the way it’s built only furthers that. That gives me less need to cover it up with a unsightly case. The common argument for small phones like this is that they’re more welcoming to those with small hands. That’s true, but I’m a six-foot dude who has no trouble using a Google Pixel XL. What I like about the iPhone SE are the simpler things: fitting it in any pocket; texting with one thumb (use a swipe-typing keyboard like Gboard); comfortably web-browsing without letting go of the subway cart railing. There is a freedom and assuredness to it that isn’t as present with a standard-sized phone. It doesn’t preclude you from doing other things, nor does it make you contort when only one hand is free. It also understands it’s a phone, not so much a multimedia center. It makes it easier to text and make calls, regardless of what else you’re preoccupied with. It's not as luxurious for watching videos or reading articles as a larger phone, but “luxurious” is a relative term when the alternatives are smaller than six inches. I have a tablet and a television for when I want to savor something. The SE doesn’t make things smaller; it just shows you less at a time. When you’re dealing with a device you hold inches from your face, it’s not that hard to get used to. REUTERS/Stephen Lam The key to all of this is that the iPhone SE, while not cutting-edge in 2017, is still more than capable from a technical standpoint. The A9 chip still breezes through everything you do with a phone. The screen is not as vibrant as modern iPhones, but it never offends. The camera remains above-average. And, by virtue of having to push less pixels, the battery life is tremendous. It did have a storage problem last year, but Apple fixed that last month by doubling the space across the board. The kicker is that it’s all more affordable than other iPhones. It starts at $400, which isn’t as good of a deal as it was a year ago, but is still enough to make any flaws here a little more palatable. I realize I’m in the minority. According to figures provided to Business Insider by research firm IHS Markit, the iPhone SE accounted for just 9.8% of all iPhone sales in 2016. If you factor in older models like the iPhone 5s, 4-inch iPhones accounted for 16% of sales. Small phones were not abandoned by accident. But the iPhone SE is a reminder that the smartphone’s past still has its perks in the present. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

With over 1 billion iPhones sold over the last 9 years, Apple’s iconic smartphone not only revolutionized the way the world uses technology, it also helped transform Apple into one of the most influential and successful companies on the planet. Along the way, the success Apple saw with the iPhone proved to be an absolute goldmine for an array of companies who happened to manufacture and supply integral components for the device. So while the iPhone helped some companies achieve record-breaking profits, relying too heavily on Apple is not without its fair share of risk, something which Imagination Technologies recently learned when its stock plummeted nearly 70% after Apple informed the company of its plan to design a brand new GPU architecture all by itself. Don't Miss: The new MacBook Pro has a shiny new problem More recently, shares of Dialog Semiconductor fell by more than 30% amid reports that Apple might be interested in developing power management chips in-house. All that said, Statista recently put together a fascinating chart which maps out which companies have businesses that rely primarily on their partnership with Apple. As our chart illustrates, many companies from different fields have their relationship with Apple to thank for more than 50 percent of their annual revenue. Relying on a single customer in such a way poses a big risk, which is why Apple’s publicly-listed suppliers often trade at lower multiples than similar companies with a more diverse customer base. It also puts Apple in a position of power in contract negotiations, where the iPhone maker can use its leverage to dictate terms and conditions. As evidenced above, Dialog Semiconductor has reason to be paranoid at the slightest hint that Apple might be interested in designing its own power management chips. Still, it’s not as if every company on this chart has reason to worry. Indeed, it’s not as if Apple has any plans or even interest in supplanting Foxconn as an iPhone manufacturer. Additionally, a recent analyst report noted that Apple similarly has no interest in trying to develop its own audio chips and, in the process, kick Cirrus Logic to the curve. All in all, the chart above helps illustrate just how impactful the iPhone is across all spheres of the tech industry. And while Apple can help boost a company’s profits with a lucrative iPhone contract, it also has the power to pull the rug out from underneath those same company’s at a moment’s notice.

Technology, and design which will ultimately change the communication devices from the all too familiar, too something worthy of our excitement. However, while we wait for that to happen, we’re going to talk about the best smartphones of the year so far. geralt / Pixabay Best Smartphones Of 2017 When picking a smartphone, what do you look for? Could it be a big screen, fast processor, great rear camera, lots of RAM, storage space, or even battery capacity? Maybe you have loyalty to a particular brand, or you just buy what you can afford at the time. However, you go about it, one thing is certain, it’s not easy. Especially, when you consider every manufacturer claims theirs is the best among all that are available. As such, you may find yourself disagreeing with some of our choices below, and that’s fine. After all, we’re all individuals and not exactly looking for the same spec and features. So, here we go, here are our Top-4 best smartphones of 2017 so far. Apple’s iPhone tends to take the top spot in most of our lists, with Samsung in a close second. Although, continued improvements in Android handsets and much of the same from Apple, have led to a changing of the guard this time. Galaxy S8 Yet to be released, the Galaxy S8 is the first on to our best smartphones list because it offers an edge-to-edge display. In fact, it’s an edge-to-edge infinity display using Super AMOLED technology, and it looks beautiful. Along with its typically Samsung good looks, there’s an assortment of internal features that make it an extremely power device. Such as the Snapdragon 835 chipset, the most powerful Qualcomm chip ever to be incorporated into a handset. Additionally, there’s 4GB of RAM, which the South Korean giant believes to be ample to support day-to-day operations. Furthermore, both variants come with 64GB of storage and a MicroSD card slot for further expansion. However, what could be a game changer for the Galaxy S8, isn’t its IP68 water resistance, or USB Type-C port. It’s the promise of a truly AI assistant in the form of Bixby, for which a hardware button exists on the device. Samsung believes its assistant will truly revolutionize the way you use its smartphones. The Galaxy S8 64GB is available Unlocked to Pre-order on Amazon for $999.99, with free shipping. iPhone 7 Plus When Apple launched the iPhone 7 Plus back in September, it took the world by storm, with its dual-lens camera and bokeh effect. However, since then it has gone on to be a true great, one of the best smartphones around. Offering real stability thanks to iOS 10 and its many updates, along with other camera software improvements. However, that’s for us, not the most important, as for many years people had complained about iPhone battery life. Often taking to forums to air their grievances. With the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple has created a device which not only has the best camera but also has one of, if not the best battery life. Yes, its capacity isn’t the largest 2900mAh, but the included A10 Fusion chipset is so efficient that 9.5-hours battery life is possible. Meaning, that it beats the competition on this list by a clear one and a half hours. The Black iPhone 7 Plus is available Unlocked (refurbished) on Amazon for $709.99, with free shipping. LG G6 Has LG finally put to bed its rather lackluster software support for its devices? Only time will tell, but, it was the first manufacturer to launch an early 2017 flagship. A handset with all of the required features to make it on to this best smartphones list. Features such as a 5.7-inch display with 18:9 aspect ratio and 564 ppi, which means it gives detailed images and near perfect colors. However, where the LG G6 falls down compared to the S8, is with its chosen chipset. For whatever reason LG decided on 2016’s Snapdragon 821. Yes, it’s a great chipset, one that is more than capable coupled with 4GB of RAM, but it’s not the latest 835. Meaning there are performance differences which are in the Galaxy S8’s favor, not the LG G6’s. Additionally, where the S8 and the iPhone 7 Plus are good looking devices the G6 just doesn’t stand out. A negative which can be placed upon many of the companies handsets going back over some years. Finally, on a positive note, there’s the 13MP dual-cameras these make-up for other deficiencies with features such as dual-LED flash. The LG G6 is available Unlocked to buy on Amazon for $755.00, with free shipping. Google Pixel Being the first smartphone to carry the Google brand name, the Google Pixel and its larger sibling took the market by storm in October. In fact, at that point, it seemed fortuitous that the Note 7 was going through its recall creating a void for Google to fill. And fill them they did, becoming so popular that even now half a year after their release theirs still a backlog of orders. As for the handset itself with its 5-inch display, it has the smallest on this best smartphones list. However, it has a suite of specs and features which make it a formidable device. Such as the Snapdragon 821 chipset, the most powerful when the handset released. Also, theirs the relatively standard (for today) 4GB of RAM, which with the Snapdragon makes the Google Pixel is as fast as any handset currently available. If you’re looking for big positives to own one of these, there are at least two. One is the fact that since this is a Google device, you can expect to get regular Android updates. As well as be updated to the latest version of the operating system when Google has it ready. Lastly, there’s the camera; it’s probably 2nd only to the iPhone 7 Plus. Followed by the LG G6, and then the Galaxy S8 cameras. In fact, when launching Google compared it to the 7 Plus camera suggesting theirs was superior. And while it does take fantastically detailed images, we feel the iPhone camera is just that little bit better. The Google Pixel 32GB is available Unlocked to buy on Amazon for $760.00, with free shipping.

Your talent and your fate are all dependent on the amount of work you do and from which attitude you do it. Incredible work ethics are the only thing which you would find in the personality of every successful person. It doesn’t matter what the individual do, from the desk job to the wrestling in the shorts; their work ethics made them what they are today. To give tribute to such people and to take some inspiration from their lives, I am writing this post in which I will discuss the eight incredible work ethics of 8 different successful people. 1.  Apple CEO Tim Cook: Apple needed a guy who can run the business with the same intent that showed by the Steve Jobs and they appointed Tim Cook for that. The selection of Tim Cook was on the cards because of his extremely incredible work ethics. He is a workaholic and that kind of a guy who does even call his employees at 4 a.m. Many of his employs claim that he is the first to come and last to go kind of a guy in the office and often schedule meetings on Sunday to plan out the whole week of work. 2.  General Motor’s Mary Barra: Mary Barra was only 18 when she joined General Motors by enrolling in engineering college on scholarship. Her attitude of giving everything to the company that she has and the smart decision making are the reason she is at the top of General Motors. It took 33 years in General Motors for her to move from the intern to CEO. These 33 years are full of inspiring stories which we would discuss in details some other time. 3.  Amazon’s Jeff Bezos: Analyzing Jeff’s life would make you feel that this person was born to be great. He has the habit of relentless work ethic. One of his former classmates told a magazine that once he decided to be a valedictorian and no other student even applied on his opposite because everyone knew they couldn’t beat him. In his early days at Amazon, Jeff used to work 12 hours a day and even on the Sundays. Even now he is the CEO of Amazon; he still sends emails on the customer service issues. 4.  Nisan and Renault’s Carlos Ghosn: Carlos Ghosn is the CEO of world’s top two automobile manufacturing companies which is enough to tell you about his work ethics. Ghosn works more than 60 hours a week and spends 45 hours of every month in the air. He is the guy who flies more than 150,000 miles a year just to keep his business running in every part of the world. He also used to provide essay help. He became the CEO in very tough times of Nissan and Renault, but his policies and leadership skills make these two companies best in the business. 5.  The William Sisters: Serena William and Venus William are the two biggest name on the tennis circuit. Both of these sisters have 28 grand slam championships between them, and more are yet to come. Both of them are true princess of tennis court whether it is clay, synthetic or grass. From very young age, both of these sisters worked hard to become what they are now. They used to get up at six o clock every morning and do practice. Then they go to school and do practice again after coming back from it. Their third sister Isha describes them the crazy workaholic girls who don’t sit for a minute. 6.  Dallas Maverick’s Mark Cuban: People summarize the life of Mark Cuban as the guy of golden luck. Mark sold his first company at his peak and entered into technology industry exactly at the time when the stock goes rocket high. But the intellectuals believe that this is not the luck but the right decision at the right time. The ability to take such decisions comes from his relentless work. His colleagues say that he didn’t take a vacation for seven straight years while starting his business. This billionaire still stayed up after midnight and read about the new developments in his field. 7.  Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg: Sheryl is one of the most influencing women in the business. Being a COO of world’s biggest enterprise, Sheryl Sandberg is famous for leaving office at 5:30 to have dinner with her kids and then get back online after their kid’s bed time. She is the women who start working at 7:00 a.m. She also complains that the work has made her a very bad mother. 8.  WWE’s Vince McMahon: Maybe one of the most person from the list due to his world wrestling entertainment. Vince whole life is dedicated to his company and that is why WWE is one of the most popular entertainment sport in the world. His former creative partner used to say that no matter what, he cannot come to the office before Vince and can go after him. Mark Henry the famous WWE wrestler also says that Vince’s life has only one purpose and it is to explore new heights of success for WWE. His dedication can be observed through his body. At the age of 70, he is still fitter and in shape than the boy’s age of 25.

Apple is implementing the new policy, allowing its repair staff to ship an iPad Air 2 for a unit replacement when stock of the aging and now discontinued 4th gen iPad isn’t available. An internal memo obtained by 9to5Mac reads: The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac Starting March 30th, iPad 4th generation whole unit repairs may be substituted to iPad Air 2. Apple’s memo also notes for staff to inform customers of the replacement unit’s color and capacity. The iPad Air 2 introduced a new gold color option, and most recently only had 32GB and 128GB storage options while 16GB and 64GB models were discontinued earlier. For that reason, users may receive a slight upgrade in storage when getting a replacement in addition to the device’s newer and more powerful internals overall. While the iPad Air 2, introduced in October 2014 is also now discontinued, Apple will continue offering the device as a replacement as its supplies of the older, but still supported 4th gen iPad run out. Apple last month discontinued the iPad Air 2, replacing it with the new $329 iPad. Apple typically supports products for at least 5 years following discontinuation, meaning users of the 4th gen iPad can continue to get repairs and support from Apple stores and authorized service providers. The current iteration of the 4th gen iPad was discontinued in October 2014 to make room for the iPad Air 2. Many Apple Stores and service providers don’t perform repairs on iPads, in which case a replacement is often the solution to many repair situations. Whether or not you get an upgrade to an iPad Air 2 will depend on stock in your region.

The Clamshell saw just one speed bump, and was replaced in less than two years. The second-generation iBook introduced the form factor most people think of when they think of the notebook: Everything's New But the Name Introduced at Town Hall in 2001, the updated iBook G3 was a huge departure from the curvy, rubber-injected notebook it replaced. The official name of this iBook G3 is the "iBook (Dual USB)." As the name implies, this model put its new flat sides to great use, packing Ethernet, a Modem, 2 USB ports, Firewire 400, VGA and audio-out ports along the left-hand side. On the opposite side, the tray-loading optical drive sat flush with the case, without any of the awkward visual lines found on the Clamshell. The new notebook was smaller in every dimension, and weighed a full two pounds less than its curvy ancestor. Apple claimed 5 hours of battery life, and like the Clamshell, this notebook could be outfitted with an AirPort card. Gone were the colors of the past; this iBook was all white and silver. This machine picked up the nickname "Icebook" because of its case construction. While later iBooks would be made of white plastic, the outer shell of this machine was actually transparent, with white paint applied to the inside of the shell. This gave it a sheen that still looks good today, in my opinion.1 The notebook came with a 500 MHz G3 processor, and could be optionally specced with a CD-burning, DVD-playing Combo drive for $1799. Every six months or so, Apple bumped the specs of the machine to support faster G3 chips and (eventually) more RAM. This iBook shipped with a 12-inch, 1024 x 768 display, which Jobs touted as a huge improvement to the Clamshell's 800 x 600 resolution. He pointed out that Mac OS X really benefitted from the extra pixels, and he was right; OS X felt cramped and crowded on the older models. Jobs claimed that it was the first consumer notebook with this resolution of display. iBook in the Classroom In his 2001 keynote, Jobs preached the value of wireless notebooks in the classroom. Instead of having a computer lab, he advocated a mobile-first approach using laptop carts that could travel to the students. At the time, Apple was leading the pack in terms of education customers, and he believed the iBook was going to allow Apple to stretch out its lead. The event wrapped with a conversation with the superintendent of the Henrico Country School District, which had ordered 23,000 of the new notebooks. Two More Inches In October 2001, Apple announced a 14-inch variant. Packing the same 1024 x 768 resolution but in a larger panel, the picture wasn't as good on this model, but if the number of 14-inch models I saw out in the world was any indication, most consumers didn't mind. It clocked in at 5.9 pounds. After the 14-inch model came out, Apple revved the line several more times, this time increasing the notebook's GPU as well as CPU. Eventually, it started booting into OS X by default and climbing all the way to a 900 MHz G3.2 iBook G4 In October 2003, the iBook was upgraded to use a G4 processor. The G4 retained both the 12 and 14-inch sized options in slightly updated cases. This machine broke the 1 GHz barrier for the first time in a consumer notebook from Apple, while claiming an extra hour of battery life over the G3. The system also brought USB 2.0, Bluetooth support and 802.11g support via an optional AirPort Extreme card. The Early 2004 revisions brought twice the built-in RAM and an option for the DVD-burning SuperDrive, but otherwise was a speedbump to the proven recipe. The iBook G4 saw two more revisions, the last coming in June 2005. Later models can run OS X Panther, Tiger or even Leopard. Farewell, Old Friend With 2006's Intel transition, the iBook met its end. The 13.3-inch MacBook replaced both sizes of iBook with an all-new design and articheture. In fact, the 12-inch screen size was absent from the product line until the MacBook with Retina display showed up in 2015.3 This design had one critical flaw: the keyboards smell like body odor. I wish I was kidding, but I'm not. ↩︎ These late iBook G3s have some of the most descriptive AppleCare names I've ever seen. The last two models were named "iBook (800/900 Mhz 32 VRAM)" and "iBook (14.1 LCD 900 MHz 32 VRAM.)" What a mouthful. ↩︎ The 14-inch screen size has not been resurrected to date. ↩︎ Tags: Apple history, iBook, mac Sign Up Unlock MacStories Extras Club MacStories offers exclusive access to extra MacStories content, delivered every week; it’s also a way to support us directly.

The permit allows it to conduct test drives in three vehicles with six drivers, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said on Friday. The vehicles are all 2015 Lexus RX450h, according to the DMV. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts in recent years, and the permit pulls the curtain back a bit on any possible plan. "This does confirm what’s long been rumoured: that Apple is at least toying with the idea of getting into the autonomous game in some capacity," said Chris Theodore, president of consultancy Theodore & Associates, and a former Vice President at Ford Motor Company and Chrysler. The permit does not necessarily mean Apple is building a car. "This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumoured, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology," Mr Theodore said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement when the company submitted its comments to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration late last year. After a five-page letter last November from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to NHTSA, the company was under increased speculation that they would enter into the competitive self-driving space. "The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation," Mr Kenner wrote. At that time Apple said it had provided comments to NHTSA "because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems. There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry." Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California - all vying to be the first to have commercially viable vehicles on the roads. Companies that have been issued permits also include Alphabet’s Google unit, Ford Motor Company, Volkswagen, Daimler, Tesla Motors and General Motors. Many companies have said the first cars will launch in 2020 but some experts believe it may take much longer due to regulatory challenges. * Reuters business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Technology Dubai financial services bureau EastNets denies claims of hacking Apple receives permit in California to test self-driving cars United Airlines succeeds in unifying online outrage Apple store to open in The Dubai Mall on April 27 MOST VIEWED Business | All Abu Dhabi residential sale prices drop in the first quarter SME profile: Former Dubai banker’s residency-for-investment consultancy generates growing interest A tale of two villas, and a headache, on Abu Dhabi’s Nurai Island The second-richest Arab in the world is an Emirati Financial illiteracy is something to work on Two dream Abu Dhabi villas on Nurai Island to tempt the wealthy – in pictures Dubai financial services bureau EastNets denies claims of hacking UAE company has trouble with salary payments to employees in other countries Is passive investment the next bubble?

The iPhone maker this week was the subject of countless reports and rumors, including one that says Apple has received approval to test self-driving car technology in California, suggesting the company is still moving forward with its secretive car project. Meanwhile, Apple was the subject of a new survey this week that found the company is wildly popular among teenagers, and it's inked a deal to bring iPads and Macs to the NHL. This is Fortune’s weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news this week. To see last week’s roundup, click here. But it wasn't all good news for Apple (aapl). Some MacBook Pro owners reported an odd noise with their computers and Samsung was able to wrest control over the smartphone market once again. An NYU graduate student's who spent summer last year in an iPhone factory also shed some light on what it might really be like to produce an iPhone. Read on for all that and more in this week's Fortune Apple news roundup: Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter The California Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed on Friday that Apple has received a permit to test self-driving cars in California. The permit suggests that Apple is indeed working on self-driving car technology, confirming a slew of rumors on the topic. Still, Apple hasn't commented on its plans and it's possible the company won't take advantage of its newly awarded permit. Samsung in the first quarter supplanted Apple as the world's most popular smartphone maker. The Korea-based conglomerate captured 26.1% market share worldwide, topping Apple's 16.9% share. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Apple stood atop the market with 20.3% share. Samsung at the time could only muster 18.5% market share. Apple has reportedly hired a team of biomedical engineers to treat diabetes, a report said this week. Details on the technology are slim, but a CNBC report said the team is working in Palo Alto, Calif. and it was initially the brainchild of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. It's unknown when, or even if, the diabetes treatment will be released. Qualcomm this week fired back at Apple in response to the iPhone maker's lawsuit earlier this year. Apple previously sued Qualcomm, alleging that the chipmaker abused its dominant position in the industry and forced phone makers, including Apple, to pay exorbitant royalties. Qualcomm responded this week, saying that its royalties are fair and denied that it's hurt competition in the chip industry. Apple signed a deal with the National Hockey League to deliver iPads and Macs to teams playing in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Each team has three iPad Pros that will let them evaluate players, find holes in the opponent's lineup, and more. The NHL plans to roll out iPad Pros to the entire league next season. MacBook Pro owners took to Apple forums this week to complain of a "popping sound" coming from their devices. The users report that the MacBook Pro at seemingly random times will make a sound like someone squeezing a plastic bottle. Some users said that they also heard the sound when the MacBook Pro was working hard on a resource-intensive task. The users, who all own the MacBook Pro Apple released in the fall, reported calling Apple support and were given different methods for addressing the problem. Apple has not publicly commented on the reports and it's unknown how widespread the problem is. All users who report the popping sound can still use their machines without trouble. Apple's iPhone is dominant among teenagers, according to a Piper Jaffray Taking Stock With Teens survey. The research firm, which surveyed more than 5,500 kids, said that 76% of U.S. teenagers have an iPhone, up from 74% in the fall. More than 8 in 10 teens say they plan to buy an iPhone in the coming years. Apple Watch is also the most popular smartwatch among teenagers.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File 2013)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Apple recently announced some minor upgrades to its Mac Pro desktop computer, which it says will be followed by a major overhaul of its high-end Mac. It's been four years since Apple announced any sort of update for the computer, leading some to worry that the company -- which famously worked to usher in a "post-PC" era -- was letting mobile overshadow the humble desktop. But as Apple's announcement proves, we may not see desktops die completely, even in an era when mobile devices are our most-used gadgets. What may happen, however, is that desktop computers take on a new form. Judging by what companies have been trying lately to keep excitement alive in desktops, consumers may see the companies shift from affordable computers that can work in every home to higher-end, more specialized machines. There's no denying desktops have been on the decline. Sales growth for computers, particularly desktops, has been sliding since 2012, according to consulting firm IDC. A recent study showed that Android overtook Windows as the world's most-used operating system overall. A similar thing happened with Apple in 2012 when its mobile operating system, iOS, was logged as getting more usage than Apple's desktop operating system as consumers turned more to their iPhones, iPads and iPods. Basically, desktops have seen their main functions eroded by an army of new devices. Need a big keyboard on which to type? There's a cheap laptop, or a Bluetooth keyboard, for that. Want to stream an online movie? You can do that straight from your TV. But the truth is that we may never go truly "post-PC" -- or post-Mac, as the flurry of breathless articles over Apple's plans for the Mac Pro indicated. There's always going to be things for which we need a computer. In fact, Deloitte last year claimed in a study that even the youngest of millennials, those ages 18 to 24, are still relying on desktops and laptops a lot for specific tasks, including shopping, banking, watching video and creating text and image files. On top of that, companies are working to create desktops that fit into a world where mobile devices are increasingly doing most of the heavy lifting. For Apple, part of the solution seems to be making the Mac Pro more customizable, and therefore more flexible when it comes to fitting people's needs. It's also more closely marrying the mobile and desktop experiences. Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, said that the company is working on making the iPad Pro work better with the desktop as a way to convince people that they still need both devices. Microsoft appears to be dealing with PC shifts by taking the best of mobile technology and bringing it to the desktop, often in big, beautiful fashion. The Surface Studio, a 28-inch touch screen desktop computer that's also $3,000, lets you use a stylus as well as a dial that Microsoft designed just for this touch screen. Samsung is trying to make your desk completely mobile-based. The company this month showed off a desktop mode for its upcoming Galaxy S8 phones, which lets you plug your phone into a $150 dock and use it with a monitor, keyboard and mouse for a more desktop-like experience. It's the kind of product that, in theory, that could kill the desktop as a widespread device. But it will take some time for mobile solutions like this to take off because they're still a little bit rough around the edges, said Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa. "The reality of putting your small device onto your large screen is that you have to adjust screen size and applications to fit. Those little subtle changes are hectic, and it's not realistic to use them," she said. So, judging by how the desktop market has evolved over the past several years -- and where it's headed -- the upshot seems to be that you'll probably be spending more for a desktop, but possibly using it for fewer things. Kitagawa said that, in her opinion, desktops will settle at around the $800-$1,000 range for consumers who don't want the high-end machines that you'd see in a professional setting, but want the power for gaming, video and photo editing or other hobbies. "That's going to be the sweet spot," she said.

 Apple has a new iPhone menu that makes it way easier to manage your iCloud account Kif Leswing Apr. 15, 2017, 8:30 AM 12,529 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hollis Johnson/Business Insider In the latest major software update for iPhones and iPads, iOS 10.3, Apple made it way easier to manage your iCloud account from your iPhone. Apple took various important settings — like account security, passwords, credit cards, and photo — and put them in a single, easy-to-access menu atop the Settings app. All of these options were available before, but they were scattered around the iPhone's settings. Checking out the new menu is a good opportunity to make sure everything about your iCloud account is correct and locked down.  Here's how to find the new menu. It's in the Settings app:  BI It doesn't look like a button, but you can still tap on it. It'll bring you to this menu: BI The line item "Name, Phone Numbers, Email" has your basic iCloud information, including where Apple can contact you. If you don't want to receive any promotional emails from Apple, that's where you can find how to turn them off.  "Password & Security" lets you turn on two-factor authentication. If you're worried about security, you probably should turn that on or change your password.  "Payment & Shipping" is where you can change the credit card Apple has on file.  The button below those three options, iCloud, lets you turn off which apps are using iCloud storage, as well as quickly see how much storage space you have left:  BI "iTunes & App Store" is where you can turn off automatic downloads, and you should find a list of Apple products linked to your Apple ID.  SEE ALSO: Here's how to access the iPhone's hidden mode that turns the camera into a magnifying glass More: Apple Tips Tips and tricks facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Apple has a new iPhone menu that makes it way easier to manage your iCloud account Apple has a new iPhone menu that makes it way easier to manage your iCloud account In the latest major software update for iPhones...

Making the doom spiral: Some exaggeration necessary Video Hands-on with Apple's new video-editing app, Clips It is time once again for another very exciting episode of Dissing A Smartphone That Doesn’t Exist Yet! Or, in the Apple world, just another regular day. Writing for the UK’s Express, Aaron Brown says “If the iPhone 8 looks like THIS, Apple has made a terrible mistake.” (Tip o’ the antlers to @JonyIveParody.) OK, sure, you probably can’t expect much from a publication that also runs a headline for one of their videos that says “Kelly Brook exposes SERIOUS cleavage as she dresses as very buxom Easter Bunny.” Since “SERIOUS” is the word they chose to put in all caps the Macalope assumes her cleavage discusses how portfolio diversification leads to better financial stability. AS THE iPhone 8 release date looms large on the horizon… It does not just loom, it looms LARGE. The quilt that will come from this loom will be HUGE. …technical schematics of the next Apple smartphone have supposedly been published online. LET THE CONCLUSION JUMPING BEGIN! And it's not good news for Apple fans. This thing we don’t know if it’s the real thing or not? It’s terrible “news”. (Disclosure: Actual news not included. Box may contain 99 percent filler by volume.) The technical schematics of the hotly-anticipated iPhone 8 have supposedly leaked online. This really could not get more definitive without actual things happening. If the leaked drawings are accurate, the next flagship iPhone looks a bit … well, ugly. If not, well, then we’ve wasted a lot of your time and we’re terribly sorry. Please watch a boob video. …worst of all, it appears Apple will relocate the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the rear of the phone. THIS IS HORRIBLE BECAUSE IT’S NOT WHERE IT IS NOW. It might be a little too early to judge… Oh, you think maybe these rough schematics and renderings might be off slightly? Huh. Well, that’s a real neck-jerker coming in paragraph 13. Fortunately, there is hope. The hope? This may not be the actual schematics. You don’t say. Until about three-quarters of the way through the article, you don’t. This is not the first time supposed pictures of an upcoming Apple device have hit the Internet and people have said the device looks ugly. What always ends up happening is either the images are wrong or the device looks a lot better in real life. So… sound? Check. Fury? Check. Signifying nothing? Check.

Reuters/Toru Hanai Apple has been reportedly considering a bid in Toshiba's chip business. It was reported that the technology giant would invest at least several billion dollars that would take 20 percent of the Japanese company's share. Western Digital and Broadcom were also reported to bid on the chip business. However, the US technology giant was still considering to team up with Foxconn for a joint bid. Apple's entry into the auction could improve the chip business after it lost billions of dollars. The Tokyo-based company needed to raise money from the semiconductor sale to fix its balance sheet. The possible full control of Foxconn to the chips unit may not happen as Toshiba was cautious that Japanese and U.S. Governments would object. The deal could benefit Apple as it would open the opportunity for the company to take more control over its entire supply chain. The company has been dependent on a few major manufacturers for key components of its devices including processors for iPhone produced by Samsung. Toshiba manufactures chips for smartphones, personal computers and data centers that could secure the U.S.-based technology giant's supplies for its future products. Toshiba's bankruptcy Toshiba's Westinghouse unit was behind a 716.6 billion yen (AU$6.5 billion) impairment and it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring. However, on Tuesday, the company took an unusual step as it reported its third quarter earning without approval from its auditors. The company reported that its lost in 2016 left the company with negative shareholders equity of 225.6 billion yen (AU$2.07 billion)at the end of December. It has been at odds with PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata over accounting at Westinghouse. The billions of dollars lost came from the cost overruns on nuclear construction projects. The move of the company has jeopardized its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). The company was already in the TSE's list of securities on alert in its the stock exchange's announcement in December. The company could be delisted if the plans to improve internal controls deemed insufficient. On Friday, the company's shares fell as much as 8.1 percent in Tokyo but pared losses after NHK reported Apple's plan. Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan warned that a sale may violate a joint venture it has with Toshiba. On April 9, he wrote to the Tokyo-based company's board advising them that they should negotiate exclusively with his company before any sale. A source said that Milligan included in his letter that the proposed offers should be more than the fair and supportable value of the chip business.

Subscriptions Home News National and World Apple said to near road tests of self-driving car software Story Comments Print Create a hardcopy of this page Font Size: Default font size Larger font size Posted: Saturday, April 15, 2017 6:00 am Apple said to near road tests of self-driving car software By Mark Gurman The Washington Post SentinelSource.com Apple will soon take its self-driving car software platform to public streets for the first time, a major step that gets the world’s largest technology company into a crowded race to transform transportation. The company was granted approval by the California Department of Motor Vehicles to test autonomous driving technology on public roads, according to a notice on the DMV’s website on Friday. This is the first time Apple has received approval to test its technology on public streets. Apple will soon begin testing self-driving car software with existing vehicles, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company started developing a self-driving car to take on Google and Tesla a few years ago before it pulled back and focused on first developing underlying autonomous technology last year, Bloomberg News has reported. The tests are the clearest, public sign yet that Apple is serious about a nascent field that could, in time, transform mobility and upend the auto industry. A quarter of all miles driven in the U.S. may happen in shared, self-driving electric cars by the end of the next decade, Boston Consulting Group said this month. Apple wants a piece of this action, but it’s got a lot of competition: 29 other companies have autonomous vehicle testing permits in California. Subject to standard regulations for testing autonomous technology on public roads, Apple’s test cars will have a person behind the wheel to monitor the testing, the person said. The California permit covers three 2015 Lexus RX540h SUVs, and six drivers, the DMV said. Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo and Uber Technologies Inc.’s self-driving test cars also have people behind the wheel during tests. An Apple spokesman declined to comment beyond a statement issued in December when Apple filed paperwork with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regarding safety practices for self-driving cars. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” Apple said at the time. The DMV’s website was updated Friday to acknowledge Apple becoming a permit holder. A March 30 copy of the website does not list Apple as having approval, indicating it was granted within the last two weeks. The permit requires companies to disclose traffic incidents related to their testing within 10 business days of the event. Apple’s self-driving technology is being developed in secret company offices in Sunnyvale, California, a short drive from its main Cupertino campus, Bloomberg News has reported. The company also has a team in Canada working on a car operating system that would power the platform, people familiar with the matter have said. The self-driving car platform is designed so that Apple could choose to open it up to existing carmakers or eventually port it to an Apple-designed vehicle. Apple began to focus more on the self-driving technology last year after re-hiring former hardware executive Bob Mansfield to lead the project. Apple aims to decide on the final direction of the platform by fall of this year, Bloomberg News has reported. Discuss Print Posted in National and World, News on Saturday, April 15, 2017 6:00 am.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 April 2017 by Military News After The Death of &quot;i&quot; Branding, Will Apple Ditch the iTunes Brand Next? Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) began transitioning away from its iconic „i” branding several years ago, instead moving toward „Apple <product or service>” branding. The reasons were pretty clear. Since Apple can’t trademark a single letter, countless others have attempted to piggyback on the „i” nomenclature with their own „i” devices, products, services, and even entire companies (like iHome). Over the years, what we saw was a relentless dilution of the „i” naming convention that increasingly had less and less to do with Apple. The long-term branding solution was to start branding things with „Apple.” Think of Apple Music (instead of iMusic), Apple Pay (instead of iPay), or perhaps most notable, Apple Watch (instead of iWatch). At this point, Apple hasn’t introduced an „i” product or service in years. Existing products like iPhone or iPad will certainly remain, but there’s very little chance that Apple will introduce another new iAnything ever again. iTunes does just about everything now, for better or for worse. Image source: Apple. Is iTunes next? The iTunes brand stopped making sense long ago, at least if the brand is expected to describe the service. iTunes expanded beyond just music over a decade ago, and now includes a wide range of content categories such as movies, TV shows, apps, and even ringtones (does anyone still even pay for ringtones?). It’s not just „tunes” anymore, and it hasn’t been that way for a long time. As such, the iTunes brand has been declining in appropriateness for an eternity. It became a strong brand as the first mainstream digital storefront for music, which is probably why Apple has stuck with it for so long. As a function of iTunes’ expansion, it’s no longer just a music-playing app either. It has an integrated storefront for all types of media, and will play any of that media (other than apps). There are now signs that Apple wants to move away from the iTunes brand, starting with a subset of the content: podcasts. The company has now rebranded its first-party podcasts app as „Apple Podcasts,” according to 9to5Mac . While there are some other ideas as to what this could potentially signal, like a possible podcasting subscription service, it could also mark the first indication that Apple will rebrand its digital content repository. The challenge then is: What would Apple rename it? If Apple were to rebrand iTunes altogether — which is still a pretty big „if” currently — there aren’t a whole lot of obvious or compelling alternatives. Apple Music already refers to the streaming service and doesn’t encompass the other content categories. „Apple Content” is horrendously boring and doesn’t appeal to anyone, and „Apple Media” is barely any better. „Apple Play” wouldn’t work because Apple’s dominant mobile platform rival has already used „Play” for its own storefront. Apple Store usually refers to the retail locations. If you have any better suggestions, I imagine Cook & Co. are open to ideas right about now. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

International | 15 April 2017 Hayley Tsukayama Washington - Apple this week announced some minor upgrades to its Mac Pro desktop computer, which it says will be followed by a major overhaul of its high-end Mac. It's been four years since Apple announced any sort of update for the computer, leading some to worry that the company - which famously worked to usher in a "post-PC" era - was letting mobile overshadow the humble desktop. Share this story Picture: Karen Bleier, AFP But as Apple's announcement proves, we may not see desktops die completely, even in an era when mobile devices are our most-used gadgets. What may happen, however, is that desktop computers take on a new form? Judging by what companies have been trying lately to keep excitement alive in desktops, consumers may see the companies shift from affordable computers that can work in every home to higher-end, more specialised machines. There's no denying desktops have been on the decline. Sales growth for computers, particularly desktops, has been sliding since 2012, according to consulting firm IDC. A recent study showed that Android overtook Windows as the world's most-used operating system overall. A similar thing happened with Apple in 2012 when its mobile operating system, iOS, was logged as getting more usage than Apple's desktop operating system as consumers turned more to their iPhones, iPads and iPods. Basically, desktops have seen their main functions eroded by an army of new devices. Need a big keyboard on which to type? There's a cheap laptop, or a Bluetooth keyboard for that. Want to stream an online movie? You can do that straight from your TV. But the truth is that we may never go truly "post-PC" - or post-Mac, as the flurry of breathless articles over Apple's plans for the Mac Pro indicated. Read also: How virtual reality can make you more productive There's always going to be things for which we need a computer. In fact, Deloitte last year claimed in a study that even the youngest of millennials, those ages 18 to 24, are still relying on desktops and laptops a lot for specific tasks, including shopping, banking, watching video and creating text and image files. On top of that, companies are working to create desktops that fit into a world where mobile devices are increasingly doing most of the heavy lifting. For Apple, part of the solution seems to be making the Mac Pro more customisable and therefore more flexible when it comes to fitting people's needs. It's also more closely marrying the mobile and desktop experiences. Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, said that the company is working on making the iPad Pro work better with the desktop as a way to convince people that they still need both devices. Best of mobile technology Microsoft appears to be dealing with PC shifts by taking the best of mobile technology and bringing it to the desktop, often in big, beautiful fashion. The Surface Studio, a 28-inch touch screen desktop computer that's also $3,000, lets you use a stylus as well as a dial that Microsoft designed just for this touch screen. Samsung is trying to make your desk completely mobile-based. The company this month showed off a desktop mode for its upcoming Galaxy S8 phones, which lets you plug your phone into a $150 dock and use it with a monitor, keyboard and mouse for a more desktop-like experience. It's the kind of product that, in theory, that could kill the desktop as a widespread device. But it will take some time for mobile solutions like this to take off because they're still a little bit rough around the edges, said Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa. "The reality of putting your small device onto your large screen is that you have to adjust screen size and applications to fit. Those little subtle changes are hectic, and it's not realistic to use them," she said. So, judging by how the desktop market has evolved over the past several years - and where it's headed - the upshot seems to be that you'll probably be spending more for a desktop, but possibly using it for fewer things. Kitagawa said that, in her opinion, desktops will settle at around the $800, $1 000 range for consumers who don't want the high-end machines that you'd see in a professional setting, but want the power for gaming, video and photo editing or other hobbies. "That's going to be the sweet spot," she said.  WASHINGTON POST Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 'Former Model C schools are anti-ANC' 2 Accomplices to financial murder 3 Zuma turns to clergy for prayer 4 Chiefs joint top with City after Lebese strike 5 Wife learns of affair after husband dies in crash with lover Advertisement X BUSINESS REPORT About us Contact us Feedback Follow us on INSIDE BUSINESS REPORT Companies Economy Energy Markets Entrepreneurs Technology Careers International Opinion Financial tools EXPLORE IOL News Politics Business Report Personal Finance Sport Entertainment Lifestyle Motoring Travel BUSINESS REPORT WEEKLY Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

PHOTO: REUTERS TOKYO: Tech giant Apple is considering backing Hon Hai’s multi-billion dollar bid for Toshiba’s lucrative memory chip business, a report said Saturday. The US firm plans to financially support Taiwan’s Hon Hai, which has reportedly bid some 3 trillion yen ($27.6 billion) in the initial tendering round for the memory chip business, the Mainichi Shimbun said. Apple hires secret team for treating diabetes: CNBC Apple, which uses Toshiba’s memory chips for its iPhone, hopes to secure stable supplies of the key parts by supporting Hon Hai’s bid, the daily said. Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, is separately asking SoftBank to join the team, the daily said. The Japanese telecom company may help Hon Hai negotiate with local banks currently supporting Toshiba, it said. Immediate confirmation of the report was not available. Among other bidders are Google and Amazon as well as US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom, news reports have said, quoting unnamed sources. Is Apple working on some sort of vaporiser? Local media said any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba’s memory chips. Toshiba is the world’s number two supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea’s Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67 trillion yen in revenue last fiscal year. But it plans to sell off the chip business, seen as crucial for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around, after suffering huge cost overruns and construction delays at its US nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection late March. On Tuesday, Toshiba reported an unaudited loss of $4.9 billion in long-overdue financial results for the nine months to December 2016. In announcing the earnings, Toshiba also warned of the likelihood of a worsening financial situation and said its survival was at risk.

Apple escaped through a fence and fell into a muddy swamp. LFB A pregnant horse had to be rescued by firefighters after it got stuck in a swamp in east London. Officers from the London Fire Brigade said specialist rescue crews were called to Jenkins Lane, close to Aldfreds Way (A13), after a horse, named Apple, escaped through a fence and fell into a muddy swamp. It was a difficult job for crews. Apple was stuck in the water and mud with, at times, just her head above it. Due to the location she was in, it was difficult for crews to reach her so we had to use strops, mud paths and our physical strength to pull her out as you couldn’t have got any machinery down to where Apple was. Watch manager Emma Carr, from Bethnal Green fire station Apple's owner had tried to remove the horse from the ditch for more than three hours before calling the Brigade for assistance. Apple escaped through a fence and fell into a muddy swamp. LFB Apple, who is approximately five months pregnant, was sedated by vets to prevent her from becoming even more distressed while crews worked to free her. Apple escaped through a fence and fell into a muddy swamp. LFB Emma added: "If you notice an animal in distress, the first thing to do should be to call the RSPCA if you see an animal in difficulty. If assistance from firefighters is required, the RSPCA will call us. "However in this instance, Apple's owner was right to call the Brigade for our assistance to help release her from the swamp." The Brigade was called at midnight and the incident was over for firefighters at 3am. Crews from Bethnal Green, East Ham and Lewisham fire stations attended the scene.

(Photo: VNA) Hanoi (VNA) - A number of mobile stores in Hanoi began removing Apple’s “half-eaten apple” logo from their shop banners following the US tech company’s request sent to Vietnamese mobile traders recently. A manager of a mobile store on Thai Ha Street, Hanoi told Viet Nam News that even though signs with the logo were attractive, they would change and remove the logo as it belonged to Apple and was protected. A store owner on Xa Dan Street also said that his store respected the rights of Apple. “Even though the logo makes it easy for buyers to recognise that our store is selling Apple products, we will repair our shop banners soon because it is the trademark of Apple.” However, he said that there would be other ways to make buyers realise the store sold Apple products such as writing “iPhone” or “iPad” in Vietnamese like “ai phon”, “ai pat” or using photos. Apple Inc’s legal representative in Vietnam, VOTRA Co Ltd, recently sent documents to Vietnamese phone stores on their illegal use of the brand’s trademark without Apple’s permission. The Apple legal representatives mentioned stores using the “half-eaten apple” logo, trademarks “Apple”, “iPhone” or other names such as “Apple Store”, “App Store”, “iPad”, “iPod” and “MacBook”, which are protected in Vietnam. The Vietnamese representative of the US technology company requested the stores stop using Apple’s trademark within seven days of receiving the letter. VOTRA also asked the stores to stop selling fake products under the Apple brand name. Apple has increased its presence in Vietnam since the end of 2015 when it opened an office in HCM City. In 2016, Apple hired VOTRA as its legal representative. Nguyen Ngoc Duy My from attorney office TriLaw in HCM City told news website ndh.vn that under Article 123 of Vietnam’s Law on Intellectual Property 2005, trademark owners had the right to use, allow or prevent others from using their trademark. "Because of these rights, if Apple does not give written permission to allow others (in this case Vietnamese stores) to use its trademark, these stores do not have the right to use them,” said My. My also noted that just because a store sold Apple products did not mean they could use Apple’s trademark without written consent. In term of fines, the lawyer said shops could be fined from 500,000 VND (22 USD) to 250 million VND (11,000 USD) depending on the level of their violation, business scale and commodity value. Violators could also receive other punishments such as business suspension from one to three months, material confiscation, or be forced to destroy the infringing goods, she added. -VNA Related News Apple to invest in Vietnam for the first time: media Apple’s latest dual handsets report record sales in HCM City mobile stores Apple logo Your comments about this article ...

Apple will soon take its self-driving car software platform to public streets for the first time, a major step that gets the world’s largest technology company into a crowded race to transform transportation. The company was granted approval by the California Department of Motor Vehicles to test autonomous driving technology on public roads, according to a notice on the DMV’s website on Friday. This is the first time Apple has received approval to test its technology on public streets. Apple will soon begin testing self-driving car software with existing vehicles, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company started developing a self-driving car to take on Google and Tesla a few years ago before it pulled back and focused on first developing underlying autonomous technology last year, Bloomberg News has reported. The tests are the clearest public sign yet that Apple is serious about a nascent field that could, in time, transform mobility and upend the auto industry. A quarter of all miles driven in the U.S. may happen in shared, self-driving electric cars by the end of the next decade, Boston Consulting Group said this month. Apple wants a piece of this action, but it’s got a lot of competition: 29 other companies have autonomous vehicle testing permits in California. Subject to standard regulations for testing autonomous technology on public roads, Apple’s test cars will have a person behind the wheel to monitor the testing. The California permit covers three 2015 Lexus RX540h SUVs and six drivers, the DMV said. Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo and Uber Technologies Inc.’s self-driving test cars also have people behind the wheel during tests. An Apple spokesman declined to comment beyond a statement issued in December when Apple filed paperwork with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regarding safety practices for self-driving cars. "There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry," Apple said at the time. The DMV’s website was updated Friday to acknowledge Apple becoming a permit holder. A March 30 copy of the website does not list Apple as having approval, indicating it was granted within the past two weeks. The permit requires companies to disclose traffic incidents related to their testing within 10 business days of the event. Apple’s self-driving technology is being developed in secret company offices in Sunnyvale, Calif., a short drive from its main Cupertino campus, Bloomberg News has reported. The company also has a team in Canada working on a car-operating system that would power the platform, people familiar with the matter have said. The self-driving car platform is designed so that Apple could choose to open it up to existing carmakers or eventually port it to an Apple-designed vehicle. Apple began to focus more on the self-driving technology last year after re-hiring former hardware executive Bob Mansfield to lead the project. Apple aims to decide on the final direction of the platform by fall of this year, Bloomberg News has reported. — Bloomberg News Advertisement Advertise With Us Report Error Submit a Tip RefundRefund History Updated on Saturday, April 15, 2017 at 8:34 AM CDT: Photo added.

Apple gets green light to test self-driving cars Technology Saturday 15 April 2017 - 10:26am File: Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during a product launch event at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California on October 27, 2016. Photo: Josh Edelson / AFP SAN FRANCISCO - Apple has joined the list of companies with permits to test self-driving cars in California, according to an updated roster released on Friday by state officials. The iPhone maker has disclosed little about its ambitions when it comes to self-driving vehicles, with chief Tim Cook hinting at plans but the company declining to comment for news reports on long-idling rumours. Late last year Apple revealed -- in a letter asking the government to make it easier to develop self-driving cars -- that it was investing heavily in autonomous vehicles. Apple issued the letter because it was "investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems", an Apple spokesman said in an email to AFP at the time. The California-based tech giant is expected to focus on software systems, letting partners manufacture vehicles, but would understandably want to be able to test its navigation technology in cars. READ: California shuts down Uber's self-driving cars Most major auto manufacturers and many technology groups are developing autonomous vehicles, considered to be the future of the automobile, along with electric power, with first production models promised for about 2020. General Motors this week announced that its autonomous driving efforts, investing $14-million and adding 1,100 jobs in a new research centre in San Francisco. While GM is already testing autonomous vehicles through its Cruise Automation unit in California, Arizona and Michigan, the new initiative will ramp up those efforts. Similar research is being carried out by other vehicle manufacturers, including Ford, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, and by other groups including Uber and Google parent Alphabet. Continental this week opened a new research centre in the heart of Silicon Valley, saying it was dedicated to "mobility innovations and technologies". Chinese tech giant Baidu, which is working on autonomous driving at its California research centre, this week announced the acquisition of xPerception, a US startup that provides visual perception software, along with services and devices for people who are visually impaired.

The US firm plans to financially support Taiwan’s Hon Hai, which has reportedly bid some 3 trillion yen (RM1.2 billion) in the initial tendering round for the memory chip business, the Mainichi Shimbun said. Apple, which uses Toshiba’s memory chips for its iPhone, hopes to secure stable supplies of the key parts by supporting Hon Hai’s bid, the daily said. Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, is separately asking SoftBank to join the team, the daily said. The Japanese telecom company may help Hon Hai negotiate with local banks currently supporting Toshiba, it said. Immediate confirmation of the report was not available. Among other bidders are Google and Amazon as well as US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom, news reports have said, quoting unnamed sources. Local media said any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba’s memory chips. Toshiba is the world’s number two supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea’s Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67 trillion yen in revenue last fiscal year. But it plans to sell off the chip business, seen as crucial for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around, after suffering huge cost overruns and construction delays at its US nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection late March. On Tuesday, Toshiba reported an unaudited loss of US$4.9 billion (RM21.6 billion) in long-overdue financial results for the nine months to December 2016. In announcing the earnings, Toshiba also warned of the likelihood of a worsening financial situation and said its survival was at risk. ― AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Trump pick for Export-Import Bank is critical of its mission Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Bursa Malaysia to consolidate next week Mercosur to sign trade deal with EU this year, Argentina says Ringgit expected to climb against US dollar Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Village Grocer buys up Ben’s Independent Grocer Petronas pitches RM4.4b offshore gas project stake to oil firms, sources say Demand for Malaysian palm oil set to rebound, says Council United Airlines CEO won’t resign Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Greek Orthodox Patriarch leads Holy Fire ceremony in Jerusalem Reuters Video: Beating climate-change odds, a wolverine is born in Belgium Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Related Articles Google’s AutoDraw aims to make art of your doodles (VIDEO) Apple gets permit in California to test self-driving cars Apple considers bidding for Toshiba’s chip business Toshiba denies report of suspension of chip unit sale process Survey reveals US teens in love with Amazon and Apple Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

(AP photo) SAN FRANCISCO: Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already re-shaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. Ending years of speculation, Apple's late entry into a crowded field was made official on Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles - all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs - and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. APPLE GOES MOBILE... IN A NEW WAY Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn't discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear. The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. "Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems," the company said then. "There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation." Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple's director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company's interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion, prevent millions of crashes and save thousands of lives annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. A NEXT BIG THING Although iPhone's ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world's most valuable company, the company hasn't had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo's fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn't the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. DEEP POCKETS With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they're interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple's interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project ``Titan.'' Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

To date, the tech giant has been infuriatingly secretive about it’s efforts to build a self-driving car, code named Project Titan. Apple has been working on Project Titan for several years, but has never formally acknowledged it. Lately, the autonomous car project seems to be in flux. Recent reporting suggests that the company is no longer attempting to build its own autonomous, electric car to compete with companies like Tesla, but is instead focused on developing self-driving software it can deploy in partnership with existing carmakers. Now that it has its permit, the company appears poised to begin testing its software on public roads in California. A company source told Bloomberg that autonomous vehicle testing would begin “soon,” but declined to specify any further. According to the California DMV, Apple has three vehicles registered under the autonomous driving permit, all of which are 2015 Lexus RX crossovers. In addition, Apple has six drivers permitted to operate the vehicles. In the early days of its self-driving program, Google used Lexus SUVs outfitted with cameras and laser sensors. Late last year, Apple submitted a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in which it said that it was “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” At the time, it was seen as the strongest hint that Apple was still committed to self-driving technology.

By: San Francisco | San Francisco | Published:April 15, 2017 1:37 pm Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion, prevent millions of crashes and save thousands of lives annually in traffic accidents. (Source: AP) Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already re-shaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. Ending years of speculation, Apple’s late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs — and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. APPLE GOES MOBILE … IN A NEW WAY Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn’t discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear. The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. ” Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” the company said then. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation.” Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple’s director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company’s interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion, prevent millions of crashes and save thousands of lives annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. A NEXT BIG THING Although iPhone’s ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world’s most valuable company, the company hasn’t had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Luminar CEO Austin Russell gestures while looking at a 3D lidar map on a demonstration drive in San Francisco. (Source: AP) Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo’s fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn’t the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. DEEP POCKETS With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they’re interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple’s interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project “Titan.” Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead.

Volvo was even slower with its €1,170 (RM5,479) system that makes use of Inrix data.  The test vehicles were driven on four separate days during peak traffic between cities linked by motorways in and around Stuttgart.  The test took in more than 75 hours of driving time and more than 4,000 kilometres. — dpa Related Stories You May Be Interested Uber may face US$1mil fine over California drunken-driving complaints Apple considering multi-billion dollar investment in Toshiba chip unit Instagram’s Snapchat clone marks 200 million daily users milestone Facebook cracks down on 30,000 fake accounts in France Pedalling to save the planet Siew yoke loves briyani Others Also Read North Korea attempts but fails to launch missile - South Korea Two eagles help Dufner soar to Heritage lead Etihad Airways turns plane around for elderly couple to visit dying grandson advertisement Latest News Large fries?

Login here or sign up here International Apple said to near road tests of self-driving car software Company will test its platform with existing Lexus SUVs. Mark Gurman  /  15 April 2017&nbsp07:43 Apple will soon take its self-driving car software platform to public streets for the first time, a major step that gets the world’s largest technology company into a crowded race to reshape transportation. The California Department of Motor Vehicles granted clearance for trials of the autonomous driving technology on public roads, according to a notice on the DMV’s website on Friday. This is the first time Apple has received approval for such testing. The software tests will start soon with existing vehicles, according to a person familiar with the matter. They asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public. Cupertino, California-based Apple started designing a self-driving car to take on Google and Tesla Inc. a few years ago before it pulled back and focused on first developing underlying autonomous technology last year, Bloomberg News has reported. The tests are the clearest, public sign yet that Apple is serious about a nascent field that could, in time, transform mobility and upend the auto industry. A quarter of all miles driven in the U.S. may be traveled in shared, self-driving electric cars by the end of the next decade, Boston Consulting Group said this month. Apple wants a piece of this action, but it’s got a lot of competition: 29 other companies have autonomous vehicle testing permits in California. Subject to standard regulations for testing autonomous technology on public roads, Apple’s test cars will have a person behind the wheel to monitor the testing. The California permit covers three 2015 Lexus RX450h SUVs, and six drivers, the DMV said. Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo and Uber Technologies Inc.’s self-driving test cars also have people behind the wheel during tests. An Apple spokesman declined to comment beyond a statement issued in December when the company filed paperwork with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regarding safety practices for self-driving cars. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” Apple said at the time. The DMV’s website was updated Friday to acknowledge Apple becoming a permit holder. A March 30 copy of the website does not list Apple as having approval, indicating it was granted within the last two weeks. The permit requires companies to disclose traffic incidents related to their testing within 10 business days of the event. Apple’s self-driving technology is being developed in secret company offices in Sunnyvale, California, a short drive from its main Cupertino campus, Bloomberg News has reported. The company also has a team in Canada working on a car operating system that would power the platform, people familiar with the matter have said. The self-driving car platform is designed so that Apple could choose to open it up to existing carmakers or eventually port it to an Apple-designed vehicle. Apple began to focus more on the self-driving technology last year after re-hiring former hardware executive Bob Mansfield to lead the project. Apple aims to decide on the final direction of the platform by fall of this year, Bloomberg News has reported. © 2017 Bloomberg L.P Home    News    International More stories from Moneyweb SPONSORED The Ran Neu-Ner business leadership journey Connett Nthupi Masthead Financial Planning The risk premium attached to investing on the JSE Understanding junk status and forced sales Latest headlines    Addressing retirement fund member needs, consider TFSAs    Women on boards    Wall St week ahead: Netflix scorecard to test mettle of tech rally    Nintendo to release mini-size switch in 2019    No comments so far To comment, you must be registered and logged in.

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now I got a call from my mother-in-law this week. She usually doesn't call me directly unless she has a technology problem, and this time, it was a good one. It seems her iPad and her iPhone were both in a state of wanting her Apple ID password, and they were telling her the account was locked and to proceed she needed to reset the password. This wouldn't be a problem for many people, who could jump on a computer and reset the Apple ID password, but in my mother-in-law's case the iPad and the iPhone are her only ways to get online, so she was stuck. There was a link on her screen to reset the password, but for that she'd need to remember her security questions. Let's just say she and I didn't remember the security questions. You can also reset the password through email, so through Apple's website, I was able to reset her password and then log into her email account to make the change. I then called her back to tell her the new Apple ID password and talk her through getting her devices unlocked. Crisis averted. What happened was interesting. Apple released an iOS update, and both her devices had updated and restarted. To complete the update, you are asked to log back into your iCloud account. My mother-in-law didn't remember the password, so she locked the account after trying too many times without success. It didn't help that she really didn't understand what was going on with the update. Navigating a password reset procedure can be challenging even for me sometimes. Luckily, my wife's iPhone did the same update the day before, and she was also presented with the screen to enter her Apple ID, which she did without incident, so when my mother-in-law called, I quickly recognized she was in the same boat. The takeaway is to take your time to read and understand what is being asked in those little dialog boxes. If all else fails, have a plan for someone who can help you navigate these situations. We've been talking about passwords and how to keep up with them. In this case, a detailed notebook containing your logins and passwords is invaluable.

Subscribe free to our newsletters via your Email Address SPACE DAILY SPACE WAR TERRA DAILY ENERGY NEWS MARS DAILY GPS DAILY SEED DAILY WIND DAILY DISASTER NEWS SOLAR ENERGY MEDICAL NEWS NUCLEAR NEWS OIL & GAS NEWS BIO FUEL DAILY JAPAN NEWS With new iPhone, Trump still a target for hackers By Rob Lever Washington (AFP) March 30, 2017 President Donald Trump has a new phone. An iPhone. That would not ordinarily be news, but given the security concerns about the risk of hack attacks on the prolific White House tweeter, the shift is significant. Cybersecurity specialists say Trump's decision to transition from his Android device -- details of which were never disclosed but which was believed to be an unsecured, older-model Samsung -- is positive for security, but doesn't eliminate risks from hackers. "I can guarantee the Russians and Chinese will try to figure out an attack," said John Dickson, a former air force cybersecurity officer who now works for the Texas-based Denim Group consulting firm. White House social media chief Dan Scavino confirmed the smartphone shift this week, tweeting that Trump "has been using his new iPhone for the past couple of weeks here on Twitter. Yes, it is #POTUS45 reading & tweeting!" Dickson said security will depend on how the president is using the device -- whether it is exclusively for tweeting -- and if it is plugged into an enterprise management system that can "wall off" vulnerabilities. "If it's a single-purpose device, the risk is minimal," he said. "But as soon as you start clicking on things, downloading apps, granting access, that's when things matter tremendously." Mobile devices can be hacked to allow an attacker to listen via the phone's microphone, access its camera, monitor geolocation or even take over the handset remotely. Former president Barack Obama carried a BlackBerry, and later a different smartphone, with security modifications that limited its functions. Trump's switch comes despite his call for a boycott a year ago of the iPhone maker for refusing FBI requests to help hack a device for a probe into a deadly California attack. - More secure? - Some analysts say Apple devices may offer more security because the company controls the hardware and software and frequently updates its operating system. Apple did not respond to an AFP query on Trump's decision. Betsy Cooper, executive director of the University of California's Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity said that despite Apple's reputation, recent research has shown "that both iPhones and Android can be abused by hackers." Cooper said it remains unclear how the president's social media is managed -- what devices are used and who has access to his personal @realDonaldTrump and official @POTUS handles on Twitter. From a security standpoint, "it would be better to eliminate the personal accounts and use only government devices and government-protected social media accounts," Cooper said. Concerns of hacking come following Trump's unverified allegation that his phones were tapped during last year's election campaign, and after leaked documents from former contractor Edward Snowden showed US tapping of German leader Angela Merkel's personal phone. Some phones are marketed as "hardened" or secure devices for people in power, but it wasn't clear if these are used at the White House. - Phone as 'honeypot'? - Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the California-based International Computer Science Institute, said Trump's phone swap "massively reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the security risks." But while he agreed foreign governments are likely to try to hack the phone, Weaver said US intelligence services may have modified it to be "a nice honeypot to trap attempted attacks." A honeypot is a technique used to lure hackers and attackers to identify them and find ways to neutralize or punish them. Weaver said in a blog post earlier this year that Trump's use of an older Android device opened massive security risks and that "the working assumption should be that Trump's phone is compromised by at least one -- probably multiple -- hostile foreign intelligence services." At the time, it was not clear what type of handset Trump was using, but a New York Times report after the inauguration said he was using "his old, unsecured Android phone." Last month, Representative Ted Lieu of California called for an investigation, saying Trump's phone use may be "jeopardizing national security." Dickson said that even with strong security, the president could fall victim to an attack if he uses his phone for email and web browsing. This could be in the form of "spearphishing," or a message disguised to look as if it's from a trusted aide or family member, but which contains malware. "This is what sophisticated attackers do," Dickson said, and because the president's activities are widely known, "he would be an easier target for spearphishing." rl/ec APPLE INC.

Apple eyes backing Hon Hai bid for Toshiba chip unit: report Technology Saturday 15 April 2017 - 7:33am File: Apple hopes to secure stable supplies of Toshiba memory chips for its iPhones by supporting Hon Hai's bid. Photo: Reuters / Robert Galbraith TOKYO - Tech giant Apple is considering backing Hon Hai's multibillion-dollar bid for Toshiba's lucrative memory chip business, a report said on Saturday. The US firm plans to financially support Taiwan's Hon Hai, which has reportedly bid some 3-trillion yen (R370-billion) in the initial tendering round for the memory chip business, the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper said. Apple, which uses Toshiba's memory chips in its iPhones, hopes to secure stable supplies of the key parts by supporting Hon Hai's bid, the daily said. Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, is separately asking SoftBank to join the team, the daily said. The Japanese telecom company might help Hon Hai negotiate with local banks currently supporting Toshiba, it said. Immediate confirmation of the report was not available. READ: Apple, Samsung vow to fix flaws after CIA hacking report Among other bidders are Google and Amazon as well as US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom, news reports have said, quoting unnamed sources. Local media said any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba's memory chips. Toshiba is the world's second biggest supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea's Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67-trillion yen in revenue last fiscal year. But it plans to sell off the chip business, seen as crucial for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around after suffering huge cost overruns and construction delays at its US nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection in late March. On Tuesday, Toshiba reported an unaudited loss of $4.9-billion in long-overdue financial results for the nine months to December 2016. In announcing the earnings, Toshiba also warned of the likelihood of a worsening financial situation and said its survival was at risk.   AFP Comment Now!

Many iPhone owners don’t buy AppleCare+ that covers damage or spend $8 to $10 a month on iPhone insurance plans that cover damage and loss or theft. Apple only sells an extended warranty to users who are within 30 days of the initial iPhone purchase and the iPhone must be working at the time of purchase. Here is how replace a broken iPhone cheap, spending less than half of what carriers will charge. If you are holding a broken iPhone in your hand and it is out of warranty or without any insurance or accidental protection plan you can still get a replacement for under $300, which is 50% less than what you would pay to buy an off contract iPhone at a carrier like AT&T, Verizon or Sprint. Apple offers an Out of Warranty Service that allows almost any iPhone owner to get a replacement for $269 or less. That’s a huge savings over the off contract iPhone price. You will need to bring in the broken iPhone, so this will not help users with a lost or stolen iPhone. Thankfully the iPhone out of warranty replacement does cover water damage, so if you drop the iPhone into water and don’t have AppleCare+ you can still get a replacement. The same goes for an iPhone with a broken screen or that won’t even turn on. If you can hold your broken iPhone in your hand you likely qualify for an out of warranty iPhone replacement. Out of Warranty iPhone Replacement Cost If you can go to an Apple Store it is going to be the fastest way to get an out of warranty iPhone replacement. Apple calls this an out of warranty service, but in most cases they will take your old iPhone and give you a new one in the same visit. The prices listed below are for an out of warranty iPhone service at an Apple Store. You cannot get these prices at a carrier or at a retailer like Best Buy.   iPhone 5, iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c – $269 iPhone 4S – $199 iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 3G, Original iPhone – $149   If you call in and need to ship the phones back you will be charged $6.95 or shipping. If you need an out of warranty replacement iPhone faster you can use the Express Replacement Service and pay an additional $29 fee. The Out of Warranty iPhone replacement cost is affordable and even covers water damage and broken screens.   With this additional fee and upgraded service Apple sends a replacement iPhone to you first, and then you send the broken iPhone back. This is ideal if you need the iPhone faster, but if Apple refuses the service due to the iPhone being in multiple pieces or unauthorized modifications you will need to pay an additional fee. There is also a fee if you don’t send the iPhone in or if you send it in late. These are the best options for iPhone owners without a warranty like AppleCare+, SquareTrade or insurance like Protect Your Bubble or carrier programs. If you are in the hardware warranty for defects, but break the iPhone or drop it in water you qualify for this replacement service as well. If you need to buy an iPhone warranty or insurance, check out our comparison of the top options on the market with pricing, coverage and a breakdown. 3 Responses 07/22/2014 p HariPrasad reddy Reply Iphone 5 03/23/2016 M DEORI Reply Replace iphone 4s with new one 04/14/2017 Rana Reply If I want t replace my I phone 7plus can I do apple care or warranty??

Apple Enters Self-driving Car Race Share This Tags Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already re-shaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. Ending years of speculation, Apple’s late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs — and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. Apple Goes Mobile … In a New Way Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn’t discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear . The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. “Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” the company said then. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation.” Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple’s director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company’s interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion and save millions of people who die annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. A Next Big Thing Although iPhone’s ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world’s most valuable company, the company hasn’t had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo’s fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn’t the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. Deep Pockets With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they’re interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple’s interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project “Titan.” Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead.

The permit allows Apple to begin testing up to three 2015 Lexus SUVs similar to the type that Google uses for its autonomous cars. By obtaining clearance from California's Department of Motor Vehicles, Apple is signaling that it is serious about pushing forward with self-driving technology despite reports last fall that it was scaling back its ambitions. California's DMV disclosed the permit on its website Friday, which lists several dozen other companies that are testing self-driving technology. The group includes BMW, Ford, Honda, Nissan, Uber and others. Like those other companies, Apple's test vehicles will have human drivers behind the wheel when they go out on public roads, according to California regulations. Speculation surrounding an Apple automotive project has been bubbling for years, with Apple keeping a tight lid on its plans. The project quickly became something of an open secret among technology-watchers, even if it was never truly clear what Apple was working on. The ambiguity surrounding the effort was reflected in the numerous names that circulated about the project, such as the "Apple Car," "the iCar" and "Project Titan." Some predicted that the company would itself be producing drivable vehicles. Others said Apple was more likely focusing on software that could be used to control a car, or to upgrade a car by injecting it with autonomous capabilities. Some reports suggested Apple's new vehicle could be powered exclusively by battery-electric technology, much like cars produced by Tesla. A 2015 hiring spree at Apple for automotive engineers prompted another wave of rumours. Some of the new hires came from companies such as Ford and Tesla, who are also researching self-driving technology. But by last October, many in the team had reportedly left or been reassigned as a result of a strategic shift by the company to focus on the software side of self-driving technology. Despite the permit, it's still unclear what specific aspect Apple is working on. Apple declined to comment, referring to public remarks that it had submitted to federal highway authorities in November on its research into automation. "There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry," Apple wrote to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. With its permit, Apple is leaping into an increasingly competitive race to build the world's first mainstream self-driving car. On Thursday General Motors announced that it plans to expand its self-driving autos unit with 1,100 additional jobs and a $14 million investment, and in February Ford said that it's investing $1 billion in an artificial intelligence company called Argo AI. Self-driving technology has the potential to reshape how people work, play and commute; proponents say automating vehicles will help reduce congestion and prevent crashes caused by human error, which according to federal statistics account for 95 percent of all accidents. Analysts said that Apple may accelerate the arrival of a fully autonomous car to the market. "It's encouraging to hear Apple is still in the autonomous vehicle game," said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. She added that Apple's entry into the self-driving wars will push the industry to "provide a product that's not only safer, but more secure at a potentially even faster timeline than we're already experiencing." Several automakers, technology hardware firms and software companies have applied to test cars through California's autonomous car program, according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles' website. Companies that wish to test vehicles must provide evidence that they can train qualified employee drivers, can insure their cars and will be liable for any damage incurred during tests. They are also required to submit regular reports outlining any accidents that happen during testing and times that drivers turn off a vehicle's autonomous systems during a test. This is not the first time Apple has leapt into the automotive space. Its CarPlay interface, for example, allows drivers to connect their vehicles with their iPhones - a foray into the market for in-car infotainment that is becoming increasingly common in consumer automobiles. © 2017 The Washington Post For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.

And it makes sense to align the company’s podcasting platform with Apple Music, rather than iTunes.

Apple enters self-driving car race Latest News World News The iPhone of cars? Apple enters self-driving car race By Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writer April 15, 2017 0 193 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already re-shaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. The Apple logo above a store location entrance, in Dallas. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez, File) Ending years of speculation, Apple’s late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs — and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. APPLE GOES MOBILE … IN A NEW WAY Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn’t discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear . The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. ” Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” the company said then. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation.” Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple’s director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company’s interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion and save millions of people who die annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. A NEXT BIG THING Although iPhone’s ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world’s most valuable company, the company hasn’t had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo’s fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn’t the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. DEEP POCKETS With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they’re interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple’s interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project “Titan.” Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead.

The US firm plans to financially support Taiwan's Hon Hai, which has reportedly bid some 3 trillion yen ($27.6 billion) in the initial tendering round for the memory chip business, the Mainichi Shimbun said. Apple, which uses Toshiba's memory chips for its iPhone, hopes to secure stable supplies of the key parts by supporting Hon Hai's bid, the daily said. Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, is separately asking SoftBank to join the team, the daily said. The Japanese telecom company may help Hon Hai negotiate with local banks currently supporting Toshiba, it said. Immediate confirmation of the report was not available. Among other bidders are Google and Amazon as well as US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom, news reports have said, quoting unnamed sources. Local media said any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba's memory chips. Toshiba is the world's number two supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea's Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67 trillion yen in revenue last fiscal year. But it plans to sell off the chip business, seen as crucial for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around, after suffering huge cost overruns and construction delays at its US nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection late March. On Tuesday, Toshiba reported an unaudited loss of $4.9 billion in long-overdue financial results for the nine months to December 2016. In announcing the earnings, Toshiba also warned of the likelihood of a worsening financial situation and said its survival was at risk.

The iTunes brand stopped making sense a long time ago. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 14, 2017 at 8:00PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) began transitioning away from its iconic "i" branding several years ago, instead moving toward "Apple <product or service>" branding. The reasons were pretty clear. Since Apple can't trademark a single letter, countless others have attempted to piggyback on the "i" nomenclature with their own "i" devices, products, services, and even entire companies (like iHome). Over the years, what we saw was a relentless dilution of the "i" naming convention that increasingly had less and less to do with Apple. The long-term branding solution was to start branding things with "Apple." Think of Apple Music (instead of iMusic), Apple Pay (instead of iPay), or perhaps most notable, Apple Watch (instead of iWatch). At this point, Apple hasn't introduced an "i" product or service in years. Existing products like iPhone or iPad will certainly remain, but there's very little chance that Apple will introduce another new iAnything ever again. iTunes does just about everything now, for better or for worse. Image source: Apple. Is iTunes next? The iTunes brand stopped making sense long ago, at least if the brand is expected to describe the service. iTunes expanded beyond just music over a decade ago, and now includes a wide range of content categories such as movies, TV shows, apps, and even ringtones (does anyone still even pay for ringtones?). It's not just "tunes" anymore, and it hasn't been that way for a long time. As such, the iTunes brand has been declining in appropriateness for an eternity. It became a strong brand as the first mainstream digital storefront for music, which is probably why Apple has stuck with it for so long. As a function of iTunes' expansion, it's no longer just a music-playing app either. It has an integrated storefront for all types of media, and will play any of that media (other than apps). There are now signs that Apple wants to move away from the iTunes brand, starting with a subset of the content: podcasts. The company has now rebranded its first-party podcasts app as "Apple Podcasts," according to 9to5Mac. While there are some other ideas as to what this could potentially signal, like a possible podcasting subscription service, it could also mark the first indication that Apple will rebrand its digital content repository. The challenge then is: What would Apple rename it? If Apple were to rebrand iTunes altogether -- which is still a pretty big "if" currently -- there aren't a whole lot of obvious or compelling alternatives. Apple Music already refers to the streaming service and doesn't encompass the other content categories. "Apple Content" is horrendously boring and doesn't appeal to anyone, and "Apple Media" is barely any better. "Apple Play" wouldn't work because Apple's dominant mobile platform rival has already used "Play" for its own storefront. Apple Store usually refers to the retail locations. If you have any better suggestions, I imagine Cook & Co. are open to ideas right about now. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

The DMV updated its list of manufacturers testing self-driving cars on Friday, with Apple becoming the 30th company to be granted permission. Few details have been revealed about Apple’s plans for self-driving cars, according to Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs. But she said Apple could be a “major player” in the autonomous vehicle industry. The permit will cover three types of vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX540h models –and six individual drivers, the California DMV said in a statement to ABC News. Apple has never publicly acknowledged its self-driving car program. A company spokesman would not provide additional details about the efforts to ABC News. Household names like Google, Tesla and Ford are also on the California DMV’s list. Volkswagen Group of America was the first company to be granted a permit. In December, Apple said that it is investing heavily in “machine learning and autonomous systems” in a statement to federal regulators after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration made public an Apple letter giving input on autonomous car regulations. Regulations require every manufacturer authorized to test self-driving cars to submit an annual report “summarizing the disengagements of the technology during testing,” according to the DMV. The state of California also requires that a human be behind the wheel of autonomous vehicles during testing. “We’ve provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems. There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” Apple said at the time. California regulations for the technology became effective in September 2014.

Apple enters self-driving car race By MICHAEL LIEDTKE and The Associated Press April 14, 2017 11:03 pm 3 min read Share SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already re-shaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. Ending years of speculation, Apple’s late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs — and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. APPLE GOES MOBILE … IN A NEW WAY White House ends hiring freeze, mandates workforce, mission restructuring Advertisement Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn’t discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear. The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. “ Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” the company said then. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation.” Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple’s director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company’s interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion, prevent millions of crashes and save thousands of lives annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. What makes the 2017 CR the worst yet for Defense? A NEXT BIG THING Although iPhone’s ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world’s most valuable company, the company hasn’t had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo’s fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn’t the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. DEEP POCKETS With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they’re interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple’s interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project “Titan.” Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead.

(AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez, File) FILE - This Thursday, Sept. 19, 2013, file photo shows the Apple logo above a store location entrance, in Dallas. Apple will begin testing self-driving car technology in California, its first public move into a highly competitive field that could radically change transportation. The California Department of Motor Vehicles awarded Apple a permit to test autonomous vehicles Friday, April 14, 2017, and disclosed that information on its website. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) San Francisco • Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already re-shaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. Ending years of speculation, Apple's late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs — and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. VIDEOS TOP JOBS APPLE GOES MOBILE ... IN A NEW WAY Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn't discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear . The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. " Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems," the company said then. "There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation." Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple's director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company's interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion and save millions of people who die annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. A NEXT BIG THING Although iPhone's ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world's most valuable company, the company hasn't had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo's fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn't the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. DEEP POCKETS With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion.

Speculation about Apple's interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project "Titan."

California’s Department of Motor Vehicles quietly updated its Web site Friday to include Apple in its list of 30 companies that have permits to test self-driving cars on California’s public roads. Apple — which reportedly put its plans to develop a self-driving car of its own on the back burner last year — has obtained a permit to test its car software on three 2015 Lexus RX540h vehicles with six different drivers, the DMV said Friday in an e-mailed statement. A Lexus spokesman told The Post he had no “specific information” on why Apple chose its model, but added that its hybrid crossover SUVs “are a popular choice among companies looking to test future technologies.” The Cupertino, Calif.-based MacBook-maker isn’t in pole position when it comes to permits in California. Google and Uber have them, and the latter also started testing self-driving cars with its Pittsburgh customers late last year. Traditional automakers such as GM, Ford, Honda and Mercedes-Benz also have permits to test their models on California’s roads. Electric-car manufacturer Tesla started test-driving automated cars in California late last year. Apple’s move into self-driving cars has been hotly anticipated for years, and Friday’s news is the latest indication that it is serious about the space. Apple said in a November letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Commission that it is “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” Apple reps didn’t respond to requests for comment.

In a report from Bloomberg, it has been discovered that the California DMV has granted Apple approval to test self-driving cars on California roads. This is actually not the first time that Apple’s plans have been revealed by government agencies. Back in December last year it was revealed that Apple’s director of product integrity had written in to the NHTSA with regards to automation of transportation and machine learning, hinting at self-driving car plans. However if you might recall, it was also reported last year that Apple had given up on building its own electric car. This doesn’t mean that Apple still isn’t interested in the technology, but instead it suggested that Apple could simply be looking more towards the software side rather than the hardware side of things. Given that making your own cars is a huge undertaking, it is understandable. So this permit granted by the DMV could simply be Apple looking to test their software with existing vehicles, and nothing more, but it is an interesting development anyway. No word on if and when Apple will ever release this software to carmakers, but we’ll be keeping our eyes peeled all the same. Filed in Apple >Transportation.

The permit allows it to conduct test drives in three vehicles with six drivers, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said yesterday. The vehicles are all 2015 Lexus RX450h, according to the DMV. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts in recent years, and the permit pulls the curtain back a bit on any possible plan. “This does confirm what's long been rumoured: That Apple is at least toying with the idea of getting into the autonomous game in some capacity,” said Chris Theodore, president of consultancy Theodore & Associates, and a former vice president at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler. The permit does not mean Apple is definitely building a car. "This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumoured, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology," Theodore said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement the company made in November when it wrote to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on the subject of regulating self-driving vehicles. "The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation," Apple's director of product integrity, Steve Kenner, wrote in that five-page letter. Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California - all vying to be the first to have commercially viable vehicles on the roads. Companies that have been issued permits also include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. Many companies have said the first cars will launch in 2020 but some experts believe it may take much longer due to regulatory challenges. Shares of Apple closed down 0.5 per cent at US$141.05 (RM622.63) on Thursday. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Alphabet’s Verily makes smartwatch for health research Google’s AutoDraw aims to make art of your doodles (VIDEO) Nintendo to release mini-size Switch in 2019, Citigroup predicts Gary the parrot may hold secrets to advanced drones (VIDEO) US takedown of Russian botnet won’t end pernicious spam, say experts Project Scorpio: Five consoles that won with less power, and one that didn't That fingerprint sensor on your phone is not as safe as you think Facebook looking at behaviour to weed out fake accounts This prototype flight suit brings you that much closer to your Iron Man dreams (VIDEO) US takedown of Russian botnet won’t end pernicious spam, say experts Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Greek Orthodox Patriarch leads Holy Fire ceremony in Jerusalem Reuters Video: Beating climate-change odds, a wolverine is born in Belgium Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Related Articles Apple eyes backing Hon Hai bid for Toshiba chip unit Apple considers bidding for Toshiba’s chip business Survey reveals US teens in love with Amazon and Apple Australian regulator sues Apple alleging iPhone ‘bricking’ Chinese court rules in favour of Apple in local design patent disputes Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Apple enters self-driving car race The company, in need of a breakthrough product, is awarded a permit to test vehicles on public roads in California. By MICHAEL LIEDTKEAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already reshaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. Ending years of speculation, Apple’s late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. Apple will begin testing self-driving car technology in California, its first public move into a highly competitive field that could radically change transportation. The California Department of Motor Vehicles awarded Apple a permit to test autonomous vehicles Friday and disclosed that information on its website. Associated Press/Tony Gutierrez Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → The permit covers three vehicles – all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs – and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. APPLE GOES MOBILE Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn’t discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear . The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December: “Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” the company said then. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation.” Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor Co. executive who is now Apple’s director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company’s interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion and save millions of people who die annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. A NEXT BIG THING Although iPhone’s ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world’s most valuable company, the company hasn’t had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo’s fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to go to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn’t the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. APPLE’S DEEP POCKETS With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they’re interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple’s interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the project name “Titan.” Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead.

If you downloaded the soft launch version and are playing it right now, you should join our Discord server, where we've opened up #modern_combat_versus, a channel where you can discuss the game with other players. Need to get a game going, discuss tactics, or just want to bond over some cool stuff? This is the place for you! It's worth noting that with the debut of the soft launch, you not only need to have access to the game, but you also need a VPN to play the game since it is region-locked. We're going to explain how to use a VPN to play the game right away, and how to download it if you don't know how to download soft launch games. Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel   How to play with a VPN Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) sounds scary, but iOS makes it extremely pain-free to use one. What you're going to need is a VPN that has a server located in the Philippines so that you can appear as if you're in the region so the servers will let you play the game. This does work, but do note that performance is going to be impacted on the fact that you're connecting to the game from overseas if you're connecting via VPN. As well, you often get what you pay for with VPNs, as free VPNs can be slow because, well, people like free things. Paid VPN services do exist, and you might want to consider one if playing region-locked soft launches is of interest to you. Be sure to check out our #modern_combat_versus room where people are sharing VPN recommendations. As well, sound off in the comments if you have any VPN recommendations. But for the purposes of this guide, we're going to use a VPN app that's good enough for Modern Combat Versus, in Free VPN by Cloudwall [Free]. All you need to do is to download the app, choose the Philippines server, and hit Connect. The first time you do this, it will prompt you to "Allow" the VPN connection, and take you to Settings where you will have to put in your passcode or Touch ID to approve the VPN profile installation. Once you do this, Cloudwall will connect. All you need to do now is to launch Modern Combat Versus and you can go through the tutorial and play the game for yourself.   How to download the soft launch version So, you want to download Modern Combat Versus, but don't know how? We often talk about soft launched games here on TouchArcade (and if you enjoy our coverage, your support is most welcome). While getting soft launched games in a country you don't reside in isn't necessarily easy, it's not that difficult to do, you just have to know where you're looking and what to do. Here's how to register an iTunes account in the Philippines for the Modern Combat Versus soft launch. The first step is that you'll have an easier time doing this from desktop iTunes. This process isn't impossible from iOS, and it has been possible to just change the country on your account, but doing so from a computer with mouse and keyboard, along with creating a new account, is the easiest and most non-destructive way to get access to other iTunes stores. Start by signing out of your account. Go into the App Store on iTunes, and scroll all the way to the bottom to where you see the country flag, or the "Change Country" link. Click that, and now select the country that you want to sign up in, which in this case is the Philippines. I recommend repeating this process for countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, as these countries regularly get soft-launched games as well. Now, go and download a free app. Ideally, it'd be Modern Combat Versus, but any free app will work. Once you do this, it'll prompt you to sign in to the iTunes Store. Choose "Create Apple ID." You'll want to make sure that you download a free app. You can't just register a new account outright as you'll have to put in a credit card number, and well, if you had that, you wouldn't be reading this article, now would you? For the email address, what I recommend doing is if you have a Gmail address, to use + and something to signify the country that the email is for. So, for example, use elihodappsucks+ph@gmail.com for a Philippines account. This way, the emails still get sent to your inbox, but it will function differently than your current Apple ID. If your email provider doesn't support the + function, or if that's too complicated, create a burner email somewhere to use as your alt Apple ID. Obviously for payment method, choose none. For the personal information including billing address, you'll need some sort of quasi-usable address in the country you're signing up in. Personally, I like to use a fake name generator website for coming up with usable addresses and info. Fill that out, and hit Create Apple ID. You'll need to verify your Apple ID, but once you do, it should be usable. Now you can sign in with it on your device. To switch Apple IDs, scroll to the bottom of the App Store, tap the Apple ID section, and choose Sign Out. Then, sign back in with your new Apple ID. The App Store will automatically switch you to your Apple ID's App Store. From there, you can download whatever free apps you want to that account. Do note that you can't necessarily buy anything from this account without some form of payment method attached. You could get someone to give you a gift card from the Philippines of course, or possibly buy the country's iTunes gift card off of eBay. What you can't do is buy IAP in the app from your home account; Apple requires that you be signed in to the account that you bought the app on to buy IAP in it. There's not really an easy way around this, so you'll just have to play free games for free unless you find a hookup. Otherwise, you'll see a screen like this: Note that if Gameloft releases an update, the App Store won't automatically update the game, it'll usually just make you sign in with the password of your alternate country's account for the update to download. And when you sign in with your other account, the store will switch automatically to the account's country. Also, be sure to sign into an account in-game so that you don't lose progress when the game comes out in your country. You'll need to delete and re-install on your primary account so that you can make purchases. In general, the soft launch account process should be pretty painless. This is as compared to the Android process, where...well, it's not as easy to do it yourself since Google restricts it based on the device's region, which is harder to fake. This trick has worked and been known for a few years now, and while Apple could possibly change it someday, you should be good for the foreseeable future to download soft launch games.

Mark No need for vpn just change ur flag in Account to appropriate country. You will need to know country code equivalent to US zip code and that's it. Save with your existing iTunes already in there. It will log you into appropriate App Store and download then change the country info back. This author is totally inefficient and must be new to doing this. gNades The vpn isn't to download the game. The vpn is to trick the game into thinking you are in the Philippines. Gameloft has region locked the game you can start the game but it will check your location and lock you out if you are not in the Philippines. boydstr Seeing the posts there already mixed messages in the right way to doing this. Mark GNades is correct. I thought info was being provided to download the game. What was being provided was a workaround to playing it online in that region specific boydstr No problem Mark TouchArcade is a great platform where other gamers can talk about gaming and share other game related information.

Bank of America will also make a donation for every Apple Pay transaction using its cards, also up to $1 million. Customers around the world can also easily donate directly to (RED) through iTunes. In the US, iTunes Movies is offering a free download of The Lazarus Effect, the documentary about the mission of (RED). The Killers’ holiday album, Don’t Waste Your Wishes, is exclusively available on iTunes featuring all 10 of their holiday singles, as well as a new track “I’ll Be Home for Christmas,” with 100 percent of the proceeds in the US going to the Global Fund. Over the past 10 years, 70 million lives have been impacted by (RED)-supported Global Fund grants. At the start of Apple’s partnership with (RED), 1,200 babies were born with HIV every day, and today, UNAIDS predicts that number could be near zero by the year 2020, with the end of AIDS by 2030. With the life-saving medication costing as little as 30 cents a day, every person can make a difference. Through these efforts we’ll get that much closer to helping (RED) create an AIDS-free generation.

AUTOMATION DATA INFRASTRUCTURE INTERNET TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVES INSIGHTS GOVTECH.COM FutureStructure_Grey FutureStructure California DMV Gives Apple Permission to Test Driverless Cars The technology giant is now the 30th company to receive approval for testing on state roadways. by News Staff / April 14, 2017 Matt Buchanan According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) website, Apple is now permitted to test self-driving cars in the state. Apple is now the 30th tech company with such rights. They join other big-name tech firms like Google and Tesla, as well as more traditional automakers like Volkswagen, Mercedes Benz, Nissan, GM, BMW, Honda, Ford and Subaru. Though Apple never formally announced plans to build an autonomous vehicle (AV), there has been much speculation about the tech giant getting into the driverless game. RELATEDCalifornia DMV Adopts Autonomous Vehicle Testing RulesData Shows Promise for Autonomous Vehicles' Progress For starters, former Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak said two years ago that a self-driving “automobile makes a lot of sense for a company like Apple,” adding that “Tesla has set an example that a new car company can come, not out of Detroit, but out of Silicon Valley. Just the price of cars make me think Apple should work on it.” Then later that year, in September 2015, the California DMV admitted to having met with Apple officials about the state's rules for testing autonomous vehicles on public streets. And this past December, the company penned a letter to the U.S. Department of Transportation acknowledging its interest in AV technology. Like all permit-holders, Apple must report accidents within 10 business days, and submit annual reports that document self-driving tech failures, including disengagements, which is when when a human driver takes over.

Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

Photo / AP After months of speculation that the company is developing automotive technology, Apple has officially leapt into the war for self-driving cars by obtaining a test permit from California regulators. The permit allows Apple to begin testing up to three 2015 Lexus SUVs similar to the type that Google uses for its autonomous cars. By obtaining clearance from California's Department of Motor Vehicles, Apple is signaling that it is serious about pushing forward with self-driving technology despite reports last fall that it was scaling back its ambitions. California's DMV disclosed the permit on its website Friday, which lists several dozen other companies that are testing self-driving technology. The group includes BMW, Ford, Honda, Nissan, Uber and others. Like those other companies, Apple's test vehicles will have human drivers behind the wheel when they go out on public roads, according to California regulations. Speculation surrounding an Apple automotive project has been bubbling for years, with Apple keeping a tight lid on its plans. The project quickly became something of an open secret among technology-watchers, even if it was never truly clear what Apple was working on. The ambiguity surrounding the effort was reflected in the numerous names that circulated about the project, such as the "Apple Car," "the iCar" and "Project Titan." Some predicted that the company would itself be producing drivable vehicles. Others said Apple was more likely focusing on software that could be used to control a car, or to upgrade a car by injecting it with autonomous capabilities. Some reports suggested Apple's new vehicle could be powered exclusively by battery-electric technology, much like cars produced by Tesla. A 2015 hiring spree at Apple for automotive engineers prompted another wave of rumors. Some of the new hires came from companies such as Ford and Tesla, who are also researching self-driving technology. But by last October, many in the team had reportedly left or been reassigned as a result of a strategic shift by the company to focus on the software side of self-driving technology. Despite the permit, it's still unclear what specific aspect Apple is working on. Continued below. Related Content Google Maps reduces drive time in Auckland Your Views: Readers Letters Job applications go Hollywood Apple declined to comment, referring to public remarks that it had submitted to federal highway authorities in November on its research into automation. "There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry," Apple wrote to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. With its permit, Apple is leaping into an increasingly competitive race to build the world's first mainstream self-driving car. On Thursday General Motors announced that it plans to expand its self-driving autos unit with 1,100 additional jobs and a US$14 million (NZ$20m) investment, and in February Ford said that it's investing US$1 billion in an artificial intelligence company called Argo AI. Self-driving technology has the potential to reshape how people work, play and commute; proponents say automating vehicles will help reduce congestion and prevent crashes caused by human error, which according to federal statistics account for 95 per cent of all accidents. Analysts said that Apple may accelerate the arrival of a fully autonomous car to the market. "It's encouraging to hear Apple is still in the autonomous vehicle game," said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. She added that Apple's entry into the self-driving wars will push the industry to "provide a product that's not only safer, but more secure at a potentially even faster timeline than we're already experiencing." Several automakers, technology hardware firms and software companies have applied to test cars through California's autonomous car program, according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles' website. Companies that wish to test vehicles must provide evidence that they can train qualified employee drivers, can insure their cars and will be liable for any damage incurred during tests. They are also required to submit regular reports outlining any accidents that happen during testing and times that drivers turn off a vehicle's autonomous systems during a test. This is not the first time Apple has leapt into the automotive space. Its CarPlay interface, for example, allows drivers to connect their vehicles with their iPhones - a foray into the market for in-car infotainment that is becoming increasingly common in consumer automobiles. - Washington Post By Brian Fung, Hayley Tsukayama Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Ending years of speculation, Apple's late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs — and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. APPLE GOES MOBILE ... IN A NEW WAY Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn't discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear . Uber to Waymo: We aren't using your robocar laser beam secrets Joel Rosenblatt Uber Technologies Inc. has an alibi for Alphabet Inc.'s allegations of trade-secrets theft — the ride-hailing company is using off-the-shelf technology in its driverless cars weaving through San Francisco and Pittsburgh.

Uber Technologies Inc. has an alibi for Alphabet Inc.'s allegations of trade-secrets theft — the ride-hailing company is using off-the-shelf technology in its driverless cars weaving through San Francisco and Pittsburgh. Uber is trying to persuade a judge not to issue an order that might stall... (Joel Rosenblatt) The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. " Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems," the company said then. "There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation." Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple's director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company's interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion and save millions of people who die annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. A NEXT BIG THING Although iPhone's ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world's most valuable company, the company hasn't had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Google's self-driving minivan will start test drives this month in California and Arizona Tribune news services Waymo, Google's self-driving car division, will start testing its new fleet of minivans on public roads in California and Arizona later this month.

Waymo, Google's self-driving car division, will start testing its new fleet of minivans on public roads in California and Arizona later this month. The minivans, built in collaboration with Fiat Chrysler, are Chrysler Pacifica hybrids outfitted with Waymo's own suite of sensors and radar. Waymo... (Tribune news services) Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo's fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn't the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. DEEP POCKETS With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they're interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple's interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project "Titan." Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead. Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Automotive Industry Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Apple Inc.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Guest The sudden rise of the headless AI Jensen Harris, Textio@jensenharris April 15, 2017 10:14 PM Tags: ai, Alexa, Amazon, Assistant, bots, chatbots, Google Home, machine learning, voicebots Image Credit: Shutterstock.com/Zapp2Photo “Hey Siri, how’s the weather today?” “OK Google, remind me to pay the power bill.” “Alexa, tell me a joke!” Bots are eating the world. Whether you are an enterprising app developer building the essential software to bring a virtual Taylor Swift into your Slack chats, or just lonely and in need of a dumb, annoying virtual friend to message you on Facebook, we seem to be clear on one thing: many experiences, apps, sites, and products are breathlessly going to be replaced with bots. (Unless they are being replaced with VR. Or AR. Or a typewriter keyboard for your iPhone.) It’s official: “bot for X” is the new “Uber for X”. And sure, bots are cool. Ever since ELIZA struggled to pass the Turing Test and HAL 9000 murdered his crew (later reincarnated in a hardly-remembered Apple Super Bowl commercial) we’ve been infatuated with the idea of computers as our inevitable sidekicks. Bots center around one specific niche aspect of artificial intelligence: conversational understanding. Human factors experts have long been enthralled by the idea that a more natural way to communicate with computers would be through speech, and we’ve spent the better part of a century building to a point where natural conversations may soon be a reality. While this is indeed an important step forward in human-computer interaction, it is truly just one small part of what AI is about—and not the part that will matter the most for the enterprise companies who actually buy almost $4 trillion in software and services each year. Bots are the new command line Today, most bots just provide a wrapper around existing functionality. Much as in the early days of graphical user interface (GUI), the point-and-click interface provided different ways of achieving the same tasks you could do on the command line, most bots provide an additional channel with which to do tasks you likely often do another way. Instead of speaking a specific sentence, you can open the Weather app on your iPhone. You can open your task list and type “Pay the power bill.” You could search Google for a viola joke. Many of today’s bots are kind of a hipster façade around the same basic command line interfaces consumers abandoned in the 1980s. They require specific syntaxes and understand only a limited vocabulary—but they sure have personality! format /q /fs:fat /v:mydisk wasn’t nearly this funny back in the day. Yes, Taco Bell really did this. While the added convenience of language recognition is a benefit, until bots are capable of performing very complex and novel tasks that richly combine actions and context across the boundaries of apps and sites in unique ways the first time they are asked, we will be limited to trying to remember the 489 commands Siri recognizes. (Yes that link is a man page for Siri.) The rise of headless AI But I’m not down on bots. I’m just a lot more excited by the less-flashy flavor of AI that is changing the nature of work itself: headless AI. Headless AI is the application of artificial intelligence to vastly improve internal business processes. It is fully transforming the crucial machinery of business—processes like hiring, lead generation, financial modeling, and information security. Legacy software has become commodity in all of these areas, and purpose-built AI solutions will get a larger and larger wallet share of these huge enterprise cost centers. Headless AI combines machine intelligence and learning loops to constantly evolve. Because these solutions plug into the data lifeblood of a company, they become incredibly valuable as the algorithms adapt to the patterns that work. I call this form of AI “headless” because, unlike bots, the value is mostly not about the personality. Headless AI works with humans and augments their strengths; it doesn’t try to replace them. It gives people superpowers. While being able to talk to your CRM is cool, having a sales platform that accurately predicts the 100 opportunities you can close this quarter is worth breaking the bank for. Having a cute avatar answer your customer support chats seems nice enough, but predicting ahead of time what areas of your product will get support requests so that you can fix them before customers suffer is pure gold. It’s happening! (already) Though bots get all the glamour, headless AI is quietly happening everywhere already. These new platforms are generally purpose-built solutions optimized around specific domains and outcomes data. They learn not from people talking to them, but by voraciously chomping up all of the relevant proprietary data fed into them. The best systems employ learning loops and massive streams of incoming data to constantly improve. This creates a multiplier effect: the earlier and more pervasively an organization rolls out headless AI solutions, the more quickly the positive results compound. If you wait a year to deploy, you don’t just lose the year of improved productivity — you lose the year of learning and adaptation of the software to your company’s patterns. This puts you doubly behind. Companies like Apple, Expedia, and Johnson & Johnson use Textio’s augmented writing platform to chop weeks off the time it takes them to fill open jobs. DeepMind helped Google reduce power consumption in their data centers by 15%. A former NSA analyst created Area 1 Security to predict cyberattacks before they happen. These new headless AI companies, and dozens of others, are helping enterprises make radical productivity leaps today that they haven’t seen from software in decades. Headless AI is where the money is I’m not sure if there’s a revenue model that works for bots. I guess we will see. People are trying to figure that out. I’m thankful I don’t have to! What I do know is that there is a lot of money to be made in transforming the efficiency of core enterprise functions. This is what headless AI is all about. If you can improve a crucial business process in a decisive way by a clear and measurable amount, that is incredibly valuable. What is most game changing about this kind of software is that it is purely quantitative. Unlike a bot, where the potential return on investment is fairly qualitative (“customers liked interacting with the bot”), most headless AI is fully in the realm of predicting the future and then helping you change that future. Something where the return on investment is measurable and evident. Improving, in real life, the quantity, quality, and demographics of the people who walk through your front door with resumes in hand… how much is it worth to more quickly hire better people than your competition? If you can predict exactly who will buy what, when… how much could you improve your customer experience? Because this kind of software proves itself through the numbers, it is inherently valuable and easy to budget for. Headless is where the real AI money is. Headless AI everywhere In the near future, every core business function will have been transformed by AI—hiring, sales, security, marketing, finance, manufacturing… everything. Purpose-built headless AI platforms will provide the new infrastructure which will drive every business. The enterprises who are already on this train are getting an outsized advantage until everyone else catches up. Legacy software will get squeezed down into a smaller portion of the IT wallet as the most valuable services become the native AI platforms—just as form-based desktop software got squeezed out by the cloud in the last generation. Bots are here to stay. They’ll keep getting headlines. “OK Google, search for tacobot.” But the real enterprise revolution is happening in the companies who are using headless AI to transform their core businesses.

It’s official. According to the California DMV’s website, updated Friday (April 14), Apple is the latest among 30 companies who already have permits to test autonomous vehicles on the state’s highways and byways. Since the DMV requires any manufacturer to apply for a permit before testing a vehicle in autonomous mode on California’s roads, this is the strongest confirmation yet of Apple’s intent to develop self-driving car technology. The DMV website turns out to be a treasure trove of information on all the facets of  highly automated vehicles currently in development.  Who's who For starters, for anyone who wants to know which car and tech outfits are currently entertaining California dreams about their robo-cars, here’s a list of test-drive permits, in the order they were granted: ·   •    Volkswagen Group of America     •   Mercedes Benz     •    Google     •    Delphi Automotive     •    Tesla Motors     •    Bosch     •    Nissan     •    GM Cruise LLC     •    BMW     •    Honda     •    Ford     •    Zoox, Inc.     •    Drive.ai, Inc.     •    Faraday & Future Inc.     •    Baidu USA LLC     •    Wheego Electric Cars Inc.     •    Valeo North America, Inc.     •    NextEV USA, Inc.     •    Telenav, Inc.     •    NVIDIA Corporation     •    AutoX Technologies Inc     •    Subaru     •    Udacity, Inc     •    Navya Inc.     •    Renovo Motors Inc     •    UATC LLC (Uber)     •    PlusAi Inc     •    Nuro, Inc     •    CarOne LLC     •    Apple Inc. Accidents in autonomous mode The DMV can also reveal which self-driving cars in autonomous mode actually had accidents. This link reports traffic accidents involving an autonomous vehicle in Calif. over the last two years. Of the 28 reported, 24 were filed by Google (no surprises there, given its early start), three by GM Cruise (including Cruise Automation) and one by Delphi. What about disengagements? The most interesting click on this site, in the view of Egil Juliussen, research director for infotainment and ADAS at IHS Automotive, is where each carmaker reports on autonomous vehicle disengagement.  Here’s the link to the 2016 disengagement report. According to the DMV, California Autonomous Vehicle Testing Regulations require every manufacturer authorized to test robo-cars on public roads to submit an annual report summarizing disengagements from the technology during testing.  Consider Google (now Waymo), which scored well compared to the year before. In 2015, Google had 0.80 disengagements every 1,000 miles (autonomous miles on public roads in Calif.). In 2016, the Waymo number dropped to 0.20. “You can see that they are making a pretty good progress,” said Juliussen.

It now appears that customers who require whole unit repairs are being upgraded to the iPad Air 2. According to the folks at 9to5Mac, Apple and other authorized technicians will be able to provide the iPad Air 2 as a valid replacement for those bringing in iPad 4th generation for service. The fourth-generation iPad was released alongside the original iPad Mini in 2012. It has long been discontinued but still supported by Apple. As stock of replacement devices dwindles, customers may now get the option to replace it with a newer iPad Air 2. The iPad Air 2 includes a better processor, thinner profile, and also comes with other enhanced features. Naturally, these replacements will be at the discretion of the service provider. Interestingly enough, the iPad Air 2 was recently discontinued in March, making way for the latest iPad. While the specifications remain the same, the release highlight was perhaps the decrease in price by $70.

The US firm plans to financially support Taiwan’s Hon Hai, which has reportedly bid some 3 trillion yen ($27.6 billion) in the initial tendering round for the memory chip business, the Mainichi Shimbun said. Apple, which uses Toshiba’s memory chips for its iPhone, hopes to secure stable supplies of the key parts by supporting Hon Hai’s bid, the daily said. Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, is separately asking SoftBank to join the team, the daily said. The Japanese telecom company may help Hon Hai negotiate with local banks currently supporting Toshiba, it said. Immediate confirmation of the report was not available. Among other bidders are Google and Amazon as well as US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners, quoting unnamed sources. Published in The Express Tribune, April 16th, 2017.

The Apple Store will be spread over 1,322 square meters on the ground floor and the first basement level of the mall in Taiwan's tallest skyscraper, the source said. Meanwhile, in view of the expected opening of the country's first Apple Store in the Taipei 101mall, Apple premium reseller Studio A will close its shop there on April 17, Studio A president Cheng Ying-lung (程應龍) said. Cheng said the Studio A store in Taipei 101 has seen a year-on-year decline in business over the past three months, due mainly to a drop in tourist arrivals from China. Studio A will work on expanding its membership base and improving its maintenance and repair services in an effort to handle the expected competition from the Apple Store, Cheng said. Last July, Apple posted its first job listings for Taiwan, which were followed by a confirmation of its plans to set up a store in the country. However, Apple did not say when the shop would be opened or where in Taiwan it would be located.

Normangee Star Finance Market Industry Companies People Contacts About Our staff Contacts Terms of use Privacy Apple gets green light to test self-driving cars 15.04.2017 Madeline Patrick 0 Comment Apple Inc plans to start testing self-driving cars on California roads, the clearest signal yet that the world’s most valuable technology company wants to design or build autonomous vehicle technology. At last, the company’s secretive efforts was crowned by the success. Of course Apple’s competitors have been testing autonomous vehicles long since that time. Apple – which reportedly put its plans to develop a self-driving auto of its own on the back burner previous year – has obtained a permit to test its auto software on three 2015 Lexus RX540h vehicles with six different drivers, the DMV said Friday in an e-mailed statement. Apple does not test a full self-driving vehicle. According to the California DMV, Apple has three vehicles registered under the autonomous driving permit, all of which are 2015 Lexus RX crossovers. Many companies have said the first self-driving cars will launch in 2020, but some experts believe it may take much longer due to regulatory challenges. “We’re still in the first mile of the marathon of this race”. Apple is one of the most important players in smartphone technology. The DMV’s website was updated Friday to acknowledge Apple becoming a permit holder. Apple has never formerly acknowledged its work on driverless technology, but rumors have swirled around the company’s foray into the increasingly crowded field that includes the likes of Tesla, Google spin-off Waymo and Uber. Electric-car manufacturer Tesla started test-driving automated cars in California late past year. As per The Verge report, “Late past year, Apple submitted a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in which it said that it was “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation“. Apple began to focus more on the self-driving technology a year ago after re-hiring former hardware executive Bob Mansfield to lead the project. “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation“, the company said in the comments. Neil Cybart, from Above Avalon site said, “Apple is working on a transportation platform Instead of selling cars”. Company CEO Tim Cook flat out refused in 2015 to reveal any information when he appeared on comedian Stephen Colbert’s TV show. ← Russian Federation slams watchdog probe of alleged Syria chemical attack Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez acquitted on double murder → Recent Posts Pittsburgh Steelers chairman Dan Rooney passes away at age 84 Russell Westbrook against James Harden highlight when NBA playoffs open United passenger David Dao takes legal action over forceful removal United Airlines Will Compensate All Passengers Who Were On Controversial Flight Tense Turkey votes in crunch referendum on Erdogan powers Copyright © 2017 Normangee Star.

Apple today received a permit to test a self-driving auto on California highways. Apple joins the likes of Google, Ford, Tesla, Faraday Future, BMW, Mercedes and GM among the 30 firms who also have permits to go driverless in the Bear Republic. This is the next positive step taken by Apple where autonomous driving is concerned after Apple sent in a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in November a year ago. Apple has been notoriously secretive about its plans for autonomous vehicles. Despite the permit, it's still unclear what specific aspect Apple is working on. "This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumored, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology", Theodore said. A new name just showed up on California's growing list of companies allowed to test autonomous vehicles in the state: Apple. Apple's interest in autonomous vehicle technology has always been clear. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology, but it's also a company with a history of trailing in markets that it eventually revolutionizes. Among the list of permitted companies is also ride-sharing company Uber, who carried out autonomous testing without a permit in California previous year. It's no secret, Apple has been working hard on a self-driving vehicle. While GM is already testing autonomous vehicles through its Cruise Automation unit in California, Arizona and MI, the new initiative will ramp up those efforts. The majority of the companies that are permitted to test in California aren't trying to build their own vehicle platform. We all knew that Apple had the hots for cars. Apple, which is notoriously secretive about almost everything except when staging one of its high-profile product announcements, had no comment. General Motors is boosting its autonomous driving efforts, investing $14 million and adding 1,100 jobs in a new research center in San Francisco.

About us Our staff Contacts Home Business Health Science Tech World The iPhone of cars? Apple enters self-driving vehicle race April 15, 2017 Paul Smedley Leave a comment Apple Inc (AAPL) has secured a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said on Friday. Vehicle manufacturers such as BMW, Volkswagen, Tesla, Ford and General Motors have always been in the race including tech firms google and Uber. The Cupertino, Calif., company’s late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded it a permit to start testing self-driving auto technology on public roads. Long suspected of working on a self-driving vehicle project, Apple has never openly and directly discussed its interest in cars. The California authorities’ permission covers three 2015 Lexus sport-utility cars equipped with respective software and hardware. The firm in December sent a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that hinted at work on self-driving vehicles. Aside from the new permit, Apple has provided little insight into its vehicle-related efforts. “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation“, the letter said, which was meant to comment on the agency’s federal automated vehicle’s policy. Per California DMV’s policy, companies are required to file disengagement reports which disclose general facts about their driverless vehicle programs, including miles travelled. The country’s largest automaker by sales is testing more than 50 autonomous Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles on public roads in San Francisco, the Detroit metropolitan area and Scottsdale, Arizona. Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo and Uber Technologies Inc.’s self-driving test cars also have people behind the wheel during tests. Apple is one of the most important players in smartphone technology. “I don’t think to be successful they have to do a vehicle, and I also think it’s a pretty big stretch, without an acquisition, to build what it would take to be really successful at cars quickly enough”. So, Apple’s vision for autonomous systems clearly extends beyond transportation, but for now, they appear to be getting ready to burn some rubber (um, hopefully not) in California with their latest self-driving software. Apple had not openly announced that it was working on an electric vehicle. According to Apple spokesperson, test drive should improve artificial intelligence systems that must learn the ways to interact with an unpredictability of human drivers.

Networking | 10 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (17) Verizon to Drop Email Service by Josh Centers If Verizon is your ISP, and you use a verizon.net email address, we have some bad news: Verizon has announced that it’s shutting down its email business. This move may affect more than 1100 TidBITS and Take Control readers. (Joe Kissell addressed a number of the issues raised by Verizon’s move in “FlippedBITS: Misconceptions about Changing Email Addresses,” 4 March 2014.) Verizon hasn’t specified exactly when the shutdown will happen, but the good news is that you will be able to keep your verizon.net email address. Now for some potentially bad news: if you decide to keep your Verizon email address, you’ll have to use it with the free AOL Mail service. Verizon purchased AOL in 2015 in what was thought to be strictly a content play, but now it looks as though Verizon had some other ideas in mind as well (see “Verizon to Buy AOL,” 12 May 2015). The upside if this approach is that Verizon will transfer your email messages, contacts, and calendars automatically. If you decide to switch to another email host, you’ll have until the shutdown date to migrate your email and other data to your new address. Verizon says that when you log into webmail.verizon.com, you should see an “Email service notice” with further information and instructions. Verizon also says that it will post the shutdown date there. I recommend transferring your existing verizon.net email address to AOL Mail, even if you don’t plan to use it. That way, even if you switch providers, you can still have AOL Mail forward any stray messages to your new address. There are a couple of ways to do this: Techwalla explains how to set up forwarding from AOL, while the Houston Chronicle describes a method that takes advantage of Gmail’s POP3 import to download mail directly from AOL. This latter method should also work with most other email providers. If you’re shopping for a new email service, we can offer a few suggestions. Google’s Gmail is an obvious choice, and it’s TidBITS publisher Adam Engst’s preference. Gmail is free and offers innovative features, but it’s designed to be used via its Web interface or native iOS apps. Or, you can be like Adam and use Mailplane, which wraps the Gmail Web interface in a native Mac app (see “Zen and the Art of Gmail, Part 4: Mailplane,” 16 March 2011). If you want to access Gmail via Apple Mail or another standard IMAP client, you may run into usage quirks, since Google bolted on Gmail’s IMAP support afterward. Apple’s iCloud email is another obvious choice, though it’s not as feature-rich as Gmail. Plus, if storing your mail in iCloud pushes you over the 5 GB of storage space that you get for free, you’ll need to pay Apple for more. However, iCloud email is second to none in terms of integration with Apple devices and can be used on other platforms. Our own Michael Cohen has been using it as his primary email account since the days of iTools. Several other TidBITS contributors and I use FastMail, which is a paid service, but it works well with Apple Mail, offers excellent customer support, and lets you use your own domain name. FastMail is the only non-Apple email provider I’m aware of that offers IMAP push email on iOS. FastMail’s spam filtering isn’t as good as Gmail’s, but I’ve found that C-Command Software’s SpamSieve does a fantastic job. (TidBITS members receive a 20 percent discount on SpamSieve.) The painful part of any email migration is moving existing messages from your old account to the new one. Gmail and FastMail both offer instructions on how to do this. You can also use Apple Mail to transfer mail between accounts manually by copying messages from a mailbox in one IMAP account to another mailbox in a different IMAP account. We’ve found that such transfers usually work fine for a relatively small number of messages, but trying to do a complete migration that way may require a lot of babysitting, restarting, and verification work. Email is a complex topic, so if you have questions that you’d like us to cover more in-depth in future articles, let us know in the comments!   READERS LIKE YOU!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Jeff Hecht  2017-04-10 16:03 One important note, and one additional option to consider. Verizon is handling this oddly, and their FAQs say they will notify you when it's time to move. So you will not find any notice in your Verizon Webmail (or wherever you get your Verizon email) until they're ready. Also, you can use Apple Mail to download GMail with POP3, if that works for you. Be aware that with POP3 GMail keeps spam in a folder that you can only see in webmail. Reply Lindsley Williams   2017-04-10 16:54 In another list community, I read that Google Docs is not HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) compliant. Is there a way to establish if the various email providers are or can be set to be so? Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-10 17:16 Google is your friend: http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=hippa+compliant+email+providers Sounds like the free version of Gmail is not HIPPA-compliant, but the paid version is. Reply gastropod  2017-04-10 19:12 Well, it's HIPAA compliant IF you have a signed contract for your circumstances. E.g. paid Google Docs has HIPAA on a feature checklist, which means that they're willing to enter into such a contract. At my university, Google Docs (logged into the correct way) is HIPAA (and FERPA) compliant because lawyers made it so, but if I just got a paid Google Docs account for myself, it wouldn't be. Reply Linda Hackling  2017-04-13 14:14 So many get this wrong. It's NOT "HIPPA." It's HIPAA." Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act." Reply Scott Hoenig  2017-04-10 16:58 It seems like if you use the Mac Mail program for your mail client, or any other mail client, the SMTP/POP settings will continue to work. You have to tell them you want to keep your Verizon.net address, but that's it. The only change would be if you want web mail access. So Verizon is keeping its mail servers--they're just dropping support for their web mail application. That's what I can figure out from the FAQs they have. Reply Scott Hoenig  2017-04-10 21:58 I forgot to mention that you also need to make sure you set your "new" AOL webmail password to match your existing Verizon mail password, or you have to change that in the Apple Mail settings, as well. Reply Peter Flint  2017-04-10 21:19 Just an aside that in addition to Mailplane, Postbox works pretty well with Gmail as an alternative to Apple Mail, and looks and feels very similar to Mail, in a good way. I made the switch a few years ago when Mail got wiggy with Gmail. No regrets. Reply linda  2017-04-11 01:01 Another very good paid email service is Hushmail. They do support imap for the iPhone. They have personal and business plans with varied data storage. Works with Mail/Thunderbird/Postbox, etc. or their web interface. They even have free web only accounts. You can send encrypted emails, have aliases, security features, HIPPA-compliant, and they are pretty reliable. Reply rwwilson147  2017-04-11 02:19 Yup, Email is a complex topic. I left ATT as an ISP a few months ago and my swbell.net att.yahoo email account seems to have lost its outbound mail function. I've been using Thunderbird for many years but it looks like I'm going to need a new client. I'm having to use the online Yahoo mail site for swbell.net email Send function now, which I don't like much. Rather better to have the whole database including Sent, etc., on one's hard drive. Do you have suggestions for me? Thanks for you work and any suggestions you may have to ease my transition. Richard Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-11 10:15 This article should help! http://tidbits.com/article/14554 Reply Carol Sierzega  2017-04-11 10:42 I found that the Email migration from Verizon to AOL to be smooth and simple. You should, however, check your AOL webmail settings on the AOL site. AOL mail is very serious about marking emails as spam, even from some email senders that were not spammers in the Verizon email. I found several in my AOL Spam folder that I actually wanted to receive in my Apple Mail inbox. It's easy to change the AOL Mail setting for emails that are not spam so the emails that you want will land in your Apple Mail Inbox on your Mac. Reply David Laffitte  2017-04-11 16:46 No info from Verizon regarding the change. Nothing from them. Nothing when I go to webmail site. Dead silence from VZ. Reply Anonymous  2017-04-13 11:17 My transition went smoothly, but I'm still mystified about the whole IMAP/POP thing. And yes, I've looked at the Take Control book. I use Apple Mail because I want my messages to live in folders on my hard drive, but I also want to avoid downloading the read messages I don't want to keep on both my phone and laptop. My somewhat kludgy workaround is to look at them first in the web interface and delete anything I don't want to keep, check the Spam box for errant good stuff, then download into Mail on my devices. There's got to be a better way. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-13 14:27 There is, and it's IMAP. :-) This article from 2013 (which appears in an updated form in our "Are Your Bits Flipped?" book), should eliminate your confusion. http://tidbits.com/article/13692 The full book is here: http://www.takecontrolbooks.com/flippedbits Reply Scott Randell  2017-04-13 18:36 I actually have not received anything from Verizon notifying me of this. I just logged on, and not a message about that in sight. Where is this coming from?

The company began moving staff into the $5bn (£4bn) development this month but parts of the 175-acre site are still brown dirt. Apple has purchased at least 3,000 mature trees from nurseries up and down the Pacific coast — sparking complaints that there are none left for other schemes. The landscapers of the rooftop park at San Francisco’s new Transbay Transit Centre have taken to fitting lockable tree tags when they find suitable specimens in nurseries, to stop them being snapped up by the iPhone maker.

There is Levi’s stadium, the lavish, $1.3bn (£1bn) home of the San Francisco 49ers. And then there is the “spaceship”, Apple’s new headquarters. From the air the size of the latter is clear. The 69,000-seat Levi’s stadium is big — but it would fit comfortably within the tech giant’s gigantic doughnut-shaped campus, which opened its doors this month to the first of the 12,000 people who will work there. One of the largest office buildings in the world, it will be encased in curved glass and covered with enough solar panels to be almost entirely off grid. Want to read more?

For those who are interested in getting a bit speculative about a market top, now might be a good time to sell covered calls — but I would do it against certain blue-chip stocks. Source: Poker Photos via Flickr (Modified) Right now, the market is 20% overvalued, and stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) are big names that feel stretched as far as valuation is concerned. They have brands that dominate their sectors — I mean, think about the global brands that go along with Apple, Disney and Southwest — and because of that, they carry an extra margin of safety. Even more than the market itself has. So when that big correction comes (it will), they should bounce back pretty quickly. Until then, it might be worth using covered calls to squeeze some extra upside out of these stocks, which I don’t believe have much more upside for the time being. 3 Trades on 3 Massive Dips in Industrial Stocks Here’s a look at three income-generating plays.

The permit allows it to conduct test drives in three vehicles with six drivers, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said. The vehicles are all 2015 Lexus RX450h, according to the DMV. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts in recent years, and the permit pulls the curtain back a bit on any possible plan. “This does confirm what’s long been rumored: that Apple is at least toying with the idea of getting into the autonomous game in some capacity,” said Chris Theodore, president of consultancy Theodore & Associates, and a former vice president at Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Chrysler. The permit does not mean Apple is definitely building a car. “This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumored, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology,” Theodore said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement the company made in November when it wrote to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on the subject of regulating self-driving vehicles. “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Apple’s director of product integrity, Steve Kenner, wrote in that five-page letter. Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California – all vying to be the first to have commercially viable vehicles on the roads.

Is Pushing Ahead With Testing Self-Driving Cars The California DMV grants Apple a permit to begin testing. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 15, 2017 at 7:49PM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) autonomous-car plans have been seemingly up in the air for the past year. The New York Times reported in September that the company was rethinking its strategy, laying off "dozens of employees" in the process. A month later, in October, Bloomberg further detailed the shift, saying Apple had "drastically scaled back its automotive ambitions" and was instead focusing on developing autonomous-driving software; Apple was reportedly no longer interested in actually building a car -- even though focusing on software without integrating the hardware is decidedly very un-Apple-like. Apple then sent a letter to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in December, confirming that it was making self-driving-car investments while offering some input on the proposed Federal Automated Vehicles Policy. The most recent development is that Apple has now secured a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to test autonomous vehicles. Image source: Getty Images. Last but not least Last week, the California DMV updated its site for autonomous-vehicle testing. Manufacturers that hold permits to test autonomous vehicles are listed in chronological order, and "Apple Inc." is the latest addition. These are the same permits that Uber complained about in December, after the DMV told Uber it needed to obtain a permit to continue testing its self-driving cars. The episode was a bit absurd, since the permits cost just $150, and Uber moved its self-driving-vehicle pilot to Arizona instead, a transition that undoubtedly cost much more than $150. Uber has since relented and obtained its permit last month. (Uber is listed a few spots above Apple.) Bloomberg says Apple is nearly ready to begin testing its autonomous-driving software, and the California DMV permit includes three Lexus hybrid SUVs and six drivers; a driver must be present to disengage the autonomous-driving software if necessary. Manufacturers with permits must also submit annual disengagement reports that detail when a human driver had to take control during testing. Technology first; strategy later The hardest nut to crack when it comes to self-driving vehicles is the software. Most companies have gravitated toward the same set of hardware sensors, more or less. With one notable exception, most approaches include some type of LIDAR system combined with radar and cameras. It's not clear what hardware suite Apple is planning on using, but presumably it is exploring several potential configurations. It seems that Apple's overall strategy is still up in the air. Apple would probably prefer to build its own vehicle with integrated hardware and software, but manufacturing vehicles in volume is incredibly difficult and expensive. Yet autonomous driving as a technology has so much potential to save lives and deliver societal value in other ways -- such as convenience and vehicle utilization efficiency -- that Apple can't ignore it. Given the regulatory considerations, combined with the leaky nature of Silicon Valley, there's no way for Apple to keep its plans completely secret. For now, it looks as if Apple is pushing ahead with testing its self-driving-car software and will figure out the market strategy later.  Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

This Walmart-owned service has been around for a while, but was limited to inserting physical discs into PCs or converting discs to digital in-store. Many new Blu-rays come with a Digital HD copy supplied, but for older single-disc format BDs, digital redemption codes that have expired, and especially DVDs (which don’t typically come with a digital copy), this is a great way to build your digital collection inexpensively. The Mobile Disc to Digital service works pretty much like Walmart/Vudu’s existing Disc-to-Digital conversion, except that instead of inserting a disc into a PC for verification you simply use your phone’s camera to scan the barcode from disc packaging. A few things have to be enabled in the Vudu app settings to the feature to work. For one, “Location” must be turned on. This might have something to do with regional information on the discs. In addition, the camera must be enabled, there needs to be billing set up, and a UV (UltraViolet) account must be connected. Not all movies are able to be converted. We tried a bunch of older Blu-ray Discs and DVDs that were pre-UltraViolet/iTunes to see what titles could be converted. Titles that were eligible for a $2 conversion include Avatar, An American in Paris, Michael Jackson: This is It, Syriana, There Will be Blood, Mongol, and Das Boot. Titles that costs $5 for the conversion included Elf and The Road Warrior. The titles that were not eligible from our bunch included the Star Wars Trilogy, the Riddick Trilogy, Gangs of New York, Zero Dark Thirty, and Dune among others. What’s also nice about the new app feature is that if you already own the UltraViolet title the app will let you know. However, it doesn’t know if you may already own a digital copy through iTunes, Google Play, Amazon or other services. The Vudu app is free to download from iTunes and Google Play.

Shortly after the iOS 10.3 release in late March Apple confirmed its iOS 10.3.2 update. The company didn’t take the stage or put out a press release. Instead, Apple confirmed the update with a release into its beta programs for developers and the general public. Anyone with an Apple ID can try the iOS 10.3.2 update ahead of its release. The iOS 10.3.2 update will, at some point, replace Apple’s iOS 10.3.1 update. iOS 10.3.1, a maintenance release, is the current version of iOS 10. Only Apple knows when that will occur. The company hasn’t revealed an official iOS 10.3.2 release date and probably won’t ahead of time. Apple only confirms iOS release dates on stage during media events. That said, the iOS 10.3.2 update continues to make progress in beta and behind the scenes. And with a release getting closer, we’re taking a close look at the next iOS 10 update for your device. As of right now, iOS 10.3.2 appears to be a small upgrade for iPhone and iPad but don’t let that discourage you. There are some reasons to feel excited about the iOS 10.3.2 release. Under-the-Hood Improvements & Fixes   1 / 5 If you're dealing with problems on iOS 10.3.1 or below, you should be excited about the upcoming iOS 10.3.2 release. As of right now, the iOS 10.3.2 update appears to be a small maintenance release. Updates with this kind of version number, x.x.x, typically are.  So far, beta testers have tracked down two fixes: - SiriKit car commands should now work as expected. - Third-party VPN apps should now work as expected. At this point we're not expecting a change log with 100 fixes for lingering iOS problems. That probably won't happen. However, along with a few select bug fixes, we expect the iOS 10.3.2 update to solve performance issues for some iPhone and iPad users. iOS updates always do.  If you're suffering from weird unfixable battery drain, an issue with your Bluetooth, UI lag, random reboots, or another common performance issue, there's a chance iOS 10.3.2 will fix your problem. There's no guarantee but there's a chance. To give you some hope, we noticed speed improvements on the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s when we downloaded Apple's iOS 10.3.1 update. iOS 10.3.1 is also a small maintenance update.  In the meantime, we recommend taking a look at our list of fixes for the most common iOS 10 problems to see if you can't fix your issue ahead of the iOS 10.3.2 release.    1 / 5 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

It makes sense, as I’ve written before, since voice is likely the most natural, organic and simple UI for a post-mobile era. Naturally, secondary voice-based services will now emerge: Voice-based SEO, for instance. But that’s just on the consumer side. Enterprise voice data must be studied, too, which is why AI-based voice analytics platform VoiceOps has just left stealth to a seed round with the participation of Accel, Founders Fund and Lowercase Capital. VoiceOps works by transcribing phone calls and using their artificial intelligence engine to parse the information in order to provide insights such as an individual employee’s core skillset and any week-over-week trends. “VPs & managers now know if their sales reps are highlighting benefits or just feature dropping on their calls,” the company explains. “Asking probing questions, if they’re making upsell attempts, or asking for the close at the appropriate moment. VoiceOps then compares individual performances to team averages, and tracks progress longitudinally. VoiceOps is doing in an hour what used to take managers days.” Here’s my interview with the co-founder and CEO of VoiceOps, Daria Evdokimova. In it, she discusses the company’s business model, its foundation in cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, and what lessons any entrepreneur can draw from the company’s challenges and successes. VoiceOps CEO Daria Evdokimova Can you explain what VoiceOps does? “In its simplest form, VoiceOps is a call analytics platform. Designed for enterprise sales teams and leveraging a form of AI (natural language processing), we’ve built a product that does in an hour what currently takes sales managers days – understanding what their team is actually saying on the phone. We transcribe calls, parse at better-than-human quality, and then break down those conversations into core skills. That helps us analyze what behavior is most successful (e.g. how many probing questions to ask on a call, what’s the value of describing benefits vs. features, when to time an upsell or close attempt, etc.). Once we understand what works, we help managers scale that out, improving performance across their entire team. In short, we help sales teams close more deals.” What makes now the right time for an audio data AI? “Good question, Adam. Part of it is that the nature of sales teams is changing: while inside sales is growing, attrition rates for salespeople keep going up, which means that there’s more need for efficient training on what reps should say on the phone. Every other part of the sales stack (email especially) are already data driven, but sales reps spend most of their time on the phone, so it makes sense that it’s the most important activity to have analytics on. The other very important piece is the more recent advances in Machine Learning – it’s only now becoming possible to have a large scale voice analytics operation because of the recent advancements in speech to text, machine learning algorithms, and the cost of computing power becoming extremely cheap.” What challenges have you overcome in your path to cofounding this company? “I think in general the hardest part in starting a company is building something valuable enough that people or companies are willing to pay real money to use it. From a very early stage, we were extremely focused on not pricing ourselves out of business, which meant we needed to build real value into our product, i.e. the output needs to have an impactful return on investment. For our users, saving time by automating and providing accurate data for sales coaching is great. But by improving core sales processes we’re able to show an increase in metrics like successful close attempts and revenue. That’s where we become indispensable for our customers. Understanding how we can provide the most value to our customers, and then executing on it will always be the challenge we’re most focused on.” Any startup lessons for any young entrepreneur who might be interested in a similar journey? “For anyone considering starting a company, I’d absolutely suggest finding co-founders that you trust and that accel in the areas you’re weakest. That means first understanding that you can’t do everything, nor should you try. I’m extremely lucky in that regard — both (cofounders) Ethan Barhydt and Nate Becker have put in heroic efforts to get us where we are today. The other piece of advice I can give is to be the expert in whatever space you’re attacking. So many parts of starting a company are sales oriented, whether it’s recruiting, fundraising, or actually selling your product or service to clients. Having a passion for what you’re doing helps with selling, but being the most knowledgeable in the room about your subject matter builds credibility, and having credibility as a first-time entrepreneur is no easy feat. In other words, make sure no one else knows more than you about your business.” What’s in VoiceOps’ future? “For us, our wedge in the door is the call analytics platform we’ve built, which is essentially a very powerful sales enablement tool. However, almost every customer we’ve onboarded has rolled out VoiceOps to other teams within their company. Eventually our goal is to serve every single function of a company that relies on calls to be successful, be it sales, support, customer success, or compliance. Eventually, we believe we can become the hub of all voice data for the enterprise.” Tags: Audio, Big Data, CEO, Interview, voice Did you like this article?

(大立光), a smartphone camera lens supplier to Apple Inc., said Thursday that its gross margin for the first quarter of this year hit a record high in the company's history due to an improvement in yield rates, while its bottom line was affected by a stronger Taiwan dollar. In an investor conference, Largan said that its gross margin -- the difference between revenue and cost of goods sold -- for the January-March period rose from 70.72 percent to a record high of 70.90 percent. "The higher yield rates commanded by Largan shows the company's strong competitive edge in high-end camera lens production worldwide," MasterLink Securities analyst Tom Tang said. "Few doubt that Largan has secured a large chunk of orders placed by Apple for production of the next generation of iPhones." Largan released the first-quarter results after the local equity market closed. Largan shares closed down 1.45 percent to close at NT$4,410.00 (US$145.54) in the day's trading session amid caution ahead of the release of the earnings report. "The fourth quarter's gross margin surprised the market. It seems that investors were wrong to cut their holdings today before the release of the results," Tang said. In an investor conference, Largan Chief Executive Officer Adam Lin (林恩平) said there is room for his company to raise yield rates, but he did not give further details about the assessment. Still, a stronger Taiwan dollar, which rose more than 6 percent against the U.S. dollar in the first quarter, led Largan to report NT$1.14 billion in foreign exchange losses in the three-month period. Along with the slow season effect, the foreign exchange losses dragged down Largan's profitability, with its net profit for the first quarter down 42 percent from a quarter earlier to NT$4.88 billion. However, the first-quarter figure was 35 percent higher than in the same period of last year. Its earnings per share for the first quarter fell to NT$36.41 from the previous quarter's NT$63.06, but rose from NT$27.01 recorded over the same period of last year, Largan said. In the first quarter, Largan's consolidated sales stood at NT$10.81 billion, down 31 percent from a quarter earlier but up 31 percent from a year earlier. During the January-March period, 10 megapixel lenses or higher accounted for 70 percent-80 percent of Largan's total sales, 8 megapixel lenses made up 10 percent-20 percent, and 5 megapixel lenses represented up to 5 percent. Lin said that he was more upbeat about the coming months as its major clients continue to place orders. Previously, Lin had said that sales for April would lag behind March's NT$3.63 billion, but he changed his tone on Thursday, saying that sales for April will match the figure for the previous month, while sales for May are expected to reach April's level.

Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen If you thought your fingerprint was unique, think again. There are actually many similarities across human fingerprint patterns, something researchers say could be exploited by hackers to break into your phone. WATCH: Apple applies for fingerprint patent A new report suggests that hackers could potentially use partial prints to fool the fingerprint security system on mobile devices. These partial prints would theoretically be able to unlock the smartphones of those individuals whose fingerprints contain matching patterns. Researchers have dubbed this print the “master print.” It reveals that the fingerprint-based authentication systems in smartphones use small sensors that do not capture the entire fingerprint. Instead, they scan and store partial fingerprints. Furthermore, many phones allow users to store more than one of their fingerprints on their device, and identity is confirmed when a fingerprint matches any of the stored fingerprints. This means that fragments from multiple different fingerprints can be used to create a synthetic partial print to unlock many devices. The green boxes show the locations of 5 MasterPrints detected in 5 different full fingerprints from an optical fingerprint data set. Story continues below Fingerprint sensors are a form of biometric authentication, which allows people to use their own bodily traits to sign into their devices. Also included under the umbrella of biometrics are facial recognition and retina scans. The study’s co-author, professor Nasir Memon of New York University, said in an interview that hackers could potentially take fragments from multiple different fingerprints to create a synthetic partial print that could be expected to unlock many devices. When his team culled images of fingerprints to create a synthetic partial print, they reported matching of between 26 and 65 per cent of users. “I was very surprised. When the idea occurred to me to explore it, the numbers were very surprising,” Memon said. He added that while running tests with his lab students, he ordered the results to be double checked because the matches were so high. The images correspond to the top 5 partial fingerprints that were selected as MasterPrints from a fingerprint data set. Together, these 5 MasterPrints span different portions of the full fingerprint, which in turn increases the probability of falsely matching with a large number of partial fingerprints. While Memon doesn’t believe fingerprint sensors should be removed from the sign-in process entirely, he warns that they may not be the most reliable method to use on their own. “I think fingerprints are very conveniently placed on phones, but they’re more of a visibility feature rather than a security keeper,” he continues. The iPhone 5s popularized the fingerprint scanner in 2013, and it has appeared in multiple mobile devices since then. Individuals who rely on their device’s fingerprint scanners must first let their device memorize their prints. On an iPhone, this process involves (after navigating to the Settings page and scrolling down to the Touch ID option) tapping the screen repeatedly to let the device recognize the nuances of the fingerprint. When that’s complete, the user will receive a prompt to alter the position of their finger (likely their second finger or their thumb) and repeat the process until the device has memorized that angle as well. On Android phones, the process varies depending on the brand and manufacturer. WATCH: Why your smartphone is at risk from hackers Due to several factors however, including limited storage on smartphones and the reduced size of the fingerprint sensor in smartphones, mobile devices are only able to capture partial images of the users’ fingerprints. Aditi Roy, a post-doctoral researcher who co-authored the report, warns that despite the convenience of mobile fingerprint sensors, users shouldn’t rely on them for sensitive transactions. “The fingerprint-based authentication system is very convenient from users’ point of view. However, unless it is made more secure to different types of attacks (one of which is described in our research), we should not rely on it fully. Especially, this is true in sensitive work like financial transactions. For example, when mobile banking and credit card payment are conducted on these devices,” she says. READ MORE: WikiLeaks claims the CIA is hacking TVs, smartphones and cars to spy on you Memon goes on to explain that there are several potential solutions to this problem, but that none have been readily integrated by smartphone vendors yet. Some of these include increasing the size of the sensor or increasing the resolution of the fingerprint itself. Users can also take precautions by limiting the number of fingerprints they store on their devices, or changing the settings on their device to require the pin to unlock it after a certain amount of time. Memon states that the best way to protect your phone however, is to use a two-factor authentication system requiring both a pin and a fingerprint on certain occasions. WATCH: Tech: Small smartphone accessories for Android and iPhones “The pin still remains a solid way to protect the phone. We kind of hear about fingerprints being unique, but that’s really just a small part of it. If you take many small parts, you can match any of them. A lot of the work in biometrics is done with the anticipation of the random attack,” Memon goes on. The study’s co-authors agree however, that while users don’t need to abandon the fingerprint sensor entirely, they do need to be cautious about how much they rely on it. It looks like we won’t be able to say goodbye to passwords and pins just yet. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Privacy Policy | About Us Apple, of course, is no exception to this trend, and the latest evidence from Cupertino, California indicates that they're about to make another radical leap from their origins in computers. As Business Insider reports, the company has secured a permit to test self-driving cars in Cupertino, suggesting that some sort of pivot to automotive technology is on the way. It's still unclear whether this means that Apple will be manufacturing entire cars, or just developing the software that enables them to operate autonomously. The company has been mum on further details. All that is known beyond the receipt of the permit is that they'll be using three models of the 2015 Lexus RX450h in their testing. Unfortunately, it's unlikely that whatever they're working on will come to market soon. In 2016, CEO Tim Cook said of the project, "Do you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve, it was so exciting, you weren't sure what was going to be downstairs? Well, it's going to be Christmas Eve for a while." Tags: applecarstech Privacy Policy  |  About Us Copyright © 2017 Rodale Inc.
