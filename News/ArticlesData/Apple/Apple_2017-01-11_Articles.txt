All 3 major labels, Pandora, Rhapsody/Napster, HD Trax and the RIAA announced their support for the high-quality format through the Digital Entertainment Group (DEG), an industry association dedicated to hi-res releases. Interestingly, Apple Music and Spotify were absent from the announcement. While the DEG didn’t specify exactly what “hi-res” meant, Apple has been collecting high-resolution masters for its Mastered For iTunes program for the last 4 years. Although Apple would prefer masters at a 96kHz/24 bit resolution, it considers any master that’s 24 bit to be hi-res, regardless of the sample rate. Since Apple has been at the forefront in collecting high quality masters, it would stand to reason that Apple Music would have no problem implementing a new hi-res tier. There’s been no hint of that, however, although the company is notoriously tight-lipped about new developments. Spotify doesn’t seem to want to go that route yet, having enough trouble getting people to buy up to the $9.99 per month paid subscription tier, although it does have 41 million current subscribers, about twice that of its nearest competitor Apple Music. Tidal and Deezer both have hi-res tiers, but neither has made much of a impact on music consumers. That said, there are numerous online services like HD Trax that specialize in 96/24 and higher products available for download at a premium price. These are more for the audiophile sector, however, and don’t get much traction from mainstream consumers. That said, the natural progression is to high-resolution streaming, and all services will eventually go that way (you’ve heard it here first). I predict that what we’ll eventually see is the standard subscription tier at $4.99-5.99, and the hi-res premium tier at $9.99 per month. That’s not going to happen soon though, but 5 years from now there’s a good chance that it will be the norm when it comes to streaming.

A number appeared after Apple launched the MacBook Pro in late October. Other Apple users used social media to wonder out loud about jumping to Windows or to announce an actual move. And Windows users are thinking of moving to Mac. On one level moving is easy This level of fluidity is unprecedented. In many respects it has never been easier to move from Mac to Windows or Windows to Mac. Yet switching from one to the other or for that matter to Linux or a Chromebook can be trouble. It can be so much trouble that you need powerful reasons to move. A missing HDMI port is not enough reason.2 At least not on its own. Wrenching... Wrench number one is that most long-term computer users have invested in one or more expensive apps that don't make a good journey to the alternative operating system. This is less of a problem now that many apps are cloud-based or purchased as a subscription. It's not going to worry anyone who uses, say, Xero. If, say, you move from a Mac to a Windows machine, and use Microsoft Office then you can kill the MacOS account and download the applications to your new Windows computer in a matter of minutes. Cloud You can keep your iCloud account active long after moving to Windows. Likewise, Microsoft OneDrive works well on Macs. More specialist applications and games can be more troublesome. There aren't many third-party hardware devices still limited to only Apple or Windows. Printers, back-up drives, routers and so on can make the switch in minutes. If you like a big screen or typing on a mechanical keyboard your old devices will all work with your new computer. Although you may need to buy a dongle to connect them to the ports on the new machine. Phones You may run into unforeseen compatibility problems between devices like phones or tablets. iPhones and iPads play nice with Windows PCs and Macs, but the experience is much better when you are all Apple. Likewise, the flow between your Android phone and your Windows laptop will be different if you switch to a Mac. Maybe not worse; different. There will be minor niggles. Standardisation and convergence mean from a hardware and software point of view moving from Windows to Mac or Mac to Windows isn't a big deal. Brain However, moving your brain from one way of thinking to another is harder. This isn't so much of a problem for casual users who don't dive too deep into their operating system. There will be frustrating mysteries in their new system, but there already are in the old one. More sophisticated users can struggle. All of us who work many hours each day with computers develop habits, learn shortcuts and productivity hacks to get more done in less time. These rarely translate from one operating system to another. You'd be surprised how many you have accumulated over the years. Peak productivity It can take hours to get used to the basics of a new operating system, it can take months to get to peak productivity. This is why moving can be trouble. Within hours of firing up a new computer with a different OS you'll take delight in features that were missing from your old one. Not long after you'll start to wonder why simple things that were so easy with your old computer are suddenly hard — or even seem impossible. You have to build this learning curve into your planning before moving. If you are unhappy with what you have, if your frustrations have reached boiling point or if you like the look of that fancy new computer then by all means move to another operating system. While changing may be rewarding in the long-term, in the short-term it could be harder than you expect.

If you're a disgruntled MacBook Pro user you'd have to be crazy to spend up to NZ$6000 on a Surface Book because of a missing port.

Apple said the 'highly inconsistent' battery test results were to to an obscure bug normal users would never encounter.  Consumer Reports has now finished retesting the battery life on Apple MacBook Pro laptops with Apple's fix - and the machines passed with flying colours, gaining them the crucial recommendation. Scroll down for video  Apple has fixed an 'obscure' bug in its new MacBook Pro laptops, prompting Consumer Reports to run new tests just weeks after publishing a report that slammed their inconsistent battery life HOW TO GET THE FIX  Apple’s updated software is available through Apple’s Beta Software Program now, and will be rolled out in a full Software Update to all users in several weeks.   Consumers who want to download the new software right now have to sign up for the company’s Beta program.  You can confirm you have the new version by clicking on About This Mac under the Apple menu; the operating system will be listed as macOS Sierra Version 10.12.3 Beta (16D25a).    'Our results show that a software update released by Apple on January 9 fixed problems we’d encountered in earlier testing,' the organisation said. 'With the updated software, the three MacBook Pros in our labs all performed well, with one model running 18.75 hours on a charge.  'We tested each model multiple times using the new software, following the same protocol we apply to hundreds of laptops every year.' When CR first evaluated the MacBook Pro laptops in December, it found that battery life results were highly inconsistent from one test to the next.  In the report published at the end of December, the Consumer Reports labs tested three new MacBook Pros, which launched this fall: a 13-inch model with Apple's new Touch Bar, a 13-inch model without the Touch Bar; and a 15-inch model.

Share this article Share In the report published at the end of December, the Consumer Reports labs tested three new MacBook Pros, which launched this fall: a 13-inch model with Apple's new Touch Bar, a 13-inch model without the Touch Bar; and a 15-inch model WHAT APPLE SAYS CAUSED THE ISSUE  In response to Consumer Reports' recent evaluation, Apple investigated the results and found that a software bug triggered by a 'hidden Safari setting' was to blame. The developer setting turns off the browser cache.  And, they say consumers would never run into this same problem.  'This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage,' told Dailymail.com. 'Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab.' Consumer Reports is now running new tests after downloading the fix.   The lab found inconsistent results across the trials, with battery life as long as 19.5 hours and as short as 3.75. After the Consumer Reports team shared the results with Apple, the firm has now fixed the bug through its Beta Software Program. And according to Apple, the issue stems from the test conditions themselves. 'We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results,' an Apple spokesperson told Dailymail.com 'We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache. 'This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage.  'Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab. 'After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life.  'We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test. 'This is the best pro notebook we've ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we're glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro.' Anyone who signs up for Apple's Beta Software program can access the fix on their website. But, it will also be rolled out in a few weeks as a part of a broader Software Update for all MacBook Pro users. The laptops scored well in other measures of display and performance, and Consumer Reports says the MacBook Pros will earn the Recommended rating if the new tests show the battery life has really improved. WHAT CONSUMER REPORTS' LABS FOUND IN THE INITIAL TESTS  On December 22, Consumer Reports published their findings from lab tests on three new MacBook Pros, which launched this fall: a 13-inch model with Apple's new Touch Bar, a 13-inch model without the Touch Bar; and a 15-inch model. They found that the new line failed to meet battery life standards, and for the first time, Apple's MacBooks did not receive the recommended ratings. 'The MacBook Pro battery life results were highly inconsistent from one trial to the next,' according to Consumer Reports. 'For instance, in a series of three consecutive tests, the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third. 'The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for 19.5 hours in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. 'And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours.' The laptops were subjected to repeated tests, Consumer Reports explains, and these are just a handful of the results.  In their tests, Consumer Reports researchers download a series of 10 web pages repeatedly, from the time the battery is fully charged, until it shuts down. These pages are stored on their lab's server, and transmitted across a WiFi network, and all tests are done in the computer's native browser (in this case, Safari). Certain default features which aim to extend battery life are turned off for the tests, such as screen auto-dimming and local caching of web pages. Apple says it's this last move that caused the problem, triggering a bug in the Safari browser. Once they turned caching back on, Consumer Reports found that the three MacBooks then had consistently high battery life results. The Consumer Reports labs are now rerunning the tests with the new fix, and are expected to release their findings later this week.     Read more: www.consumerrepo...

Rumoured to feature a curved screen December 20th 2016 a month ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Analysts have given predictions of what is needed to make the iPhone 8 a winner. Brooke Crothersnews.com.au THIS year marks the 10th anniversary of iPhone, which means anticipation is ramping up faster than usual for the next Apple phone. FoxNews.com asked analysts what they think Apple needs to do to stay on top. First, the latest rumours. A report this week from Taipei-based DigiTimes, which sources information from iPhone component suppliers, suggests that the 2017 iPhone will use a glass-encased design. That supports prior reports that claim at least one iPhone model will have a “redesigned all-glass body with a steel frame housing an edge-to-edge, curved OLED display,” as pointed out by Apple enthusiast site MacRumors, referring to the organic light-emitting diode displays that Samsung uses on its Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. The iPhone 8 might have a curved display.Source:AFP As the rumour and hype cycle intensifies, Apple will have to meet rising expectations, according to Jitesh Ubrani, an analyst at market researcher IDC. “I think a redesign of the iPhone is certainly warranted if Apple wants to maintain their image as a design leader,” Ubrani told FoxNews.com in an email. “In recent years, from a design perspective, Apple’s most significant changes were introducing larger screen sizes and a gold/rose gold iPhone,” Ubrani said. “Meanwhile, their competition has clearly surpassed them by employing different materials, curved screens, OLED displays and more.” Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates, agrees. “There was a fair amount of public grousing when the iPhone 7 failed to introduce any exciting new features,” he said in an email to FoxNews.com. “A really beautiful new finish would be good. Voice control at the level of [Amazon’s] Alexa would be nice. The best and broadest video service in the world could help.” But even if Apple executes, the world has changed a lot since the iPhone was introduced in 2007. “There’s a reality that the rest of the world has caught up, and new, fantastic features are hard to come by. In 2007, Apple had as much as a three-year lead on everyone else. No longer,” Kay added. The iPhone 8 might have an OLED screen like this LG phone.Source:AFP And about that 10th Anniversary iPhone that’s rumoured this year. It’s not the name that counts but the industrial design, says Daniel Matte, an analyst at market research firm Canalys. “I’m not sure that it really matters if this year’s iPhone is the ‘10th anniversary model,’” though a redesign is “definitely needed,” Matte said in an email. And let’s not forget AR or augmented reality, which CEO Tim Cook favours over virtual reality. “Outside of that, they also need to reveal, or at least lay the groundwork for their mobile AR framework,” said IDC’s Ubrani. “Apple has been on an acquiring spree in the recent past and there is lot of interest from the developer community and to some extent the larger commercial audience, to see those acquisitions come to fruition. The AR market is still in its infancy but it’s on track to be the next wave of computing and paramount in securing Apple’s future.” Leave a comment Add your comment to this story Show Comments Jump back to top Right now in technology 297Readers Nintendo Switch: Australian price, release date, specs 219Readers This is what the world will look like in 250 million years 95Readers The Light Phone: The anti-smartphone doesn’t have text, emai... 37Readers Spaces launches first rocket since launch pad explosion MORE IN Mobile Phones New apps target tech-savvy tykes Aussies set for super-fast phone speeds Samsung to redeem itself with new range FOLLOW US ADVERTISE ABOUT US JOIN Please enter a valid email address Legal: Privacy Policy Relevant Ads Opt-Out Cookie Policy Terms & Conditions A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

Apparently the plan is to offer  the original content as part of its existing $10-a-month Apple Music service by the end of 2017. The report claims that Apple has been negotiating with producers in recent months to purchase the rights for scripted television, as well as meeting with marketing executives at studios and networks to see if they are willing to help promote Apple-distributed content. In an effort to lure producers, Apple would reportedly be open to sharing ratings and demographic information with the studios it partner with — Netflix doesn’t share any such information with its content creators. Apple Music already includes some content centered on musicians, including a documentary about the influence of Roland’s TR-808 drum machine. It also bought the rights to Carpool Karaoke and is reportedly working on a semi-biographical series chronicling Dr. Dre's rise called “Vital Signs.”  The new content will be more in line with what the likes of Netflix and Amazon are doing. Bundling original video content with Apple Music should help it catch up with Spotify’s larger subscriber base.

"Look at Amazon, they sell their hardware basically at cost — their tablets, their Echo devices," Colin Gillis, senior technology analyst and director of research at BGC Financial, told CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Thursday. "But they have a whole commerce business, as well as a thriving advertising business, as well as their digital consumption of music and movies that they pull in through their entire ecosystem...so [Apple] could just focus on bolstering those things." The Wall Street Journal on Thursday reported that Apple is building a "significant new business" in original television shows and movies. Citing unnamed sources, the Journal said the new content would come as part of Apple Music by the end of 2017. "It remains to be seen whether this is a meaningful move into original content, a space where you've already got firm No. 1, Netflix, and Amazon pouring in billions of dollars," Gillis said. "Apple clearly is late." CBS | Getty Images Britney Spears joins James Corden for Carpool Karaoke on 'The Late Late Show with James Corden,' Airing Thursday, August 25th 2016, on The CBS Television Network. Apple announced in July it wouldpurchase the rights to stream an original version of viral late-night series "Carpool Karaoke," but otherwise mostly focuses on music video-related documentaries. Initiatives like Apple Pay and Apple Music "really needs some beefing up," before Apple can accomplish the goals outlined by the Journal, Gillis said. "Let's get a video streaming service, let's focus in on getting more adoption for Apple Pay...let's get Home Kit rebooted and make sure we're on track for home automation," Gillis said. "When you look at the PC market, it's declined for five years in a row now. It's entirely possible this could happen to the smartphone market." Gillis has a "sell" rating on the stock with an $85 price target, well below the $132.65 average on Wall Street, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. "Not only are we concerned about Apple missing big trends like artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality, automation, but the services layer that everyone points to is a little bit lackluster," Gillis. Apple's services have hit some major milestones. December was the best month ever for the App Store, and Andrew Murphy of Loup Ventures posited on Thursday that Apple is moving toward augmented reality with "baby steps," training its customers and building its production capability. But Gillis is not alone in his criticisms — PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel concurred with a New York Times reporter this week that "the age of Apple is over." "We know what a smartphone looks like and does," Thiel said to the Times. "It's not the fault of Tim Cook, but it's not an area where there will be any more innovation."

 Apple's Macs were the biggest losers of the PC industry in 2016 Matt Weinberger Jan. 12, 2017, 6:08 PM 14,787 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple was the manufacturer that shrunk its PC shipments the most in 2016, with its Mac laptops and desktops ceding 9.8% market share to other companies, according to a report from analyst firm IDC.   Overall, 2016 marked the fifth consecutive year of decline in the overall PC industry, with a 5.7% dip in PC shipments from 2015. Dell was the biggest winner for the year, showing a 4.3% gain in shipments. Check out the chart: Screenshot/IDC We already had some signs in the middle of 2016 that it was going to be a rough year for Apple: In the second and third quarters of the year, shipments of Apple's Macs were declining way faster than industry average, as people waited impatiently for the company to release a new MacBook Pro. The fourth quarter of 2016 went a little better for Apple. That new MacBook Pro, which arrived in October 2016, stabilized things for Apple, and it saw a meager .8% decline over the same period in 2015, according to IDC. But it wasn't enough to totally regain the ground that Apple had already lost to Windows-based PCs earlier in the year.  A guest points to a new MacBook Pro during an Apple media event in Cupertino.Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Meanwhile, some of Apple's biggest fans feel forced to buy 'pathetic' and 'old' Macs from 2013, as the company doesn't offer desktop and laptops to suit their needs. And Microsoft says that Apple fans disappointed over the newest MacBook Pro are leaving Macs behind entirely and coming over to its Surface devices.  Apple's strategy has always been to focus on the higher end of the market, where it makes more money selling fewer computers, so the fact that it increased its market share by 7.4% is still good news. And there are larger trends at play here, as people generally keep their PCs longer. Still, coming out of a year when Apple posted its first annual loss in revenue since 2001, and when Mac fans are concerned that the computers are no longer a priority at the company, it's not an encouraging statistic.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Jan 12, 2017 at 6:22PM Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have gone essentially nowhere over the past two years or so, despite incredible profits, a fast-growing dividend, and over $130 billion worth of share repurchases to date. The iPhone, which accounts for the bulk of Apple's revenue and profits, has suffered from slumping sales for multiple quarters, with the launch of the iPhone 7 unable to reverse that trend. Sales of iPads and Macs also tumbled during Apple's third quarter, leading to a 9% year-over-year decline in total revenue. Apple will attempt to return to growth in 2017 and beyond, but the company faces some major challenges on that front. Image source: Apple. The smartphone market has become the PC market Consumers stopped getting excited about new laptops years ago, and that same phenomenon is now happening in the smartphone market. Smartphones are still improving each year, but the relative change is getting smaller. Just like how each new generation of PC is only modestly better than the last, smartphones launched today are no longer dramatically better than those launched a year ago. The iPhone 7, while one of the best smartphones available, offered little in the way of compelling new features. A faster processor, better graphics, and an improved camera have become table stakes in the smartphone business, and features like water resistance are far from revolutionary. The iPhone 7 was another refinement to Apple's successful iPhone formula, but refinements aren't moving units like they used to. There's hope that the next iPhone will bring with it substantial improvements, including an OLED screen and a dramatic new design. Analysts are talking about an iPhone "super cycle," which could spur a massive number of upgrades and return Apple to growth. But that requires Apple to come up with something genuinely new and exciting, something that it's had trouble with as the iPhone has matured. Is there any innovation left in smartphones? I guess we'll find out later this year. Coming up with the next big thing is hard Apple changed the world, first with the iPod and then in a bigger way with the iPhone. Other products have been successful in an absolute sense; Apple sold more than 9 million iPads during the fourth quarter alone. But relative to the iPhone, the iPad isn't very meaningful for the company, producing just 9% of total revenue. The Apple Watch, while still in its early days, also hasn't set the world on fire. Apple still lumps its wearable device in the "Other Products" category, which saw revenue slump 22% year over year during the fourth quarter to just $2.4 billion. While the iPhone became a must-have device that essentially created the smartphone market, the Apple Watch doesn't have the same shine. Image source: Apple. The odds of Apple coming up with another device on par with the iPhone are vanishingly small, for the simple reason that the iPhone has been such a massive outlier in the consumer electronics industry. Apple is reportedly still interested in self-driving cars, and rumors have been swirling about the company working on a virtual reality or augmented reality device. But Apple is playing catch-up in all of these areas. If iPhone sales continue to slump, it will be very difficult to offset that decline with sales of new devices. Services are no panacea Apple has made a big deal about its growing services businesses, but it's nowhere near big enough to counteract iPhone weakness. Services generated $6.3 billion of revenue during the fourth quarter, up 24% year over year. Again, in an absolute sense, the services business is impressive. But relative to the iPhone, it's peanuts. There are a lot of questions surrounding Apple's services business. With iPhone, iPad, and Mac sales all declining, can the company keep up its services growth rate if it's selling fewer devices? Will Apple's push into content, first with Apple Music and now, reportedly, with original TV shows and movies, be anywhere near as profitable as selling hardware? Getting into original content is going to be expensive, and while Apple certainly has deep pockets, I don't see a clear competitive advantage for the company. The major challenge for Apple will be replacing high-margin hardware revenue with enough services revenue to prevent further declines in profitability. That's not impossible, but it's a tall order.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: MOBILE Apple is nearing $1 trillion in iOS revenue Don Reisinger, Fortune January 12, 2017 3:43 PM Tags: Apple, Fortune, iOS, iPhone Above: Apple chief executive Tim Cook. Image Credit: Apple Apple is on pace to generate a cumulative $1 trillion in revenue from iOS-related products since the company introduced its first such device, the iPhone, in 2007, according to one analyst. Apple’s total sales of iOS-based hardware like the iPhone and iPad, as well as from software like its cut of app sales through its App Store, will reach the milestone this year, Asymco analyst Horace Dediu wrote in a blog post on Wednesday. He estimates that the iPhone, a device he calls “the most successful product of all time,” along with the iPad, iPod Touch, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, which all use a version of iOS, will combine for $980 billion in cumulative sales by mid-2017, around the time of the iPhone’s 10th anniversary of availability. Add another $100 billion in iOS services revenue, including Apple’s (AAPL, -0.47%) App Store sales and Apple Music subscriptions, and Apple will pass the trillion-dollar-mark for all iOS-related products. The report comes just days after Apple celebrated the 10th anniversary of the iPhone’s unveiling on Jan. 9, 2007. At the time, late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs called the iPhone “revolutionary.” But whether he predicted that it would ultimately account for the lion’s share of a trillion-dollar business is unknown. That said, it can be difficult to determine exactly how much revenue Apple has generated on each of its products. For instance, Apple has never announced Apple Watch sales, making any calculations about revenue from them a guessing game. It’s also worth noting that Apple keeps some of its revenue on the software side a secret. Earlier this year, Apple said that it’s paid $60 billion to developers since its App Store opened in 2008. But the company didn’t say how much money it kept. The calculation does not include Apple’s Mac desktops, MacBooks, and accessories, none of which are iOS devices or related products. Given those wrinkles, Dediu acknowledges in his blog post that some of his data points are estimates. Still, considering Apple has disclosed iPhone and iPad revenue for years, some of the information is reliable. Additionally, Apple has hundreds of billions of dollars in cash, grew much of it the proceeds of sales of iPhones and associated devices. With $1 trillion in sight, Apple and others are now looking ahead to the second decade. Dediu, for one, offered some predictions on where Apple may take its business, including the iPhone, in the coming years. “As we look toward the second decade of the iPhone, the expectation isn’t one of another ‘big bang’ but a process of continuous improvement,” he wrote. “The market is nearing saturation so the goals must be to capture more switchers from Android. Apple has achieved this with the Mac: survival, persistence and eventual redemption.” Dediu went on to say that Apple might, in the next decade, focus its efforts on the “expansion of a network of ancillary ‘smart’ accessories.” “The Apple Watch, the AirPods, Pencil and possible new wearables point toward a future where the iPhone is a hub to a mesh of personal devices,” he wrote. “The seamless integration of such devices is what has always set Apple apart.” This story originally appeared on Fortune.com.

Ok, got it TAGS Tesla Tesla News Industry news Tesla scoops Apple exec to head autonomous tech 13 January 2017  by  Terry Martin &  Tung Nguyen , GoAutoMedia Chris Lattner joins Tesla as vice-president of its Autopilot system after 11 years with Apple. Tesla Motors has nabbed another former-Apple employee, with the all-electric car-maker recruiting ex-senior developer Chris Lattner to lead the advancement of its Autopilot self-driving software. As part of his new role, Mr Lattner is expected to oversee the development and implementation of a completely hands-free self-driving system, leading Tesla's emissions-free vehicles into a fully autonomous future. During his 11 years with Apple, Mr Lattner created Swift, a programming language designed as a foundation for building applications across Apple platforms, and prior to Apple, he was at LLVM Compiler as lead author. Tesla has recently upgraded its self-driving hardware across its all-electric sedan and SUV range, fitting eight new surround video cameras in the Model S and Model X to provide full 360-degree visibility. The tech start-up has also updated its models with 12 ultrasonic sensors, able to detect objects at nearly double the distance of previous sensors, and improved processing powering to up to 40 times faster than before. Pushing further into autonomous driving technology, Tesla said the future of automotive travel will be safer and cheaper without humans behind the wheel. "Self-driving vehicles will play a crucial role in improving transportation safety and accelerating the world's transition to a sustainable future," it said. "Full autonomy will enable a Tesla to be substantially safer than a human driver, lower the financial cost of transportation for those who can own a car and provide low-cost on-demand mobility for those who do not." Tesla's Autopilot self-driving software came under fire last year when it failed to distinguish a white semi-trailer from the skyline, resulting in a collision and the death of the Model S's driver. Improvements to the software have since been rolled out to all Model S and Model X Autopilot enabled vehicles with Tesla still charging ahead with development of its self-driving tech. Will Tesla be the first car-maker to bring a fully autonomous vehicle to market? Tell us in the comments below.

Michael Hartnett, the bank's investment strategist, says there will be a perfect moment for the "Big Short" within a few months, but first we must all wait for the speculative fever to pass. The warning signs of a market top are not yet flashing red. The Bull/Bear ratio is a frothy 3.4, but far from extreme. The cash reserves of money managers have fallen to a 19-month low of 4.8 per cent. The danger zone is nearer 4 per cent. Powerful rallies tend to draw all but the most steely resisters into the vortex first. Related Content Why most economists are so worried about Trump 'Vicious cycle': the biggest global risks over the next decade Bank of America recommends "laggard risk assets", singling out British assets as the ultimate unloved play. We in the UK may think that the headline rise of the FTSE-250 over the past 20 months is not so bad, but for sophisticated investors who think in dollar terms it has been a 20 per cent haircut. It is only for the brave and nimble. Hartnett says bond stress is creeping up on the markets. The peak-to-trough losses for holders of US Treasuries over the past five months are already greater than before the 1987 crash, the Orange County and Mexico blow-ups in 1994, and is not far short of the "taper tantrum" in 2013. Advertisement The great unknown is where the pain threshold lies in a global system with debt ratios that are now roughly 40 per cent of GDP higher than just before the Lehman crisis. Bank of America fears a further rise in yields of 50 to 75 basis points may be enough to trigger a "financial event". HSBC's latest global outlook is even darker. Indeed, it is astonishing.

Markets will conclude by the summer that Trumpian stimulus does not add up to much, and that the reflation narrative is a hoax. "We believe that equities are walking a tightrope, and there is a fairly long way to fall," said the bank. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link "We believe that equities are walking a tightrope, and there is a fairly long way to fall," says HSBC. Photo: Karl Hilzinger While I do not take a view on stock prices, HSBC's outlook is broadly in line with my own. The world cannot tolerate the sort of Fed tightening now being etched into forecasts by the macro-economic fraternity. We may find that three US rate rises and even a smidgeon of ECB tapering are all it takes to detonate the next crisis. The Institute of International Finance says debt has reached $US217 trillion ($290 trillion), a record ratio of 325 per cent of GDP. What is remarkable is that even in mature economies trying to "deleverage", the ratio jumped by 6 per cent of GDP to 390 per cent over the first nine months of last year. There is almost nowhere left to hide. Corporate debt in emerging markets has jumped from $US6.5 trillion to $US25.5 trillion since Lehman, with the "credit gap" signalling danger in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Chile, Turkey, and Indonesia. Total offshore dollar debt has risen fivefold to $US10 trillion since 2000. The pattern of the past 35 years is a steadily falling "natural" rate of interest, requiring ever more radical action by central banks at the trough of each cycle. The policy elites badly misjudged the force of this "Wicksellian" effect in the build-up to the global crisis in 2008. While the subprime saga makes for electrifying Hollywood films, it was not the reason why the Western banking system collapsed. The trigger was tight money. The European Central Bank raised rates into the teeth of the storm. Hawkish Fed rhetoric from March to August 2008 pushed up US borrowing costs sharply, even though the money supply was by then imploding. Both underestimated the fragility of the system. Central bankers are more alert this time but they have not scrapped their infamous "DSGE" models, and I suspect that political pressure - from Congress, or from Germany - will cause them to overtighten again. We may find that three US rate rises and even a smidgeon of ECB tapering are all it takes to detonate the next crisis. Markets seem to be betting that Donald Trump's fiscal largesse will be large enough to break out of this deflationary grip. HSBC says they are "cherry-picking the good bits" from his campaign. We do not yet know whether his infrastructure plan really exists. There will certainly be tax cuts but circumstances are nothing like the Reagan stimulus of the early 1980s when the US was coming out of recession. The Fed's Stanley Fischer has hinted that rates will rise by 50 basis points to counter each 1 per cent of GDP in fiscal stimulus, given the late stage of the economic cycle. So either it turns out that Trump is mostly bluster - and therefore little has changed - or we get real stimulus and the Fed goes on the war path. This would push the US dollar to nose-bleed levels, squeezing emerging markets until the pips squeak. HSBC warns Trump's "tax holiday" for US corporate profits held overseas could lead to a surge of repatriation, withdrawing yet more dollar liquidity from the Asia, Latin America and the Mid-East. The key point is that the world has changed since the Reagan era. The US is no longer the economic hegemon or buyer-of-last resort for global imports, but it is still the monetary hegemon through unprecedented levels of dollarisation. This is a dangerous split. The global economy risks a dollar shock, without the trade benefits that used to offset such dollar rallies. "The US now accounts for a much smaller share of global demand than it did over a decade ago and its high income level and ageing population mean that more than two-thirds of US consumer spending is now on services," said Janet Henry, HSBC's chief economist. Whether you think the deflationary supercycle since 1980 has really touched bottom depends on what you think caused it in the first place. If it was a one-off shock caused by globalisation and the entry of the Communist world into the capitalist system, it will self-correct over time. The counter view is that it stems from a deeper corrosion of monetary policy. The BIS calls it the bad habit of asymmetry: letting asset bubbles run their course, but pulling out all the stops to deal with busts. This is slow intertemporal poison. It draws prosperity from the future. The trap closes on central banks. If such a hypothesis is true, the only way out is repudiation of debt, a jubilee of sorts. These are rarely gentle affairs.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | January 12, 2017 -- 22:47 GMT (14:47 PST) | Topic: Government : US A US appeals court ruled Thursday that a group of iPhone owners can proceed with a class action lawsuit against Apple, which claims the Cupertino company has attempted to monopolize the market for iPhone apps. The ruling, from the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, re-opens allegations first brought to court in late 2011. The plaintiffs argued Apple, which only allows iPhone users to purchase apps through its App Store, created an anticompetitive marketplace for apps. A district court threw out the case, arguing the plaintiffs had no standing to sue. The case cites the 1977 Supreme Court Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, which limited who can sue for antitrust damages. The general rule is that only "the overcharged direct purchaser, and not others in the chain of manufacture or distribution" has standing. "The question before us is whether Plaintiffs purchased their iPhone apps directly from the app developers, or directly from Apple," Judge William A. Fletcher wrote in the Appeals Court ruling issued Thursday. "Stated otherwise, the question is whether Apple is a manufacturer or producer, or whether it is a distributor. Under [legal precedent], if Apple is a manufacturer or producer from whom Plaintiffs purchased indirectly, Plaintiffs do not have standing. But if Apple is a distributor from whom Plaintiffs purchased directly, Plaintiffs do have standing." Apple argued that consumers purchase apps indirectly through Apple. It compared its business to the owner of a shopping mall that "leases physical space to various stores." In other words, if the App Store is like a mall, app distributors are like stores that sell their goods directly to consumers. Fletcher, however, wrote that Apple's analogy is "unconvincing." "In the case before us, third-party developers of iPhone apps do not have their own 'stores," he wrote. "Indeed, part of the anti-competitive behavior alleged by Plaintiffs is that, far from allowing iPhone app developers to sell through their own 'stores,' Apple specifically forbids them to do so, instead requiring them to sell iPhone apps only through Apple's App Store."

The lawsuit is a few years old, but an appeals court has allowed the lawsuit to go forward. If the plaintiffs win, one of their attorneys said to Reuters that "the obvious solution is to compel Apple to let people shop for applications wherever they want, which would open the market and help lower prices." Now, while "lower prices" would be unlikely because the sheer amount of mobile competition has driven prices low enough as it is for paid apps, and free-to-play apps work because they form their own self-contained economy, what would be interesting would be a situation where Apple would have to allow sideloading similar to Android. You might not be able to get emulators through the App Store the way you can through Google Play, but there could conceivably be fewer hoops to jump through. What's interesting is that this idea picked up a bit of steam recently in an interview that Epic's Tim Sweeney did with Glixel where he mentions the App Store's monopoly in the context of Oculus trying to drive people to only the Oculus store. I think it's ludicrous that they're not prosecuting more of the tech companies right now for their practices. There's a lot going on that's wrong. Apple has a monopoly on iOS hardware. That's fine. But they shouldn't be able to tie that market to a monopoly on distributing software, on collecting in-app revenue from software. I should be able to go to a web page and download a new Epic game to my phone without Apple's approval. I should be able to use Confederate flags, if that was our design choice, in our product. Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel Now, it's worth noting that on Android, few developers are going outside the preinstalled store. Mobile is all about convenience, and there are few developers or publishers that could get away with not being on the main storefront. The lost downloads might not be worth whatever they get back in the 30% cut they wouldn't lose to Apple any more. Amazon has made their app unavailable on Google Play, requiring you to download it to use Amazon Video, also with access to Amazon Appstore, Amazon Underground, and various Amazon services. But how much of this is due to the App Store making people used to going to the preinstalled store for their apps? Considering this lawsuit went through a multiple-year appeal process just to get to the point where it could go forward, don't expect to be installing emulators without jailbreak or third-party app install services any time soon, or that this wouldn't wind up getting settled at some point, but at least there's a fight out there to open up iOS devices. 'Golf Zero' is Shaping Up to Be the 'Super Meat Boy' of Golf Games Apple TV App Size Limit Raised to 4 GB gaymerX "the obvious solution is to compel Apple to let people shop for applications wherever they want, which would open the market and help lower prices." Since when is .99¢ for the average app/game considered a high price? http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Since free became the new standard? Anonomation Eli, would thus help you guys with possibly updating the TA app in any way? http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Potentially, if they allow other stores or distribution methods outside of the official Apple app store. Still doesn't solve the problem of paying for it, but, at least we wouldn't be betting the farm to see whether or not it gets approved. EvilDucktator I'd help do it for free, I'm sure some people I know and other readers would help. If Apple knock the update back, no harm, because the current version is approved right? err404 This isn't about competition in pricing. The rights owner already has full control of the price. This is about the developer not wanting to pay Apple 30%. For most apps Apple's cut is not a big deal, but for slim margin media subscriptions that cut makes it near impossible to be competitive. If Apple losses I get to have Amazon video on my Apple TV, but it also means giving out my payment details to every app that thinks they can get away with it. http://www.stingergames.com/ Blaine Hodge Why? To open up the iOS market to Android levels of 99% app piracy and malware? Apple isn't perfect, but they've done a great job all things considered. And driving down app cost? App prices have been beaten down to a bloody pulp with F2P/freemium apps and games. PlayStation, Nintendo, and Xbox have their own store ecosystems and that's fine too. If Apple was barring other companies like Google from publishing iOS apps, sure. But they aren't. Wizard_Mike What a ridiculous lawsuit. What next? Forcing Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo to open up to third party software distribution on their game consoles? Yeah right. This is just silly. chuckfinley Alright, I'll bite. Since the big three do allow others on their consoles, was that poorly veiled sarcasm or just trolling ? crapple2011 And what would be so crazy about that? Sure they would have to change their business model a bit and try to earn more with the hardware instead of selling subsidized consoles and then earning money from unjustified "fees" for game sales... It certainly would be to the advantage of the consumer. But who thinks about consumers nowadays, it's all about higher share prices and a "thriving economy". Nowadays the economy isn't there anymore for the people but instead people live to be the input factor for the economy, be it as part of the underpaid workforce or as the dumbed down consumer that should happily pay for overpriced stuff, just to make the virtual construct of "the economy" make more money (and to buy the few people at the top even mors ferrari, yachts and airplanes). crapple2011 Incredible that people here are actually defending Apple with this practice! Also incredible that it took this long until legal action is being taken. It is absurd that a company that has a monopoly on application puchases on their devices, and a market share of well in excess of 50% of total mobile application sales, is allowed to take a god like position and to assume the role of basically all 3 branches of government at the same time to decide which applications suppliers may offer and which applications consumers are allowed to buy. People ridicule North Korea for the censorship and propaganda on their TV and elsewhere but don't realize we're allowing a private corporation to do the same here. At a minimum there should at least be legally binding rules that cite under which circumstances Apple is allowed to reject an application, and these rules should be very strict and certainly exclude anything where Apple tries to push its own moral beliefs down the world's throat or where they block apps only to their own advantage. IainsTheName If the iOS ecosystem was the only one available, you'd have a point. However we live in a world with Android, Windows, Linux, Tizen among others. This type of argument will never work as long as there's choice out there. chuckfinley Could not agree more. Don't like apple's playground? Go play somewhere else. It's free f$&;ing will people. It's ridiculous how we want a free market except when we don't like the rules despite still having choice. Sebastian Gomez I'd still stick to the AppStore. The best stuff will still be there. Gamer_Kev While I currently use an Android phone, I like the secure environment my iPad provides for shopping. With all software coming through one service, it provides an extra level of security that my phone and PC don't. I'd hate to see that disappear and with jailbreaking now legal, iPhone users already have the option to go elsewhere for their apps if they want. Bulk Paint I don't get it. If Apple want to let you buy things elsewhere or stick to their prescribed store, it's up to them. It's their ecosystem - their rules. It's not as if they have a monopoly on smart phones or tablets - but if you opt in to their system, you opt in. That's it. Also, how do prices get driven lower than 'free'? Finally, as a developer, having to support multiple stores is a right royal pain. When Super Glyph Quest came out on Android, we did an exclusivity deal with Amazon. For a while, the Amazon store was the only place you could get the game. It turns out that all Android users do is check Google Play (or, you know - wherever they get their warez from) - if it's not on there, it doesn't exist as far as they're concerned. Waste of time. Reign I think the issue should be do Apple or anyone for that matter have the right to not allow you to "own" a product you've paid for. By that I mean once I've paid for a product it should be mine to do as I will with said product, however in the case of I devices I'm told what I can do and what I can't change and have access to. The law suit should be more geared to allowing you to own what you have paid for, saying its apples ecosystem and my purchase was me opting in to these system doesn't hold weight. If I buy a laptop from Apple should I not be allowed to install Linux or Windows on it if that's my choice? I'm purchasing a piece of hardware and there for I should be allowed to do with it as I will. Does window (which is software so is more logically to be argued I'm only licensing the software and not taking ownership) only allow me to buy products from Microsoft? Do they even have to be Microsoft approved product? The issue is we have been dictated to by Apple for so long we have this mentality of "well it's their product" "it's their ecosystem" which I'm sorry, but it's total bs. Before anyone come back at me with well why buy an apple product then my answer is I do so knowing I will be jail breaking it, and I'm buying the hardware. I also do like the operating system and with the perks of a jailbreak it's better still, I have no issue supporting Apple for the work they do however don't tell me I can only buy from Apple and I opted in to some form of legal agreement with them, if that was true jailbreaking would be illegal, that's some capitalist bs and I buy from Cydia as well as Apple so I'm already not solely buying from Apple. Reign Does this mean we could see open (rooted) Apple devices in the future, here's to hoping. Honestly I can't see it happening surely this would open up the possibility of piracy, I mean what stops a third party app store after a couple of years, allowing you to download pirated applications? Yes they will be removed from the AppStore but by that time they could be installed on a number of devices this also means more virus possibilities and security flaws as well as less censorship (which might not be a bad thing, the censorship that is). With most developers moving to some form of f2p model the piracy issue might not be a big factor but I'm still not sure how I feel about this, all coming from a guy with a jail broken iPhone. I'd love to see Apple forced to open up there devices but I'm not sure how this would play out. MonkeyChunks I am sure Samsung agents created this case and I hope this lawsuit doesn't award the plaintiffs anything. I don't want the App Store app s to be affected by apps availability outside the App Store. ste86uk Surely the devs mostly decide what they want to sell their apps for more than Apple do. Besides I've always thought the App Store is a lot safer being controlled the way it is than other mobile stores. Lamar Taylor I prefer the security of the App Store over the convenience of being able to download apps from anywhere. I have an iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge as my business phone. Google Play is filled with fake apps, virus apps, and phishing apps and you are able to download apps from outside Google Play but no telling what you are going to get. I remember the fake Netflix app for Android tablets that was stealing passwords and credit card info. You don't have issues like that going directly through the App Store on iOS.

IT and International Data Corporation (“IDC”). For full year 2016, the situation was similar as it marked the fifth consecutive year of annual fall, as per both the research firms. The Data The preliminary data released by Gartner showed that PC shipments in the quarter were down 3.7% year over year to 72.6 million units. The decline marked the ninth straight quarter of year-over-year fall, which is the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC industry. For the full year, Gartner stated that PC shipments fell 6.2% to 269.7 million units, continuing the annual trend of decline since 2012. Gartner stated that among the top six vendors, Asus and Acer witnessed declines in PC sales, while the likes of Lenovo, HP Inc. HPQ, Dell and Apple AAPL recorded growth during the fourth quarter. However, companies under the Others category witnessed a 18.8% drop in PC shipments. Lenovo has managed to retain its leading position with 21.7% market share. Most importantly, the company registered a year-over-year increase in PC sales for the first time after witnessing a decline for several quarters. Lenovo saw 1.6% growth in PC sales during the fourth quarter. HP Inc. and Dell were the other gainers during the quarter and recorded the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Holding the second spot among worldwide PC vendors, HP Inc. registered 4.3% growth in PC shipments and raised its market share to 20.4% from 18.8% in the year-ago quarter. Dell, which occupied the third position, witnessed 5.4% growth and raised its market share to 14.8% from 13.5% in fourth-quarter 2015. Apple made a comeback this quarter as it registered year-over-year growth after two consecutive quarters of decline. During the quarter, the company’s Mac sales increased 2.4%, which helped it to improve its market share to 7.5% from 7%. It holds the fifth spot among the top six PC vendors. Asus and Acer held the fourth and sixth spots respectively, witnessing a year-over-year decline in PC shipments of 8.5% and 4.4%. IDC, on the other hand, stated that PC shipments fell 1.5% year over year to about 70.2 million units in the fourth quarter. For the full year, PC shipments were down 5.7% to 260 million units. As usual, there were slight differences between the data provided by the two research firms. This is mainly due to different techniques used for tracking PC sales as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products. For example, unlike Gartner, IDC includes Chromebooks, which run on Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL Chrome operating system. Gartner, on the other hand, takes into account Microsoft Corporation MSFT tablets and "detachables" such as the iPad Pro and the Asus Transformer, which are not taken into account by IDC. However, IDC agreed with Gartner on tumbling PC shipments at Asus and other smaller companies as well as increasing sales at Lenovo, HP Inc. and Dell. Nonetheless, it has a different view on Apple, as the firm saw a 0.9% decline in fourth quarter PC shipments as against Gartner’s projection of 2.4% growth. Talking about the geographical performance, the two firms agreed that overall PC shipments across every region fell during the quarter. However, as per IDC, which shows Japan’s sales separately, the region witnessed year-over-year growth for the second consecutive quarter. Concerns Talking about the challenges faced by vendors during the quarter, the firms stopped blaming Brexit and the delay in fully deploying Windows 10 operating systems by enterprises, and instead held sluggish demand responsible for the PC shipment decline. Gartner, in particular, cited weak back-to-school demand and ongoing low demand in the consumer market, especially in emerging markets, as the main reason for the decline in PC shipments. Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner stated that, "Similar to low-key back to school sales in 3Q16, big sales events, such as Black Friday, Cyber Monday and holiday sales are no longer effective marketing opportunities for PCs since PC purchases are generally driven by a 'need,' rather than 'want,' motivation". Read More Furthermore, as per Gartner, Asia/Pacific region witnessed the highest fall in the quarter. This was mainly because of two reasons - demonetization of the Indian currency and success of China's 11.11 (Singles Day on Nov 11, 2016) online shopping event. IDC agreed on Gartner’s views on the performance of the Asia/Pacific region, but also mentioned that although the demonetization crisis in India had affected PC sales initially in the country, it has recovered significantly toward the end of the quarter. Extended lifecycle of the PC as a result of the availability of a wide range of alternative computing devices is another reason behind the overall decline. Bottom Line Though both the research firms reported a year-over-year decline in global PC shipments, we believe that the downtrend has become rather modest in the third quarter, compared with the previous quarters. For the first, second and third quarters of 2016, IDC had reported an 11.5%, 4.5% and 3.9% drop in PC shipments, while Gartner’s figures stood at 9.6%, 5.2% and 5.7%, respectively. Furthermore, the two firms stated that PC vendors are now coming with innovative products such as 2-in-1s and thin and light notebooks as well as technology enhancements, which can make customers opt for a new PC. Moreover, the two firms also agreed on the view that PC sales will witness stabilization in the quarters ahead as the demand for relatively inexpensive mobile computing devices, such as smartphones and tablets are slowing down. However, Kitagawa opined that “This side of the market is much bigger than the PC enthusiast segment; thus, steep declines in the infrequent PC user market offset the fast growth of the PC enthusiast market." She further added that “although the overall PC market will see stagnation, there are growth opportunities within the market, such as the engaged PC user market, the business market and gaming. However, these growth areas will not prevent the overall decline of the PC market, at least in the next year.” Therefore, from the long-term perspective, PCs have to compete with mobile computing devices as returning to growth is still a distant possibility. In our opinion, PC manufacturers have a bigger problem to deal with — cost of device — to ensure long-term growth. Nonetheless, for the time being, an improving trend in PC shipments will benefit the business prospects of companies like HP Inc., Intel Corporation INTC, Seagate Technologies STX and Western Digital WDC, which continue to depend substantially on PC sales. Currently, Seagate sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Microsoft and Western Digital carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Roston - Jan 12, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Following its retesting efforts, Consumer Reports has revised its previous decision not to recommend the new MacBook Pro, changing its decision to recommended. As we previously reported, Apple worked with Consumer Reports directly following the publication of its results, something that ultimately led to a software fix. Once that was available, Consumer Reports retested the units and found the results favorable. The initial issue surfaced when Consumer Reports’ testing found widely differing battery run times, including a huge range of 3.75 hours to 16 hours for the non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro. The 13-inch Touch Bar version wasn’t much better with a range of 4.5 hours on the low end and 19.5 hours on the high end, while the 15-inch version had an 8-to-18.5 hour range. The results were surprising, to put it mildly, for both consumers and Apple itself. Last month, Apple’s Phil Schiller tweeted that the company was working with Consumer Reports to figure out what happened. “Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data,” he had said. Earlier this week, we got an update on the fruits of that labor. It seems that a pair of situations caused the issue, the first being that Consumer Reports disabled the local caching of Web pages to, it says, better simulate every day operation. Apple seemed to disagree that such a method would represent how most users utilize Safari, however. Furthermore, Consumer Reports’ testing managed to trip up a rare bug involving the icons, which resulted in the large discrepancies in battery life. Once it received the software update from Apple, Consumer Reports retested the new MacBook Pros and said they ‘performed well.’ The company went on to say, “Now that we’ve factored in the new battery-life measurements, the laptops’ overall scores have risen, and all three machines now fall well within the recommended range…” The software update will be rolling out to everyone soon, but you can get it now if you’re part of Apple’s Beta program.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Gadgets Five features to consider when buying Android tablet January 13, 2017January 12, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 Here is a brief shortlist of tablet PC considerations before you take the plunge and break the bank. Which one? You may or may not already have a model in mind. Maybe you have been to the Apple store and fallen in love with iOS. Maybe you are firmly set up in camp Google and have your heart set on an Android. Then again, there is Windows, probably the least favourable operating system for use with touch controls. But don’t forget Bill’s OS will give you unparalleled software compatibility and Flash support out of the box. But if you are leaning towards Windows, wouldn’t a netbook be better? Android and Windows devices can vary greatly, so do your research and read as many reviews as possible before reaching for your wallet. We cannot speak for every Android or Windows tablet, but we know that Apple’s iPad doesn’t support a user-replaceable battery and Apple charges N500 in Nigeria currently to replace the lithium polymer cell once it dies. The only way to really tell if you and a new piece of kit are made for each other is by trying it out. Go to a shop and play with everything they have for about 30 minutes. If it suits, go home, go on the Internet and buy it cheaper. Are they too touchy? Tablet devices require a touch input to function. Granted, you may get one or two buttons on the front, maybe a volume rocker on the side, but that is about it. “Gorilla arm” is the rather humorous name for the act of obscuring the screen you are using with your arm, primarily due to the layout and touch nature of the device. This is always going to be an issue with touch input, so you are going to have to live with it. On another note, if you are particularly heavy handed or have a habit of breaking things, then you will want to either reconsider or take out accidental damage cover when you buy. Once that lovely capacitive touch screen dies, it is pretty much game over. Are you a consumer? By consumer in this instance, we mean do you waste enough time on the Internet or is your time online usually put to better use? As this latest generation of tablet devices slowly mature, it has become fairly evident that tablet PCs are devices aimed more at consumption than production. The lack of a physical keyboard is indicative of this. Instead, you are more likely to find this generation’s average tablet user streaming video, playing games, reading RSS feeds or eBooks – that sort of thing. Sure, Twitter and e-mail won’t cause a sweat, but we had rather not have to produce a lengthy document using an onscreen keyboard, would you? Do you ‘really’ need one? You have got your iPhone to keep your thumbs in shape, your netbook for computing-on-the-go and your home PC answers to the call of duty when you finally get home at night. Where will a tablet fit into your digital lifestyle? If you don’t already own one then maybe a netbook will be a wiser purchase. You will get more bangs for your buck, a proper operating system and the reassuring touch of a physical keyboard. You can also easily upgrade RAM and replace a dud battery in a netbook, and you won’t need an external keyboard or iPad keyboard dock to get some work done. Should I wait? You may also choose to wait because technology evolves. Waiting or delaying for some weeks, months or even a year can help you avoid a situation where you may have to regret for not making the right choice should any of the brands decide to launch a ‘better’ product.

Apple plans to follow premium channels HBO and Showtime, as well as streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, in creating its own original TV shows and movies, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. The company is negotiating agreements with veteran content producers to buy the rights to scripted television programs, unnamed sources told the WSJ. It likely will offer its content through an over-the-top service similar to Netflix. The move to original TV content could be a major leap forward for Apple to promote not only its devices but its content delivery system. Apple recently launched Apple Music, a US$10-a-month music streaming service that includes some short documentary-based programming. However, Apple Music has not yet achieved the success of Spotify, which has more than 40 million paying subscribers, compared to Apple's 20 million. Apple could have its work cut out for it as it attempts a similar play in an already-crowded TV market. TV viewers already have a wealth of original programming to choose from on basic and premium cable, as well as OTT -- not to mention the old standard television networks. Beyond the Music Apple's short-term strategy could be to expand on Apple Music and make it an even more appealing draw than Spotify or other competitors. "This could be a way of adding value to Apple Music with original video content," said Dan Cryan, senior director of digital media at IHS Markit. "As much as anything else, this move by Apple needs to be seen in the context of its music business," he told the E-Commerce Times. "You need a large bouquet of content to make it work as video proposition, but to add value to a music subscription service you still just need to make good content that can attract users," Cryan explained. "But fundamentally what you are doing is still very different from a standalone video model." Brand Position and Proxy Apple's interest in offering original content may be keyed to expansion of its brand and its ecosystem. "To be a premium brand in the digital space you have to have original content," said Joel Espelien, senior analyst at The Diffusion Group. "When you think of what makes HBO or Showtime a premium brand, it is really their original content," he told the E-Commerce Times. "If you don't have that original content, the consumer may think you are just a generic service, which is why even DirecTV has now put out original content to stand out," Espelien pointed out. "Apple has been vulnerable by not having that content, but the second part of this is that original content is also a great proxy for the ecosystem." It's much easier to promote original programming than to attempt to lure consumers to a service or ecosystem, he noted. "You can't put that sort of stuff on the side of a bus, and ... the consumer isn't drawn to it, which is why Netflix promotes its original content." Content Provider Apple already has achieved great success pivoting from a computer company -- one that practically went out of business in the 1990s -- to a consumer electronics maker and services company. Apple's ecosystem remains a key part of its business, and any content it creates likely will exist within its ecosystem as well. "Content becomes much more important to an ecosystem company -- much more important than it is to a device company," said Espelien. Although Apple's content could help promote Apple devices such as the iPad, it also would have to be available on competitor devices, such as Android tablets. "In a fundamental sense, all Apple products exist as part of the ecosystem that includes devices and services, but it is doubtful people would buy an Apple TV device just to watch a few shows," said IHS Markit's Cryan. "This is why Apple Music is already available for Android devices," he observed. "The bigger question is whether Apple can use these shows to promote mindshare for Apple Music and its services."

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Lock down your Mac with system and networking monitoring tools Glenn Fleishman 13 January, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments Security Any malware powerful enough to overcome the defences that Apple built to resist incursions may also be powerful enough to hide its traces. That’s not quite an axiom of security, but it’s generally true. If an attacker of any sort creates software designed to attack your system quietly, it typically tries to prevent security software and any other kind of inspection from noticing. That’s very, very hard and any exploit that’s sufficiently good at being entirely invisible is likely also good enough for a hacker to sell for a million dollars, with the advantage that the sale is probably legal in most places, and thus better than distributing malware that steals financial credentials or holds files for ransom. (I am not a lawyer, and that’s not legal advice.) Such exploits, once discovered, are fixed at high priority by operating system makers, giving them sometimes short windows of utility. The more widely used the exploit is, the less likely it will remain available to use. Unless you’re a highly valuable, targeted individual, it’s more likely that what you’d see is malware that doesn’t hide its traces that well because most people aren’t set up to look for it. This can be especially true in macOS and iOS. Most macOS users don’t run software capable of spotting malicious behaviour; they rely on Apple. iOS can’t run anti-malware or other monitoring software at all. And Apple has stayed on top of the biggest risks to iOS as they’ve been discovered, whether as zero-days (found in the wild before being patched) or ahead of widespread use. Because Apple doesn’t lock down macOS as tightly as iOS, it’s thus more vulnerable to less severe assaults. To forestall a large category of attacks, Apple added a powerful baseline feature starting in OS X El Capitan (10.11). System Integrity Protection (SIP) locks down major directories associated with macOS and Apple’s preinstalled apps. But there’s a lot of havoc that can be wrought without accessing files in those paths, and while SIP appears well designed, it’s absolutely a target of hackers. To my knowledge, it hasn’t been broken through yet, but that never means it can’t. This column is another entry in my series of how to deal with security as if you woke up and were a dissident in your own country. Assuming the unlimited resources of a government agency or security apparatus, any vulnerability that can be found will be, and it will be used as skillfully as possible for as long as possible. Protecting against such vulnerabilities helps you fight malware as well as government-led attacks. Multi-pronged resistance In the olden days, I used to run firewall software, anti-virus software and some other protective extensions. OS X was young, and there had been malware for System 7, 8, and 9. However, Apple had a very small percentage of the market share, and hadn’t built OS X to allow its email software to execute code. Security through obscurity worked. All of those different pieces of monitoring and protection software did slow things down. I gradually stripped them off, as I felt Apple had improved the OS or certain kinds of threats disappeared. Now, I find myself in the reverse position, layering amulets one on top of each other. There’s still the risk of adverse interaction and system slowdowns, but the kind of monitoring that will serve you best integrates at a level where it’s examining what’s happening instead of churning away at tasks. If you want to monitor and block potential adverse actions, I recommend these four areas, some of which have a single product offering, often cheap: Network monitoring. Little Snitch (US$35) is a sort of firewall, although it’s more accurately an app-based network activity filter. You can whitelist and blacklist permitted network behaviour by apps and system components, and have an alert spring up before new ones are allowed. I reviewed the initial release of the current version in 2012; it’s been updated all the way to 3.7.1 since, and works with Yosemite, El Capitan, and Sierra (10.10, 10.11 and 10.12). Little Snitch can prevent malicious apps from reaching out to command-and-control systems they use to download full malware payloads or transmit information back to an attacker. Firewall apps from other companies take a different approach to a similar end, but I prefer Little Snitch’s conceptual framework. File-access monitoring. Designed in part to block potential ransomware from gaining a foothold in macOS, Little Flocker (US$15 to US$25) works at a system level to control which apps and system components have access to which volumes, files and directories. You can set up rules or have it learn your system’s behaviour, and you’re prompted to allow or deny attempts that fall outside permitted actions you defined. Little Flocker operates under the reasonable proposition that few apps need unlimited access to read, write or otherwise modify every user-accessible file on all mounted drives. Ransomware gets called out, because such malware encrypts typically only user documents, which have less protection than system files. But apps also shouldn’t be trying to read files other than those you point it at – especially an app the name of which you don’t recognise or know why it would be running. There’s nothing else quite like it available. I wrote up a detailed preview of the 1.0 release in November. The app is US$15 for personal use (up to five computers) or US$25 for a single-user business licence. it works in El Capitan and Sierra. Persistent software installs. BlockBlock (free, still in beta) is another nearly unique app, monitoring for attempts to create system entries that allow software to be persistent, or relaunched at every reboot. One of the first thing malware does is try to make sure that even if it’s killed off during a session, whenever a computer reboots, it simply launches again. You can allow or block such attempts. (I wrote about BlockBlock in the same article that covers Little Flocker.) Mic and video activity. Keeping outsiders from gaining access to your Mac’s mics and cameras is key in ensuring privacy, and that kind of access is more likely from government players trying to surveille you than plain old malware operators, who just want to steal. I’ve written two columns about this, one about audio and one about video. Several apps, free and paid, can monitor whether an audio or video source is being tapped, but because that monitoring relies on the system properly reporting what’s happening, they’re much more likely to be disrupted by clever software. This is why those most at risk of A/V snooping remove mics and video (or put tape over a video camera). You may feel like you’re being watched Too much monitoring can be irritating. I was just watching some of the old ‘I’m a Mac/I’m a PC’ ads on the 10th anniversary of the launch of that multi-year campaign, and I saw the one that ridiculed Microsoft Vista’s excessively interferring security permission system. No Mac user wants to relive that. But the joy of the two more frequently invoked of the four categories I note above is that they’re rules-based and you train them. There’s a learning period after which you’re asked less and less often, because new behaviour only arises from installing new apps – or from malware. The other two categories only intrude when either something happens: software tries to install a persistent component or A/V hardware gets invoked. I’m using two of the above regularly (A/V monitoring and Little Flocker) and am easing into installing the other two. I know a number of people who run all four. The lack of overlap between them should keep bad interactions low.

Computers by Shara Tibken January 12, 2017 2:19 PM PST @sharatibken Up Next SpaceX returns to space and nails re-entry landing Apple introduced redesign MacBook Pro computers in October, the first major update in four years.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Consumer Reports is doing an about face on Apple's MacBook Pro. The endorsement reverses an earlier call by Consumer Reports telling consumers to avoid the new MacBooks, for the first time ever, because of big fluctuations in battery life. The publication on Thursday said a software update issued by Apple has fixed the battery problems it found in earlier tests. "With the updated software, the three MacBook Pros in our labs all performed well, with one model running 18.75 hours on a charge," Consumer Reports said. "Now that we've factored in the new battery-life measurements, the laptops' overall scores have risen, and all three machines now fall well within the recommended range in Consumer Reports ratings." Apple plans to roll out the software fix it gave Consumer Reports to all users in several weeks, the publication said. Users enrolled in Apple's beta software program already have access to the update. Apple referred CNET to its comment from earlier this week about the Consumer Reports battery test. It said, in part, that the setting used by the publication to test the MacBooks "is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage." It also said it had fixed the bug found in the test and that "this is the best pro notebook we've ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we're glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro." Apple's new MacBook Pro, unveiled in October, was the first major update to its high-end laptop in four years. Apple executives, speaking in an exclusive interview with CNET before the launch, dubbed the changes -- including a thinner design and a Touch Bar above the keyboard -- a "milestone" and a "big step forward" for its top-of-the-line notebooks. See also Does the Mac still matter? Consumer Reports will retest MacBook Pro battery life CNET's take on the new MacBook Pro The MacBook Pro was redesigned as people start to take a second look at PCs, many of which employ full touchscreen monitors, foldable bodies that let them turn into tablets and -- most importantly -- competitive pricing. These Macs were meant to show Apple still cares about its computer lineup, given how much attention it's focused on its top moneymaker, the iPhone. Sales of the phone, which turns 10 this year, make up about two-thirds of Apple's revenue. But demand for the iPhone is slowing, which is why Apple needed to please some its long-time core customer base -- designers and creators who rely on the Mac. It didn't take long, though, for people to complain about everything from the pricing, the lowest option for a Touch Bar version is $1,799, to the removal of the MagSafe charging port. Battery life quickly became a big issue, with many saying they got about a third the promised 10-hour battery life. Apple tries the second-screen approach with the MacBook Pro Touch Bar The new Touch Bar is as close as a MacBook Pro is going to get to a Touch Screen. by Dan Ackerman 2:34 Close Drag One thread about the topic on Apple's support site has had more than 30,000 views and over 500 comments since it was first posted in late November. CNET, for its part, didn't see any battery issues in its many tests of the new MacBook Pro. Reviewer Dan Ackerman gave the 13-inch Touch Bar model an 8.6 rating (out of 10) and said, "Apple's smart, useful Touch Bar makes it well worth splurging on the step-up version of the streamlined 13-inch MacBook Pro." CNET tests laptop battery life with a looping video playback, while Consumer Reports uses a browser-based benchmark. CNET's tests showed battery life in line with Apple's numbers. Battery drain In December, Apple removed the "time remaining" battery life estimate from its Mac software, saying the number has been inaccurate and the percentage remaining tally was a better measure. Consumer Reports' first findings from its MacBook Pro battery test came out nine days later. "After factoring together our complete test results, Consumer Reports finds that all three MacBook Pro laptops fail to meet our standards for recommended models," the publication said at the time. "This is a real departure from past MacBooks." The publication re-tested the machines after Apple identified an issue with the Safari browser that appeared to affect battery life during the publication's proprietary benchmarking tests. Apple released a software update to fix the issue on Tuesday. 53 Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13-inch, 2016) Even though Consumer Reports now recommends the new MacBooks, Apple hasn't escaped unscathed. "Bottom line to me is that this news itself does not do any good for Mac, whether or not a battery issue exists," Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa said. "Even if there were no battery issue, it is hard to recover the product reputation as this news can stick to [a] consumer's mind." And there are still plenty of people experiencing battery issues. Jeff Geerling, a St. Louis, Missouri-based web and app developer, published a lengthy blog post Tuesday on why he returned his new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in favor of one with normal function keys. "The battery is the straw that broke this camel's back," the 31-year-old wrote. "After two times using the Touch Bar model on the road without power nearby, I nearly lost it when my laptop was under 10 [percent] battery remaining after only three hours of use." Geerling, a self-proclaimed Apple fanatic who has owned more than dozen Macs over the past 20 years, said he may think twice about buying a Mac in the future. The battery issues he experienced "made me look elsewhere for the first time in many years," Geerling said in an interview. "If Apple continues to neglect the Mac while other manufacturers like Dell and Lenovo are catering to developers ... that's where I start to feel nervous about the future of the Mac."

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues New MacBook Pros stop Apple’s skid in worldwide PC shipments Agam Shah 13 January, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Apple’s new MacBook Pros have put the brakes on a free-fall of Mac shipments globally, though they haven’t provided the significant boost the company was looking for. The company’s Mac shipments totalled 5.3 million units during the fourth quarter of 2016, a decline of just 0.9 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015. That compares favourably to overall Mac shipments in 2016, which totalled 18.4 million units, a decline of 9.8 percent compared to 2015, according to IDC. Apple launched the new MacBook Pros in late October, and it was considered a significant upgrade. Had the new MacBook Pros shipped for all three months, the quarterly growth may have jumped up to flat or positive territory. But that’s still not an encouraging sign for MacBook Pros, which haven’t provided an overwhelming boost to worldwide Mac shipments. Apple will share its Mac shipment numbers during an earnings call on 31 January. Apple’s shipment numbers haven’t always agreed with figures from research firms like IDC and Gartner. The MacBook Pros were met with mixed reviews. They had new features like the Touch Bar, which received a lukewarm reaction. The Macs were also criticised for including Intel’s older Skylake chips and not the newer Kaby Lake chips. Windows PCs and Chromebooks are performing better. Apple was the fourth-largest PC maker in the world behind Lenovo, HP and Dell, all of which recorded positive shipment growth during the fourth quarter of 2016. Nevertheless, Apple’s Mac shipments are recovering, and it comes at a time when PC shipments are also stabilising. PC shipments in the fourth quarter totalled 70.2 million, declining by just 1.5 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015, according to IDC. The numbers include traditional PCs and not devices with detachable keyboards, which are considered tablets. Competing analyst firm Gartner has predicted PC shipments will go through minor quarterly declines until returning to positive growth in 2017. One reason for the recovery was a clear delineation of product categories. Tablets aren’t considered competition anymore, and many customers are returning to laptops and desktops for their primary computing needs. Gaming PCs have thrived in the last year as interest in virtual reality and eSports grows. Holiday deals boosted PC sales in the US and Europe, and the consumer PC market is recovering, IDC said. Shipments also were robust in China as buyers moved to thin and light devices. Lenovo’s PC shipments totalled 15.7 million, growing by 1.7 percent and maintaining a 22.4 percent market share. HP’s shipments totalled 15.27 million, growing by 6.6 percent, a 21.7 percent market share. Dell recorded the biggest quarterly gain with its shipments growing by 8.6 percent to 11 million units. Asus was the fifth largest PC maker behind Apple, and its shipments declined by 11.3 percent to 5.1 million units. In 2016, shipments of PCs totalled 260 million units, declining by 5.7 percent compared to 2015.

Thursday, January 12, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Apple Is Becoming HBO Shira Ovide: Apple is making the rounds in Hollywood, seeking to buy high-quality original TV series and perhaps movies. The idea is to supplement the Apple Music streaming song service with more digital video, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. Think of Apple creating shows with similar quality and buzz to Netflix’s series “Stranger Things” but available only to subscribers who pay $10 a month for Apple Music. Mitchel Broussard: Apple executives have told Hollywood that the new original content will launch by the end of 2017, according to the new report. In terms of specific genres, HBO’s Westworld and Netflix’s Stranger Things were both used as comparisons for what Apple is aiming to produce on Apple Music. These proposed series and movies “don’t have any particular relationship to music,” unlike Carpool Karaoke and Vital Signs. Zac Cichy: Not that Sony is a bad company. But I think we could all agree that Apple becoming Sony would be very bad. We live in an age where there is more good video content available than one could reasonably watch. But there’s only one good combination of a desktop OS and hardware, and it’s being neglected. Apple doesn’t have the resources and attention to make sure that PDF files work or that their customers have a good Wi-Fi experience. And of course there’s plenty of iOS and cloud work to do, too. TV and movie content seems like an unnecessary distraction. Apple should focus on the things that only they can do. Update (2017-01-13): Dan Moren: Granted, that might mean that those content providers are less enthusiastic about doing business with Apple, especially since their own shows would presumably take a backseat to Apple’s prominent marketing of its in-house efforts, such as in the new TV app that’s now front-and-center on Apple’s set-top box. Apple Music Apple TV Mac 17 Comments 17 Comments Mike Oldham January 12, 2017 4:59 PM This is by far my biggest concern with Apple. Their mac lineup is a mess. I could forgive this if I had confidence that they were doing something awesome soon. But from all appearances they aren't. They are working on movies or watches or even phones. I love my iPhone, but I think I would rather switch to android for my phone that switch to windows or linux on my personal computer. They are stewards over the single most important piece of technology in my life and it appears that they don't like it nearly as much as I do, or at least they like different things about it than I do. Michael Tsai January 12, 2017 5:12 PM @Mike You forgot cars. :-) I, too, would much rather switch to Android than to Windows or Linux. Chucky January 12, 2017 5:23 PM "Apple doesn’t have the resources and attention to make sure that PDF files work or that their customers have a good Wi-Fi experience. And of course there’s plenty of iOS and cloud work to do, too. TV and movie content seems like an unnecessary distraction. Apple should focus on the things that only they can do." Hmmm... I don't think "resources and attention" are the issues here. They're a big enough corporation, with more than enough resources to make the Mac and Mac ecosystem work properly. They have more than enough headcount to give the necessary attention. The issue seems to me to be that their priorities are such that they just don't care about the Mac, and that is the sole cause of the lack of the "resources and attention". As far as getting into original programming goes, I've got no problem with that. They've got the resources and attention to do that without having to cut into other priorities. They can walk and chew gum, if they choose to do so. And given how Apple TV has been severely languishing, (something I'm not sure if everyone is aware of), if they want to stay in that game, this is something they actually need to do. Same deal if they don't want Apple Music to keep languishing. The only problem with "becoming HBO" is that they're likely to fail. Netflix has thrown immense resources at the task for quite a while, and mostly failed to date. Same with Amazon. Same with other premium cable channels. It's really hard to "become HBO". HBO has been investing in a talent / production pipeline for original programming for two decades now, and they've become really, really good at it. Plus, as you note, the sector is massively oversaturated at the moment. Folks don't subscribe to Netflix for their originals, instead its a supplement to the TV/film back catalog that costs them a lot of dough. Folks obviously don't subscribe to Amazon Prime for their video originals. But folks in large numbers do subscribe to HBO just for the originals. Everyone thinks creating compelling, "must have" original programming is relatively easy. But it's just not. Companies keep proving that fact over and over again. At least Apple has all the cash in the world, so they've got no issues with tossing a big chunk of money down a sinkhole to potentially be successful enough to add some minor value for folks in order to get people beyond pure company fanbois actually interested in Apple TV and Apple Music. Again, this probably doesn't work, but the alternative for Cupertino is to just watch Apple TV and Apple Music slowly die. (This should also be viewed in context of the ongoing Apple/Amazon shadow war.) Michael Tsai January 12, 2017 7:17 PM @Chucky Can they really walk and chew? It seems to me that the execs/groups that would be working on this are also responsible for some of the things that already need more attention. I agree about Apple TV languishing, but to me the issues are hardware, software, and access to existing content that people want. Apple making its own content doesn’t address any of those. And, yes, it seems unlikely that they could actually become HBO, or even Netflix, in terms of content. Didn’t Apple used to talk about how they loved to say “no” and only would take on areas where they could really make a difference? Jon H January 12, 2017 7:21 PM I feel like Apple execs are hanging out with the wrong crowd these days, leading to weirdness like this interest in producing original content, or the high-end Apple Watch, and the neglect of their fundamental core. has January 12, 2017 7:22 PM @Chucky: "The issue seems to me to be that their priorities are such that they just don't care about the Mac" If you have one product line that generates a million $1500 sales per-year, and another product line that generates a hundred million $500 sales per-year, and each requires about the same amount of manpower and investment to maintain, which product line do you shitcan so that you can put ALL of your manpower into doubling the sales of the other? Michael Tsai January 12, 2017 7:31 PM @has Right, but that doesn’t explain the lack of focus. Chucky January 12, 2017 8:04 PM "Can they really walk and chew?" An excellent question that will almost entirely determine Cupertino's future. The organization really does seem incredibly dysfunctional at the moment. Perhaps putting a supply chain guy and a design guy in charge has some downside. But if they simply can't choose to learn how to walk and chew gum at the same time, the whole ship is going to slowly sink beneath the waves at some point anyway, no matter where they put their focus. "It seems to me that the execs/groups that would be working on this are also responsible for some of the things that already need more attention." Well, that's the rotten core of the problem, no? A corporation of this mega-size and mega-resources needs to be able to create groups to focus on different areas, with enough executive control to prioritize and coordinate. I mean, look at Amazon. They have fingers in pies of a whole multitude of various disparate projects. Some fail. Some work. They analyze, they reallocate, and they keep pushing forward. Amazon may be unusually good at this type thing, but anytime a company hits a certain size, being able to do this at least minimally competently is the only way to survive. "And, yes, it seems unlikely that they could actually become HBO, or even Netflix, in terms of content. Didn’t Apple used to talk about how they loved to say “no” and only would take on areas where they could really make a difference?" They've hit both size and maturation in their core product market that leaves them in a situation where they can no longer love to say "no". They need to be able to love to say "yes", and then monitor whether or not to continue saying "yes" to each different thing. As previously stated, we seem in full agreement that they are indeed highly unlikely to "become HBO". But again, I don't see how they avoid sinking money into such an effort unless they decide they're willing to let Apple TV and Apple Music slowly die. Their bigger risk seems to me to replicate their late '80's strategy where pursuit of short-term margins and profits keeps them from investment necessary for the future. Think of how much money Amazon is setting on fire to subsidize Prime Video - it's gotta be a huge chunk of the price a consumer pays for Prime, and results in Amazon delivering them video they're essentially getting for free. But it gains Amazon big benefits in growing their ecosystem. Chucky January 12, 2017 8:16 PM "If you have one product line that generates a million $1500 sales per-year, and another product line that generates a hundred million $500 sales per-year, and each requires about the same amount of manpower and investment to maintain, which product line do you shitcan so that you can put ALL of your manpower into doubling the sales of the other?" The problem is that the BIG product line has hit maturation in terms of growth prospects. There will be no doubling in the foreseeable future. Either they'll adapt to that fact, or they won't. And to adapt, it means enhancing the broader ecosystem, even at the cost of some short-term margins. It's not as if they're losing money on the Mac. It's not as if they lack the resources necessary to have fingers in multiple pies. If management is too dysfunctional to be able to do such things, well, pray. Michael Tsai January 12, 2017 11:27 PM @Chucky I think the company would be just fine if Apple TV and Apple Music died or never existed in the first place. So it’s not at all obvious to me that Apple should get into video content to prop them up. Indeed, I wonder whether those products are causing a strategy tax that ultimately hurts the iPhone and thus the company. Imagine if instead of trying to sell Apple TVs, Apple licensed AirPlay (not just audio) so that it could be built into as many devices as Amazon is. Yes, the mega growth for iPhone is over. Plus, if it’s strategic to invest billions in factories, etc., to build hardware for the iPhone, why would it not also be strategic to invest in the platform that produces the software for the iPhone? Keir Thomas January 13, 2017 8:20 AM My theory is that Apple keep walking down these blind alleys because they're forced to in order to maintain key staff. I suspect the car project was there to stop Ive from walking off and doing it himself via his own agency, which is why its forced cancellation due to strict budget cutting probably hurt more than people realised at the time. And maybe somebody in the senior management team really wants to get into content creation. In other words, since Jobs' demise, the whole "vision thing" has become a democratic process. Cook has many many virtues and is steeped in Apple values, but at no point has he ever shown any kind of vision. His only choice is to democratise it. Jon H January 13, 2017 8:42 AM Kind of off-topic, but am I the only one who thinks the "TV" app has a terrible icon and seems like an unnecessary revamp of the Video app? Especially if you don't have any apps that work with it, or use an cable internet provider that isn't supported - the unusable functionality takes center stage. Michael Tsai January 13, 2017 8:46 AM @Jon Yes, as someone who only has video purchased from iTunes, the TV app seems like a regression. The interface is more confusing, and I get bounced to another app to see some of the episodes. Chucky January 13, 2017 5:05 PM "I think the company would be just fine if Apple TV and Apple Music died or never existed in the first place. So it’s not at all obvious to me that Apple should get into video content to prop them up." I mean, from my personal POV, sure! I've never used either, because I don't like my services tied to a single hardware provider. From the POV of an Apple shareholder, which I used to be until I decided the company was getting dysfunctional, I'm less sure. If they kill the Apple TV and Apple Music, they're both potentially really hurting the iTunes Store, and more importantly missing out on a big growth opportunity for the future, as well as the lock-in potential they love so very dearly. "I wonder whether those products are causing a strategy tax that ultimately hurts the iPhone and thus the company. Imagine if instead of trying to sell Apple TVs, Apple licensed AirPlay (not just audio) so that it could be built into as many devices as Amazon is." Now this, to me, is a far more interesting dilemma. And it's not just AirPlay that'd have to go hardware agnostic. Apple Music too. And they'd also have to create a hardware agnostic platform for your iTunes Store library. At that point, they'd still have to make an Apple TV, just like Amazon makes a Fire TV and Kindles as a reference platform for consuming your content, even as they also let 3rd party devices access it as well. Obviously, I'd personally love it. And it'd likely give Apple a far better shot at prospering in the content market going forward if it wasn't all ghettoized on Apple hardware. But, it's really, really difficult for me to see them going in that direction. The strategy tax / lock-in is so deeply ingrained into Cupertino management's DNA at this point, that even if it is obviously a better direction for Apple going forward, it's hard for me to see them having the vision necessary to reverse their whole direction on these matters. "Plus, if it’s strategic to invest billions in factories, etc., to build hardware for the iPhone, why would it not also be strategic to invest in the platform that produces the software for the iPhone?" Now here may be our only real disagreement. My take is that Cupertino management is so damn dysfunctional that it isn't a question of scattered focus. It's a question of the dysfunction making it impossible for them to do almost anything well. Cook is a fine supply chain guy, so they do investing in factories well. Ive is a fine superficial design-looks-good-in-the-store guy, so they do that well too. But beyond that, what on Earth is Apple doing well these days? Not only can't they handle Mac software well, but as you note, they're not doing all that well with the iOS platform. So I worry far less that going into video content production will scatter their focus than I do about the fact that they just can't execute anything all that well these days, no matter how clearly it affects their core interests and should be a primary focus. In short, I guess my point is that this isn't even a question of being able to walk and chew gum at the same time. The question is if they can figure out how to just simply walk without constant stumbling around, even without any distractions. has January 13, 2017 9:53 PM @Chucky: "The problem is that the BIG product line has hit maturation in terms of growth prospects. There will be no doubling in the foreseeable future. Either they'll adapt to that fact, or they won't. And to adapt, it means enhancing the broader ecosystem, even at the cost of some short-term margins." No, it means they should've started breaking ground on their *next* Big Market four years ago. That's four years every Apple competitor has now had to catch up to where Apple was four years ago. And now that they've arrived at that waypoint, they can't believe their eyes when they see that Apple is still there too, quietly dozing! Whereas what should have happened is that they arrive at that point, only to see Apple flying off full speed atop its Next Big Thing, laughing at the suckers standing there agog hands full with OLD PRODUCT which they now have to shift so they can start trying to catch up with Apple all over again. By resting too long on its existing laurels, Apple has handed all it competitors a free opportunity to get *ahead* of them in the race. Ballmer's Microsoft did exactly the same thing in the 2000s: got fat and complacent at the top of desktop/laptop computing; so wasn't paying any attention when Apple—then Google—suddenly flew straight past them borne by the NEW HOTNESS that was smartphone supercomputing. ... A front-of-the-race leader like Apple cannot continue selling the same-old same-old as its primary product and expect to remain in the game. It has to keep moving forward *constantly*, disrupting itself BEFORE anyone else gets the chance, just to maintain its position relative to the rest of the pack. Microsoft failed to do this, and all they can do now is go make themselves into "the next IBM". They'll always be around making okay money, but they will NEVER get another chance to be WORLD #1—the one who not only leads the fields by a mile but gets to define all the rules by which all their rivals must race them too. Apple is failing to do this now too, and—worse—if it does lose mobile it CAN'T just fall back to being a desktop/laptop company either. Because even if it should survive such a catastrophic fall in both markets' and shareholders' eyes, there is *already* an established "IBM" who WHOLLY OWNS that particular market, and the certainly aren't going to share their scraps with anyone else. Apple should still have a bit of time in which to upright themselves and get back into a healthy position; not the lead, but a forward position where they can start working to retake it. OTOH, if Apple haven't *already* had their recovery plan underway long before folks outside of Apple start noticing a problem†, they are in FAR more serious trouble internally than a just few New Product stalls and flops. † Oh, and I don't mean silly nonsense like "talent retention" (c.f. the big news this week), because good talent *always* moves often. That's how great employees advance their careers: by jumping to a higher-placed, higher-paid job at each new employer (WAY quicker than hoping to get promoted internally). Regular movement = good health. It's employees who *never* move that are the real sign of impending sickness: they're the complacent deadweight that ossifies in-place till further progress becomes impossible. Likewise, seeing existing talent quiting means nothing; it's not seeing hot New Talent arriving by the truckload and immediately getting to work on hot New Product Development that says they're seriously in the shit. ... Where Apple *should* be at by now is owning the entire living room: huge black glass rectangle on the wall, pencil-thin exclusive Bose speakers to each side, no visible cables or boxes anywhere, and NO MESS OF REMOTES all over the coffee table either, cos everyone just talks to the unified, universal multimedia system that grows through their home via their personal iPhone, the family iPad, or just speaking out loud to their house's own Siri assistant. Always-on streaming music, TV, movies, life-size video-calls to family and friends; every hook into Home Automation so that even lighting and room temperatures are immaculately integrated and seamlessly streamlined; a *house* that *looks after you*; a home that *knows you* even better than you know yourself. iPhone and iPad are still there, of course, but now they're no longer the Big Product, just a now-totally familiar, largely unremarked, traveling companion to the customer whose assigned role now is simply to tie it all together. And all this might've happened by now too, had The Steve's wetware not chosen that particular moment to pack up and quit. ... Peanut gallery members like to scold Apple right now for forgetting how to produce great products, but it's not new products that Apple's forgotten how to create, it's new markets. Chucky January 13, 2017 11:33 PM "Where Apple *should* be at by now is owning the entire living room: huge black glass rectangle on the wall, pencil-thin exclusive Bose speakers to each side, no visible cables or boxes anywhere, and NO MESS OF REMOTES all over the coffee table either, cos everyone just talks to the unified, universal multimedia system" That'd be terrific! If only Apple owned all the content production companies and all the monopoly last-mile wireline MSO's, they could make that come true! Easily! (When Steve-o kept saying the Apple TV was only a hobby because they lacked a "go to market strategy", he wasn't just blowing smoke. He was talking common sense. Unlike the music companies with their brain-dead no-DRM CD format, the film/TV industry had a plan to keep Apple from drinking their milkshake. They took notes from Apple's music takeover, and actually learned lessons!) "Peanut gallery members like to scold Apple right now for forgetting how to produce great products, but it's not new products that Apple's forgotten how to create, it's new markets." Of course, there also the concept that the iPod, which directly lead into the iPhone, was a one-off. There is no "new market" like that one. You can only discover the Americas once. And in that scenario, Apple is Spain. Other companies will be England, because they understand that while you can only discover the Americas once, how you manage that discovery is the difference between short-term milking that discovery, and creating thriving business lines - aka "great products" around that discovery. But in the meantime, they still sure know how to manage supply chains, no? Hurrah! Chucky January 13, 2017 11:40 PM "The TV is going to lose until there's a better--until there's a viable--go to market strategy," Jobs said. "Otherwise you're just making another Tivo. It's not a problem with technology, not a problem with vision, it's a fundamental go to market problem." Asked if it made sense to partner with a major cable company the way Apple partnered with AT&T to bring the iPhone to market, Jobs said, "Well then you run into another problem. Which is: there isn't a cable operator that's national. There's a bunch of cable operators. "And then it not like there's a GSM standard where you build a phone for the US and it also works in all these other countries. No, every single country has different standards, different government approvals, it's very… Tower of Bableish. No, balkanized." Jobs concluded by saying "I'm sure smarter people than us will figure this out, but that's why we say Apple TV a hobby; that's why we use that phrase." I love my TiVo, FWIW. It's an absolutely kickass product. Beats the hell out of all the competition. My recorded cable shows and my OTT shows all in one unified list. You can pry it out of my cold, dead hands. Less than 1% market share. Stay up-to-date by subscribing to the Comments RSS Feed for this post.

Don't Miss: New Galaxy S8 leak says the headphone jack is here to stay “With the updated software,” CR writes, “the three MacBook Pros in our labs all performed well, with one model running 18.75 hours on a charge. We tested each model multiple times using the new software, following the same protocol we apply to hundreds of laptops every year.” Consequently, Consumer Reports has now bestowed Apple’s refreshed MacBook Pro line with a “Buy” recommendation. As to how the whole saga got started in the first place, Consumer Reports‘ initial testing found that battery life on Apple’s new MacBook Pro models varied wildly. On the non-Touch Bar model, for example, testers found that battery life fluctuated between 4.5 hours on the low-end and 19.5 hours on the high-end. After looking into the matter, Apple discovered that Consumer Reports conducted its testing with a hidden Safari setting (meant only for developers) turned on. According to Apple, the setting is not “used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage.” Apple also discovered that the use of this developer setting “triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab.” Trending right now: New Galaxy S8 leak says the headphone jack is here to stay The iPhone 7’s screen scratches like crazy, but we’ll show you how to keep it looking new The NES Classic Edition was in stock at Best Buy for just 20 minutes See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next 9 tech-friendly gifts for people obsessed with travel Yahoo Tech 2017 Honda CR-V Central Iowa Honda DealersSponsored Galaxy S7, S7 Edge Get Android Nougat Update International Business Times Showdown in the South China Sea: China’s artificial islands explained Digital Trends Wristband monitors your blood alcohol content while you drink Yahoo Tech Marijuana Millionaire #2 MONEY MORNINGSponsored Got 50 bucks burning a hole in your pocket?

 Consumer Reports just changed its mind and now recommends the new MacBook Pro Kif Leswing Jan. 12, 2017, 5:43 PM 18,720 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Shortly before Christmas, Consumer Reports, one of the most-trusted product review groups for over 80 years, said that Apple's lastest MacBook Pro had seriously inconsistent battery life, which meant that it couldn't give the computer its coveted "recommended" rating. But Apple said that it didn't understand the battery life test Consumer Reports used, and Apple's head of marketing Phil Schiller said it would work with Consumer Reports to "understand their battery tests." On Thursday, Consumer Reports said that after Apple fixed a bug, it could now give the MacBook Pro a "recommended" rating. In fact, after applying Apple's bug fix, Consumer Reports said it found the new MacBook Pro models get great battery life: The three MacBook Pros in our labs include two 13-inch models, one with Apple’s new Touch Bar and one without the Touch Bar; and a 15-inch model. (All 15-inch MacBook Pros come with the Touch Bar.) The new average battery-life results are, in order, 15.75 hours, 18.75 hours, and 17.25 hours. Consumer Reports continues to insist that its testing issues were caused by a specific Apple bug that it uncovered.  But in a statement provided to Business Insider earlier this week, Apple said that Consumer Reports' testing did "not reflect real-world usage." Apple said that Consumer Reports used a "hidden Safari setting" in its testing that consumers don't typically turn on.  Regardless of the spat, Apple's newest laptop is now one of the laptops that Consumer Reports can recommend to its readers.  The bug that Consumer Reports discovered was fixed in a recent beta version of MacOS, and will be rolled out to users in the coming weeks.  SEE ALSO: Apple just issued an official explanation why its new MacBook Pros failed Consumer Reports’ battery tests More: Consumer Reports Apple MacBook Pro Recommendations Battery Life batteries Macs macOS facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Consumer Reports just changed its mind and now recommends the new MacBook Pro Consumer Reports just changed its mind and now recommends the new MacBook Pro Shortly before Christmas, Consumer Reports, one...

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling revives a long-simmering legal challenge originally filed in 2012 taking aim at Apple's practice of only allowing iPhones to run apps purchased from its own App Store.  A group of iPhone users sued saying the Cupertino, California, company's practice was anticompetitive. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling revives a long-simmering legal challenge originally filed in 2012 taking aim at Apple's practice of only allowing iPhones to run apps purchased from its own App Store. APPY NEW YEAR  Apple said customers spent nearly $240 million on apps and in-app purchases on New Year's Day, the biggest sales day ever.  App Store sales topped more than $3 billion in December, helped by the launch of Nintendo Co Ltd's Super Mario Run, which was downloaded more than 40 million times in the first four days after its launch.  Apple had argued that users did not have standing to sue it because they purchased apps from developers, with Apple simply renting out space to those developers. Developers pay a cut of their revenues to Apple in exchange for the right to sell in the App Store.  A lower court sided with Apple, but Judge William A. Fletcher ruled that iPhone users purchase apps directly from Apple, which gives iPhone users the right to bring a legal challenge against Apple. Apple declined to comment. The courts have yet to address the substance of the iPhone users' allegations; up until this point, the wrangling has been over whether they have the right to sue Apple in the first place. But if the challenge ultimately succeeds, 'the obvious solution is to compel Apple to let people shop for applications wherever they want, which would open the market and help lower prices,' Mark C. Rifkin, an attorney with Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz representing the group of iPhone users, told Reuters in an interview.

MailOnline gives its verdict on Nintendo's latest console While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing.

Court revives suit alleging Apple monopoly on iPhone apps Updated: Jan 12, 2017 - 4:44 PM Twtter SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A federal appeals court has revived a lawsuit accusing Apple of having an illegal monopoly on the sale of iPhone apps. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Thursday the plaintiffs have the right to sue Apple because they purchased apps directly from the company. Apple had argued that it did not sell apps, but instead acted as an intermediary used by the app developers. The ruling overturned a lower court decision dismissing the lawsuit. An email to Apple was not immediately returned. The lawsuit says Apple only allows developers to sell iPhone apps through its App Store. The lawsuit says Apple gets 30 percent of a customer's payment for an app developed by a third party. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Follow TechnoBuffalo After initially giving Apple’s latest MacBook Pro a rating of “Do Not Recommend,” Consumer Reports has reversed course. The website provided an update on Thursday saying it now recommends the laptop after retesting the laptop’s battery life. When Consumer Reports first evaluated Apple’s new laptop in December, testers found battery life to be poor (similar to a lot of other reports). This prevented the website from recommending the new device, although it received strong scores in other categories. Thanks to a recent software update, which is currently in beta, battery life has improved dramatically, according to Consumer Reports, besting even Apple’s own 10-hour estimates in certain situations. Consumer Reports says all three models fall well within its recommended range. The three MacBook Pros in our labs include two 13-inch models, one with Apple’s new Touch Bar and one without the Touch Bar; and a 15-inch model. (All 15-inch MacBook Pros come with the Touch Bar.) The new average battery-life results are, in order, 15.75 hours, 18.75 hours, and 17.25 hours. We bought the three computers at retail, as we do with other products rated by Consumer Reports, to ensure that we are testing the same models a consumer would buy. That’s a dramatic increase Of course, battery life always depends on what you’re doing, so don’t expect to match the findings revealed by Consumer Reports exactly. We experienced similar battery issues, as noted in our review, so we’ll update as necessary if we notice any significant changes. You can test out the latest macOS beta by signing up for Apple’s beta software program. If you’re uncomfortable using beta software on your main machine, you can wait until the consumer release hits, which should be any day now.

The ruling is a reversal of the decision reached by a lower court in 2013, which sided with Apple. For its defense, Apple argued that it was renting out space in the App Store, thus meaning that users did not have the right to sue in the first place. Apple stated that, because the app developers themselves set the price, they are the ones responsible for any lawsuits, but the appeals court overruled that. The case originated in 2012 when Apple was challenged for its practice of only allowing users to only run apps from the App Store, thus having been approved by the company itself. The issue brought forth in the original case, titled Pepper et al v. Apple Inc, alleged that Apple’s practice of restricting the iOS App Store leads to a lack of competition and higher app prices. Today’s ruling doesn’t speak on that allegation, though. Instead, it simply rules that iOS users have the right to sue. Now that the decision concerning the right to sue has been reached, the original case can move forward. An attorney for the plaintiffs in the case explained to Reuters that the goal here is for Apple to open up the app ecosystem to allow users to be able to buy and download apps from third-party sources. That outcomes seems incredibly unlikely seeing the security issues that surround it, but a damages payment is also suggested: But if the challenge ultimately succeeds, “the obvious solution is to compel Apple to let people shop for applications wherever they want, which would open the market and help lower prices,” Mark C. Rifkin, an attorney with Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz representing the group of iPhone users, told Reuters in an interview. “The other alternative is for Apple to pay people damages for the higher than competitive prices they’ve had to pay historically because Apple has utilized its monopoly.” There’s currently no date set for a decision on the original case of whether or not Apple has monopolized the iOS app market, but it will now move forward thanks to today’s ruling.

The Cupertino company argued the users did not have grounds to sue because they bought apps from developers, meaning developers set the prices instead of Apple. Developers hand over 30 percent of their earnings to Apple in exchange for the right to sell in the App Store, according to the San Francisco Gate. The group taking action against Apple says the commission have cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars. The plaintiffs are looking to dismiss the commissions or allows developers to sell their products outside the App Store. The ruling would cover all apps sold between 2008, the year the App Store was launched, through 2013.

Wang Obsession Glass January 12, 2017 Fool's gold. (Reuters/Mike Blake) Share Written by Amy X. Wang Obsession Glass January 12, 2017 Shiny and bright is the future of Netflix right now. The video streaming service took a bet on original television programming that has paid off in spades: Sci-fi adventure Stranger Things dominated water-cooler talk last summer, royal drama The Crown snagged top awards at the Golden Globes, and critics are keenly eyeing what’s next. Now Apple—a recent expert at copycat moves—wants in on that success. In 2017, the tech giant will make a “significant” foray into original TV shows and movies, the Wall Street Journal reported today (paywall). Sources say Apple has been in talks with veteran Hollywood producers for months, aiming to put out high-quality original content—think Stranger Things, or HBO’s Westworld—by the end of the year. But here’s what’s odd: Rather than making its original programming a standalone product, Apple will offer the content exclusively through Apple Music, its $10-a-month music-streaming service. As the company’s growth slows, Apple CEO Tim Cook seems to think bolstering Apple Music offerings will attract more users. It’s not the worst bet—Apple Music amassed 20 million subscribers in its first year of existence—but it means the company is missing out on a major opportunity for innovation. While the market for original scripted content is quite saturated—Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime are all big players—the market for original films and other less-abundant video formats remains almost unexplored. Apple’s longstanding ties to Hollywood (dating back to the glory days of iTunes movie rentals) could have made for an ambitious project to revitalize the sluggish movie industry, with perhaps an entirely new style of video-streaming, or a game-changing pricing model. Among Apple’s more successful videos so far, for example, was an exclusive documentary of Taylor Swift’s 1989 world tour, a lengthy one-shot that Netflix and its ilk don’t seem interested in pursuing at the moment. Instead, Apple seems to be approaching video half-heartedly, as a mere add-on to one small part of its massive operations. Historically, Apple products have either solved a problem for consumers, or introduced them to some insanely useful tool they didn’t know they needed (see: the Macintosh, the iTunes store, the release of the iPhone into a sleepy 2007 mobile tech market). Post-Jobs, the company has has struggled to maintain that momentum. By tacking video onto Apple Music and shying away from, say, the creation of “Apple Entertainment,” it seems Apple is resigning itself to a different future—one that leaves its reputation for innovation in the past.

Not having this feature available to me in my city, I have no idea if Apple's latest transit maps patent application is confirming a feature already in place or one in the works. However, considering that the patent was only filed a little over three months, it's likely a new feature. Apple's invention for transit maps revealed today comprises of a method for displaying incident reports for a user's specific favorite transit line and/or stations. In some embodiments, a reported incident can be an incident about the overall transit line, a portion of the transit line, or one or more stations along the transit line.   Apple's patent FIGS. 14 and 15 illustrate two different examples of transit incident reports that the map application can generate and display in the condensed incident reporting pane; FIG. 18 and 19 illustrates one examples of expanded incident reports that could be displayed in the incident reporting pane;   Apple's patent FIG. 20 noted above illustrates an example of a transit incident card that the map application shows when any entry in the expanded incident report is selected.   Apple's patent application 20170010118 was filed back in September 2016.

Advisor Insights Newsletters Site Log In Advisor Insights Log In Apple Is Pursuing The Holy Grail of Original Content (AAPL) By Chris Ciaccia | January 12, 2017 — 3:09 PM EST Like Indiana Jones, Apple is finally going after the Holy Grail. A report from The Wall Street Journal notes that Apple is talking with Hollywood producers about bringing original TV shows and movies to its Apple Music service, which would place it in direct competition with Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, HBO and others. Apple has dipped its toes in the original content waters before, getting exclusive licenses for Apple Music with artists like Taylor Swift and Frank Ocean, as well as producing TV shows about Dr. Dre (Apple owns Beats, which was started by the venerable rapper) as well as Planet of the Apps, but this is different. According to report, Apple wants to go head-to-head with shows like Westworld, Stranger Things and other critically acclaimed content. Saying it wants to compete with these sorts of shows and actually doing so are two very different things. There are plenty of programs with premises that should have worked but didn't, for various reasons, such as HBO's Vinyl, Netflix's Marco Polo, and The Get Down, to name a few. Content is a tricky business and it can be very subjective, no matter how much data a company possesses. Nearly every single channel passed on Stranger Things before Netflix took a chance on it. There's the very real chance Apple will buy a TV show or movie it thinks is going to be a hit with its subscribers and for whatever reason, it doesn't work out. Still, Apple going deeper into original content is the right move, for a number of reasons. Apple needs another growth engine to shift focus away from the slowdown in iPhone sales and currently, the only part of the company that is experiencing growth is the services business, led by Apple Music, which now has more than 20 million paying subscribers. By adding TV shows and movies, it would help broaden the appeal of the service, especially if it gets a hit show or movie that isn't available elsewhere. It would also give Apple more clout with Hollywood studios, should it ever decide to revisit the idea of a skinny bundle for television networks, much like Sling TV, DirecTV Now or the upcoming service from Hulu. Many have talked about Apple buying Netflix, which in theory, is a good idea, because of the huge lead in subscribers it has over Apple. However, once you dig down into the idea, it would cost Apple considerable amounts of money to both buy the company and its off-balance sheet liabilities, rights to shows it doesn't own and other obligations that would make for a messy and very expensive deal. By going alone and skipping billions in upfront spend to acquire Netflix, Apple is pursuing the hard job of building a media company. If it manages (and it's a big if) to produce hit TV shows or get its hands on hit movies, or eventually produce its own movies, Apple will have seized the holy grail of the content business and provide it with another major growth driver. There's just one big problem: nearly every other big consumer tech company on earth is trying the same trick. STOCKS: AAPL, GOOGL, FB, AMZN, NFLX, PYPL Trending How Hard are the CFA Exams?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple’s iPhone Completes 10 Years: Here’s the Timeline of Its Achievements By Zara Ali Posted Jan 9, 2017 12Shares Share Tweet Submit We all remember how the first iPhone changed the face and fate of the smartphone industry, and today is the day when the ‘revolutionary product’ completes its tenth year. Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone on January 9 at Macworld 2007 in San Francisco. It came with a 3.5-inch display and Apple defined it as ‘a revolutionary and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone.’ The first iPhone hit the store shelves six months after its announcement, and now ten years later, Apple boasts over 1 billion units sold globally. It is noteworthy to point out that ever since the first launch, Apple witnessed rising sales charts except for the year 2016 that marked its first ever decline. However, iPhone still retains the spot of Apple’s most successful product by generating 60 percent of the company’s total revenue. In an official blog post, Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing said, “It is amazing that from the very first iPhone through to today’s newest iPhone 7 Plus, it has remained the gold standard by which all other smartphones are judged. For many of us, iPhone has become the most essential device in our lives and we love it.” To recall, Apple disrupted the smartphone industry which was then ruled by Nokia and BlackBerry. Isn’t it ironical that BlackBerry is in a crumbling state now while Nokia is desperately struggling for its comeback? Steve Jobs once mocked BlackBerry and Nokia by calling their handsets “not so smart” and “not so easy to use.” Jobs even criticized BlackBerry’s QWERTY keypad. Facebook Announces 'Lifestage' - A Video-Based Social App For Teens Steve Jobs practiced for perfection at the first launch At the time of the launch of first iPhone, the team faced a lot of hurdles due to the constant lags in the functioning of the prototype. History has it that Jobs rehearsed the demo speech for six days, but the team failed to keep the phone running smoothly throughout the demo. Sometimes the phone would freeze or shut down unexpectedly. Advertisement The engineers then took steps to ensure Wi-Fi signals and connectivity throughout the event. The team separated the Wi-Fi that was used by Jobs on stage so that the audience does not jump on the same server. AT&T provided a portable cell tower to ensure the exclusivity and signal strength of Wi-Fi used by Jobs to make the demo phone call. Apple has been adding a lot of new features and functions to its iPhone lineup with each passing year. In the year 2008, the company integrated App Store and 3G network support Video Recording and Personal Hotspot in 2009 Retina display in 2010 Siri and iCloud in 2011 Bigger 4-inch screen in 2012 Touch ID in 2013 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays in 2014 3D Touch, Live Photos, and 4K video recording in 2015 Waterproofing and dual-lens camera in 2016 iPhones Interestingly, Jobs was not convinced with the integration of third-party apps in iPhone. He even told the developers that Safari browser could handle most of the work. In a conversation with John Markoff of The New York Times, Jobs said,“You don’t want your phone to be like a PC. The last thing you want is to have loaded three apps on your phone and then you go to make a call and it doesn’t work anymore. These are more like iPods than they are like computers.” iPhone 7 Plus Ad Focuses on Its Camera Prowess – Says It Is as Good as a Movie Camera What’s next for the iPhone? This year we will see the Cupertino giant coming up with the iPhone 8, which is rumored to feature curved OLED display (panels provided by Samsung) and bezel-less edge to edge screen. Many reports also suggest that Apple might finally ditch the physical Home button. The upcoming iPhone is expected to come with Touch ID embedded directly into the screen. This, coupled with a glass back and wireless charging will mark a lot of overhauls on the smartphone. We’re just hoping for some visual leaks to take place in the meantime.

Computers by Shara Tibken January 12, 2017 2:19 PM PST @sharatibken Up Next SpaceX returns to space and nails re-entry landing Apple introduced redesign MacBook Pro computers in October, the first major update in four years.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Consumer Reports is doing an about face on Apple's MacBook Pro. The endorsement reverses an earlier call by Consumer Reports telling consumers to avoid the new MacBooks, for the first time ever, because of big fluctuations in battery life. The publication on Thursday said a software update issued by Apple has fixed the battery problems it found in earlier tests. "With the updated software, the three MacBook Pros in our labs all performed well, with one model running 18.75 hours on a charge," Consumer Reports said. "Now that we've factored in the new battery-life measurements, the laptops' overall scores have risen, and all three machines now fall well within the recommended range in Consumer Reports ratings." Apple plans to roll out the software fix it gave Consumer Reports to all users in several weeks, the publication said. Users enrolled in Apple's beta software program already have access to the update. Apple referred CNET to its comment from earlier this week about the Consumer Reports battery test. It said, in part, that the setting used by the publication to test the MacBooks "is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage." It also said it had fixed the bug found in the test and that "this is the best pro notebook we've ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we're glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro." Apple's new MacBook Pro, unveiled in October, was the first major update to its high-end laptop in four years. Apple executives, speaking in an exclusive interview with CNET before the launch, dubbed the changes -- including a thinner design and a Touch Bar above the keyboard -- a "milestone" and a "big step forward" for its top-of-the-line notebooks. See also Does the Mac still matter? Consumer Reports will retest MacBook Pro battery life CNET's take on the new MacBook Pro The MacBook Pro was redesigned as people start to take a second look at PCs, many of which employ full touchscreen monitors, foldable bodies that let them turn into tablets and -- most importantly -- competitive pricing. These Macs were meant to show Apple still cares about its computer lineup, given how much attention it's focused on its top moneymaker, the iPhone. Sales of the phone, which turns 10 this year, make up about two-thirds of Apple's revenue. But demand for the iPhone is slowing, which is why Apple needed to please some its long-time core customer base -- designers and creators who rely on the Mac. It didn't take long, though, for people to complain about everything from the pricing, the lowest option for a Touch Bar version is $1,799, to the removal of the MagSafe charging port. Battery life quickly became a big issue, with many saying they got about a third the promised 10-hour battery life. Apple tries the second-screen approach with the MacBook Pro Touch Bar The new Touch Bar is as close as a MacBook Pro is going to get to a Touch Screen. by Dan Ackerman 2:34 Close Drag One thread about the topic on Apple's support site has had more than 30,000 views and over 500 comments since it was first posted in late November. CNET, for its part, didn't see any battery issues in its many tests of the new MacBook Pro. Reviewer Dan Ackerman gave the 13-inch Touch Bar model an 8.6 rating (out of 10) and said, "Apple's smart, useful Touch Bar makes it well worth splurging on the step-up version of the streamlined 13-inch MacBook Pro." CNET tests laptop battery life with a looping video playback, while Consumer Reports uses a browser-based benchmark. CNET's tests showed battery life in line with Apple's numbers. Battery drain In December, Apple removed the "time remaining" battery life estimate from its Mac software, saying the number has been inaccurate and the percentage remaining tally was a better measure. Consumer Reports' first findings from its MacBook Pro battery test came out nine days later. "After factoring together our complete test results, Consumer Reports finds that all three MacBook Pro laptops fail to meet our standards for recommended models," the publication said at the time. "This is a real departure from past MacBooks." The publication re-tested the machines after Apple identified an issue with the Safari browser that appeared to affect battery life during the publication's proprietary benchmarking tests. Apple released a software update to fix the issue on Tuesday. 53 Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13-inch, 2016) Even though Consumer Reports now recommends the new MacBooks, Apple hasn't escaped unscathed. "Bottom line to me is that this news itself does not do any good for Mac, whether or not a battery issue exists," Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa said. "Even if there were no battery issue, it is hard to recover the product reputation as this news can stick to [a] consumer's mind." And there are still plenty of people experiencing battery issues. Jeff Geerling, a St. Louis, Missouri-based web and app developer, published a lengthy blog post Tuesday on why he returned his new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in favor of one with normal function keys. "The battery is the straw that broke this camel's back," the 31-year-old wrote. "After two times using the Touch Bar model on the road without power nearby, I nearly lost it when my laptop was under 10 [percent] battery remaining after only three hours of use." Geerling, a self-proclaimed Apple fanatic who has owned more than dozen Macs over the past 20 years, said he may think twice about buying a Mac in the future. The battery issues he experienced "made me look elsewhere for the first time in many years," Geerling said in an interview. "If Apple continues to neglect the Mac while other manufacturers like Dell and Lenovo are catering to developers ... that's where I start to feel nervous about the future of the Mac."

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Thursday the plaintiffs have the right to sue Apple because they purchased apps directly from the company. Apple had argued that it did not sell apps, but instead acted as an intermediary used by the app developers. The ruling overturned a lower court decision dismissing the lawsuit. An email to Apple was not immediately returned. The lawsuit says Apple only allows developers to sell iPhone apps through its App Store. The lawsuit says Apple gets 30 percent of a customer's payment for an app developed by a third party.

I don’t need all of them all the time, but they’re my go-to set for all of my wired connection needs. These are the four dongles Jeff needs for his Touch Bar MacBook Pro External Display and Projector Adapter I love using AirPlay with my Apple TV for streaming video from my Mac, or when I’m connecting to projectors for presentations, but it isn’t always an option—especially when I’m using an external display with my Touch Bar MacBook Pro. The solution: Apple’s USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter (US$49). It supports HDMI out, has a USB A-style port for other accessories, and has a pass-through USB-C port for power. Apple’s USB-C HDMI video adapter Keyboards, Hard Drives, and Other Accessories I can connect pretty much every USB device I have thanks to the USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter because they’re all plugged into a USB 3 hub. I just plug the hub into the USB A port on the video adapter and I’m in business. For the occasional device that wants its own direct connection, or when I want to use USB thumb drives at the coffee shop, I use Apple’s USB-C to USB A Adapter ($9). Apple’s USB-C to USB A adapter The USB-C ports on my MacBook Pro support Thunderbolt 3, but the connector is the wrong shape for the stack of external hard drives next to my desk. I solved that problem with Apple’s Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter ($29.00). Bonus: The FireWire 800 drives connected to one of my Thunderbolt 2 drives show up on my desktop, too. Apple’s Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Network Adapter I’m fine withe WiFi for most of my network connections, although sometimes Ethernet is still the best option. I’m having great luck with Anker’s USB-C to Ethernet Adapter. It’s priced at $22.99 on Amazon, which is less expensive than the backordered Belkin adapter Apple sells, and it’s available now so you don’t have to wait four weeks for delivery. Anker’s Anker USB-C to Ethernet Adapter On a side note, I’m carrying one less adapter now than I did with my 2012 Retina MacBook Pro. I did have to buy all new adapters, but I suppose having to carry fewer is a step in the right direction.

The USB C to Thunderbolt 2 adapter, and a Thunderbolt 2 cable, are handy for migrating data from an old Mac via Migration Assistant. Besides adapters, USB C to Lightning cables are definitely useful.

I’ve had 4 or more Apple power adapters fail due to problems with the connection between the brick-to-Mac cable and the brick itself. Perhaps something like Griffin’s BreakSafe cable would be a decent workaround/replacement for MagSafe.

January 12, 2017 at 10:36 EST PM webjprgm January 13, 2017 Since the ethernet adapter is used so rarely it seems a shame to have to buy a new one. Would the USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 adapter work to then use the Thunderbolt to ethernet adapter I already have? (This is hypothetical, I don’t currently own a machine with USB-C and do not plan to for a while.) January 13, 2017 at 11:52 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

It doesn't mean that the top dog should be losing any sleep. Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Jan 12, 2017 at 5:09PM Image source: Netflix. It seems as if the booming realm of premium streaming video services is about to get more competitive. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in the process of building out a new business of original TV shows and movies. The popular initial reaction is that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is going to be in for a world of hurt. Apple is a beloved brand, and a company with far more financial resources than its fellow Californian enterprise. However, reports of Netflix's demise or even that it should be fearing Apple's push into original content are overblown.  Netflix will be just fine. Let's go over a few of the reasons why Apple's arrival is no big deal. 1. Apple isn't gunning for Netflix The Wall Street Journal's sources are saying that Apple's push for video is more about beefing up Apple Music, the $10-a-month music-streaming platform that it rolled out two years ago. Apple Music is growing nicely, but no match for the similarly priced Spotify that continues to be the market leader. Giving Apple Music subscribers access to exclusive video content would help Apple differentiate itself from Spotify, which at 40 million premium accounts is twice as big as Apple Music. Spotify also has more than 100 million total users, a figure that Apple Music doesn't compete with because it's only available to paying subscribers. In short, Apple's push into first-run eye candy is more about turning Apple Music into a digital smorgasbord along the lines of the goodies that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides Prime members at no additional cost than it is to become a stand-alone Netflix killer. One can rightfully argue that a lack of intent doesn't preclude Netflix from being in the line of fire anyway, but there are other reasons why Netflix won't wind up being collateral damage here. 2. Netflix survived Amazon If Apple's digital music and subscription offering is going to look a lot like Amazon Prime, then we may as well belly up to the bar of the original alleged Netflix killer: Amazon. Jeff Bezos introduced streaming video to Amazon Prime six years ago. We don't have official Prime Video usage metrics. We know critics generally like the originals, but there's a good chance that you and your friends have seen more House of Cards or Stranger Things than Mozart in the Jungle or Transparent. However, even if Amazon's Prime Video was a hit, the ultimate burden to fail or succeed falls on Netflix. It had 21.7 million domestic subscribers and just 1.9 million international accounts when Prime Video was launched. Netflix has 86.7 million total subscribers -- 47.5 million domestic and 39.3 million international -- today. Amazon is a worthy peer to Netflix, but clearly it has not been an impediment to a platform that has nearly quadrupled in popularity since its arrival.  3. Apple isn't as crazy as Amazon Amazon was a scary entrant in 2011 because Bezos isn't afraid to operate at a loss for the sake of market share. That's not how Apple plays the game.  One can say that Apple views some of its services as a way to sell hardware, but Apple Music recently became available on Android devices. This may make Apple's video push scary since it can cover a wider market than servicing just folks tethered to iOS, but it also means that Apple isn't going to take a hit to fuel the entertainment on Android smartphones.  Netflix has a juicy market that likely topped 90 million dedicated subscribers last month. Unlike Amazon and apparently Apple, which will try to squeeze proprietary TV shows and movies, Netflix throws all of its resources into video content, with $14.4 billion in streaming content obligations as of the end of September. If a ruthless Amazon couldn't dethrone Netflix, it's hard to picture a more level-headed Apple doing so.  Netflix will be just fine.  Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple and Netflix.

Computers by Shara Tibken 12 January 2017 10:19 pm GMT @sharatibken Up Next SpaceX returns to space and nails re-entry landing Apple introduced redesign MacBook Pro computers in October, the first major update in four years.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Consumer Reports is doing an about face on Apple's MacBook Pro. The endorsement reverses an earlier call by Consumer Reports telling consumers to avoid the new MacBooks, for the first time ever, because of big fluctuations in battery life. The publication on Thursday said a software update issued by Apple has fixed the battery problems it found in earlier tests. "With the updated software, the three MacBook Pros in our labs all performed well, with one model running 18.75 hours on a charge," Consumer Reports said. "Now that we've factored in the new battery-life measurements, the laptops' overall scores have risen, and all three machines now fall well within the recommended range in Consumer Reports ratings." Apple plans to roll out the software fix it gave Consumer Reports to all users in several weeks, the publication said. Users enrolled in Apple's beta software program already have access to the update. Apple referred CNET to its comment from earlier this week about the Consumer Reports battery test. It said, in part, that the setting used by the publication to test the MacBooks "is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage." It also said it had fixed the bug found in the test and that "this is the best pro notebook we've ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we're glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro." Apple's new MacBook Pro, unveiled in October, was the first major update to its high-end laptop in four years. Apple executives, speaking in an exclusive interview with CNET before the launch, dubbed the changes -- including a thinner design and a Touch Bar above the keyboard -- a "milestone" and a "big step forward" for its top-of-the-line notebooks. See also Does the Mac still matter? Consumer Reports will retest MacBook Pro battery life CNET's take on the new MacBook Pro The MacBook Pro was redesigned as people start to take a second look at PCs, many of which employ full touchscreen monitors, foldable bodies that let them turn into tablets and -- most importantly -- competitive pricing. These Macs were meant to show Apple still cares about its computer lineup, given how much attention it's focused on its top moneymaker, the iPhone. Sales of the phone, which turns 10 this year, make up about two-thirds of Apple's revenue. But demand for the iPhone is slowing, which is why Apple needed to please some its long-time core customer base -- designers and creators who rely on the Mac. It didn't take long, though, for people to complain about everything from the pricing, the lowest option for a Touch Bar version is $1,799, to the removal of the MagSafe charging port. Battery life quickly became a big issue, with many saying they got about a third the promised 10-hour battery life. Apple tries the second-screen approach with the MacBook Pro Touch Bar The new Touch Bar is as close as a MacBook Pro is going to get to a Touch Screen. by Dan Ackerman 2:34 Close Drag One thread about the topic on Apple's support site has had more than 30,000 views and over 500 comments since it was first posted in late November. CNET, for its part, didn't see any battery issues in its many tests of the new MacBook Pro. Reviewer Dan Ackerman gave the 13-inch Touch Bar model an 8.6 rating (out of 10) and said, "Apple's smart, useful Touch Bar makes it well worth splurging on the step-up version of the streamlined 13-inch MacBook Pro." CNET tests laptop battery life with a looping video playback, while Consumer Reports uses a browser-based benchmark. CNET's tests showed battery life in line with Apple's numbers. Battery drain In December, Apple removed the "time remaining" battery life estimate from its Mac software, saying the number has been inaccurate and the percentage remaining tally was a better measure. Consumer Reports' first findings from its MacBook Pro battery test came out nine days later. "After factoring together our complete test results, Consumer Reports finds that all three MacBook Pro laptops fail to meet our standards for recommended models," the publication said at the time. "This is a real departure from past MacBooks." The publication re-tested the machines after Apple identified an issue with the Safari browser that appeared to affect battery life during the publication's proprietary benchmarking tests. Apple released a software update to fix the issue on Tuesday. 53 Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13-inch, 2016) Even though Consumer Reports now recommends the new MacBooks, Apple hasn't escaped unscathed. "Bottom line to me is that this news itself does not do any good for Mac, whether or not a battery issue exists," Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa said. "Even if there were no battery issue, it is hard to recover the product reputation as this news can stick to [a] consumer's mind." And there are still plenty of people experiencing battery issues. Jeff Geerling, a St. Louis, Missouri-based web and app developer, published a lengthy blog post Tuesday on why he returned his new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in favor of one with normal function keys. "The battery is the straw that broke this camel's back," the 31-year-old wrote. "After two times using the Touch Bar model on the road without power nearby, I nearly lost it when my laptop was under 10 [percent] battery remaining after only three hours of use." Geerling, a self-proclaimed Apple fanatic who has owned more than dozen Macs over the past 20 years, said he may think twice about buying a Mac in the future. The battery issues he experienced "made me look elsewhere for the first time in many years," Geerling said in an interview. "If Apple continues to neglect the Mac while other manufacturers like Dell and Lenovo are catering to developers ... that's where I start to feel nervous about the future of the Mac."

Apple executives are reportedly already in discussion with industry veterans about how to create shows comparable to Netflix's Stranger Things or HBO's Westworld. If all goes according to plan, the company will begin offering its original TV shows on its $11.99-per-month streaming service Apple Music by the end of 2017. Sadly, it looks like Apple is going to half-arse the enterprise. Image: Getty Let's back up for a second though, because the news about Apple's push into video production has been a long time coming. The tech company has already carved out deals for some original programming, including a 16-episode spinoff of James Corden's Carpool Karaoke, a reality TV competition called Planet of the Apps and a scripted show from Dr Dre that we don't know much about except that it includes at least one orgy. Now, Apple is also reportedly talking to "veteran producers" in Hollywood to look for scripted television shows and is also speaking to studios and network executives in the search for new video content. Apple is reportedly serious about buying rights to scripted television programs, and the discussions around original movies are said to be "preliminary". The discussions mark a huge strategic shift for Apple. The company has long been rumoured to have an interest in original video content, and the prospect of Apple elbowing its way into Hollywood has been talked about in media and tech circles ever since Steve Jobs cut a deal with networks and TV studios to bring shows and movies to iTunes in 2005. In 2015, a full decade later, Variety reported that Apple was "eyeing" a move into original programming, but details were scarce at that point. The scope of Apple's ambitions has never been clear. No one could suss out whether the company planned to create an entire division dedicated to creating original content or just experiment with one or two projects. On the surface, Apple and Hollywood have always appeared to have an obvious symbiotic relationship. The tech giant has a built-in audience through iTunes that makes it easy to get eyeballs in front of any show it wants. Apple also makes many of the devices people are streaming content to, like the iPhone and Apple TV. Of course, Apple wouldn't be the first technology company to dip its toes into producing original content only to fail miserably. Take the Xbox Entertainment Studios, created to develop original series for the gaming platform (like an overhyped live action Halo series produced by Steven Spielberg that never saw the light of day). The studio was ultimately closed after two years due to the cost of competing in an overcrowded race with the likes of Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. The same thing is happening right now with YouTube Red. Google has essentially tacked on a paid service to its already popular streaming platform, and despite signing deals with some big stars who are already popular on the platform, the Google-funded programming is unmemorable. When's the last time you heard about or read about a YouTube Red show? Can you even name one? Apple's content appears to be headed down the wrong path as well. The shows that have already been announced sound abominable, and it seems the company's approach going forward will be tepid. According to the WSJ report, Apple will not spend the hundreds of millions of dollars it would take to really make content competitive with streaming top dogs like Netflix and Amazon — to say nothing of HBO. Instead, the company wants to use its original TV episodes as a differentiator to help it better compete against Spotify, the chief rival to Apple Music. This will be a huge waste of time and money that will likely yield garbage content. If Apple plans to use original programming to compete with Spotify it should take a cue from its enemy — remember the garbage series called Drawn & Recorded Spotify created last year? I hope you don't because it was embarrassingly bad. (Please see the terrible video above.) If the success of Amazon and Netflix programming has taught us anything, it's that the only way to make good video content is to go all in. There are, of course, the occasional good shows that pop up on other platforms — Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee comes to mind — but those programs are an anomaly. The best programming — the kind that wins awards and gets more people to subscribe — has been accomplished by throwing the treasury at it. Companies rarely reveal how much they actually spend, but for reference Amazon spent $US1.3 billion ($1.7 billion) on content in 2014. And over winter the company revealed that it would spend twice as much in the second half of 2016 than it did in the second half of 2015. And that's peanuts when you consider that Netflix is reportedly planning to spend some $US6 billion ($8 billion) on content in 2017. Apple and Hollywood appear to be inseparable at this point. Apple needs endless content for people to consume, and Hollywood needs to reach more people in a world were technology is radically changing how people watch stuff. Who knows, maybe Apple will get away with spending modest amounts to produce really compelling programming that shifts the balance between Apple Music and Spotify. History seems to indicate otherwise. Comments nexusq @nexusq Jan 13, 2017, 12:48pm So they're just copying Netflix and Amazon?

Have you ever thought "I wish I could listen to all my music through one earphone, so I don't need to wear both?" Apple's new AirPods solve a lot of these problems. Problems I'm not entirely sure needed to be solved, but problems nonetheless. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter? Subscribe Have a tip? Contact our editors!

Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login Here are the Companies We Love to Love Posted on January 12, 2017 by Brad Hoppmann In Wednesday’s Afternoon Edition, we looked at some of the companies Americans love to hate. Today, we are turning those frowns of frustration into smiles of love and admiration by looking at the companies we love to love. More specifically, we are looking at the companies that America (and the rest of the world) has said it admires most. This "admired" list is a feature at the Fortune website. It’s been a sort of a go-to guide for taking the pulse of positive corporate attitudes. The Fortune list is compiled by its survey partners at the employment firm Korn Ferry Hay Group. Here’s how it arrives at its top "50 Most Admired Companies" list: Korn Ferry Hay Group asked 4,000 executives, directors, and securities analysts who had responded to the industry surveys to select the 10 companies they admired most. They chose from a list made up of the companies that ranked in the top 25% in last year’s surveys, plus those that finished in the top 20% of their industry. Anyone could vote for any company in any industry. So, who topped the list of the most-admired (or most-loved) companies in 2016? Apple (AAPL) The cult of Apple has always been strong, as the company’s loyal followers tend to buy just about everything the Cupertino giant brings to market. The admiration for the way Apple does business, and for its mission of democratizing technology, has earned it the top spot on the Fortune list. Alphabet (GOOGL) Speaking of love and hate, I do love Google the search product, although I don’t know anyone who doesn’t hate the name "Alphabet." Still, if you need to find something out about the world, Google is the best place to start. That service alone earns Google my love. Amazon.com (AMZN) Need a last-minute gift, groceries, a hygiene product or a book delivered to you in a day (sometimes even the same day)? Then you know where to go … you go to Amazon.com. AMZN is up 8.5% in 2017. Shares gained 1.8% today on news that the company will add 100,000 U.S. jobs over the next 18 months. The online seller of everything is one of the greatest corporate innovations in history. Its revolutionary nature has changed the way we shop forever — which is why so many of us love and admire Amazon. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) The brainchild of investing genius and philanthropist Warren Buffett has a reputation for making money with good, solid investments in things people need, and trends people understand. That’s in part Buffett’s own philosophy, which he couches in a homespun, avuncular way that resonates with so many around the globe. Walt Disney (DIS) We all grew up with Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Snow White and Cinderella, so loving Disney is almost ingrained in our DNA. Yet the company continues to put out great, new content via movie franchises like "Star Wars." Add to that the joy of its theme parks, and you get a recipe for love and admiration other companies can only wish upon a star for. Other firms that round out the top 10 admired list include …   Starbucks (SBUX)   Southwest Airlines (LUV)   FedEx (FDX)   Nike (NKE)   General Electric (GE) My Cash Flow Kings newsletter subscribers can attest to the strength of several of these stocks, including Nike and Apple, which are current positions. In Apple, we are tracking open gains of 77.2%! For us, our biggest factor in deciding whether to delve into, or dump, a stock depends on cash flow. Having a strong brand, stellar management team, thriving product pipeline and … yes … happy customers are also big factors when we are deciding what — and when — to buy. And not only do we make timely recommendations in Cash Flow Kings of the stocks we love, we also share a monthly list of stocks to stay far away from. Our customers have told us to keep this information coming. And if getting these kinds of recommendations sounds like something you’d be interested in, click here to join us today. *** Taking a quick look back at yesterday’s list of companies folks "love to hate," we received some pretty passionate feedback. Even from those who "love to love" them! From the "not feeling the love" camp, Joe G. writes … Sears is definitely at the top of the list. Followed by BOA, followed by WFC, followed by Comcast. There is no customer service from any of these companies. They all desire to go out of business! And Bob S. writes … I was astonished at how many customer surveys Comcast operates on their website. Today I was having new service installed. Comcast, it turns out, does a horribly bad job of tracking edits to their customer service website. I was told to click a certain link and then look in the upper-right corner of that page, for the information I needed. I clicked it. There was nothing written in the upper-right corner. So I called customer service. Which takes 30 minutes. We DID eventually resolve the problem. But if a competing means of getting 72 MBPS Internet speeds, were available, I’d use it. Offering up a few names that could also make the "no love" list, Tommr writes … My current list of hated companies includes Century Link and UnitedHealth Group. Customer service is really bad. One can spend literally an hour or more on the phone with their customer service and never accomplish anything! They put you on hold for a long time. Give you the run around and even try to sell you something! I would not do any business with these companies, but I really have no choice! However, two readers are still "lovin’" two of those names we talked about … LH writes … I’m not sure why McDonald’s is on your list. In our city the service is good, the food is consistent (and) prices are reasonable. I love their breakfasts. The rest of the list I agree with, especially Sears and Wells Fargo. Hans writes … Thanks. From a Canadian perspective, I don’t agree with your bashing McDonald’s and Wal-Mart. Please remember not everyone is rich. Here in Montreal you can buy a cheeseburger and small fries for less than 4 Dollars pretty good value for money. Also the Wal-Mart has a good Produce section. Always very fresh and at half the cost of my regular grocer. Brad response: Thank you, everyone. You bring up some great points. Folks in smaller cities or less-urban areas may have limited choices in stores or restaurants to patronize. And even in bigger metropolitan areas, you still don’t get a lot of choices when it comes to your utilities. (And cable/internet is indeed a utility nowadays). The level of service provided certainly can vary by individual, site or even the day. Just like a good stock, they can have their "off" days, just as long as they can consistently deliver the results that customers and shareholders deserve. *** What’s your take on the top names on this list? Do you have your own most admired list? Are you in love with any companies? If so, please share it with me and your fellow Afternoon Edition readers. And, doing so is easy. All you have to do to share your thoughts is leave me a comment on our website or send me an e-mail. *** It was a solid seven-day run for the Nasdaq. Unfortunately, it ended yesterday as markets continued to digest Donald Trump’s Wednesday press conference. The broader markets closed lower, with the Nasdaq sliding 0.3%. • The FTSE 100 continued its winning streak. The London index set another record high as it celebrated a 13th-straight day with gains. • Amazon (AMZN) gained 1.8% after it announced plans to create more than 100,000 full-time jobs in the U.S. with full benefits in the next 18 months. • JPMorgan (JPM) fell 1% despite issuing an optimistic forecast for fourth-quarter earnings, due out tomorrow. JPM’s trading revenue should be up 15%. JPM, like other bank stocks, has been rising under the expectation that many post-crisis financial regulations will be lifted during the new administration. • China forecasts record crude demand: Net imports could rise 5.3% and consumption may hit a record 12 million barrels per day in 2017, according to China National Petroleum Corp. WTI crude surged 1.5% today. • Gold hit a seven-week high: The yellow metal settled at $1,199.80 per troy ounce (+0.3%), after trading as high as $1,207 during Thursday’s session.

Registered developers and public testers can install the update either via iOS 10’s OTA mechanism, or as a standalone download via Apple’s website. The release comes a few hours after Apple issued the fourth beta of macOS Sierra 10.12.3, and just a few days after beta 3 was seeded for both platforms, suggesting that they are nearing closer to public launch. We have yet to see any user-facing changes in the iOS 10.2.1 betas, and given the release notes and version number, we probably won’t. This is likely a minor update with mostly under-the-hood improvements. If you are looking for new features, Apple released iOS 10.2 a month ago with new emoji, widgets, wallpapers and more, and rumor has it iOS 10.3 is in the works with an all-new Theater Mode CC toggle. Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Apple seeds OS X 10.11.2 beta 4 to developers and public testers Apple increases max tvOS app size from 200mb to 4GB Apple seeds first beta of iOS 10.2.1, macOS Sierra 10.12.3 and tvOS 10.1.1 to developers Apple seeds watchOS 3.1.1 beta 3 to developers Related Topics Apple, Developer, Developers, iOS 10.2.1, Update leart wow 2gb ota update. doesn’t look like a small change Tavish 32.8 MB here…. were you on the latest beta before this? leart https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/496a8ca8c21eb47e943e1aaeb7a42a68835bba11b77950575d24dc10129151b6.jpg Tavish I believe you just wondering if you were on beta 3 before this? I was and on my 7 plus it was only 32.8MB. What beta and phone do you have? leart that its not my phone, it’s the screenshot posted on the article .. my 6s+ it’s on 9.3.5 and I’m just fine there Tavish haha my bad. I thought you meant beta 4 vs. beta 3. Alec Ratzell This is the update size before being on any 10.2.1 beta Sailor_V90 Wait what happened to the iOS 10.3 beta? Guess it was all a myth Blip dude I actually think it’s coming, just not now. I feel like Apple may spare 10.3 until they are sure themselves the next gen iPads are ready for the public. So I’d say a few weeks before we see a Beta 1 for 10.3. Still waiting on Dark mode here!! I could be wrong of course. Sailor_V90 No that makes sense actually samuelcarreira 30,7 mb update on iPad Air 2 (developer beta) samuelcarreira The 10 version is one of the worst iOS releases on the iOS history in terms of new features and overall design. It’s always a good new when the new version it’s more optimized but the iOS 10 brings some annoying changes like the new control center (one of the worst design implementations ever) and the new unlock feature which isn’t a good option for older devices without Touch ID. And we don’t see any new great features in the minor iOS 10 releases… so iOS 10 will be in history at the level of the iOS 8 Kobi Iakobi need help pls . im on 9.3.3 jb (iphone6) do i need to upgrade to 10.2 in order to get jailbrake ?

Peter Thiel worries that Trump may not go far enough. "Everyone says Trump is going to change everything way too much," says the famed venture capitalist, contrarian and member of the Trump transition team. "Well, maybe Trump is going to change everything way too little. That seems like the much more plausible risk to me."

Thiel is comfortable being a walking oxymoron: He is driven to save the world from the apocalypse. Yet he helped boost the man regarded by many as a danger to the planet. "The election had an apocalyptic feel to it," says Thiel, wearing a gray Zegna suit and sipping white wine in a red leather booth at the Monkey Bar in Manhattan. "There was a way in which Trump was funny, so you could be apocalyptic and funny at the same time. It's a strange combination, but it's somehow very powerful psychologically." Related Content Trump's man Tillerson stays blunt as hearing turns testy The moment Trump's press conference degenerated into chaos At the recent meeting of tech executives at Trump Tower - orchestrated by Thiel - the President-elect caressed Thiel's hand so affectionately that body language experts went into a frenzy. I note that he looked uneasy being petted in front of his peers. "I was thinking, 'I hope this doesn't look too weird on TV,'" he says. Advertisement I ask if he had to twist arms to lure some of the anti-Trump tech titans, like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. "I think, early on, everybody was worried that they would be the only person to show up," Thiel says. "At the end, everybody was worried they would be the only person not to show up. I think the bigger tech companies all wanted to get a little bit off the ledge that they had gotten on. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Peter Thiel donated more than $1 million to Trump's campaign.  Photo: Bloomberg One could have predicted Thiel's affinity for Trump by reading his 2014 book, Zero to One, in which he offers three prongs of his philosophy: 1) It is better to risk boldness than triviality. 2) A bad plan is better than no plan. 3) Sales matter just as much as product. But he was portrayed as an outcast in Silicon Valley and denounced as a jerk for supporting Trump and giving him $US1.25 million ($1.67 million). "I didn't give him any money for a long time because I didn't think it mattered, and then the campaign asked me to," he says. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Peter Thiel, centre, listen as President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with technology industry leaders on December 14.  Photo: AP He recalls that he went through a lot of "meta" debates about Trump in Silicon Valley. "One of my good friends said, 'Peter, do you realise how crazy this is, how everybody thinks this is crazy?' I was like: 'Well, why am I wrong? What's substantively wrong with this?' And it all got referred back to 'Everybody thinks Trump's really crazy.' So it's like there's a shortcut, which is: 'I don't need to explain it. It's good enough that everybody thinks something. If everybody thinks this is crazy, I don't even have to explain to you why it's crazy. You should just change your mind.'" The reaction from the gay community has been harsh, with one writer in The Advocate going so far as to suggest that Thiel was not even a gay man, because he did not "embrace the struggle." "I think Trump is very good on gay rights," Thiel says. "I don't think he will reverse anything. I would obviously be concerned if I thought otherwise." I ask him if he worries about the bromance with Vladimir Putin and Trump's bizarre affinity for dictators. "But should Russia be allied with the West or with China?" Thiel says. "There are these really bad dictators in the Middle East, and we got rid of them and in many cases there's even worse chaos." So he doesn't worry about Trump sending an intemperate tweet and spurring a war with North Korea? "A Twitter war is not a real war," Thiel says. Thiel and Trump are strange bedfellows, given that much of Thiel's billions came from being one of the original investors in Facebook and Trump recently said it's better to send important messages by courier. ("Well," Thiel notes, "one does have to be very careful with what one says in an email.") Trump, with his litigious streak and his pugilistic attitude toward the press and his threat to change the libel laws, naturally admired Thiel's legal smackdown of Gawker. The tech titan was disturbed by the "painful and paralysing" stories published on the gossipy website and other blogs under the Gawker banner, including a 2007 post that originally appeared on Valleywag blithely headlined "Peter Thiel Is Totally Gay, People." So he secretly financed the lawsuit filed by Terry Bollea (the real name of wrestler Hulk Hogan) against Gawker for posting an excerpt from a sex tape showing Hogan with a friend's wife. A court ruled in Bollea's favor, in a judgment of $US140 million ($187 million), which drove the site into bankruptcy. (Gawker founder Nick Denton, who is also gay, described Thiel to Vanity Fair as "interesting - and scary.") "It basically stands for the narrow proposition that you should not publish a sex tape," Thiel says. "I think that's an insult to journalists to suggest that's journalism now. Transparency is good, but at some point it can go in this very toxic direction." Just as there was "a self-fulfilling Hillary bubble" where "everybody was just too scared to say this was a really bad idea" to support this "very weak candidate," Thiel believes Gawker manufactured "a totally insane bubble full of somewhat sociopathic people in New York." When the case went to court in Florida, he contends, the culture that "you could do whatever you wanted and there were no consequences" was exposed. "There's some resonances between Hogan beating Gawker and Trump beating the establishment in this country," Thiel says. Hulk Hogan was "this crazy person" who didn't seem like the best plaintiff, but "he didn't give up." Using two wrestling terms he learned, Thiel says that many people assumed Trump was "kayfabe" a move that looks real but is fake. But then his campaign turned into a "shoot" the word for an unscripted move that suddenly becomes real. "People thought the whole Trump thing was fake, that it wasn't going to go anywhere, that it was the most ridiculous thing imaginable, and then somehow he won, like Hogan did," Thiel says. "And what I wonder is, whether maybe pro wrestling is one of the most real things we have in our society and what's really disturbing is that the other stuff is much more fake. And whatever the superficialities of Trump might be, he was more authentic than the other politicians. He sort of talked in a way like ordinary people talk. It was not sort of this Orwellian newspeak jargon that so many of the candidates use. So he was sort of real. He actually wanted to win." While many predict that Trump will crash and burn, Thiel does not think he will regret his role. I ask him how Trump, who is still putting out a lot of wacky, childish tweets, has struck him during the transition. Isn't he running around with his hair on fire? "The hair seems fine," Thiel says. "Mr Trump seems fine."

Donald Trump had no plans to meet with Ms Le Pen, according to an aide to the president-elect, who asked not to be identified without authorisation to speak publicly. Neither is she on Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon's schedule, a person familiar said. Ms Le Pen's campaign chief of staff, David Rachline, said earlier that she was making a private visit to New York. "It's not on her public agenda," Mr Rachline said in a text message exchange, when asked if she planned a meeting with Mr Trump or officials close to him. "We don't communicate about private visits."

She has repeatedly said she was supportive of Mr Trump's policies for the US and called him "a sign of hope" for European anti-establishment politicians in a press conference this month. Trump has met on several occasions with Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party, most recently in December.

It is unclear whether the ban, which is linked to security concerns as the burqa fully conceals the wearer's face, extends to wearing the garment in public places. "We have taken the step of completely banning the import, manufacture and marketing of this garment in all the cities and towns of the kingdom," a senior Moroccan government official said. The kingdom's government has not confirmed the ban and it was unavailable for comment yesterday.

They instead opt for the hijab, a headscarf, or the niqab, which leaves the area around the face visible.

It believes 1500 Moroccan nationals are fighting in Syria and Iraq, of whom 220 have been jailed after returning home. A number of Islamic State extremists who committed terrorist attacks in 2015 and 2016 had links to Morocco. Salah Abdeslam, a co-plotter of the November 2015 Paris attacks which left 130 people dead, is a French national of Moroccan descent. Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who also helped plan the attack, had dual Belgian-Moroccan citizenship. Oussama Atar, another Belgian-Moroccan citizen, is suspected of planning the Paris attacks and the March 2016 Belgian bombings, which killed 32. In December, Moroccan citizen Redouane S was arrested in Germany on suspicion of plotting the Paris massacre. His full name has not been released due to Germany's strict privacy laws. The Foreign Office's travel guidance on Morocco says there is a "growing number of Moroccans sympathetic or belonging to Daesh [IS] and other extremist groups". "[The authorities] regularly report the disruption of terrorist cells, some of which intended to carry out attacks in Morocco," it adds.

Perhaps the Apple Music interface will eventually have original TV shows and movies to choose from. (Apple Photo) Apple TV is a piece of hardware, but it could become a new mindset for the tech giant. Looking to offset slowing sales of iPhones and iPads, Apple is reportedly setting its sights on Hollywood and planning a “significant new business” in original television shows and movies, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The Journal said people familiar with the plans said original content would be available to subscribers who are already using Apple Music, the tech giant’s $10-a-month streaming service. That service has struggled to catch up to Spotify, and the hope is that premium shows — similar to HBO’s “Westworld” or Netflix’s “Stranger Things” — could differentiate Apple and attract users. The report said Apple doesn’t appear ready to spend the big bucks that Amazon, Netflix and the premium cable networks spend annually on critically acclaimed content. But the company has reportedly been in contact with Hollywood veterans and hopes to be able to offer original, scripted content by the end of the year. Apple Music launched in the summer of 2015 and the Journal notes that revenue for the service rose 22 percent in the quarter ending Sept. 24. But its subscriber base of about 20 million is half that of Spotify. Writer and editor Kurt Schlosser covers the Geek Life beat for GeekWire.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 13 January 2017 | MYT 6:00 AM Could 2017 bring AR glasses from Apple? Cooking at Apple?: The rumoured augmented reality glasses are likely to function via connection to an iPhone. Pictured is Cook. — AFP Relaxnews The rumour comes from American blogger Robert Scoble, who reportedly spoke to Carl Zeiss employees at the recent Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. They apparently confirmed that Apple is working on a pair of lightweight augmented reality glasses. Although the information remains unconfirmed, it isn't the first time that the Cupertino tech firm has been linked to such a project. In fact, Bloomberg reported in 2016 that Apple was developing this kind of device. In reality, the augmented reality glasses are likely to function via connection to an iPhone. The Apple CEO has already spoken up as a greater believer in augmented reality technology than in virtual reality, adding further weight to the project's existence, even if it remains pure speculation. Robert Scoble even claims that the product could land as soon as 2017. Note that Carl Zeiss has already developed and launched a virtual reality headset, the VR One, which connects to a smartphone (Android or iOS). Currently, the connected glasses market is still in very early days. Following the failure of Google Glass, it was Microsoft that caused a sensation in 2015 with its Hololens glasses, allowing wearers to interact with virtual reality elements in a real-world environment. Hololens is out now in selected countries priced US$3,000 (RM13,390) in the form of a developers' kit for professionals. In a completely different genre and on a smaller scale, Snaps haslaunched Spectacles glasses that can film and share short videos online on Snapchat. CES 2017 brought a host of product announcements, notably the R8 and R9 glasses presented by Californian firm Osterhout Design Group. These use Qualcomm technology, making use of the latest Snapdragon 835 processor, and are due on sale in summer 2017, priced around US$1,000 (RM4,460) for the R8 and double that for the R9. Israeli start-up Lumus presented Maximus at the Las Vegas event. This prototype lets wearers experience virtual reality with a wide 55° field of view, and can be added directly to regular glasses. Maximus could also come to market soon. —  AFP Relaxnews   You May Be Interested QLED vs OLED Could your gadgets send you to jail?

These purchases combine low cost and supreme utility with an overabundance of cool, geek, or nostalgia factor. The Elago W3 Apple Watch stand hits every one of those checkboxes. It’s a $15 silicone smartwatch stand that makes your Apple device look like a miniature Macintosh, equipped with a floppy drive cutout and everything. A fitting stand for a wrist computer more powerful than a 1984 desktop It supports Apple’s nightstand mode, so you can use your tiny Macintosh replica as an alarm clock on your bedside table. It also works Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2, including both the 38mm and 42mm versions. The product engineering involved here is not too complicated. The small plastic charging puck for the Apple Watch slips into a recessed circular hole in the stand and the cable is tucked under. The Apple Watch then slides in, where it can be removed easily. The straps can also tie around the back of the stand. Yet you can also remove the band if you want to have the full 1984 Apple desktop experience (minus the keyboard and mouse, miniature replicas of which do not come included). Elago makes a number of other neat Apple Watch accessories all sold through Amazon or on its website. But this one — for just $15 — is clearly the only smartwatch stand you’ll ever need.

When it comes to actual sales, the iPhone 7 series is doing pretty well for Apple, at least well enough to significantly gain market share over Android phones. BGR has the news. “According to new data released this week by leading market research firm Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, Apple’s new iPhone models stole a significant amount of market share from Android during the holiday shopping period last year.” The iPhone 7 Plus has sold very well for Apple. [Image by Daryl Deino] The article adds that in the United States, the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 6s were the three best-selling smartphones during the three-month period that ended in November of 2015. When combined, the three devices accounted for 31.3 percent of all smartphone sales in the United States. This is good news for Apple, who has been criticized for lacking innovation with their new smartphones. One of the biggest complaints was that Apple was removing the standard headphone jack. An article in Mashable summarized that the removal of the headphone jack doesn’t represent anything groundbreaking. “And I’ve never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as I did Wednesday, when marketing chief Phil Schiller explained why the iPhone 7 would not have a standard 3.5mm aux cable input, better known as the headphone jack,” wrote columnist Chris Taylor, who added that music certainly doesn’t sound better over Bluetooth or a Lightning connector. Then, there is the fact that both the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus versions have outdated screen resolutions (750 x 1334 for iPhone 7 and 1920 x 1080 for the 7 Plus). However, many would argue that Apple hasn’t changed the screen resolution because it would decrease battery life. There is also the argument that on such a small device, a higher screen resolution wouldn’t make much of a difference to the human eye. Many believe that the iPhone 7, especially the 7 Plus, smartphones are gaining market share because one major Android flagship phone, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, was recalled. The recall eventually led to many Android users reluctantly purchasing the iPhone 7 Plus. The Galaxy Note 7 recall certainly helped Apple. [Image by Daryl Deino] The Galaxy Note 7 arrived with fantastic reviews when released in August. Then, some phones started to explode. Samsung issued a recall and rushed replacement smartphones to the market. Then, some of the replacement smartphones started to explode. All in all, the Note 7 launch was the most disastrous smartphone launch in history. Samsung suffered a lot of brand damage but is getting ready to come back with the Galaxy S8. According to Tech Radar, the Galaxy S8 is shaping up to be a huge upgrade from the S7 and S7 Edge. “Likely highlights include a 4K screen, a Snapdragon 830 processor, 6GB of RAM and a massively improved camera. There’s even a chance that the Samsung Galaxy S8 will have an iris scanner or a foldable screen, though the latter is somewhat less likely.” The article adds that there could be two different versions of the S8, and both will come with curved screens. One could be a 5.7-inch regular version, and the other, the one that would have the 4K screen, will be 6.1 inches. The S8 could also have a 30MP dual-lens rear camera, an 8MP front camera, and a 4200mAh battery. However, Apple isn’t sitting quietly. The rumored iPhone 8 series is rumored to be the biggest upgrade to the iPhone in 10 years. According to 9to5Mac, we may see 4.7-inch to 5.8-inch curved OLED displays, an all-glass design with new colors, wireless charging, an embedded (into the screen) home button, and something that has to do with augmented reality. Based on the rumors, are you more excited for the iPhone 8 or the Galaxy S8? Let us know in the comments section.

(AAP) Previous Next Show Grid Previous Next Hide Grid Image 1/ Video Audio A US court has ruled iPhone customers can sue Apple for forcing them to buy apps only from its App Store. Source: AAP 13 Jan 2017 - 9:40 AM  UPDATED 13 Jan 2017 - 9:40 AM Tweet iPhone app purchasers may sue Apple over allegations the company monopolised the market for iPhone apps by not allowing users to purchase them outside the App Store, leading to higher prices, a US appeals court has ruled. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruling revives a long-simmering legal challenge originally filed in 2012 taking aim at Apple's practice of allowing iPhones to run only apps purchased from its own App Store. A group of iPhone users sued saying the company's practice was anti-competitive. Apple had argued that users did not have standing to sue it because they purchased apps from developers, with Apple simply renting out space to those developers. Developers pay a cut of their revenues to Apple in exchange for the right to sell in the App Store. A lower court sided with Apple, but judge William A. Fletcher ruled that iPhone users purchase apps directly from Apple, which gives iPhone users the right to bring a legal challenge against Apple. Apple declined to comment. The courts have yet to address the substance of the iPhone users' allegations; up to this point, the wrangling has been over whether they have the right to sue Apple in the first place. But if the challenge ultimately succeeds, "the obvious solution is to compel Apple to let people shop for applications wherever they want, which would open the market and help lower prices", Mark C. Rifkin, a lawyer with Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz representing the group of iPhone users, told Reuters in an interview. "The other alternative is for Apple to pay people damages for the higher than competitive prices they've had to pay historically because Apple has utilised its monopoly."

"Now, I don't know that I'm going to get along with Vladimir Putin. I hope I do. But there's a good chance I won't." The specific nature of Trump's relationship with the sinister president of Russia has been giving foreign policy experts shudders for months, climaxing this week in the publication of a dossier with allegations so salacious that they practically gave smelling salts a comeback. Beyond Putin, Trump's voracious hunger to be liked seems to be one of the defining elements of his personality and, likely, of his presidency. He doesn't yet seem to have learned that being liked can be a very bad thing and that there are times when it's worth making an active effort to earn a good enemy.

Lee, a suspect in an influence-peddling investigation. More videos Trump: Russia report a 'blot' on intel community President-elect Donald Trump delivered his first formal press conference following the November presidential election in New York on Wednesday. For the purposes of argument, and given Trump's well-documented and exceptionally high self-regard, I'm going to assume that Trump believes that Putin likes him because Putin appreciates and admires the quality Trump values most in himself. That's not unusual; most of us hope to be loved for ourselves, and to be seen in the best possible light. Relationships that proceed on these terms are based on respect and give us reason to expect that the other person involved will be willing to work with us in a constructive fashion, to accept our wishes and ideas as legitimate and to reach compromises that are genuinely agreeable. This isn't the only road to being liked, though. For plenty of people, Trump included, the primary criteria for whether someone is likable isn't whether he or she possesses a strong character, sparkling conversational skills or a well-calibrated moral compass: It's whether the person gives you what you want and tells you what you want to hear. No matter how much Trump would like to believe that Putin genuinely likes and respects him, it would be prudent - if not within his capacity - to consider the possibility that Putin has treated Trump warmly because he believes Trump can be easily manipulated into behaving like an obedient toady. Trump's desire for Putin's approval may be a more valuable asset for Putin than Putin's ostensible affection for Trump will be for the president-elect. Related Content The moment Trump's press conference degenerated into chaos BuzzFeed crossed the line in publishing salacious 'dossier' on Trump If it's possible to be esteemed for the wrong reasons, there are also people whose approval isn't worth having. Putin's long record of authoritarianism and corruption has been extensively documented. Presidents don't always have the luxury of purity, but their choices ought to become at least somewhat clearer when dealing with someone who pairs an ominous governing style with decisions that endanger American interests. And there are situations where a leader's governing style is so morally intolerable that it might not be acceptable to court his or her approval even for strategic reasons. Though it might be hard to imagine facing this choice personally, there are times when it's better to be called "son of a whore" than to garner glowing praise from someone who has bragged about personally carrying out extrajudicial executions in the midst of a murderous campaign against people who sell and use drugs.

More videos Apple plans original streaming TV content Apple is planning to build a significant new business in original television shows and movies, according to The Wall Street Journal. Apple does not appear to be gunning directly for Netflix or Amazon with its video experiment, according to the Journal, because its offering would still be relatively small. But it could up the ante against Spotify, as well as tee up Apple for a big role in media and Hollywood. Rumours of Apple's interest in television are not new. The company was said to have been planning to launch a streaming TV service as far back as 2012. But negotiations with content providers for TV rights have made it hard for Apple to break into the market and offer a cable-like experience. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Exclusive shows like Stranger Things are one of the main reason consumers sign up for Netflix.  With more Americans cutting the cord, however, and embracing the kind of original content pioneered by Netflix, Apple may have another shot at building a TV empire. The company has already debuted a number of music-related shows and documentaries on Apple TV, and that is expected to grow with an original series featuring Dr. Dre, a reality show called Planet of the Apps, and rights to produce a spinoff of CBS' Carpool Karaoke. "The entire world of communications and entertainment and television are all changing and converging," said Jeff Kagan, an independent telecom and media analyst. "We are going to see many companies enter the space in the same way. Some of them will be successful. Some of them will not. This is just the early days."

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Apple removes AirPod finder app from the App Store Apple removes AirPod finder app from the App Store By Ryan Whitwam on January 12, 2017 at 3:38 pm Comment There are suddenly a lot of completely wireless earbuds on the market, which are “completely wireless” because there’s no wire connecting the two sides, nor a wire going to your device. Apple was (it insists) courageous enough to completely remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7. It has compensated for that by releasing the AirPods, completely wireless earbuds that will cost you $159. Oh, and that’ll be $69 when you inevitably lose one. If you have a time machine and $3.99, you can maybe skip the $69 charge. The time machine is necessary because Apple pulled the Finder for AirPods app from the App Store. Why? Because Apple. According to a review of the app from MacRumors, Finder for AirPods worked as advertised. It used the Bluetooth connection between your phone and the AirPod to figure out roughly where it was hiding. There is no way to ascertain a direction simply from the Bluetooth signal strength, but the app had a signal strength graph and text descriptions of your proximity to the missing AirPod. It was like playing a game of hotter or colder. That’s not ideal, but it was a $4 app could potentially save you from a $69 bill. The app was sent to Apple for review on December 22nd, and published two weeks later. When people started talking about the app, Apple allegedly decided it should not have approved the app. The app was removed from the App Store, and the developer Deucks took to Reddit (where he had been promoting the app) to explain the situation. Deucks says that Apple contacted him to because it didn’t like the “concept” of the app. Even though it didn’t violate any rules, Apple decided to pull the app. Apple has regularly removed apps from the App Store that it doesn’t like, which it reserves the right to do. There certainly isn’t any technical issue with the app. Deucks has several similar Finder apps for other products, including Fitbit, Misfit, and Jawbone. Users in the announcement thread have speculated Apple is trying to save face by pretending AirPods aren’t so easy lose. Others suspect they want to make sure people replace lost AirPods for $69. Anyone who bought the app can request a refund from Apple via the support site. If you have it on your iPhone already, it should continue working for now. We’ve reached out to Apple to ask about its reasoning for removing the app, but we don’t expect a reply.

"Now, I don't know that I'm going to get along with Vladimir Putin. I hope I do. But there's a good chance I won't." The specific nature of Trump's relationship with the sinister president of Russia has been giving foreign policy experts shudders for months, climaxing this week in the publication of a dossier with allegations so salacious that they practically gave smelling salts a comeback. Beyond Putin, Trump's voracious hunger to be liked seems to be one of the defining elements of his personality and, likely, of his presidency. He doesn't yet seem to have learned that being liked can be a very bad thing and that there are times when it's worth making an active effort to earn a good enemy.

More videos Trump: Russia report a 'blot' on intel community President-elect Donald Trump delivered his first formal press conference following the November presidential election in New York on Wednesday. For the purposes of argument, and given Trump's well-documented and exceptionally high self-regard, I'm going to assume that Trump believes that Putin likes him because Putin appreciates and admires the quality Trump values most in himself. That's not unusual; most of us hope to be loved for ourselves, and to be seen in the best possible light. Relationships that proceed on these terms are based on respect and give us reason to expect that the other person involved will be willing to work with us in a constructive fashion, to accept our wishes and ideas as legitimate and to reach compromises that are genuinely agreeable. This isn't the only road to being liked, though. For plenty of people, Trump included, the primary criteria for whether someone is likable isn't whether he or she possesses a strong character, sparkling conversational skills or a well-calibrated moral compass: It's whether the person gives you what you want and tells you what you want to hear. No matter how much Trump would like to believe that Putin genuinely likes and respects him, it would be prudent - if not within his capacity - to consider the possibility that Putin has treated Trump warmly because he believes Trump can be easily manipulated into behaving like an obedient toady. Trump's desire for Putin's approval may be a more valuable asset for Putin than Putin's ostensible affection for Trump will be for the president-elect. Related Content The moment Trump's press conference degenerated into chaos BuzzFeed crossed the line in publishing salacious 'dossier' on Trump If it's possible to be esteemed for the wrong reasons, there are also people whose approval isn't worth having. Putin's long record of authoritarianism and corruption has been extensively documented. Presidents don't always have the luxury of purity, but their choices ought to become at least somewhat clearer when dealing with someone who pairs an ominous governing style with decisions that endanger American interests. And there are situations where a leader's governing style is so morally intolerable that it might not be acceptable to court his or her approval even for strategic reasons. Though it might be hard to imagine facing this choice personally, there are times when it's better to be called "son of a whore" than to garner glowing praise from someone who has bragged about personally carrying out extrajudicial executions in the midst of a murderous campaign against people who sell and use drugs. Advertisement Trump himself has occasionally appeared to recognise the value of this idea, if only on the level of personal expedience. "I don't want to energise the group. I'm not looking to energise them," he told editors and writers from the New York Times in November, when executive editor Dean Baquet asked Trump about his support from white nationalist groups.

More videos Trump: Russia report a 'blot' on intel community President-elect Donald Trump delivered his first formal press conference following the November presidential election in New York on Wednesday. For the purposes of argument, and given Trump's well-documented and exceptionally high self-regard, I'm going to assume that Trump believes that Putin likes him because Putin appreciates and admires the quality Trump values most in himself. That's not unusual; most of us hope to be loved for ourselves, and to be seen in the best possible light. Relationships that proceed on these terms are based on respect and give us reason to expect that the other person involved will be willing to work with us in a constructive fashion, to accept our wishes and ideas as legitimate and to reach compromises that are genuinely agreeable. This isn't the only road to being liked, though. For plenty of people, Trump included, the primary criteria for whether someone is likable isn't whether he or she possesses a strong character, sparkling conversational skills or a well-calibrated moral compass: It's whether the person gives you what you want and tells you what you want to hear. No matter how much Trump would like to believe that Putin genuinely likes and respects him, it would be prudent - if not within his capacity - to consider the possibility that Putin has treated Trump warmly because he believes Trump can be easily manipulated into behaving like an obedient toady. Trump's desire for Putin's approval may be a more valuable asset for Putin than Putin's ostensible affection for Trump will be for the president-elect. Related Content The moment Trump's press conference degenerated into chaos BuzzFeed crossed the line in publishing salacious 'dossier' on Trump If it's possible to be esteemed for the wrong reasons, there are also people whose approval isn't worth having. Putin's long record of authoritarianism and corruption has been extensively documented. Presidents don't always have the luxury of purity, but their choices ought to become at least somewhat clearer when dealing with someone who pairs an ominous governing style with decisions that endanger American interests. And there are situations where a leader's governing style is so morally intolerable that it might not be acceptable to court his or her approval even for strategic reasons. Though it might be hard to imagine facing this choice personally, there are times when it's better to be called "son of a whore" than to garner glowing praise from someone who has bragged about personally carrying out extrajudicial executions in the midst of a murderous campaign against people who sell and use drugs. Advertisement Trump himself has occasionally appeared to recognise the value of this idea, if only on the level of personal expedience. "I don't want to energise the group. I'm not looking to energise them," he told editors and writers from the New York Times in November, when executive editor Dean Baquet asked Trump about his support from white nationalist groups. "I don't want to energise the group, and I disavow the group. They, again, I don't know if it's reporting or whatever. I don't know where they were four years ago, and where they were for (Mitt) Romney and (John) McCain and all of the other people that ran, so I just don't know, I had nothing to compare it to. But it's not a group I want to energise, and if they are energised I want to look into it and find out why."

This was essentially the same thing Trump said last February when informed that former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke had endorsed him -- "David Duke endorsed me? OK, alright. I disavow, OK?" -- except multiple times, as if "disavow" or "energise" are magical words of power that could banish these pesky fans and the trouble they cause him. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Russian President Vladimir Putin has long been supportive of Trump. Photo: AP No matter how often Trump utters these incantations, they still the same thing as "(looking) into it and (finding) out why." Instead, these impatient, monotonous statements treat the cause of white nationalist enthusiasm for Trump as if it's incidental, rather than the result of anything he has said or any position he has taken. If Trump was serious about deflating the racists who see his administration as an opportunity to restore white power, it would not be difficult for him or his staff to figure out what racists respond to, and to stop doing it, or at least to actively and publicly discourage the ugliest interpretations of his rhetoric. Winning an election is certainly a matter of getting people to like you, though that can mean everything from "I could have a beer with him" to "I find him marginally less offensive than his opponents." The substance of the job that follows winning an election, though, has very little to do with being liked. I don't know if Trump will learn this the easy way, or the hard way, or whether he'll learn it at all.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Only a few days after releasing the third beta for iOS 10.2.1, Apple on Thursday released yet another update. It doesn’t appear there are any major changes in the latest update, but we’ll be sure to provide you with details should anything of significance pop up. Apple rolled out the first beta for iOS 10.2.1 last month and followed that up with another update before the New Year. With Apple’s updates becoming more frequent, we can likely expect the final release to appear in the not-so-distant future. Before iOS 10.2.1, Apple released iOS 10.2, which included new emoji, new wallpapers, a TV app, and additional iMessage effects. Developers can download the fourth iOS 10.2.1 beta right now.

Home Industry iPhone app purchasers may sue Apple Inc as US appeals court revives antitrust lawsuit against company iPhone app purchasers may sue Apple Inc as US appeals court revives antitrust lawsuit against company iPhone app purchasers may sue Apple Inc over allegations that the company monopolized the market for iPhone apps by not allowing users to purchase them outside the App Store, leading to higher prices, a US appeals court ruled on Thursday. By: Reuters | San Francisco | Published: January 13, 2017 2:45 AM Apple had argued that users did not have standing to sue it because they purchased apps from developers, with Apple simply renting out space to those developers. (Reuters) iPhone app purchasers may sue Apple Inc over allegations that the company monopolized the market for iPhone apps by not allowing users to purchase them outside the App Store, leading to higher prices, a US appeals court ruled on Thursday. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruling revives a long-simmering legal challenge originally filed in 2012 taking aim at Apple’s practice of only allowing iPhones to run apps purchased from its own App Store. A group of iPhone users sued saying the Cupertino, California, company’s practice was anticompetitive. Apple had argued that users did not have standing to sue it because they purchased apps from developers, with Apple simply renting out space to those developers. Developers pay a cut of their revenues to Apple in exchange for the right to sell in the App Store. You may also like to watch this: A lower court sided with Apple, but Judge William A. Fletcher ruled that iPhone users purchase apps directly from Apple, which gives iPhone users the right to bring a legal challenge against Apple. Apple declined to comment. The courts have yet to address the substance of the iPhone users’ allegations; up this point, the wrangling has been over whether they have the right to sue Apple in the first place. But if the challenge ultimately succeeds, “the obvious solution is to compel Apple to let people shop for applications wherever they want, which would open the market and help lower prices,” Mark C. Rifkin, an attorney with Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz representing the group of iPhone users, told Reuters in an interview. “The other alternative is for Apple to pay people damages for the higher than competitive prices they’ve had to pay historically because Apple has utilized its monopoly.” The case is Pepper et al v. Apple Inc., case number 4:11-cv-06714 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Please Wait while comments are loading...

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Apple looking at earphones equipped with fitness and health tracker By Ethan Baron / January 12, 2017 at 1:08 PM In an apparent bid to haul in an increased share of the multi-billion-dollar wearable fitness monitor market, Apple has filed an application to patent earphones equipped with a health- and fitness-tracking device. The market for wearable fitness devices is expected to hit an annual $12 billion by 2022, according to market intelligence firm Markets and Markets. And while the Apple Watch has some health- and fitness-monitoring functions, its use has not become widespread. Now, the Cupertino company is seeking a patent for a setup that combines earphones with a health-and-fitness monitor built in, or attached. The device would monitor user activity during exercise or sports, and also collect biometric data such as body temperature, perspiration level and heart rate, according to a patent application filed Sept. 22 and made public Jan. 12 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The technology could also allow the user to control their device with head movements, the application said. For the user, such a device could mean one less gadget to deal with, the application suggested. “Assuming the user is otherwise using the hearing device, such as to provide audio output by a portable media player, the user gains monitoring capabilities without requiring the user to wear or carry an additional article,” the application said. Apple envisions several options for design. The monitoring device could be integrated with the earphones. Or it could be attached to them, and removable. Or put into a housing attached to an earphones cord. Or attached to the user’s clothing. The application makes specific reference to the technology being suitable for either wired or wireless earphones, which would make it a fit for Apple’s new wireless “Airpods” earbuds. A user could also control the device via the monitor, but by moving the head rather than touching the device or monitor, according to the application. Applying for a patent does not necessarily mean developing a real product, so only time will tell if this technology makes it to market.   Image: Drawing of an Apple earphone equipped with a health-and-fitness tracker (U.S. Patent and Trademark Office)    Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: AirPods, Apple, earphones, fitness, headphones, health, tracker, wireless   More Posts in 1 Apple sued over girl’s death at hands of driver ‘distracted’ by FaceTime video call December 30, 2016   What do Airbnb users want in 2017?

Thursday, January 12, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Six Colors’ 2016 Apple Report Card Jason Snell: “Apple TV has effectively stood still in 2016, despite needing significant attention in UI and remote design, performance, bugs, and reliability,” said Marco Arment. “Third-party apps and games have mostly failed to materialize, with Apple making no meaningful changes to address this.” […] “I’ve been using Apple computers since 1980, and this is the first year where I feel like Apple is just another company rather than the computer that delighted me through all these decades,” said Brent Simmons. “It feels like Apple is no longer the company for people who make things.” “This is a company that has lost touch with its users,” said Kirk McElhearn. “They’re harming their reputation with long-time users, they’re killing themselves in the ‘pro’ sector, where Apple used to be the main provider, and even ‘average’ users are starting to question whether it’s worth buying Apple products.” Unlike much of the panel, I did not see a software quality improvement in 2016. Previously: Apple’s 2016 in Review, Six Colors’ Apple Report Card. Update (2017-01-12): Nick Heer: From my perspective, Apple’s 2016 was uneven, at best. Unlike the panel, I thought the iPad had a pretty poor 2016: the 9.7-inch iPad Pro was introduced in the spring, and then it seemed like they forgot all about the iPad’s hardware and software for the rest of the year. My Apple TV gets lots of use, but mostly as a Netflix and YouTube box; very few streaming services are available in Canada. The Mac story is frustrating, and software quality is still rough. Over the course of many of the products and updates introduced this year, I’ve also felt that Apple has struggled to establish clear narratives and compelling rationales. On a positive note, the reliability of Apple’s cloud services have noticeably improved, iOS 10 fixes many of my biggest complaints — while introducing some new ones — developer relations seem improved, and the company’s commitment to privacy is a particular highlight.

Back in 2015, when Apple unveiled the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, Apple SVP Phil Schiller said they ultimately picked the screen size because the width of the device matched the height of the existing 9.7-inch iPad. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is like having two 9.7-inch screens side by side. Provost takes this idea and runs with it. The width of a 10.5-inch iPad would match the height of the screen on an iPad mini. The 10.5-inch device would also match the resolution of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, while having the same pixel density of the iPad mini. The math works out perfectly. This new 10.5″ iPad would have the exact same resolution as the 12.9″ iPad Pro (2732 x 2048), but the same pixel density of the iPad mini (326 ppi instead of 264 ppi). Crunch the numbers, do a little Pythagorean Theorem, and you end up with a screen 10.5″ diagonal (10.47″ to be precise, but none of Apple’s stated screen sizes are exact). In terms of physcial dimensions, the width of this 10.5″ screen would be exactly the same as the height of the iPad mini screen. While it’s not confirmed, Provost makes a compelling argument for a 10.5-inch iPad. However, it would make more sense for Apple to drop the 9.7-inch iPad form factor in favor of the 10.5-inch, while retaining the iPad mini and 12.9-inch iPad Pro form factors.

Opinion | 12 Jan 2017 | Print  | Comment (19) Why We Should Care about the Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Rating by Glenn Fleishman Like many people, I scratched my head when Consumer Reports issued a “not recommended” evaluation of the 2016 MacBook Pro on 22 December 2016. It wasn’t that the new laptops are above reproach; rather, it was the huge inconsistency in battery life that CR saw across multiple tests of three different units. As a technology journalist, I knew what I’d do in that circumstance: assume it was my fault because of the erratic results in the tests — battery life ranging from 3.75 hours to 16 hours with the same model — and isolate my testing decisions until I found the problem, whether it was mine or Apple’s. I’ve done this many times myself, including finding significant bugs in the first 802.11n AirPort routers that Apple later fixed. The apparent reason for CR’s test result inconsistency was revealed on 11 January 2017. After Apple reviewed the test methodology provided by CR, the firm discovered a bug that affected a setting available only after enabling developer options in Safari. Apple has already released a developer beta of Sierra that fixes the bug, and CR says it will retest the laptops with the bug fix in place. Update: CR performed its tests with the fix in place and now recommends the MacBook Pro. I found myself aggravated by this situation, though not through a desire to defend Apple nor to denigrate Consumer Reports, despite its history in leading the charge on the non-existent Antennagate issue back with the iPhone 4 (see “Apple Responds to iPhone 4 Antenna Issue,” 16 July 2010). Rather, it’s the way in which CR failed to serve its readers, rather than how it interacted with Apple, that worries me. (CR is a subscription publication that also makes some material available to the general public at no cost.) By not revealing its test methods more fully in its original report or admitting that it should have done more work to exclude its setup as the reason for the results, I worry that CR’s actions reduce the credibility of all technology reporting and reviewing. Consumer Reports has more prominence on technology reviews now than at any previous time, because so few publications remain that have the staff and time to perform rigorous testing. I wrote recently for Fast Company about the difficulty of finding safe and reliable USB-C products because of a lack of extensive independent testing. Because of this, more people are likely to rely on CR’s recommendations, which could lead to poor buying decisions for two reasons: Users who might have benefited from purchasing newer gear might have unnecessarily put it off due to CR’s report. Because CR found in retesting that the problems were due entirely to this bug, it sent a message to all consumers — not just those who read Consumer Reports — that negative results may just be due to testing errors. To enable the setting in question, you must open Safari > Preferences > Advanced and select the Show Develop Menu in Menu Bar. Then, in the Develop menu, you have to choose Disable Caches. CR uses a script to pull a set of 10 Web pages over a local network repeatedly, and disables caching to simulate the effect of a user pulling down fresh pages from many sites. Without caching, the test provides a consistency that isn’t related to network or remote server performance; with caching enabled, Safari wouldn’t use the network or other system resources much at all. The bug apparently prevents caching of icons, which thrashes battery life in some cases. That said, almost no one would ever engage this setting — caches almost always improve performance. Thus, even though some new MacBook Pro owners are complaining about poor battery life relative to previous laptops and advertised performance, no regular user will encounter this particular bug. (Apple disabled the calculation of remaining battery time in macOS following the MacBook Pro release, reportedly due to its predictive accuracy, see “macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Focuses on New MacBook Pros,” 13 December 2016.) Consumer Reports did most of the things that are upheld as standards at responsible technology publications: it presented Apple with the testing results and gave Apple an opportunity to respond, but didn’t change its conclusion when Apple couldn’t explain the discrepancy. After publishing the results, CR provided additional detailed information to Apple, which analyzed it and determined where the bug in Safari lay. Since CR retested and found that battery life is comparable to previous models and competing laptops, it’s reasonable to ask what cost came with the first report. It may have cost Apple sales. No reporter should worry about whether their honest and well-researched test results might affect a company’s sales, but they should always be concerned with rigor and fairness. (A reporter can have qualms, especially when writing about small firms, but those need to be balanced with the readers’ best interests.) More concerning is the effect that CR’s report could have on the trust consumers place in Consumer Reports in particular and technology publications in general. Without a trusted technology press to verify corporate marketing claims, consumers will be left only with inherently biased sources of information. It’s extremely rare that any tech company actively aims to deceive consumers about the quality of its goods — see the recent debacle Samsung caused by not immediately owning up to Galaxy Note 7 problems — but everyone tries to paint their products in the best possible light. And it’s not hard for that paint job to verge into whitewashing away unpleasant realities. So yes, I question Consumer Reports publishing their recommendation without trying harder than they say they did to figure out why their tests provided such wildly inconsistent results. In fact, CR did test briefly with Google Chrome, in a process that wasn’t fully documented in the original article. CR obviously couldn’t recommend the MacBook Pro based on the Chrome test, but they could have used those results to help isolate the Safari problem in their test suite. The moral of the story is that, when the results of one test are so unusual, the correct thing to do is dig more, not introduce confusion into the world. The reason isn’t to save a company’s feelings or sales, but to keep your bond of trust with your readers. Note: This article appeared a few hours before CR issued its updated recommendations after retesting, finding consistent and high battery life.   PDFpen is your Swiss Army knife for PDFs.

Reply Derek Roff   2017-01-12 14:58 A good article, Glenn, but in spite of having been a subscriber for most of the last 60 years, I am more critical of Consumer Reports than you were in this text. For thirty years, they have been dumbing down their testing, and especially, their reporting of their testing. In the last ten years or so, there have been several scandals over various aspects of their procedures and ethics. While I'm not ready to rate Consumer Reports as "not recommended", my testing reveals multiple inconsistencies and errors that are a cause for concern. I hope that someday, they return to their former rigor and care. Reply Eric Ladner  2017-01-12 20:21 I do not always agree with Consumer Reports. I don't think I've ever bought a _bad_ product by following their recommendations, but I have not always thought that their top recommendations were the best choice for me, usually because what they considered most important in testing was not what was most important in my intended use. Still, I'm not sure I think they were at fault in this case. I admit that I know nothing about standards for writing testing protocols, but I can't quite follow the logic of your criticism. If they performed exactly the same tests multiple times on the same laptops, and got widely varying results, it seems a reasonable conclusion that the problem was with the product--which in fact it was. The fact that the tests used a setting that most users would never make doesn't really matter; any user _could_ do so. "The bug apparently prevents caching of icons, which thrashes battery life in some cases." What does "in some cases" mean? That the same laptop downloading the same 10 pages over and over until the battery is dead may achieve a widely differing number of downloads yesterday, today, and tomorrow? I think that indicates a problem with the product, not the test. And, how else could they have performed the test? "Without caching, the test provides a consistency that isn’t related to network or remote server performance; with caching enabled, Safari wouldn’t use the network or other system resources much at all." "Consumer Reports did most of the things that are upheld as standards at responsible technology publications: it presented Apple with the testing results and gave Apple an opportunity to respond, but didn’t change its conclusion when Apple couldn’t explain the discrepancy." Why in the world should they have changed their conclusion? They gave Apple the results and a chance to explain them, in advance of publication. What were they supposed to do then? Say, "We asked Apple about this and they don't know what's wrong, so we guess it's okay"? Yes, it might have been more thorough if Consumer Reports had pursued the problem themselves until they pinned it down, but was that really their responsibility? They discovered erratic behavior which could affect customers; they called it to Apple's attention; they reported on it. Finally, as to the cost of the report: The first thing you read now in the online copy of the test report is "(Update: Consumer Reports tested the new MacBook Pros after Apple issued a fix in response to our initial battery test results. We now recommend the laptops.)" Obviously, nothing can be done about the existing printed copies, but I will be extremely surprised if this update does not also appear in the first magazine issue to which it can be added. I always particularly look for the Glenn Fleishman byline on TidBITS articles, and I will continue to do so, even though now, as with Consumer Reports, I have to say that I don't always agree with you. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2017-01-12 20:28 They didn’t test using typical user settings, which is on them to figure out why there was a variance. If you create a test environment that produces inconsistent results, something’s wrong if, changing one variable, you get consistent results (trying Chrome, in their case). Given that no other testing they had done of Apple or other laptops produced such a result, they should have backed out their test setup to figure out if it was their fault. It wasn’t, but they also weren’t testing a typical user setup, so what was wrong wouldn’t affect any user except those who had forgotten they had changed an obscure setting used for testing. The preferred way to test network features is to set up a server that does what you want, not modify the stock hardware. (You can configure a server to prevent a Web browser from caching very easily.) I think you’re misreading a few parts of the article, especially about changing conclusions. Reply Bob Berardino  2017-01-12 21:32 I'm sorry, but after reading your initial article here, and your reply above, I cannot agree with your assessment of this situation. Nobody complained about CR when they recommended Apple products with this test protocol. They stressed the machine and encountered variation (the real problem here) above what was expected from this test. Switching to Chrome reduced the variation, indicating something with Safari, the default Apple browser. It is not CR's job to diagnose the problem, just to report their findings. They didn't recommend the MacBook Pro, and now everybody is shooting the messenger. They share their findings with Apple, which provided a bug fix, the variation is back to within expected results of their test, and they're back recommending the Mac. Thank you CR for helping to find this bug. Now, how much it helps users in real-life remains to be seen, but I think they did what they should be doing - report what they see based on testing they can control. Reply Brian D Vesley   2017-01-12 20:56 Amen. At some point another test program without using unusual computer settings should have been run to see if CR's test results were within a reasonable range. Poor methodology for a previously trusted consumer organization. Now skeptical about relying on them. Reply Tom Robinson   2017-01-12 21:19 Well stated Glenn. What's even worse is saying they now recommended it because of Apple's forthcoming fix is total blameshifting and gaslighting. Turning the cache off would never be done by end users, rarely by developers, and shouldn't be done in testing (for those reasons). Reply Simon   2017-01-13 03:44 I admit right off the bat I'm clueless about CR. That said, when it comes to this MBP battery story I am quite a bit more critical of Apple, actually. 1.) CR did perform the test using a Safari feature. Sure it might be a dev feature, but it's provided by Apple and for the type of test CR was performing it did indeed make sense to not rely on caching. 2.) CR did communicate openly about what they found and how they tested. The also involved Apple early from what I can tell. 3.) Because such inconsistency in testing is indeed worrisome (possibly more so than simply somewhat limited battery life alone), I believe it did made sense to report details, involve Apple, and inform consumers. The fact that they were apprently puzzled and therefore informed and involved more parties to me indicates they were truly interested in what's going on. Openly communicating not just results, but also your open questions to the very end is something that in my book also suggests seriousness. [As a physicist in research that is the way we are usually expected to handle things, so I admit I have a personal bias here.] 4.) Apple shipped buggy software that caused this "battery issue". 5.) This type of bug is typical Apple as of these days. It's related to a more subtle feature (a dev feature, i.e. something that might be considered 'pro') rather than something flashy that marketing can make a big hoopla over. Safari dev settings are just not sexy. So why bother? 6.) Their lack of attention to detail (something they once absolutely killed at) is exactly what leads to bugs like this one making their way to production software. 7.) When you sell a computer to customers for $2400 the product has to be considered solid and ready. You don't take $2400 and then involve your paying customers into some kind of involuntarily beta test where ultimately an independent consumer organization then has to do your software debugging for you. Just consider for a moment how ridiculous this is. Apple is sitting on something like $250B and employees probably thousands of skilled engineers, yet in the end they have essentially let a magazine test their hardware/software integration on their latest and greatest new product! 8.) I think CR should have held off on issuing a recommendation until the bug fix provided by Apple is rolled into a macOS version that is shipping to customers. Trying out the fix in a beta update is fine for testing purposes, but the recommendation to the public needs to be based on what's shipping, not what might ship and then might work. 9.) Everybody makes mistakes. It's a good thing this turned out to be a bug that can apparently be resolved easily and Apple appears willing to soon release a public fix. I'm happy CR found the bug and glad their tests will hopefully lead to getting a fix to customers soon. 10.) And finally, the battery life CR now reports consistently is indeed very good. I hope this translates to everyday use for most people. I know one thing I always loved about my 2013 13" MBP was its awesome battery life despite the Core i7, 16 GB RAM, and its 500 GB SSD (maxed out at the time). Reply Tom Robinson   2017-01-13 04:10 4, 5, 6: No software is 100% perfect. The 100s of man hours spent investigating & fixing this obscure bug in a barely used developer option could instead have been used to actually benefit real-world users. 7 & 10: how many customers turn on the Develop menu and then disable caching? Reply Glenn Fleishman   2017-01-13 09:47 1. When the test produced unexpected results, they should have gone back to a stock configuration and re-tested (not for recommendation but for evaluation). You can prevent caching on the server side, which is typically done to isolate browser issues. 2. They didn't reveal their methodology fully until the second post after Apple had discovered the bug. The initial report says they informed Apple before publishing, not that they did so "early." 5. The feature used is for debugging and testing, not for normal use. It's absolutely Apple's bug, but it's never something that would be enabled casually, even by a developer. Reply hapa powamoku  2017-01-13 07:05 i appreciate the question whether CR lost some cred here, but when CR made its first announcement, i was already recommending people wait to buy until the already known battery life issue was resolved. (removing the battery estimate from ALL notebooks to cover a problem w/ the new ones was pretty dodgy.) also i guess in CR's defense: i had an early iphone 4. i had it drop calls, until i put it in a case. when the "non-existent" problem was fixed, i was glad to be able to give an older relative a 4S w/o reservation. it burns me that apple PR won the antennagate fight so decisively: "you're holding it wrong" was blaming the user for a design problem. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2017-01-13 09:50 I agree: the battery life issue remains concerning because of reports. However, the basis on which the recommendation was made and the follow-up doesn't reassure me that they would examine their own testing better in the future, thus harming the credibility of all reviewers. The Antennagate issue was "resolved" in that nearly all phones at the time had the problem — remember that "how to hold your phone" was in the manual for competing phones — and it didn't affect people in a substantive way that led them to return the phone in greater numbers than previous models. Reply hapa powamoku  2017-01-13 17:16 obviously it was a great phone—i used mine more than 3 years, it's actually still doing offline things around the house, i have no idea what might kill it—but the long fury at CR (& not at other outlets that reported same, including new york times) raises trust questions about apple's press corps. apple is a giant company, intensely secretive, intensely *manipulative*, with tens of billions to spare on PR; consumer reports is not. Reply jfutral  2017-01-13 11:33 Hmmm... You would have a stronger point if CR was the only place reporting battery issues. And a methodology that has consistently awarded Apple and MBP recommendations in the past, regardless of "developer menu" blah, blah, blah, really does say the issue is with Apple, not CR. CR was consistent. MBP was not. Joe Reply Glenn Fleishman   2017-01-13 13:50 But you miss my point, then: it isn't that the battery life was low. It was that it was inconsistent and didn't match results in other testing from other publications. Yes, there are absolutely stories (which I've read, too) from readers seeing unacceptably poor battery life. (In fact, see a comment in this thread.) However, CR's methodology didn't produce a consistent result, and it rests on them to understand why their testing setup produced a variance. Had they done what I and other reviewers typically do to isolate causes, they would have found their setup was not at fault. By more or less shrugging, releasing a "not recommended" rating, then revising that without any seeming self-reflection about their process, it doesn't serve readers well in providing a rigorous, trustworthy assessment. The point isn't that the outcome would have been different. Rather, that readers would have understood that it was clearly not the testing process that was at fault. This would have further enhanced CR's credibility and conclusions. Reply jfutral  2017-01-13 14:18 I don't think this one anomaly should have caused CR reflection on their methodology. I thin (and you're the first person I've read report this, so good on you) that they reached out to Apple before publishing because it was such an anomaly. So they did not _just_ shrug. So, again, the inconsistency was on Apple and MBP's part, not CR's. They were certainly resting on a methodology that has proven more than adequate for many years with no reason to think this time should be any different. What I am curious about is if the bug is actually an effect or symptom of the actual cause of battery issues many people are having. The Safari Developer bug is just the unexpected way for it to have been exposed. It may not be that this was only CR methodology specific. So, in a different way, I do agree that we should care about the report. Joe Reply Chris CIa  2017-01-13 12:10 Don't know about the Consumer Reports testing issue. WHat I do know is that I returned not one but TWO MacBook Pro 2016's because i could not get more than 3 1/2 hours of battery life from either. As a person on airplanes nearly every week that was unacceptable. Instead I keep using my MacBook Pro 2015 which provides nearly triple the battery power I experienced. I've owned about 20 MacBook Pro's over the past 20+ years so I love them and am not an Apple basher. Something else must be a factor. Reply Scott Randell  2017-01-13 13:42 HI Glenn, I am so glad you did this on TidBits. OK I really don't care what CR says, and as you say the problem has already been fixed. But I think there is another reason why you should not buy the Touch Bar Macbook Pro or the MacBook. These units are not repairable or upgradable. Not by the use or even an authorized Mac Repair shop. The 13 inch (let's start with this, but I think an actual power user may want the 15 inch or use this with an external display) with 500 GB of storage 16 GB of ram and AppleCare it is $2449.00. If after AppleCare expires something goes wrong say the storage unit fails (not likely but it could happen) the only repair is a complete logic board replacement. In speaking to one of the techs in my local repair shop, they estimate at that time it would be between $800.00 and $1000.00. Really not fair. I think Apple should increase AppleCare coverage to 6 years for units which require new LB to repair. Reply AuntieBob  2017-01-15 09:42 Like most "seasoned" professionals, I reserve my purchasing till after others have gone through a bottle of advil or tylenol. My first reaction when I read the CR not recommending was, See! Apple! You Are Fallible! Then I drank my last sip of latté and thought, well, if CR found this, there has to be something going on. Apple tends to throw legal anchors at folks. Then when I read that Apple was going to discuss this with CR (I hate marketing speak and leveraging...aka strongarming) and even saw the AAPL had dropped (a wee bit) after CR's putting the MBP on notice, I was suddenly skeptical. My impression (sans all the facts), along with the last few years of Apple's QC (don't get me started on them discontinuing Airport routers) isn't good. This isn't so much about CR (they make mistakes) but that it sounded like Apple wanted to backpedal/discredit them (sales are not up) and Apple's focus on iOS rather than MacOS clearly reflects "push it out the door, fix later" mentality.

Last week the library announced it had released a new version for Android devices. next play/pause pre St. Thomas-Elgin Weekly News By Sean Meyer Last summer, the nearly 14,000 cardholders of the Elgin County Library were given the chance to handle their resources needs through a new app available on their favourite Apple device. As the calendar turned to 2017, Android users were given the same opportunity. On Jan. 6, the library announced the release of the MyLibrary app, offering the same functionality for Android devices, allowing patrons to manage their library accounts on the go. “We are thrilled to offer MyLibrary to our patrons who use an Android device,” said Elgin County Library co-ordinator Laura Molnar. “The app is very popular with our current users, and offering a second platform greatly expands our ability to serve our total user base.” Molnar said she has spoken to many people since the July 2016 launch of the Apple version of MyLibrary and has heard only positive remarks. In fact, she said the most common comment from users is, “I love it so much, when does it come out for Android?” The intention all along had been to have an Android version ready for release by the end of 2016. Innovative Interfaces Inc., which manages the library’s software and created the MyLibrary app, met that deadline — albeit barely — having the Android version ready on Dec. 28, 2016. “I get very excited when I talk about it and I think that creates excitement in others. But even if it is other people discussing it, everyone seems so excited,” Molnar said. “That’s a wonderful feeling, to feel that excitement that is being generated around it. I think it’s so well liked because it is so simple to use. It really is elegant.” While first-hand accounts are an important metric of success, so too are hard numbers. With that in mind, Molnar reached out to Innovative a couple of months ago to see how the app was rolling out. At that time it was mainly just the Elgin County and London Public libraries using the app, but it had already seen upwards of 300 downloads. That number, Molnar said, tells her the library is on the right track with the app and now just has to keep spreading the word. “We’re hoping to do more advertising . . . we talk about it in our branches; we promote it on our social media,” she said. “Our patrons love the idea they can take it with them and easily tap on the app, manage their account, see what’s available to pick up. It has all of this nice functionality, all our social media comes is pulled into one, easy to access app. It’s all right there.” The app is free to download and includes four primary features: • Scan Book. Simply scan the barcode on any book’s cover to see if it is available at the library, and in what formats. • Search Catalog. This will link users to the mobile version of the library catalogue, making it easer to search the catalogue and place holds on items. • My Account. Allows the user to see their checkouts, holds, and profile information. In addition, the app will scan a library card, making it easy for first-time users to sign in to the app. • Social Media.

(Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group) By Levi Sumagaysay | lsumagaysay@bayareanewsgroup.com and Patrick May | pmay@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: January 12, 2017 at 11:51 am | UPDATED: January 13, 2017 at 3:37 am After hinting around for months that it was dipping its toes into the world of streaming content, Apple is now reportedly ready to jump in with both feet. According to unnamed sources in a Wall Street Journal story Thursday, the Cupertino tech giant has big plans to create original scripted shows by the end of this year. And the company is powwowing with Hollywood execs about bundling original shows, and possibly movies, with its Apple Music Service. The report is not a surprise. Last year, Apple made news when it announced plans to produce 16 episodes of Carpool Karaoke, the popular sketch that The Late Late Show’s James Corden has made a runaway hit among late-night TV viewers, even though Corden is not going to appear in them. In July, Apple announced plans to produce Planet of the Apps, its first reality show that is being put together by entertainer will.i.am. And there has been talk of Apple working on a six-episode series in production by rapper and record producer Dr. Dre. Also last year, Apple hired former Time Warner Cable heavyweight Peter Stern to work directly with its software and services Senior Vice President Eddy Cue, a move that suggests an effort to launch more original content. As a Variety article pointed out at the time, “after trying for some time to directly license programming from key networks, Apple has more recently refocused its efforts towards providing the infrastructure for third-party services to run on with its Apple TV device. At the same time, Apple has also been slowly increasing its investment into original content, leading some to believe that the company may be testing the waters for the launch of a full-blown video service at some point down the line.” Apple, which has not commented on the reports, has got its work cut out for it if it hopes to get anything close to the culture-bending success that Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other streaming-content kings have had in the past few years. Apple does have a built-in audience – 20 million paid subscribers – and a built-in delivery platform in its Apple Music app, but the competition going forward will be intense as Apple tries to play with the big boys of streaming.

Check out our new Apple News app channel here. “When you look at Hulu or Amazon or Netflix, they have lots of other content as well, so the question is: Will Apple’s business model be competitive with these other providers already in the market?” said analyst Van Baker with Gartner. “Because you’d have to have a pretty full portfolio of stuff to get people to sign up for your service, and I question whether Apple’s going to be able to pull that off.” Amazon and Hulu have been on a content-producing roll, with the former now having cranked out seven dramas, including the acclaimed The Man in The High Castle, along with seven comedies, featuring works by Woody Allen and winners like Mozart in the Jungle. Hulu currently has 11 original comedies, a handful of comedies and documentaries and a long list of shows in the works. Related Articles iPhone’s 10th anniversary: How the Apple product some critics panned changed our lives Amazon plans to hire 100,000 over the next 18 months But it’s Los Gatos-based Netflix that remains the king of the content hill. Netflix has gone from a DVD-by-mail service launched in 1997 to a subscription-based online service in 1999. In the years since, it has amassed a paid-subscription audience of 25 million just in the United States, according to the data-compilation firm Statista. And estimates show Netflix on pace to reach 24.4 million subscribers by 2020 — in Brazil alone. Its growth has been explosive at times: Netflix’s global subscriber base, for example, went from around 26 million in the first quarter of 2012 to more than 75 million by the fourth quarter of 2015. And all those subscribers have been signing up because of all that content, starting with Netflix’s first self-commissioned original content series House of Cards, which premiered in 2013 and has maintained a huge following to this day. Netflix released more than 125 original series or films in 2016, more than any other single American network or cable channel. The Netflix audience has helped make huge hits out of shows like Orange is the New Black, Narcos and Stranger Things, whose young cast stole the show at last week’s Golden Globes awards ceremony. Still, some think Apple’s got a good shot at success, assuming the content it produces is, well, binge-worthy. With so-called OTT, or over-the-top, content, Netflix and others provide a wide range of quality content. That leads analyst Greg Ireland with IDC to think that while Apple may be behind the curve, it still has a great opportunity to profit in the space. “Yes, they’re behind in entering this market now, but with OTT, I don’t see the market growing for one provider at the expense of another,’’ he said. “The services are priced competitively. So you could take the $80 you spend each month for your TV bundle and move it over to OTT, where you can find great diversity and quality of content and you can afford to subscribe to more than one. For Apple, I think it comes down to its execution around the content it produces. Will it resonate with viewers? Will Apple create compelling content and all the buzz that goes along with that?’’ Tags:  Amazon Apple Apple Music Hulu Movies Netflix Technology Television Levi Sumagaysay Levi Sumagaysay is editor for the Bay Area News Group in charge of the SiliconBeat.com technology blog and Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter.

 FX boss: I 'worry' about what Silicon Valley will do to TV Jethro Nededog Jan. 12, 2017, 10:34 PM 4,840 facebook linkedin twitter email print John Landgraf at the Winter 2017 Television Critics Association press tour. Getty Images PASADENA, California — FX Networks President John Landgraf addressed Apple's announcement that it will be producing original television shows during the Television Critics Association press tour on Thursday. Earlier on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is taking meetings with Hollywood studios with the intention of producing original TV shows, including scripted programming, and movies by the end of 2017. Its first original series is "Carpool Karaoke," a half-hour interview series for Apple Music based on James Corden's hit segment from CBS's "The Late Late Show." Landgraf, who has been raising red flags about the continually growing amount of TV shows, aka "peak TV," was surprisingly accepting of Apple's announcement. In the past, he's objected to the influx of programming from the tech industry, specifically Netflix. FX research shows that there were 454 scripted TV shows in 2016, a new record. "There’s extraordinary amounts of resource and capital in Silicon Valley and they’re beginning to flow through Netflix and Amazon, and now others in the programming business, and that is creating an acceleration of this increased programming," Landgraf said of Apple's announcement. "We welcome those competitors," he continued. "Ultimately, what we’ve tried to do is identify it, label it, but we haven’t tried to use it as an excuse for a lack of performance. You can’t deny it’s happening. How good does a show have to be to be good enough for you to care about, to be relevant in this environment? The bar gets higher every year." But Landgraf said that he continues to worry about the new wave of TV shows and companies creating them. He compared that to the problem of "fake news" in which facts are treated as subjective. Landgraf refers to the growing amount of companies producing TV as "fragmentation." "There’s a lot of good that comes from fragmentation," he explained. "We see new and diverse voices. And young, talented people who have never had an opportunity are getting an opportunity and great television is coming from that. We’re trying to be a part of that as much as possible. I think my worry of where we’re going as a culture is that I don’t like the fact that everyone has their own news and I hope that we don’t get to the point where everyone has their own individual television show. "We want to make good commercial shows," he continued. "We want to be able to be a part of the conversation in America. I worry when you have 500 shows, 600 shows, 700 scripted shows. By the way, if you take all the shows, I still worry about where we’re going through the democratization of the internet. I can see the fragmentation created by the web." Landgraf also said he's "going out on a limb" and sticking to his prediction that 2018 will be the final year of peak TV and the number of scripted shows will decrease after that.

Get the full scoop on the phone’s new design, specs and all the features in store. Design The new model is rumoured to be 5.5 inches and is likely to have an OLED display with a dual camera lens. It may also feature curved edges like the Samsung Galaxy S7 that may respond to touch gestures. Rumours have also been swirling that Apple is planning to do away with the physical home button and replace it with a touch sensitive button placed on the screen itself. It may also feature similar haptic feedback technology as seen in the iPhone 7 to create the illusion of a home button. This would mean that there is no visible bezel or button. We’ve also heard that the new phone could feature biometric additions like a facial scanner and even an iris scanner. Apple may also move the SIM tray to the bottom or even to the edge. We think it may be to make room for a Smart Connector. Knowing Apple we’re pretty sure they are working several years ahead on the iPhone line. We feel there’s a good chance that they’re already testing future models and prototypes way ahead of the iPhone 8. Specifications This is pretty simple to predict if you follow the logical progression of iPhones chipsets over the years. iPhone 6 and its versions came with the A8 processor, 6s came with A9, iPhone 7 had the A10 fusion chip. No prizes for guessing that the iPhone 8 is likely to feature the A11 chip. We also believe that Apple has been adding coprocessors to handle artificial intelligence and the new chipset will build further on this. Apple will also bump up the RAM and cameras, rumours point to a high resolution front camera, since the front camera usage has increased significantly. iPhone 8 is rumoured to be available in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB storage options. However, the 10th anniversary iPhone may replace the 32GB variant with a 64 GB iPhone as a base model. Recent reports suggest that Apple could be working on custom GPUs and even modems for better networks and wireless connectivity. Wireless Charging We are most excited about this rumour, which is something we’ve heard from Apple previously. Leaks from Apple HQ have pointed at ‘cutting edge wireless technology’ that could change the future of iPhones and iPads. This means you could walk into a room and wirelessly charge your device without a physical cable. Apple is said to be working on overcoming technical barriers including loss of power over distance, in this case. Rumours say that wireless charging could have a long range, upto 15ft away. We’re interested in finding out if Apple moves to a glass back instead of metal to facilitate this feature or if they continue to use aluminium and offer wireless charging. Apple filled a patent for a particular type of wireless charging that will allow iPhone users to charge wirelessly when placed near an iMac that has the same technology, called NFMR power or near field magnetic resonance.   Name and Variants The 10th anniversary iPhone is expected to be available in three variants according to some rumours. The names may accordingly be iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, along with an iPhone 8 which will have all the high end features like wireless charging and curved OLED display. Launch Date The iPhone launch cycle is expected to remain the same, with the 10th Anniversary iPhone/s launching in September of 2017. However Apple may hold an earlier event for a revision of the iPhone SE which is expected in February. On our Wishlist Now that we’ve given you a lowdown of all the rumour mills, we’d like to share our wishlist for the iPhone 8: Waterproofing: It’s time for Apple to take the plunge into complete waterproof technology for all its future devices. While the iPhone 7 is water ‘resistant’ (rated IP67) which means it can survive accidental splashes and dunks, we’d like to go swimming with the new iPhone 8 and even take underwater pictures. Better Display and Truer Tones: Apple has shied away from doing major updates to their device displays. The iPhone 7 (4.7″) comes with 1334 x 750 display and 7s Plus (5.5″) comes with a 1920 x 1080p resolution. We’d like to see a significant bump to 1920 x 1080 for the 4.7-inch model and 2560 x 1440 for the 5.5-inch model. We hope the new phone comes with a True Tone system to enhance display colours. Fast Charging and Better Battery Performance: It’s 2017 and it’s time for Apple to adapt to fast charge technology. We’ve seen dash charging in most Android phones which allow phones to be charged faster in lesser time. We hope that the new iPhone 8 will feature this tech with or without a cable. We also feel it’s time for Siri to retire and for Apple to reign in the new super assistant – Jarvis. Heard that rumour? No? Well, we’d like to start it. What is on your wishlist for the iPhone 8?

Citing people familiar with the matter, the WSJ report indicates that Apple is looking to “build a significant new business” in the area to make it a bigger player in Hollywood to offset slowing sales of its iPhone and iPad devices. Sources suggest that Apple would offer this programming to existing Apple Music subscribers to give it a competitive edge over rival streaming music services. Apple has reportedly talked with veteran producers over the past few months about buying rights to scripted television programs, and the company has attempted to woo experienced studio and network marketing executives to come on board to help promote the new content. Plans right now appear to be focused primarily on TV, with plans to produce original movies being in the more preliminary stages. Sources suggest that shows would likely be comparable to critically acclaimed programs from HBO or Netflix, but it also doesn’t look like Apple is yet prepared to spend the billions of dollars annually to become a direct competitor to Netflix or Amazon Prime. Apple executives have apparently told people in Hollywood that they hope to start offering original scripted content by the end of 2017.

Barely Grew Mac Market Share Last Quarter Do you see what happens when you neglect the Mac? Do you see what happens? Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Jan 12, 2017 at 2:52PM The new MacBook Pro appears to have only slightly helped Apple's Mac unit shipments. Image source: Apple. The iPhone wasn't the only Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) product to stall in 2016. The Mac has certainly seen better days, too, and the Mac maker lost global PC market share throughout much of 2016. Well, market researcher IDC has just released its latest estimates on the global PC market for the fourth quarter, and there's a little bit of good news for Apple investors. According to the estimates, Apple might have barely notched a gain in its global PC market share. A total of 70.2 million PCs were shipped in the fourth quarter, representing a year-over-year decline of 1.5%. Apple shipped roughly 5.3 million Macs by IDC's count, which represents a decline of just 0.9%. That's technically enough to earn Apple a tiny bit more market share, performing slightly better than the broader market. Breaking the trend According to IDC's quarterly estimates, Apple underperformed the PC market in Q2 and Q3, so outperforming the PC market in Q4, however slight, still breaks the negative trend. Quarter Apple Change (YOY) Worldwide PC Market Change (YOY) Q1 2016 (2.1%) (11.5%) Q2 2016 (8.3%) (4.5%) Q3 2016 (13%) (3.9%) Q4 2016 (0.9%) (1.5%) Data source: IDC. However, it's worth noting that IDC's estimates don't always line up with the actual volumes that Apple reports. In fact, Apple's official figures are worse than IDC's for the first three quarters of 2016 (Q4 results will be released later this month). The company saw Mac units fall by 11.6% in the first quarter, so Apple actually lost share for the first three quarters of the year. This marks the fifth consecutive year that the global PC market has contracted. For the full year, there were an estimated 260.2 million PCs shipped worldwide, down 5.7% from 2015. Rivals like HP and Dell fared well, growing by 1.3% and 4.3% respectively. Back to the Mac Apple has seemingly recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, which is also when it launched its controversial new MacBook Pro. On one hand, the new notebook suffered from supply constraints throughout most of the quarter. Many customers that placed orders early still didn't receive their products until December. It's challenging to fully gauge demand when suffering from supply constraints. More broadly, Apple has received some deserved criticism over its continued neglect of the Mac, despite recent comments from CEO Tim Cook that Apple is "very committed" to the Mac and that "great desktops" are in the pipeline. Even Apple's former ad man Ken Segall is boggled by what is taking the company so long to update its lineup. For the longest time, Apple disregarded traditional resource allocation methodologies, simply focusing on building great products and trusting that the financials will take care of themselves. But it seems that under Cook the company may be implementing traditional resource allocation methodologies, where the most important products (iOS devices) get the most attention. It doesn't matter if this is a conscious decision or an inadvertent one -- Mac development is clearly suffering. As long as the Mac remains second-class relative to the iPhone, investors can continue to expect market share losses. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Amazon's Bezos who met with President-Elect Trump last Month Announced 100,000 new U.S. Jobs on the way | Main | Apple Introduces Live Map Advisories for Public Transit » January 12, 2017 Xiaomi, Another Apple Hater Stumbles and refuses to announce their Horrible Smartphone Sales Figures   Last month Patently Apple posted a report titled "Flash in the Pan LeEco, who Likened Apple to Hitler, Lost Millions on Smartphones and is Dire Cost Cutting Mode." LeEco's ego maniac CEO who likened Apple to Hitler and told CNBC that Apple was outdated found that actually running a successful business takes discipline and innovation that matters rather than flash in the pan thinking that ran out of money because the banks strangled his business to stop widly spending. LeEco lost money on smartphones and are now seen as nothing but a flash in the pan. Xiaomi was another favored company by Wall Street seeing them as the next Apple. Hugo Barra, Vice President of International – whatever that means – told Bloomberg that they, little Xiaomi couldn't allow Apple to take ownership of smartphone design.   Xiaomi is just the latest to fall off the map of relevancy as they embarrassingly stated that they weren't going to stand by tradition and reveal how many smartphones they sold in 2016. A Xiaomi rep confirmed to TechCrunch that the company would not be disclosing its 2016 sales numbers.   Xiaomi is using the very same excuse that LeEco used, as in … Oh we grew too fast and that's why we're having problems. Funny, Apple's sales exploded with the iPhone and iPad and never used the excuse that the dog eat their homework. Apple had many times their combined growth and still reported to Wall Street and made money then and still hold 91% of the smartphone industry profits – because they're a professionally run company on a global scale.   Xiaomi, like LeEco, is just another company run by big mouths who took cheap shots at Apple and have now stumbled from being unable to manage their growth like true business leaders. The Steve Jobs wannabe CEO and co-founder Lei Jun, according to many, is a joke.     He recently wanted to show some Steve Jobs magic by introducing their new smartphone that was designed in-part by French designer Philippe Stark who lent a hand in designing the yacht for the late Steve Jobs. Jun's obsession over wanting to be like Steve Jobs is actually a little creepy.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

TECHNOLOGY 8 Big Tech Battles That Will Be Fought In 2017 Here are 8 likely technology-related battles that will be fought in 2017 - in Washington, in courts, and in markets. Those who understand the issues and the opportunities that they create could stand to make a fortune. By Joseph Steinberg Joseph Steinberg is a cybersecurity expert and entrepreneur. He is CEO of SecureMySocial, which recently brought to market the world's first system to warn people in real time if they are making inappropriate social media posts. He is also the inventor of several popular cybersecurity technologies, and the author of books and articles on information security and business-related topics. Full bio: www.JosephSteinberg.com @JosephSteinberg CEO, SecureMySocial@JosephSteinberg WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement 2017 will likely see many big technology-related battles - in Washington, in courts, and in markets. Each of these battles will produce winners and losers - those who understand the issues and the opportunities that they create could stand to make a fortune. Here are 8 likely battles to be fought: Cybersecurity Regulation After a presidential election in which hacking and email security dominated many conversations (and continue to do so months afterward) - expect to see both efforts by Congress to pass various legislation related to cybersecurity, and pushback from various elements within the technology industry. Consumer use of encryption is likely to be one of the areas seeing significant disagreements - President-elect Donald Trump, for example, sided with the FBI when it demanded that Apple create a backdoor in iPhone security earlier this year; the technology industry generally supported Apple. Internet of Things (IoT) Security As consumers and businesses continue to adopt smart devices at a growing rate, and in light of IoT malware that caused major Internet disruptions this past fall, there will likely be a battle between regulators and industry groups on the one hand, and consumers and some manufacturers on the other. Consumers want cheap devices, and there are firms that specialize in offering cheap technology; the government, industry groups, and cybersecurity professionals, on the other hand, want IoT devices to be made with some minimal security capabilities in order to prevent their being easily compromised and commandeered for DDoS attacks. But, adding features such as security improvements costs money, something that consumers do not like to spend on features about which they do not care. Foreign Worker Visa Reform With Republicans running the show in Congress, and with a new President who has promised to bring jobs back to the USA and enforce immigration laws with greater diligence than his predecessor, we are likely to see increased scrutiny vis-à-vis the issuance of H1-B visas, which allow technical workers from overseas to work in the USA. There is evidence that the visas have sometimes been used as part of corporate efforts to replace American workers with cheaper labor from oversees; one plan that has been discussed by various Republicans would require companies to pay any employee working on an H1-B visa at least $100,000. Such a change would impact technology companies, other employers, and possibly even school districts that have hired some teachers from overseas - and is opposed by many in the tech industry. Democrats, whose primary concern vis-à-vis immigration has typically been to address the issue of millions of people living in the United States who are unable to work due to their having entered the country illegally, may also push back against changes that only address H1-Bs. Contractors Being Reclassified as Employees Many sharing-economy type businesses (e.g., Uber) utilize external workers who the firms classify as contractors - making large portions of their de-facto staffs ineligible for various benefits, and saving the firms on payroll taxes. Some governments have already expressed discomfort with this - in March, California regulators found that a couple Uber drivers were eligible for unemployment benefits as if they were employees, and, in October, New York State regulators found the same; we can expect more States to take action in 2017. The battle will also likely expand in many areas from unemployment benefits to full employee classification - meaning eligibility for benefits as well as the need for employer's to pay half of the Social Security and Medicare taxes due on a worker's earnings. This type of situation is not entirely different than one that occurred during the dot-com era. There could also be substantial battles if contractors whom a government reclassifies as employees petition courts with claims that they should have received employee stock options no differently than employees hired at the same time - a situation that has happened in the past. Regulations Regarding Self-Driving Cars and Trucks We are only at the extreme tip of the iceberg of the self-driving car revolution, but there still may be some big battles in 2017. In 2016 we saw San Francisco reject Uber's self-driving cars, while Pittsburgh embraced them. Expect to see more conflicts as business and individuals try to deploy more self-driving cars; eventually, detailed, formal regulations will be put into place. The issues with self-driving cars are complex - besides all of the technological necessities, there are moral dilemma that may be regulated differently in different locations (e.g., if a car realizes that it is going to get into a crash, should it do its best to protect its occupants at the expense of others, or its best to protect all humans in the area at the expense of its occupants). The self-driving vehicle battle will explode when unions get involved, something that is certain to happen as self-driving trucks become a practical reality, and eventually render nearly all long-distance truck driving jobs obsolete and unnecessary. The benefits of self-driving trucks are tremendous -- besides the inherent cost savings, the trucks can also drive 24 hours a day with no need to stop for sleep -- which will likely make their arrival and mass deployment happen much faster than people realize, ensuring that there will be lobbying and legal battles in the not so distant future. The Legality of Regulation-Skirting Tech Firms On that note, businesses and unions hurt by disruptive technology will continue to battle against it, and government regulators intent on enforcing existing laws will continue to watch tech firms for violations. Many disruptive firms facilitate activities that circumvent regulations - and sometimes regulators and courts don't approve. Not that long ago, we saw the Supreme Court effectively shut down Aereo's television antenna sharing service, and AirBnB is currently battling New York, San Francisco, and Santa Monica over the legality of regulations that impose fines for various popular uses of its service. Obamacare-Dependent Technology Many, if not most, technology companies that rely directly or indirectly on the Affordable Care Act (AKA Obamacare), will likely feel the impact of whatever changes the Republicans make to the existing system - there will be plenty of lobbying, and, some issues that develop, will, no doubt, lead to battles in court. The repeal of Obamacare will also likely create opportunities in remote medical care - leading to battles (perhaps after 2017) between technology companies in that emerging market, and, eventually, a battle over much less expensive, out-of-country doctors treating patients in the USA. All Marijuana-Related Technology Despite all of the media reports about the legalization of marijuana in many states, pot is technically illegal by federal law (even for medicinal purposes) anywhere and everywhere in the United States. While President Obama has opted not to enforce federal law in situations where marijuana would be legal per state law, President-elect Trump could decide to do otherwise, or to enforce the law in some situations in which Obama did not (for example, allowing the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes where it is allowed by state law, but not allowing the recreational use of marijuana anywhere). Changes in this regard will lead to state governments fighting the federal government, will lead to issues for technology firms processing marijuana-related payments or servicing other needs of the cannabis industry, and will create legal battles for the many startups directly involved in the marijuana business. Investors will likely remain on the sideline until the dust settles. Like this column? Sign up to subscribe to email alerts and you'll never miss a post.

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     Apple reportedly planning major push into TV shows and movies Listen | Print By Business Insider     Jan 12, 2017 in Technology Apple is preparing for a major push into original video content, according to a new report from The Wall Street Journal — a move that could set it on a collision course with the likes of Netflix and Amazon. The California-based technology giant is reportedly planning to bundle original video content with its Apple Music subscription service by the end of 2017. It has apparently been talking to "veteran producers" about both original TV shows and movies — though the movie plans are reportedly more "preliminary." Apple has already shown some appetite for original video content — it bought the "Carpool Karaoke" TV series starring James Corden in July. But this would be a significant broadening of these ambitions. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment. Netflix and Amazon Prime are two of the major players in on-demand video, and both have extensive libraries of original content. But The Journal is reporting that — at least for now — Apple doesn't intend to try to match their libraries. Instead, the company would hope for its smaller collection of content to aid Apple Music's battle against its archrival music-streaming service Spotify. The move would also help to boost Apple's services business, an increasingly important area for the company as its hardware sales slow down. Historically, Apple has been all about "hits" — launching huge, revolutionary products that provide a major boost to the company (in theory). But with the exception of the Apple Watch, it hasn't launched a significant new product since Tim Cook became CEO in 2011, and sales growth of iPhones — on which the company is highly reliant — is slowing. Subscription services offer Apple an opportunity to generate recurring revenue and better monetise its existing user base. Even if Apple isn't immediately seeking to go head-to-head with the likes of Netflix and Amazon, it would still be a development of concern to the two subscription services. Apple enjoys enormous profits and has huge cash reserves — and is under increasing pressure to find new growth. If it develops the will to go all-in on original content, it has the resources to outspend anyone else in the market. This article was originally published on Business Insider. Copyright 2017.

The mobile app gold rush may be over Posted Jan 12, 2017 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Media blog Techdirt fights for its life in frivolous lawsuit Ten years ago, Apple announced the iPhone, which soon gave birth to the App Store and the resulting broader app ecosystem. That industry has now matured, having reached critical mass, according to a new report from Flurry out this morning. While there’s still some growth to be seen — app usage is up 11 percent over last year, for example — that growth is slowing. And many app categories are now growing at the expense of others, when before, all were growing in tandem. This indicates that apps have maxed out on the finite resource that is users’ time. That is, drawing attention to a new app will mean having to shift users away from others. This could be a problem for new app businesses — especially those that mean to take on the incumbents like 2016’s most used apps: Facebook, Messenger, Google, Gmail, Instagram, Amazon, Apple Music and others. To generate its analysis, Flurry looks at the apps on its analytics platform. Flurry’s footprint now includes the ability to track more than 940,000 apps across 2.1 billion devices in 3.2 billion sessions, offering deep insight to the state of the app ecosystem today. The firm found that overall app usage is only up a moderate amount — 11 percent year-over-year, compared with 58 percent in the 2015 annual report. However, time spent in apps is soaring, up 69 percent over last year. Some apps are doing better than others, the report indicates. Social networking and messaging applications, not surprisingly, had a great year, with session growth climbing 44 percent over 2015, and time spent in apps up a staggering 394 percent year-over-year. The increases in these categories are due to a number of factors: the ubiquity of smart devices, faster mobile broadband, newer features that allow for voice and video calling, the combination of communication and entertainment that the apps allow for, the addition of live content, the aging of the “I Generation” (who were kids when smartphones arrived and are now teens with their own devices) and more. One factor Flurry didn’t mention, but seems notable, is users’ newer desire for more private socializing and sharing. This feels like a cultural response to an overall decline in user privacy, or at least an awareness of how un-private the web really is. Over the past few years, people have grown to understand how much what takes place on public social networks is watched, analyzed and used to generate big piles of personal data that’s traded and sold to marketers and advertisers. (Not to mention that whole government spying on their citizens thing.) Messaging apps aren’t necessarily any more private and secure than a more public social network — that depends on their use of encryption techniques and security practices — but they feel that way, which has also factored into their growing adoption. But their growth has come at others’ expense. For example, the personalization category lost the most traction, with a 46 percent decline in usage. Flurry attributed this drop to the diminishing value for users of these apps. Games also declined in terms of time spent by 4 percent — a smallish drop, but one that speaks to the ephemeral nature of these applications. Gaming revenue is doing okay, though. Thanks to massive hits like Pokémon GO, the App Store has been breaking records on that front. (Also, note that Super Mario Run arrived too late in the year to impact Flurry’s numbers in the Games category.) Other app categories on the rise in 2016 included Business and Finance, up 43 percent in terms of time spent; Shopping, up 32 percent; and Sports, up 25 percent. Shopping, in particular, benefited from the maturation of the e-commerce industry, which has made strides in terms of enabling easier mobile checkout flows, and has benefited from native mobile payment mechanisms, like Apple Pay, we’d argue. And Flurry notes, too, that Amazon’s prowess can’t be overlooked, as it took 38 percent of holiday sales transactions. Beyond apps, the report also delved into form factor preferences, finding that phablets now account for 41 percent market share by Q4 2016. This correlates with the growth in media consumption and social engagement app categories, Flurry says. Overall, the slowing of growth in app usage points to the end of the app gold rush era and market maturity. It will be harder for new apps to find install bases, which means you’ll see more startups pulling stunts like spamming your contact list to hack their growth, perhaps, more M&A activity in this space and more VC-backed apps closing up shop when the funds run out. The big tech companies behind the app platforms — Apple, Google, Microsoft and the like — will be looking to find the next developer platform, as the mobile app ecosystem matures. In the running are apps for wearables, connected TVs and media players and bots. But the most promising next frontier appears to be voice computing — which means 2017 may be Amazon’s turn to play in the “app” ecosystem, thanks to its Alexa assistant and its many add-ons. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Flurry Founded 2005 Overview Flurry is an application that provides analytics for businesses to monitor the trends and habits of mobile users across multiple mobile applications.

In a bid to differentiate itself from Spotify Ltd., which has about twice as many subscribers, Apple has been speaking with makers of original programming about buying rights to scripted shows and potentially movies, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The discussions were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal, which said Apple had spoken with marketing executives at movie studios and television networks about joining the Cupertino, California-based company to help promote the new material. Apple’s initial plan is to produce a small number of high-quality shows, the person said. That’s a different approach than the one used by Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., which have spent heavily to create a wide-ranging library of original shows, documentaries and movies. Apple’s effort would expand on what it already has under way, including a series based on the life of rapper Dr. Dre, a competition show about makers of apps, and a spin off of “Carpool Karaoke” with talk-show host James Corden. Apple’s foray into TV programming has had many fits and starts, ranging from making its own TV sets to trying to offer a cable-like package of channels. After years of on-and-off talks with producers, studios and agents, it began investing in original programming over the past 18 months. This is a strategy shift for Apple, which previously preferred to be a platform for other companies to release content rather than become a media company itself. But as Netflix and Amazon have built loyal subscriber bases with an expanding catalog of shows such as “The Crown” and “Transparent,” Apple has followed.

The two companies offer nearly identical catalogs at the same price. In a bid to stand out, Apple plans to steadily increase the amount of video content available through the service, the person said. Spotify said in May it would make 12 original series, expanding the video offerings on the service. As the world’s most valuable company, Apple has unmatched resources if it wants to outbid competitors for shows it thinks will boost the service. Its arrival surely will be welcomed by makers of TV shows in Hollywood who have already been enjoying a lucrative boom from the influx of new digital services bidding for their creations.

It adds the first touchscreen that any Mac has had, updates to new(er) Intel processors and AMD graphics, and makes a swathe of behind-the-scenes usability changes. It's the sum total of those small changes, though — not the new processing power or the not-exactly-amazing battery life — that make the new MacBook Pro a worthwhile purchase if you're considering one. What Is It? The late-2016-into-2017 Apple MacBook Pro is the first design refresh in four years for the most powerful portable notebook that Apple currently produces. It's thinner and lighter than the now very outdated MacBook Air, aggressively abandons old connection standards in favour of USB Type-C across the board, and upgrades to a brighter and more colourful display and a much, much larger Force Touch trackpad. And, of course, it runs macOS. You're able to buy a MacBook Pro from a starting price of $2199 in Australia for an entry-level 13-inch model, which you can spec up to $2999 for the top 13-inch or as much as $4249 for the best possible 15-inch variant. That $2199 won't get you the new MacBook Pro's most talked-about feature, though; the cheapest Touch Bar-enabled MBP is $2699 in Oz. 13-inch models get a Core i5 CPU and 256GB or 512GB SSD as default, while the 15-inchers have Core i7s; you can spec any machine up to an i7 and larger SSD, though, although the best processors and 2TB SSDs are restricted to 15-inch only. The Touch Bar is an interesting compromise between a touchscreen laptop display — as seen on Apple's direct competitor from Microsoft, the Surface Book — and good ol' fashioned keyboard buttons. It replaces the old row of 12 function keys on the previous MacBook Pro with a fully customisable, touch-sensitive OLED panel with TouchID. It's still an interesting move by Apple not to make the Pro laptop touch-enabled across its entire screen, but that's a move that would require significant work on its macOS operating system as well as on the hardware level. Those USB-C ports are all multipurpose, too — you can use them all for charging, for data, or video, or any other transfer standard that USB-C supports, as long as you have the right cable or a dongle. Apple claims up to 10 hours of battery life from all of the different MacBook Pro 13- and 15-inch models in its regular wireless web browsing tests, but it's worth noting that the new 87-Watt power adapter that connects over USB-C will charge the laptop much faster than its predecessor. I'll go into detail on my varied experiences of the MacBook Pro's off-charger battery life performance later on, but I will say now that when you visit a charger to top up you'll get plenty of battery reserve back very quickly. What's It Good At? The biggest and most important updates to the new MacBook Pro, I think, aren't under the hood: they're on the outside. Most obvious is the noticeable improvement in usability that the new MacBook Pro's keyboard and trackpad bring. It's absolutely true that there's a not-exactly-shallow learning curve to using the Pro's incredibly short-travel keyboard, which it has inherited from the 12-inch retina MacBook, but once you're used to the key positioning, it's a joy to use. I can blast through emails and longer articles — like this review — at a greater speed and with greater accuracy on the MacBook Pro's keyboard than on the Logitech mechanical keyboard that I use on my desktop PC daily. The Touch Bar is an interesting development, and while it definitely feels like a first-generation device — it's not incredibly high resolution, it doesn't have bespoke controls in every app — it's also a very very smart idea. Having a fully customisable panel in front of your fingerprints means keyboard autocomplete and autocorrect is instantly as easy as it is on an iPhone, choosing an emoji from the list that pops up is simple, and apps like Photoshop that have integrated Touch Bar support do it very well. Being able to choose a colour by swiping your finger across the panel is a quantum leap over a keyboard. And the larger trackpad is equally as important. It's massive, and that helps a lot for general navigation around MacOS as well as gestures like pinching and zooming around apps like Maps. The new screen, too, is much brighter, and that's a godsend whenever you're working anywhere that you can't control the lighting within. It's two thirds brighter than the last generation at 500 nits, and that level also means it's one of the brighter easily-portable laptops out there. If you need a notebook that you can work on while you're out in a cafe, while you're sitting outside, while you're travelling on a train or a bus on the way to work in the morning, the MacBook Pro kicks ass. It supports DCI-P3 wide colour and has two thirds more contrast than the last generation, but what you need to know is that it just looks good. Being smaller and thinner and lighter means that the MacBook Pro — and remember this is a Pro, with a full-fat Intel processor and fast storage and discrete graphics on the 15-inch model, not the lightweight Core M of the 12-inch MacBook — is actually portable. It's the first iteration of the MacBook Pro that I'd actually carry to work and back with me every day, in the same way that I've been doing currently with the Surface Pro 4. You don't make the usual sacrifices of thin and light laptops, either — for example, the MacBook Pro has speakers that don't sound terrible. What's It Not Good At? Over the past couple of weeks of road-testing, the battery life of the MacBook Pro has been... mediocre. Not abysmal, but just not particularly impressive. It's understandable, though: the new MacBook Pro has more going on than the old one ever did. A lot of that comes from the extra power required by that massively bright 500-nit screen and the Touch Bar and the better backlighting of the redesigned keyboard, as well as the more powerful processor and new discrete graphics. With the screen at high brightness and wireless working away actively, I've seen battery life in the region of five hours, half of Apple's testing. For what it's worth, recharging that battery with the fast USB-C charger happens quickly. Apple's timing for the update of the MacBook Pro means that it uses Intel's sixth-generation Skylake mobile processors, rather than the seventh-generation Kaby Lake chips that are starting to appear in competitor notebooks post-CES. That's a pity, because the new chips are both more powerful and more energy-efficient. That doesn't make the MacBook Pro any less good, but it does mean that there will be competing machines from the likes of Razer and Dell and Lenovo that may have superior battery life or more outright grunt. The switch to Thunderbolt 34 and USB Type-C is a Good Thing, and I won't hear anyone else say otherwise. I'm not blinkered enough to think that it's not going to be a difficult thing, though, for anyone considering an upgrade that still has a legacy device that they need to plug in regularly. Anything with a standard USB connector will need an adapter, any non Thunderbolt 3-compatible monitor will need a converter on its cable. It's possible to upgrade other components of your setup when you buy a new MacBook, but that's just an extra cost to consider. And it's one small price to pay for the relentless march of technology, but have you noticed that the new MacBook Pro doesn't have that beautiful glowing Apple logo on the top of its lid any more? I miss it. Should You Buy It? The new MacBook Pro is, in so many ways, a huge and quantum improvement over its predecessor. It's smaller and thinner and lighter and has a brighter screen and a better keyboard and a bigger trackpad and more powerful processor and you can unlock it with your fingerprint. If you've used a MacBook Pro from the last generation or two generations ago, every one of these improvements should be useful to you in some way. But the road to the future is paved with difficulties and failures along the way. You have the potential to use the new MacBook Pro's batter faster than you could on the older models. The Touch Bar still feels like a work in progress, and you'll probably have to wait for your favourite Mac app to make the best possible use of it in the months and years to come. You'll need new cables or bulky dongles, for now at least, to use those Thunderbolt 3 ports. It's worth it, but it's not an entirely painless upgrade. This story originally appeared on Gizmodo Comments NegativeZero @negativezero Jan 13, 2017, 6:08am They're very nicely engineered laptops but are still ridiculously expensive for the hardware that's in them, and with more and more companies making well-engineered laptops in the same style that have vastly better hardware for the price, it's really hard to justify unless you're really enamored with OSX. Reply 1 luffy_luck @luffy_luck Jan 13, 2017, 9:12am I agree. The MPB are nice, but I don't have 3k laying around for this hardware. For this price I can buy a decent laptop and build a good desktop... Reply 0 NegativeZero @negativezero Jan 13, 2017, 10:25am $3599 AU for a model that actually has a discrete GPU in it, though what it has is an anemic Radeon 450. At least you don't have to drop 4 grand to get the GPU now, I guess. Reply 0 LadyVile @ladygrace Jan 13, 2017, 11:13am This is an ad not a review. Reply 0 stevothegodamneddevo Guest Jan 13, 2017, 12:53pm sorry, no! I was a long time OSX apple hardware buyer/user but having spent $3.5K on building my own PC (m.2, 1080gtx, acer predator monitor, ssd, water cooling) I will never go back to buying such outrageously priced hardware from Apple ever again. Yes, i bought a desktop, this is a laptop, but nevertheless, it is outrageous! The new un-cool will be those suckers still buying into this crap. Reply 0 stevothegodamneddevo Guest Jan 13, 2017, 1:01pm forgot to mention... if you are reading this Apple, i'll be purchasing a surface book pro... at ~$1300, that's the price point for a decent laptop for the work I do. Reply 0 rammo123 @rammo123 Jan 14, 2017, 1:35pm for anyone considering an upgrade that still has a legacy device By "legacy device" do you mean 99.99% of all devices currently on sale? I'm a long time Apple fan but they've delved waaaay to deep into dongle hell with this one. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

The macOS Sierra 10.12.3 update is available for download through the Apple Developer Center or through the software update mechanism in the Mac App Store. According to Apple's release notes, the 10.12.3 update "improves the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac." No specific changes, bug fixes, or feature additions were discovered in the first three betas, but we'll update this post should any new features be found in the fourth beta. With bug fixes, it's often hard to determine exactly what's included in an update until Apple supplies detailed release notes with a release. We do, however, know that this update fixes a Safari bug that caused battery life problems during the MacBook Pro testing conducted by Consumer Reports. Available since September, macOS Sierra is the latest Mac operating system. It includes Siri support, Apple Pay for the web, Universal Clipboard, Apple Watch auto unlocking, improved iCloud Drive integration, Picture-in-Picture multitasking, and dozens of smaller features that can be found in our macOS Sierra roundup. Update: The fourth macOS Sierra 10.12.3 beta is also available for public beta testers.

Apple is also considering movies but that’s further down the roadmap and isn’t confirmed. Apple is planning to build a significant new business in original television shows and movies, according to people familiar with the matter […] Executives at Apple have told people in Hollywood they hope to start offering original scripted content by the end of 2017. Unlike other reports, this one says that Apple will be building the TV shows into Apple Music instead of making it a separate subscription. The WSJ suggests that this move will help Apple Music catch up to Spotify’s growing subscriber base. Apple’s plan will reportedly have a small number of high-profile shows. The shows Apple is considering would likely be comparable to critically acclaimed programs like Westworld on Time Warner’s HBO or Stranger Things on Netflix . Today’s report contradicts what Apple SVP Eddy Cue said last year, stating that Apple was ‘not in the business of trying to create TV shows.” Tags: Apple Music, iTunes, tv shows About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

Apple is taking additional steps to expand its music subscription service beyond just offering songs. By Adam Satariano. Added by Agency Staff on 12 January 2017. Saved under World Tags: Amazon, Apple, Apple Music, Netflix, Spotify Tweet Apple is taking additional steps to expand its US$10/month (R60/month in South Africa) music subscription service beyond just offering songs. In a bid to differentiate itself from Spotify, which has about twice as many subscribers, Apple has been speaking with makers of original programming about buying rights to scripted shows and potentially movies, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The discussions were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal, which said Apple had spoken with marketing executives at movie studios and television networks about joining the company to help promote the new material. Apple’s initial plan is to produce a small number of high-quality shows, the person said. That’s a different approach than the one used by Netflix and Amazon.com, which have spent heavily to create a wide-ranging library of original shows, documentaries and movies. Apple’s effort would expand on what it already has under way, including a series based on the life of rapper Dr Dre, a competition show about makers of apps and a spin off of “Carpool Karaoke” with talk show host James Corden. Apple’s foray into TV programming has had many fits and starts, ranging from making its own TV sets to trying to offer a cable-like package of channels. After years of on-and-off talks with producers, studios and agents, it began investing in original programming over the past 18 months. This is a strategy shift for Apple, which previously preferred to be a platform for other companies to release content rather than become a media company itself. But as Netflix and Amazon have built loyal subscriber bases with an expanding catalogue of shows such as The Crown and Transparent, Apple has followed. Apple Music, created in 2015, has 20m subscribers, while Spotify had more than 40m as of September 2016. The two companies offer nearly identical catalogues at the same price. In a bid to stand out, Apple plans to steadily increase the amount of video content available through the service, the person said. Spotify said in May it would make 12 original series, expanding the video offerings on the service. As the world’s most valuable company, Apple has unmatched resources if it wants to outbid competitors for shows it thinks will boost the service. Its arrival surely will be welcomed by makers of TV shows in Hollywood who have already been enjoying a lucrative boom from the influx of new digital services bidding for their creations.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 24Big price hikes at Cell C 12WhatsApp has ‘security backdoor’ 10Cell C blames rand for price hikes 6CSIR, Eskom at odds over renewables 6Backspace: ‘Women in tech’ Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

The tech giant has reportedly talked to 'veteran producers' about producing its own  to take on amazon and Netflix as well as traditional studios. It is believed that Apple will bundle the shows and movies with its music streaming service, Apple Music, and the first shows could hit screens by the end of 2017, according to The Wall Street Journal. Scroll down for video  The Wall Street Journal reported  Apple has talked to 'veteran producers' about the content, which could be available by the end of 2017. It is believed that Apple will bundle the shows and movies with its music streaming service, Apple Music,in a bid to compete with its rival Spotify APPLE'S TV PLANS  People familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal that Apple has plans to create original shows and movies. The firm is apparently in talks with producers, marketers and other networks about the content. Apple is said to create content that is comparable to Netflix's 'Stranger Things' and HBO's 'Westworld'. However, the firm is pitting themselves against Spotify - not Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. Sources say the content will be available to those who pay the $10-a-month subscription for Apple Music. And it is said content will be released to the service by the end of 2017.  The Wall Street Journal reported the big move on Thursday, which it says could be Apple's way of offsetting 'slowing sales of iPhones and iPads'. The firm has already produced several music documentaries, and recently bought the right to James Corden's Carpool Karaoke,  which is being turned into a 16 part series with celebrity hosts. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment.  It is believed that the original content will be available for users who pay a $10-a-month fee to stream music from Apple Music, according to people familiar with the matter. And although Apple Music does offer a handful of documentary-style segments on musicians, users have yet to see the value in the content. Apple seems to now understand that the public wants more than just short stories about musicians and could release content that is comparable to HBO's 'Westworld' or Netflix's 'Stranger Things', sources revealed. Netflix and Amazon Prime may be the two firms to beat in this industry, but The Journal reports Apple isn't looking compete with these streaming giants. Instead, the Cupertino company has its sights set on Spotify. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The rise of 'killer zombie' mice: Switching on rodent's... Does Facebook want to read your THOUGHTS?

Share this article Share 47 shares CARPOOL KARAOKE ON APPLE James Corden announced in January that he will be appearing 'at some point this year' on the show, which has been sold to Apple as a 16 part standalone show.  James Corden presides over his late-night show's 'Carpool Karaoke' segment, but the series spin-off will have a succession of hosts. It'S believed that the content will be available for users who pay a $10-a-month fee to stream music from Apple Music, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm already offers these users access to 'Carpool Karakoke', which it bought last year Celebrity pairs including Alicia Keys and John Legend, Ariana Grande and Seth MacFarlane, and Blake Shelton and Chelsea Handler will be featured on the 16-episode series to be released weekly on Apple Music. A debut date has yet to be announced, but E! has reported that it will be later this year. Corden, who will appear with Will Smith on one episode, said he was proud The Late Late Show has created a segment that works so well it will stand on its own. Apple, which revolutionized music consumption when it launched iTunes in 2001, in 2015 made a concerted push into the booming area of streaming through Apple Music. The company says the service has drawn over 15 million subscribers but it still trails leader Spotify, which said it had 28 million paying subscribers at the end of 2015. If the allegations are true, this move could put Apple in the lead, as it would offer much more content than Spotify. Apple has already signed a deal with CBS Television Studios and Fulwell 73 in July 2016 that turned 'Carpool Karaoke' into a full-blown series. This new series will only available for subscribers to the iPhone maker's music streaming app and E! has reported fans will be able to watch it sometime later this year. And just a few days before announcing the purchase of 'Carpool Karaoke', the firm revealed details of an original TV series called 'Planet of the Apps'. Apple could release content that is comparable to HBO's 'Westworld' (pictured) or Netflix's 'Stranger Things', sources revealed. But the idea is to compete with its rival Spotify TIMELINE: TEN YEARS OF IPHONES  2007: After being unveiled in January, the first iPhone goes on sale amid passionate Apple fan reaction and queues outside retail stores. 2008: On July 11 2008 the second generation iPhone 3G launches, including in a white colour option for the first time. 2009: The iPhone 3GS goes on sale in June, and sales for the year reach more than 25 million. 2010: The introduction of the iPhone 4 includes the first major redesign of the iPhone. The front and back casing are both made of glass for the first time, with a steel trim and edges. 2011: The iPhone 4s is introduced, including voice assistant Siri for the first time. 2012: The iPhone 5 ushers in another redesign, this time increasing the screen size to four inches for the first time. 2013: Another 's' model, this time the iPhone 5s, is launched. The first iPhone to include a fingerprint scanner integrated into the home button, known as Touch ID. 2014: In September the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are unveiled, offering the iPhone in two sizes for the first time – both of which have increased screen sizes on previous generations at 4.7 and 5.5 inches respectively. 2015: In September the 6s and 6s Plus are released, complete with a new pressure sensitive screen. 2016: In September the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are announced, with the Plus housing a dual rear camera for the first time that is designed to capture images to rival that of a digital camera.  The show is being co-produced with Propagate, a newly launched production company co-owned by Ben Silverman, best known for The Biggest Loser, and Howard T. Owens of MasterChef Junior fame. Will.i.am will also be involved, and contestant will compete for funding of up to $10m. The casting call in July was looking for app creators who have a vision to 'shape the future, solve real problems, and inspire change within our daily lives.' The firm is apparently in talks with producers, marketers and other networks about the content. Apple has tested the waters with original content and is still working on release its 'Planet of the Apps' 'Over 2 million apps are available on the App Store, with new apps published every day,' said Silverman and Owens, Co-CEOs of Propagate. 'Planet of the Apps will give app creators the chance to break through and share their ideas with the world. 'This is an exciting format that taps into what is driving culture today. Developers who make it to the final round of the show will also meet with venture capitalists who will be investing up to $10 million, though Apple says developers are not required to take the money or give up any equity in their apps. Apps featured in the show will also receive prime placement in the App Store.    Read more: Apple Sets Its Sights on Hollywood With Plans for Original Content - WSJ Share or comment on this article e-mail 47 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is it really worth paying £280 for the Switch? MailOnline gives its verdict on Nintendo's latest console While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. A familiar old friend that could be the perfect starter phone: Dailymail.com's verdict on the iPhone SE The new iPhone SE has a 4inch screen and familiar design - but has had a huge upgrade on the inside, making this a perfect first time iPhone. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

The Cupertino, California-base tech giant plans to offer original television shows and movies as bundle with its $10-a-month Apple Music subscription service, according to the Wall Street Journal. The report says that the company has been in talks with Hollywood producers about buying rights to scripted television programs.

But not everything Apple’s visionary leader imagined about the iPhone actually made it into the final product — and that’s really a very good thing, because the iPhone that we know and love may have had an entirely different look and software experience. After a couple of videos leaks showed us alleged prototypes of the original iPhone, running competing UI designs, former iPod guru Tony Fadell, who actually worked on the first iPhone while at Apple, revealed some of the things that happened during development. That includes some of peculiar requests Jobs had for the engineering teams that were working on the product. Don't Miss: Apple’s ‘boring’ iPhone 7 just stole a ton of market share from Android After Sonny Dickson had released a couple of videos showing an original iPhone design based on the iPhone, Fadell reached out to The Verge to comment on the clips. The former Apple exec said that everyone involved with the iPhone project worked together and that there were not two competing designs, as Dickson had reported. “It was a competing set of ideas, not teams, and we were all working on it,” he said. Fadell also revealed that, while the user interfaces in the video seem to be accurate, they never ran on iPhone prototypes. Instead, they were running on Macs without access to the hardware. It’s unclear who ported the UIs to the iPhones in the video, Fadell said. “Someone, somewhere ported that thing, and that’s why it’s shown side by side,” he said. “It was never, we never had anything like that at Apple when we were making decisions.” He also revealed some of the things Jobs wanted for the iPhone that could have changed the phone forever. nokia-3650More “A lot of us saw very early on that you couldn’t make the click wheel work for dialing a phone really quickly,” the exec recalled. “So we’d say, ‘Steve, we don’t want to spend time on this.’ And Steve would go, ‘No, I want you to do it. Go and do it. You have to try it. Try.’” The problem with the iPod phone design is that you could do almost anything with the click wheel on it, except for quickly dialing a phone number. That device had a physical click wheel, not a digital one like the one in the video. The UI from the video was actually intended for an iPod that would feature a bigger screen in the same compact body. “We tried everything,” Fadell said about the project. “We tried having little buttons on the click wheel so you could click. There was a Nokia phone where they had a circular pattern for the numbers, in hard buttons, and Steve was like ‘Go make that work.’ So we tried that.” At Jobs’s request, the engineers tried to come up with an iPod phone that would have resembled the Nokia phone in the image above, and they worked on it for about 10 weeks before giving up. Jobs was equally adamant on the iPhone having a virtual keyboard — which was a great idea — even though not everybody working on the project was convinced of its utility. “No, we’re going to make this keyboard work, on the glass,” Jobs would tell them. Fadell also revealed that Jobs wanted to make the switch from ARM chips to Intel after the iPhone became a success. Thankfully, that never happened, and Apple ended up creating a series of class-leading ARM chips that currently have no equal in the mobile business. On top of what Fadell revealed in the interview, it’s well documented that Jobs opposed the idea of developers creating apps for the iPhone. He was finally convinced that Apple should open iOS to third-party apps, which proved to be a great decision for Apple, for developers, and for users.

(Bill Pugliano/Getty Images) BY Amanda Silvestri NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday, January 12, 2017, 11:38 AM Between this week’s North American International Auto Show and Volkswagen’s massive settlement, it’s been a busy week in the world of automotive news. Tesla appears to be heading in the right direction with its Autopilot software after tapping an Apple software head to run the semi-autonomous program. Plus, Jeep has finally confirmed some highly-anticipated upcoming models. FOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. 'LIKE' US HERE. More on all that in a moment, but first, let’s mosey on over to Volkswagen, which just agreed to a plea deal and a massive settlement while several of its top employees were indicted on conspiracy charges. The weekend is right around the corner! This is the Thursday edition of the Daily Drive-Thru. Volkswagen pleads guilty to three charges, agrees to $4.3 billion settlement Attorney General Loretta Lynch announces a settlement with Volkswagen in their emissions controversy at the Justice Department on Jan. 11, 2017 in Washington, DC. Volkswagen will pay a penalty of $4.3 billion dollars. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images) Taking a step toward righting its wrongs in one of the biggest scandals in automotive history, Volkswagen entered a guilty plea to three charges yesterday related to emissions-cheating software installed in its diesel engines. Volkswagen, in its plea deal, agreed to pay $4.3 billion in penalties. This adds to its $14.7 billion settlement approved in October in which a U.S. District Court judge required VW to fix or buy back 480,000 2.0-liter TDI diesel engines. The German automaker is still waiting on a $1 billion deal to settle a separate suit over its 3.0-liter diesels. A federal grand jury in Michigan indicted six Volkswagen employees on conspiracy charges that include violating the Clean Air Act and defrauding U.S. customers. Among the men charged are Heinz-Jakob Neusser, the head of engine research and development who was suspended by VW in 2015, and Richard Dorenkamp, who led the engineering team in charge of developing the company’s first-generation diesel engine from 2006 to 2013.

(Getty Images) Honda recalled an additional 772,000 cars to have their Takata airbag inflators replaced. This brings the total number of Honda and Acura models recalled to 1.29 million. This recall does not involve any new models or model years. The latest list of names includes the 2005-2006 Acura MDX; 2005-2011 CR-V and Element; 2005-2012 Pilot and Acura RL; 2006-2011 Civic; 2006-2012 Ridgeline; 2007-2012 Fit; 2008-2012 Accord; 2009-2012 Acura TSX; 2010-2012 Crosstour, Insight and Acura ZDX; 2011-2012 Acura TSX Wagon; and the 2012 FCX Clarity. Honda has already stated it no longer installs the faulty Takata airbag inflators in its Honda and Acura cars, though some automakers are still installing them unbeknownst to the customer.

(Bloomberg via Getty Images) Tesla Motors announced earlier this week in a blog post that it has hired a key Apple software engineer to oversee development of the Autopilot semi-autonomous software system. Chris Lattner announced on Tuesday that he would leave Apple later this month to join the Silicon Valley-based automaker. Lattner, who had worked at Apple for over a decade, will be the vice president of Autopilot software. This is a big win for the automaker start-up, as Tesla did not previously have a full-time head of software development. The move comes after Tesla’s Autopilot “Hardware 2” update and criticism faced in the wake of crashes and a fatality related to the semi-autonomous software.

Baldauf/SB-Medien) It looks like the 2018 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1’s debut will be pushed back. General Motors had originally planned on the much-anticipated ‘Vette to debut at the North American International Auto Show this week, but the sports car was noticeably absent at the Detroit show. After spy photos were uncovered at GM’s winter test site in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, GM confidants told Car and Driver that the 750-horsepower ZR1 will instead debut at the Continental Tire Road Race Showcase event at Road America in August. The 2018 ZR1 is promised to be the fastest Corvette in ever, eclipsing 200 mph and zipping from 0-60 in less than 3 seconds. Source: Car and Driver, Car and Driver Jeep Wagoneer, Grand Wagoneer confirmed for production FCA confirmed that it will begin production of the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer at its Warren Truck Assembly Plant. (SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) Fiat Chrysler confirmed this week that the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer will begin production at Warren Truck Assembly plant in Warren, Michigan. The plant currently produces the Ram 1500, so it is safe to speculate that the two new models may be based on the Ram 1500 platform. Jeep will also be building a pickup truck based on the Wrangler at the Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio, which currently builds the Wrangler. This brings the total investment by FCA to $1 billion in factory upgrades to accommodate the new models. It was originally speculated that the Wagoneers had been delayed, but the new timeframe puts it and the Grand Wagoneer on the road for the 2021 model year.

The days of having to do this may be numbered. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | January 12, 2017 -- 17:35 GMT (09:35 PST) | Topic: iPhone Wireless charging is something iPhone fans have been requesting for several years. Finally, Apple is making changes to the design of the iPhone that will make this possible. Must read: iPhone: What will the next 10 years bring? What's Hot on ZDNet Microsoft rolls out second Windows 10 Creators Update test build in a week House bill aims to block tech giants from building "Muslim registry" With the rise of global instability, can ceramic storage save our digital culture? CES 2017 recap video: Big trends, top products, and wackiest tech The problem with the iPhone is that the current design isn't suited to wireless charging. Apple makes use of a metal rear cover, and metal and wireless charging just don't go well together (although there are budding technologies that allow wireless charging through metal, none are yet ready for prime time). In order to add wireless charging to a smartphone or tablet, the back of the device needs to be plastic, ceramic, or glass. Well, it just so happens that the current crop of iPhone rumors all point to Apple making a switch from aluminum to glass for the rear panel with the iPhone 8 (or whatever it ends up being called). The glass is likely to be no ordinary sheet of glass, but something similar to Corning's Gorilla Glass, which will bring the robustness required for daily use. At the same time, it is claimed that Apple will ditch the aluminum alloy frame for one made from forged stainless steel. Forged stainless steel would be cheaper to manufacture than the CNC milling techniques currently used. Does this sound familiar? It should, because it's similar to the setup that Apple used for the iPhone 4 (the iPhone 4S made use of an aluminum frame), although the iPhone 8 is likely to be much thinner and less bulky than the iPhone 4 and 4S. Other rumors point to Apple making the switch to OLED displays (possibly only on the higher-priced handsets), and a Home button built directly into the display.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Apple has come around to the idea of buying scripted TV series from outside producers and is thought to be looking for something that could become comparable in popularity to Westworld or Stranger Things. The TV series would reportedly be bundled with Apple Music, Apple’s $9.99 per month subscription service, as a way to help it stand out from Spotify. Spotify by and large offers the same library of music as Apple Music, and it’s generally thought to have a better interface and recommendations.

It’s a phrase that has been much in vogue in recent years, thanks to FX CEO John Landgraf’s assertion that we’ve got more original content than we can possibly handle. Of course, Landgraf also thought the amount of original programming (currently lingering in the neighborhood of 454 scripted series, according to FX) on TV and streaming services would begin to decline in 2017, proving that even a sage TV prognosticator can be hilariously optimistic. Instead, the number seems to be on the rise, leading to an overabundance of options and numerous nights in which A.V. Club TV editor Erik Adams finds himself staring into the bottom of a bottle, wondering where it will all end. But lo, the unceasing march continues, and today comes word that the outlets offering original programming to the masses have a 900-lb. piece of fruit scudding into their midst like a late-to-the-party Edible Arrangements that’s already overripe and molding. The Wall Street Journal reports Apple is planning to enter the business of creating new TV series and films, thereby following one of the last pearls of wisdom Steve Jobs offered on his deathbed: “Find a market that’s already absolutely oversaturated with options,” he doubtless whispered to several Apple execs who had pushed his family members out of the way to scribble down the man’s last oracular nuggets. “Find it, and then sink millions into telling people we’ll give them a few more offerings to join the others they don’t have time for.” The execs must have taken such advice as law, because the company is hoping to begin offering original programming on its $10-a-month Apple Music service by the end of 2017. Apple has been talking to “veteran producers” in recent months about acquiring the rights to scripted television programs, as well as discussing original films, though the latter option is still in the early stages, almost as though a company that has no experience in a new field isn’t going to just launch everything at once and hope for the best, a General Sherman throwing troops at the battle for streaming content and heedless to the losses. Still, it wants to get going on this plan—the Journal says it plans to create shows that would “likely be comparable to critically acclaimed programs like Westworld on Time Warner Inc.’s HBO or Stranger Things on Netflix. Which, of course Apple would like to compare its still-nonexistent series to things that are very popular, much the same way Hulu probably said Chance would be comparable to House. Apple enters the original programming battle. (Photo illustration: Nick Wanserski) The company’s new foray into offering you more of what you already have too much of (sadly, we’re not talking about alcohol) isn’t really a challenge to Netflix or Amazon—not yet, anyway. (Cut to: Netflix, strapping on brass knuckles and a submachine gun, muttering, “You come at the king, you best not miss.”) Apple’s real target here is Spotify, Apple Music’s prime competitor, which is a polite way of saying “streaming service that’s kicking the shit out of Apple Music with more than double its customer base.” By offering original programming, Apple Music hopes to entice new subscribers by setting itself apart from the music-based service. It’s already bought the rights to a half-hour version of James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” segments it plans to stream as a 16-episode series, and the company is similarly developing a loosely biographical series about Dr. Dre, rapper and entrepreneur, a show that will undoubtedly climax with a moving scene in which Dre signs the paperwork making him an Apple Music executive. One of the ways Apple hopes to entice talented producers into the fold is by promising to share audience data. Netflix has famously refused to release information about how many people are watching its shows or any demographic info about those audiences, which is both a great way to build mystique and also hide the fact that the only person in America currently watching Marco Polo is a stoned Dartmouth sophomore who mistook it for The Crown. By delivering demographic data, Apple could provide the traditional media relationship many in Hollywood are looking for from streaming partners, and maybe help smooth over the hurt feelings from those who just hated Songs Of Innocence so, so much. And with that, the already tsunami-like onslaught of original programming builds to a world-destroying pitch, a wave of scripted series that will surely drown unwitting viewers caught in its inescapable path. “But surely, this is more like an abundance of riches, no?” says the naive young TV fan. “Go fuck yourself,” replies Amazon, Hulu, Starz, HBO Now, Showtime, Crackle, Seeso, Acorn TV, Shudder, Playstation Vue, YouTube, and the poor, maligned CW Seed.

Remember earlier this month when Apple announced plans to produce 16 episodes of Carpool Karaoke, the hit sketch on The Late Late Show with James Corden, for this spring (Corden won't appear in them all). And how back in July Apple said it would create its first reality show Planet of the Apps, executive produced by entertainer will.i.am. Rumors also had a six-episode series in production by Dr. Dre at Apple prior to that. These moves, as many have expected, appear to be all part of a bigger plan, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal Thursday. Apple has been in talks with Hollywood producers about buying rights to scripted TV shows, the Journal says, citing people familiar with the matter. The iPhone maker also has talked with studio and network marketing executives about hiring them to promote Apple's upcoming original content, the persons told the Journal. Subscribers to Apple Music would get the content, an addition that if desirable enough could boost Apple's fortunes against Spotify, as well as Netflix and Amazon's video streaming service. Apple's $10 monthly music service has about 20 million paid subscribers, compared to Spotify's 40 million. Apple declined comment on the report.

File Photo/Rocky View Publishing If you missed spending New Years Eve in New York City, youll have a second chance to enjoy that experience Feb. 25 when the Boys and Girls Club of Airdrie (BGCA) holds its annual Dine for a Difference Gala at Apple Creek Golf Course. Its a great event and a lot of fun. Were going to count down with everybody. Were going to have live entertainment. We have a photo booth. We have our silent auction. We have our live auction, said BGCA manager of Events and Volunteer Co-ordination Jessica Nash. Nash said she hoped this years theme of New Years in New York would lead to an event that is bigger and better than last year. Its one of those events that a lot of people in the community look forward to each year and I think this year is going to be bigger and better than the last. The annual gala is the BGCAs major fundraising initiative each year. Last years event raised approximately $20,000 for the organization, which provides services and programs for Airdries children and youth. The money goes back into programming for youth programs, kids programs. We also put aside money for kids to go to camp, Nash said. We spread (the funds) across all of our needs for our organization. We were a little concerned about the (current) economy but weve seen an outpouring of support from people who are donating silent auction items, live auction items. It doesnt even seem like the economy is affecting (the gala). Nash said sponsors of the event in the past have stepped up to sponsor the gala again this year. Apple Creek Golf Course has donated use of its space as well. Helping to set the New Years Eve mood Feb. 25 will be local Southern Alberta band The 427s. They kind of play surf rock. Theyre instrumental, non-vocal. If you think of a Quentin Tarentino movie, the opening sequence  thats what kind of music they play, Nash said. To add to the fun, the Pin-ups for a Cause will be helping out. Its a group of individuals based out of Calgary who live the pin-up life  they like the vintage cars and rockabilly fashion and stuff like that. Theyll be helping with the live and silent auction and volunteering all night, Nash said. Tickets are currently on sale at the BGCA Centre at Ron Ebbeson Arena or by calling 403-948-3331.

When artificial intelligence and robots can do most of the work for us, what will we do?More >    By Jon Martindale  Provided by Apple is well aware that a good deal of the money in the tech world is made with content. That’s why it’s looking to get in on the original programming scene that Amazon and Netflix have been having such success with. By the end of 2017, Apple will have its own scripted, original content and there’s even a suggestion it could start making movies in the future. Apple Music fans will be pleased to learn that, as the rumor coming out of the WallStreetJournal’s report (via 9to5Mac) has it, access to these shows will be bundled into existing subscriptions. This would be another parallel of Amazon’s strategy of including much of its original programming and other content as part of its Prime service, which also offers free postage, music, and Ebooks. Even as it adopts this proven strategy in terms of subscription systems, purportedly Apple wants to bolster its Music service in order to compete more directly with Spotify. The latest numbers suggest that Apple Music is currently used by around 20 million people, which while impressive, isn’t a patch on Spotify’s 40 million-plus user base. More: Spotify vs. Apple Music: Which service is the streaming king? This wasn’t necessarily Apple’s original plan with its first-party programming, though. The initial plan was to team up with existing networks to showcase content or to stream it through Apple’s own services, but no deal could be struck, so now Apple is looking to go it alone. We don’t know what kind of content Apple may end up producing, but it has previously shown an interest in programming that compliments its Apple Music service. Documentaries like 808, which looked at the cultural impact of the eponymous drum machine, proved reasonably popular. It is currently said to be working on a competitive app-based reality show, called Planet of the Apps.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Is Apple past its prime? I’ve argued Apple’s lost, having its lunch eaten by Microsoft and more, but I’m not quite sure the “age of Apple” is over just yet. Speaking with The New York Times, recently, billionaire investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel argued the opposite, remarking that the age of Apple is indeed over. In a simple “confirm or deny” format, The New York Times’ Maureen Dowd phrased it as such: “The Age of Apple is over.” Thiel replied: “Confirm. We know what a smartphone looks like and does. It’s not the fault of Tim Cook, but it’s not an area where there will be any more innovation.” A different sort of mobile innovation I think smartphones, even interest in new ones, is certainly a slowing category among tech trends. Things like autonomous vehicles and AI seem to be the new hotspots, and the latter will no doubt play a role in improving smartphones. I’m not sure I agree that innovation is dead, though, especially as we start to rely on our smartphones more and more for payments, entertainment, home automation and other uses. On the other hand, one might also argue we won’t see the huge sorts of innovations we saw with things like the introduction of the multitouch display, which the iPhone employed to help flip the entire smartphone market on its head. In any case, Thiel has a lot of opinions on a variety of topics and even reasons why he thinks Star Wars is better than Star Trek. I agree, but for different reasons.

According to sources familiar with Apple’s plans, the company is currently warming up to the idea of buying up TV shows and then bringing them to life, similarly to how Netflix produces its own original content. The source in this case was speaking with The Wall Street Journal, claiming that future TV shows could be bundled with the current  Apple Music subscription, though at that point it may not make sense to simply call it Apple Music anymore. According to the report, Apple is looking to push its first series out by the end of the year but from the sounds of it, Apple’s plans are still very much in the air, so while the company may well get involved in the world of TV, there doesn’t appear to be a concrete strategy in place, so none of this may come to fruition. KitGuru Says: There has been plenty of talk about Apple getting involved in the TV world over the last year or two but I do doubt that the company would begin bundling TV shows with Apple Music without rebranding. Aside from that, Apple’s other efforts so far have ended up not panning out, so I would be surprised if this gained much traction.  Similar Posts Categories Tags Related Related Tags: ApplenewsTV Categorized Under: Apple Lucas While I applaud the developments in tv/film entertainment, whereby you can pay a small monthly amount to get access to a whole of of content incl. a few great original series, there clearly are downsides. With console gaming the problem always used to be: which exclusives do you want. If you liked the first party games of more than one label, you’d have to buy two consoles. Soon the same problem will strike with series; you’ll need HBO, Netflix, Apple, YouTube Red, Hulu, and maybe others. TV suddenly, thanks to advertising, is a lot cheaper. Maybe these channels could simply give two options for watching the stuff: unlimited and without advertising for a small subscription fee, or limited (resolution, number of times you can watch shows, etc.) with ads for free.

Here we walk through the many ways of making it happen. ____________________________ Guest post by Glenn Fleishman from Cash Music's Watt Here’s the best case scenario for every artist: someone finds your music and falls in love with it, and they decide to support your project in some way. They want to buy some tracks or a full album. Or if they catch your live show, grab a t-shirt or other merch after your set. The worst thing that you could do in this situation? Making it hard for them to pay you. The good news is that new ways to pay for physical or digital goods are popping up seemingly every day. And with them, many more options for the types of payments you can accept. The support of your fans is now a tap, swipe, or click away. If you’ve never attempted to set up anything online or at your merch table outside of making sure you have enough change on hand to break a $20 bill, this article is here to help gently guide you into the process. Accepting payment via the web PayPal is, at this point, the default for most folks looking to accept payments online. Most often that comes from personal accounts where people can log in and pay using a PayPal balance or using stored credit card or bank information. For folks without an account, they can simply enter in their credit card information Another great option is Stripe, but customers don’t have to set up a Stripe account like they do with PayPal. Stripe plugs into websites and apps, providing back-end credit card processing that is invisible to consumers except at the time they buy something from you online. With Stripe, people have to enter their credit-card information the first time they use it, but they can opt to link their payment information to a mobile phone and reuse it later at any site that relies on Stripe. While PayPal and Stripe charge almost the same fees to accept payments, PayPal is often seen as more impersonal and sometimes hostile to merchants, freezing payments when a lot of money is collected at once—such as with an album release or a big event. Stripe has better and friendlier policies and customer support, and should be easier to work out the kinds of issues you’d face. The good news, though, is that you don’t have to pick between them. The CASH Music platform supports both PayPal and Stripe, and it makes sense for most purposes to accept both so that you don’t miss out on people who use their PayPal account balance to pay for things. If you use Squarespace for Web hosting, you can connect Stripe there, too. On a plain Web site, you can also make a simple PayPal payment button that doesn’t require any programming, but you’ll have to handle sales manually. (There are many other payment processors, and different ecommerce and hosting sites may have relationships with them or let you use Stripe, too.) The advantage with Stripe, however, is that you can also use it with Apple Pay, Apple’s smartphone-based payment system. Apple Pay launched in October 2014, and until October 2016 you could only use it for paying at a store’s point-of-sale terminal or for an in-app purchase on an iPhone (or via an Apple Watch). But in October, Apple extended Apple Pay to work with its Safari browser in the latest operating systems for Mac and iPhone/iPad (macOS 10.12 Sierra and iOS 10). For people who have both Apple Pay set up and use Safari, when they go to pay on a Web site that uses Stripe, an Apple Pay button appears automatically. They can click or tap it, and then their associated iPhone or Watch lights up with information for them to approve. Much, much easier than entering credit card details. Accepting payment by text, app, or person-to-person payment sites Web sites are a great way to take payment directly, but there are other digital options that could be easier for some of your fans, and being set up to take them could result in retaining sales you might have lost from people who don’t want to pay on a Web site or don’t have a credit card or debit card. Pay via Circle, Square Cash, Venmo, and others. Several companies have set up person-to-person payments systems that let you send small to large amounts of cash directly via their app. Many require that you set up a business account, in which every transaction has a fee that’s about the same as a credit-card payment. But these systems let people draw funds from a bank account or debit card at no cost and can be an alternative for many to credit cards. (See my in-depth article.) Pay via P2P Web site. All of the sites above also let you use a Web site on a mobile or desktop browser to handle the transaction.You don’t have to have an app. Pay via Apple’s iMessage. If you’ve got an iPhone or iPad running the latest operating system release, someone else with the same setup can “text” you money as an iMessage through Circle, PayPal, Square Cash, and Venmo. Accepting payment in person I’m probably preaching to the choir here about accepting in-person payments, because anyone who performs in public and sells stuff themselves has already figured this out. But you might not be up to date with the latest. Many artists I know long ago got a Square Reader, a dongle that plugs into an Apple or Android phone or tablet, and lets you swipe a credit card. PayPal makes a rather ugly versions of the same, offering up its Mobile Card Reader. The trick is that while the Square reader is free, PayPal charges $14.99 for its swiper (though you may find a better deal via retailers like Office Depot). However, the latest and greatest Square scanner handles contactless payments from mobile devices, from an iPhone or Android phone, and accepts chip cards. The specialized reader for that costs $49 and also works with Apple and Android devices. Its full name is the Square Contactless and Chip Reader. (Check its list for phone and tablet compatibility; it’s much more restricted than the swiper.) The price tag may seem high at $49, but people increasingly want to pay in a way that makes them feel more secure. The ease of tapping a phone reduces hassle, and both tapping and “dipping” a chip is safer overall, making people more comfortable with the purchase. The scanner has a built-in battery you can recharge through a standard USB cable, and Square also sells a charging dock for it. (You’re also protected against reversed charges or “chargebacks” if customers tap or dip if the card has a chip. If you swipe a chipped card, you’re responsible if there’s a dispute and you can’t prove the transaction involved the real cardholder.) PayPal offers much more complicated Chip Card Reader that also handles contactless payments and card swiping, and has a tiny screen, so the transaction can happen entirely on the device. But it costs a whopping $149 without any real advantage. There’s one last low-tech/high-tech in-person payment method. If you’ve been reluctant to take personal checks, many banks and credit unions offer apps that let you deposit a check via a picture taken by a smartphone’s camera. This option isn’t without issues. Snapping a check on the spot doesn’t verify whether the person has enough money in their account to cover it. Nor does it ensure the check isn’t forged, however unlikely that would be for someone buying your music or merchandise. But it does have two benefits: first, it makes sure the check can be deposited correctly, and there’s nothing that will keep a bank from processing it, including the numbering information at the bottom that identifies the financial instituti on. Second, it clears more quickly: once you snap and deposit, the funds are available within a business day in most cases. What you’ll need Typically to get paid, all you’ll need is a checking account, although a few services also let you withdraw funds via a debit card account or even as a credit to a credit card. But make sure to read the fine print for any service you sign up for, because fees and timing may vary in cashing out the funds collected. P2P services, like Venmo, tend to accumulate cash in an account, and have limits on how much and how frequently you can transfer funds out. But services will increase limits of all sorts if you provide them more information, such as your social security number’s last four digits and your date of birth, which further verifies your identity. PayPal and Stripe don’t have a limit on how much you can accept, but do impose delays on withdrawals under certain circumstances, and may require you provide more documentation on your transactions if you’re charging hundreds of dollars a week and then suddenly bump up to thousands at once. What this will cost you The fees for transactions reflect a combination of the risk that a payment processor and credit network thinks it’s exposed to, the cost of overhead for handling moving money around, and a profit margin that’s impossible to know. But because there’s so much competition for small businesses (like yours!), fees and conditions started low and stayed there. That’s great news. For most transactions, you pay about 3%, with an additional 30¢ if the transaction is not done in person. And that’s about it. There are no recurring fees and no rentals required, although as I explain above, you might have to pay for certain kinds of adapters or peripherals to accept cards and mobile payments. So for an online $5 charge, you pay 45¢ of it: 3% of $5 is 15¢; add the 30¢ flat fee for a net of $4.55. This is rougher on small transactions, like someone buying a 99¢ track: you wind up paying about 33¢ (3¢ as a percentage plus the 30¢ flat fee) and keeping just 66¢. For in-person charges where someone hands you a card, dips a chipped card into a slot, or taps to pay, the percentage is slightly better for you: 2.7 or 2.75% and there’s no flat fee added. For a $5 charge, you pay just 14¢, netting $4.86. You can also take phone orders and tap in a card with some of these systems designed for in-person use, but you pay a higher rate, because there’s more risk: it’s usually 3.5% plus 15¢. For now, there’s no lower fee for dipped and tapped transactions, but that may change in the future. Friction free The fewer steps and the less typing and tapping, the more likely someone is to make a purchase or complete one in person. Take advantage of everything that’s out there so you’re not leaving fans who want your work and want to support you, but need more options through which to hand over the dough.

Prior to this, and since variable pricing was introduced close to 2009, the labels, not the artists, would tell Apple at which price tier they preferred to sell recorded product – either at 69¢, 99¢, or $1.29. Prior to 2009, all downloads at iTunes sold for 99¢, a policy that Apple chief Steve Jobs enforced to drive purchases of the iPod. Variable pricing maximized label revenue because iTunes was the port of call for most purchases and megastar releases could be priced higher than lower selling recordings. A price elasticity of demand analysis shows that moving a song to the higher price tier of $1.29 would work for the labels, earning them more revenue, as long as the purchases of that download, because of the higher price, did not fall below 23%. Conversely, a song discounted to 69¢ from 99¢ would have to increase the number of downloads by over 44% to justify the discount.1 That is why, prior to this policy, there were so few takers of the 69¢ option. Labels, in short, chose to price most of their music at 99¢ or $1.29. Apple’s new policy creates a “Great 69¢ Song” list, where the recording stays, typically, for two weeks. Once a single is taken off the list it returns to its original price. As shown above, in most instances the surge in demand that is required to justify a 69¢ discount is unlikely to materialize, so the reason for Apple granting the discount may not be obvious –- either for the independent artists that exercise this choice or for Apple, which makes approximately 30 cents to the dollar on every download. In the end, whether deliberately intended or not, we argue that what may be at stake is a pay-for play offer for better chart positioning. Charts are effective as indicators of consumer tastes as long as the only differentiating factor between two pieces of recorded music is the music itself. If a song sells at a much lower value than another, it is difficult to say if the chart is indicating a preference for a good song or a bargain. A good example is Shawn Mendes’ single “Treat You Better”, released on June 3rd, 2016. For weeks it languished, reaching No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100. Then it became part of the “Great 69¢ Song” list, which meant it went straight to the iTunes home page for promotion and exposure. The song then peaked at No. 8 on the Hot 100, and, apparently, well justified its discount.2 This, of course, may not be the case with every song, and “Treat You Better” had some traction behind it before the discount. Moreover, promotion in the “Great 69¢ Song” does not come cheap. Billboard itself reports that “the promotion can cost between $2,000-$10,000 a week.”3 Obviously, this is a sum that is not easily tendered by smaller artists, who could in any case lose money with the discount. Therefore, the inference must be that buying into the 69¢ play is a transaction meant to influence the music charts. The 69¢ discount is not new and in its latest iteration reflects the increasing role of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the fortunes of music. Apple, for instance, has decided on selling price points for music for a long time, first objecting to the labels’ request for variable pricing when iTunes was born in 2002, and then agreeing at the end of the decade to three price points for downloads The recording industry has always wished for more flexible pricing, and it is not clear that the three-tier system completely satisfied it. Before iTunes the trappings of the music marketplace were such that megastar releases were sold in every record store and perfect competition at retail prevented hits from selling more expensively. This was contrary to demand theory that suggested that sellers maximized revenue by raising prices in products that had a firm demand. Moreover, deeper catalog that didn’t sell as well took retail space and was sold more expensively in the 1990s than hits, again contradicting a long-standing economic principle that suggested that sellers who sold product with a soft demand should lower prices to maximize earnings. The labels, in short, had little power to control the price of the product they sold in the 1990s even without the ISPs. When Apple took over the distribution of recorded music, the potential for variable pricing became very real again because Apple iTunes became the single point of sale, and record stores were no longer in competition for the ubiquitous hits.4 Therefore, the best pricing system for the industry, in an era that has largely superseded the challenges of free file sharing music, is the most flexible. In fact, it could be argued that the current 69¢ discount really does not add much to the marketplace. It has been tried before, and in its latest version, as was suggested above, seems to discourage independent music makers from applying to Apple. A smaller discount would have been in everyone’s best interest. Further, for many that are preoccupied with the devaluation of music, including top-level artists, this latest policy by Apple appears to do little good. If there is an element of artist discovery and exposure in the new measure, it does not seem to come free and the medium for this new pay-for-play is really not where listeners are flocking.

Credit: Apple More like this Foxconn testing wireless charging for iPhone 8 What Samsung expects from iPhone 8 What to expect from Apple in 2017 Video Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! Apple watchers grew quite excited by pre-Christmas 2016 speculation of a link up between Apple and power-like-Wi-Fi developer, Energous. Wireless everywhere The speculation has been around for years. It’s intoxicating because we all want an iPhone that we don’t need to plug into a wall socket to keep charged. The claimed association with Energous opens up a new vista – the ability to charge a smartphone just by entering a room. The bad news is that this isn’t going to happen, at least, not yet (if ever). Why do I think this? I spoke with David Green, research manager, wireless power and smart utilities, IHS Markit for a chat about the wireless charging industry. He wouldn’t comment on Apple or the Energies speculation specifically, but provided me with some great insights into the industry. These insights suggest we’ll need to wait a little longer, even though wireless charging technologies are... Already here Apple already uses wireless power charging for its Apple Watch, as does Samsung with its high-end smartphone. Eighty percent of consumers have heard of this technology according to IHS Markit. Ninety percent of consumers want it in their next device. The industry is pursuing three different approaches to wireless charging: Charging pads “Typically inductive technology, short range, such as the Qi specification that’s built into Samsung devices.” Charging bowls These through-surface type charges are limited to a few centimeters of range. They include the “AirFuel Resonant specification that’s in this new Dell/WiTricity system.”  (Dell announced the new Latitude 7285 that uses this technology at CES 2017. Solutions based on these technologies will ship this year. Uncoupled Also known as power-like-WiFi, this technology offers low power levels at a longer range, such as the Energous RF system that Apple has been rumored to be looking at. CES 2017 saw this tech used in some relatively low power devices, including a Bluetooth-based key tracker, a medical scanning device and a hearing aid. What about the iPhone? There have been rumors of a partnership between Apple and long-distance wireless charging firm Energous. With this in mind can we expect the next iPhone to support power-like-Wi-Fi? “There’s two ends of a scale instead, charging at the same speed as a wire but on a charging pad, or perhaps trickle charging very slowly but at a larger distance away,” Green said.  He thinks charging across a room is “at least a year away from commercial high-volume reality.” The analyst would not speculate on Apple’s plans, beyond pointing out: “Regarding Apple’s plans, second guessing their exact product specification is a fool’s game,” he said, “but I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re looking at more than one method of wireless charging as part of the overall experience.” The take away is that he doesn’t think we will see devices offering full-speed wireless charging across a room for at least a year, and probably more. Accelerating innovation While Apple watchers may need to be patient before they see this kind of wireless charging in their iPhones and Macs, Green is quite optimistic about what’s happening to wireless charging generally – he expects the industry to double in size this year as new products reach market. “We’ve already seen the first magnetic resonant and laptop system, and by the end of the year we will have the first manufacturer-owned electric vehicle system too,” he said. The ace card for this technology once it does reach market is how much consumers like using it. “Once they’ve experienced wireless charging, they don’t want to go back to wired,” he explained. “The launch of “the world’s first…” in any category is therefore important in pushing the whole market forwards towards the two billion plus receivers per year that could ship in 2025. My take? It seems unlikely to me that we’ll get to use Energous’ charging solutions with larger devices, such as Macs, iPads, or iPhones within at least the next 24-months (but I can see these products shipping with charging pads). From what Green tells me about market readiness of these technologies, it seems possible Energous tech may first appear in support of Apple’s smaller connected solutions, including (but in future not confined to) Apple Watch and AirPods -- but that's a speculation on my part, not his. What I don't expect is to see such tech in an iPhone this year.  Google+?

Andrew Cunningham - Jan 12, 2017 5:50 pm UTC Enlarge / "Apple TV" may be more than the name for a streaming box if its efforts come to fruition. Apple reader comments 136 Share this story Apple is thinking about getting into the scripted TV business, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. Ever-mysterious "people familiar with the matter" tell the Journal the shows would be offered to Apple Music subscribers, and the company is talking to both "veteran producers" and "experienced marketing executives" to create and promote those shows. The shows could be released by the end of this year. The report also says Apple is looking into making movies, but it describes those efforts as "more preliminary." Apple is already dabbling in some unscripted TV, including an app developer competition series called Planet of the Apps and a half-hour version of Carpool Karaoke. Another previously announced project, a scripted "dark semi-autobiographical drama featuring at least one orgy scene," stars Dr. Dre, the rapper and producer whose name just happens to be attached to the Beats headphones Apple sells. The other scripted TV referenced in the WSJ report presumably will not star Apple employees (though I personally would probably watch a buddy cop show where Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi teamed up to solve crimes). Further ReadingYahoo yanks Yahoo Screen hub, scatters “original” content across sites Apple is a big company with many resources, but this would be a step into a crowded market that it has little experience in. Streaming-only companies like Netflix and Amazon, basic cable networks like AMC and FX, hybrid companies like HBO, and traditional broadcast networks are offering a wider range of scripted TV programs than ever before. According to FX's research, there were 455 scripted TV shows across all these providers in 2016, up from 349 in 2013 when pioneering Netflix shows like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black had their premieres. The "Peak TV" phenomenon is driving huge growth in the TV industry, but failed projects like Yahoo Screen show that success in a market already overflowing with options can be hard to come by.

Related 'Carpool Karaoke' Apple Music Series Will Have 16 Different Hosts Including Chelsea Handler & Seth MacFarlane - TCA The publication, citing “people familiar with the matter,” says that Apple wants to offer productions this year to subscribers of its Apple Music on-demand streaming service. It’s talking to “veteran producers” about deals for scripted TV programming, with movie plans “more preliminary.” The goal, it seems, is to help Apple Music distinguish itself from other music streaming services including Spotify, Pandora, and Google Music. But even a modest investment in content could represent “a transformative moment for Hollywood and mark a significant turn in strategy for Apple as it starts to become more of a media company,” the Journal says. Apple has long said that it wants to play a bigger role in media. In October, CEO Tim Cook said that television is “of intense interest to me and other people here.” He added that Apple has “started focusing on some original content” which he called “a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. So it’s an area we’re focused on.” Thus far the company has made small investments in music-related documentaries and rights to produce a half-hour interview show based on the “Carpool Karaoke” segments on CBS’ The Late Late Show with James Corden. Apple shareholders have long wondered whether it would buy a big media company, or invest heavily to build one, as sales growth slows for iPhones, its cash cow. “Most investors see prominent established video services as top candidates” to be acquired by Apple, Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty noted this week. But while “that would make some sense,” she believes “Apple could be looking to launch a differentiated video service instead of acquiring an existing platform.” The danger for Apple is that its investors are accustomed to its nearly 40% profit margin. That would be hard to duplicate if the company enters a highly competitive business with several established powers.

JealousCastingAgent • on Jan 12, 2017 9:30 am Apple is still a fantastic company, but it has failed to generate any new and impactful products for several years. And, with this idea they are just playing catch up. Reply frostie • on Jan 12, 2017 9:59 am I agree- but never count Apple out. When they do something its usually the best way to do it . They certainly have to money to generate product Reply SheLovesMedia • on Jan 12, 2017 6:54 pm Wondering, though, why Apple wouldn’t simply buy a couple of existing studios for instant content, especially considering some animation studios probably use their software???

According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Apple is planning to start producing original TV shows and movies. The content would become an added incentive to subscribers of Apple Music, the company’s $10-per-month streaming music service that launched in 2015. The more than 20 million subscribers to Apple Music would have exclusive access, giving the service a potential selling point that would help it catch up to Spotify, which has double the amount paying members as Apple’s offering. According to the reports, Apple has already been in touch with veteran Hollywood producers and has been looking to purchase the rights to scripted TV programs. The company has also pursued market executives at studios and networks to discuss approaches to promoting the content. The Cupertino company is looking for shows that will reach acclaim like HBO’s Westworld or Netflix’s Stranger Things —though replicating that success is easier said than done. Related Stories Apple Music Reaches 20 Million Subscriber Milestone Drake Debuts ‘Bad Blood’ Apple Commercial However Apple isn’t looking to flood the already crowded market of original content, where it would be competing with Netflix, Amazon and cable networks. It’s instead aiming to pick just a few hand-picked shows or movies at a time. Apple reportedly has told some Hollywood players it hopes to start offering original scripted content by the end of 2017. While the plan would mark the company’s first step into scripted territory, Apple has already started pursuing original content to bolster its Apple Music service. Last year, Apple bought the rights to an extended version of Carpool Karaoke —a popular segment on The Late Late Show with James Corden which regularly gets millions of viewers on YouTube. Apple’s first bit of scripted content will be a semi-autobiographical series about Dr. Dre, the rap legend and current Apple Music executive. The show is set to premiere later this year, and will reportedly feature at least one orgy scene, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

With new data from Gartner and IDC, it shows that Apple is beginning to rise in the PC industry, despite the entire market starting to level off. During the fourth quarter of 2016, worldwide shipments of PCs totaled a 70.2 million, that’s a 1.5% decline year-over-year, but does indicate the market is stabilizing, IDC reports. In 2016 altogether, PC shipments totaled 260 million, down 5.7 percent compared to the year before. Worldwide, Apple saw a rise from 7.4 percent in 2015 to 7.5, but Apple saw a 0.9 percent decline in 2016 overall. Apple ranks fourth in PC manufacturers, with Lenovo, HP, and Dell staying on top. Apple was boosted by the launch of new MacBook Pro models during the fourth quarter. The company moved back into fourth place and stabilized global shipments. Ganter, however, shows a slightly different angle for Apple. The firm says Apple grew from 7 percent in Q4 of 2015 to 7.5 percent in Q4 of 2016. In terms of worldwide shipments, Ganter also shows slightly better numbers increasing by 2.4 percent year-over-year. Their data also shows that Apple is fifth overall, falling behind Lenovo, HP, Dell, and Asus. Source: 9to5Mac Tags: MacBook Pro About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

Firstly, Dediu says the iPhone will sell at least 1.2 billion units within the first ten years, making it the “most successful product of all-time,” outpacing other products such as the iPod, iPad, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. In its first 10 years, the iPhone will have sold at least 1.2 billion units, making it the most successful product of all time. The iPhone also enabled the iOS empire which includes the iPod touch, the iPad, the Apple Watch and Apple TV whose combined total unit sales will reach 1.75 billion units over 10 years. This total is likely to top 2 billion units by the end of 2018. Dediu elaborates that if predictions are true, Apple will hit $980 million in iOS product sales by the middle of the year. But that’s not all, Apple also has its software and services sales, which will bring in another $100 million which will make Apple the first trillion dollar company. Dediu explains Apple’s success and how they got here, noting that Apple’s ecosystem keeps people staying within their platforms, in addition to many iPhone specific features and its reputation for being a premium device. There is a temptation to think that such a business is fragile and will be disrupted. Challengers appear daily and the number of iPhone “killers” is not measurable. One can cite the billion users of Nokia phones which defected. One can cite the loyalty of BlackBerry users that evaporated. One can even cite the juggernaut of Windows and how it became impotent. One can cite the vast number of Android devices offered at low prices. Tags: analyst, iOS, iPhone About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

It Hopes So Can Apple Create The Next 'Westworld' or 'Stranger Things'? It Hopes So By Angela Moscaritolo January 12, 2017 10:41am EST 10 Comments A new report indicates Apple wants to compete with HBO and Netflix by funding original shows of its own. Step aside HBO, Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon. Word has it that Apple is setting its sights on creating the next hit TV show. The Wall Street Journal on Thursday, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, reported that the iPhone maker "is planning to build a significant new business in original television shows and movies." The shows would reportedly be available to Apple Music subscribers. The report notes that Apple's shows "would likely be comparable to critically acclaimed programs like 'Westworld' on … HBO or 'Stranger Things' on Netflix." Apple's plan to compete with the likes of HBO and Netflix reportedly involves buying the rights to scripted TV shows and getting "veteran producers" on board to bring them to life. The company's original content ambitions also extend to feature-length films, "though those plans are more preliminary," the WSJ reported. As for the timing of this all: "Executives at Apple have told people in Hollywood they hope to start offering original scripted content by the end of 2017," the report notes. Related Apple Music vs. Spotify: Which Is Best? Apple Music vs. Spotify: Which Is Best? The Cupertino tech giant has reportedly been talking with producers about its plan, and has also approached "experienced marketing executives at studios and networks" who would be tasked with promoting this new content. At this point, Apple is just dipping its toes into the original content waters. It's not planning to spend billions or even a couple hundred million on the project, the WSJ said. Instead, the company is "looking at just a handful of carefully selected shows, and potentially films" to beef up Apple Music and better compete with Spotify. Meanwhile, if previous rumors are any indication, Apple has been exploring the idea of creating original content for some time.

Based out of Phoenix, Arizona, Cable ONE serves approximately 750,000 customers in 19 U.S. states. With Single Sign-On, users can save their pay-TV access credentials in the Settings app on their iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV so compatible video-streaming apps can automatically unlock paid content. Just two days ago, ESPN and WatchESPN iOS apps gained support for the feature, as well as compatibility with Google’s Chromecast. Single Sign-On can be managed in Settings → TV Provider on iPhone and iPad and in Settings → Accounts → TV Provider on the fourth-generation Apple TV. The feature is fully compatible inside Apple’s new TV app on iOS and tvOS. Unfortunately, most cable subscribers in the United States still cannot use the feature at all because big name providers like Verizon, Comcast and Spectrum have yet to jump on the Single Sign-On bandwagon. Single Sign-On is currently supported in the following apps: ABC (iOS and tvOS) A&E (iOS only) Bravo Now (tvOS only) DirecTV (iOS only) Disney Channel (iOS and tvOS) Disney Junior (iOS and tvOS) Disney XD (iOS and tvOS) E! Now (tvOS only) Freeform (iOS) FXNOW (tvOS) Hallmark Channel Everywhere (iOS and tvOS) History (iOS only) Lifetime (iOS only) NBC (tvOS only) Syfy Now (tvOS only) Telemundo Now (tvOS only) USA NOW (tvOS only) Watch HGTV (iOS and tvOS) Watch Food Network (iOS and tvOS) Watch Cooking Channel (iOS and tvOS) Watch DIY (iOS and tvOS) Watch Travel Channel (iOS and tvOS) These cable providers currently support Single Sign-On: CenturyLink Prism DirecTV Dish GVTC GTA Hawaiian Telcom Hotwire MetroCast Service Electric Sling Single Sing-On is currently unavailable in the United States. The full list of Single Sign-On providers is on Apple’s website.

Launched on December 13, AirPods grabbed an estimated 26 percent share of online revenue in the wireless headphone market, beating out Apple’s premium audio brand Beats which captured an estimated 15.4 percent of the market, down from 24.1 percent between the start of 2015 and December 13. In other words, Apple has managed to capture one-fourth of the wireless headphones market since the launch of AirPods. And if you also count Beats sales, the Cupertino company took almost 40 percent of online revenue in the wireless headphone market. The wireless headphone market has grown steadily over the years, accounting for half of all online headphone sales in 2016. Just ask Beats, which dominated the wireless headphone market for the last several years. Back in December 2015, wireless headphones accounted for half the combined sales of corded and wireless headphones. In just twelve months, that share has risen to as much as 75 percent. In other words, three out of each four dollars spent online on headphones went to makers of wireless headphones in December 2016. The AirPods premiere was the biggest headphones sales day in 2016. “On the December 13, the day of the AirPods release, spending on headphones was ten times greater than the pre-holiday average for 2016,” reads the survey. “It was the largest single day of online headphone spending last year.” A whopping 85 percent of those who’ve purchased AirPods since launch are male. This is similar to the gender breakdown Slice reported for the MacBook Pro release in October. Male AirPods buyers also tend to be younger than their female counterparts. In addition, more than one-third of the males who bought AirPods are millennials. Slice has a panel of over 4.4 million online shoppers who voluntarily give Slice’s software access to their inbox. By extracting detailed information from hundreds of millions of aggregated and anonymized e-receipts, Slice can map the entire purchase graph. The methodology may not be the most accurate, but it still provides an interesting insight into sales performance of AirPods.

It’s not that apple is bad but I prefer higher class zoLa siWisa I also have B&O for the house, I agree more with you. I will try the AirPods, though I am not too sold as for yet. There are many nice brands that have the same technology. When these I have played out.

Image: AP/ By Jason Abbruzzese2017-01-12 17:06:11 UTC Apple is in talks to begin making high-end television shows that could rival the kind of work produced by HBO and Netflix, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. The company has been in talks with studio executives and producers, and hopes to have something to show for its efforts by the end of 2017, according to the report. That's the kind of news that can send shivers down the spines — or dollar signs into the dreams — of the entire entertainment industry. Apple has long been seen as a quiet giant whose entry into the content creation industry would be a game changer. While Apple's main business is in making products and providing distribution for TV and music, the prospect that the company — and its cash pile of $230 billion — could begin making its own content has loomed.  While the Netflixes and HBOs of the world are probably worried about Apple, the WSJ noted that Spotify might be most at risk. Apple is reportedly planning to offer its shows as a part of its music streaming service. Apple is reportedly only looking to finance a few shows — and possibly movies — that will be enough to convince consumers to subscribe to its music service. Technically, Apple is already making a TV show. The company dipped its toe into production with a reality show around app makers.  Original TV shows could be just one part of Apple's foray into television. For years, Apple has been in various stages of talks for its own streaming TV service. Apple reportedly got close in 2015 but could not agree on business terms with TV providers.  Topics: Apple, Business, HBO, Media, netflix, spotify, Television About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Then Hulu and Amazon. Now Apple Inc. wants to be your new favorite binge-watching enabler. The Wall Street Journal reports Apple has plans to build a "significant new business" in streaming original television shows and movies, a decision that could help the tech giant offset a slow in iPhone and iPad sales. The content would be available to users of the company's $10-a-month streaming music service by the end of 2017. Analysts don't see Apple going toe-to-toe with streaming giants Netflix and Amazon anytime soon. Rather, the report says the original content is likely part of an effort to differentiate Apple Music as it struggles to keep up with the larger Spotify. What kind of original content can we expect? The Wall Street Journal reports the company has been in talks with veteran producers and is likely eyeing premium TV programming that would mirror the success of shows such as HBO's "Westworld" or Netflix's "Stranger Things," though original scripted movies remain a possibility.

At least, that’s what it seems like, given the tips that suggest Apple is speaking with content creators aplenty. Instead of attempting to create their own new video service to compete with Netflix or HBO Go directly, Apple has been tipped to be attempting to bring original video content to Apple Music. According to people familiar with the matter speaking with The Wall Street Journal, Apple is “planning to build a significant new business in original television shows and movies.” We must assume that by “television shows” they mean episodic video content, not necessarily TV shows as we’d traditionally think of them – broadcast VIA cable. This content would be internet-only. It’s been suggested by these same sources that Apple has been speaking with “veteran producers” recently about buying rights to “scripted television programs.” It would seem that Apple’s plans center on episodic content more than movies, but that movies could be in the mix in the future. Mentions of “Hollywood” in reports this week are likely meant to invoke the location of production for video content rather than the idea that Apple’s content would be released to movie theaters. It’s likely Apple’s original content will be similar to that of their previous “exclusive” content – like Dr Dre’s Compton album. That is to say, exclusive at first, but eventually released on a larger platform. It wouldn’t be completely out of line to assume Apple’s content would premiere on iOS and Apple TV devices, then eventually, possibly, make its way to media distribution channels of all sorts. What we’ll be interested to see is if programs – like Carpool Karaoke – are able to succeed if released truly exclusively to Apple products. Will Apple eventually open their content stores to devices other than their own? This might be a Nintendo situation with implications all their own!

We round up the rumours about new iMacs, including the theory that new iMacs will feature AMD Radeon Polaris graphics chips and might even be VR-ready. Latest: Tim Cook hints at the future of the Mac desktop, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac by Ashleigh Macro | 12 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will Apple release new iMacs in the UK? Will Apple update its iMac desktop line to add Intel Kaby Lake processor chips, and what other specs, design changes and new features should we expect in the next generation of iMacs? How much will the new iMacs for 2017 cost? Apple last updated its iMac line on 13 October 2015, bringing Retina-class screen resolution to the smaller Macs for the first time and equipping the larger models with new Skylake processor chips. Before that, you had to go back more than two years - if you don't include the cheaper iMac which Apple launched in June 2014 - to the last proper new iMac update, in September 2013, when Apple added Haswell processors, new graphics, next-gen Wi-Fi and faster PCIe flash storage options. (For more information on that update, read our review of the 2013 iMacs.) So much for Apple's iMac updates over the past few years. Right now we're looking ahead to the next iMac launch - what we hope will be an early-2017 iMac update. In this article we round up all the speculation about Apple's next iMac update: when new iMacs will be released in the UK, new iMac prices, tech specs and new features to expect, any leaked photos and videos that appear online, and all the other new iMac rumours that are fit to print. Updated, 22 December 2016, with comments from Apple CEO Tim Cook about the future of the Mac desktop Read next: Where to buy iMacs in the UK | Best Mac buying guide 2017 | Best cheap iMac deals UK New iMac 2017 release date, price & specs rumours: Launch date When will new iMacs come out? Early in 2017, we hope, but we had been confidently expecting an iMac update in late 2016 and that came to nothing. (A contact told us, under condition of anonymity, that the Mac Pro would be updated before the end of November 2016, and we reasoned that it would make sense for Apple to announce at least a minor update to the iMac at the same time. But the year ended with no word on new Mac desktops.) The Best Buy leak discussed in the processor section of this article, which emerged at the start of October 2016, strongly suggests that the retailer has had advance warning of an imminent launch and posted a listing slightly too early by mistake - although it's also possible that this was a speculative listing created on the basis that it would probably be needed at some point. New iMac 2017 release date: Apple CEO hints at future of the iMac In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" Interestingly, it's what Cook didn't mention in his response that suggests what Apple is planning for the future. In response, Cook wrote the following: "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." If you look closely, Cook never used the word "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac, which hasn't been updated in over a year. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important.  A report from Bloomberg might explain why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. This suggests, to us at least, that while Apple is imagining a future where desktops are still being produced, they might not feature the iconic Mac branding. Could Apple be working on a macOS/iOS hybrid to launch as the ultimate desktop experience? With the astonishing number of iOS apps compared to macOS apps, it may be a smart investment for the company, but only time will tell.  New iMac 2017 release date: What does previous launch history tell us? The last iMac update was in October 2015. Apple's yearly cycle is built around three major press events: autumn - usually September (new iPhones and iPads); spring - usually March (new iPhones and iPads, sometimes MacBooks and watches); and summer - usually June (WWDC - operating system updates, and occasional hardware). But that doesn't mean the company stays quiet the rest of the year. Mac updates can be folded into the big three events, but they're often launched at their own smaller launch events. The iMac update in 2015 got its own announcement, a few weeks after the iPhone 6s reveal. But bear in mind that, unlike the yearly or event twice-yearly update events we're used to for iOS devices, desktop Mac refreshes have frequently come several years apart. WWDC 2017 (which will take place in June next year) is therefore a possibility, and we may have to wait even longer than that. New iMac 2017 release date, price & specs rumours: Specs We'll add leaked details about the tech specs of the new iMacs to this section as we hear them. Here's what we know so far. New iMac 2017 specs: Processor Apple skipped Intel's much-delayed Broadwell processors and went straight from Haswell to Skylake for the 2015 update. Skylake uses the same 14nm manufacturing process as Broadwell, but brings even greater CPU and GPU performance, along with reduced power consumption. But what chips will appear in the next set of iMacs? Clearly that will depend on their launch date and the hardware that's available at the time. After 2015's Skylake, the next round of Intel processors, which started going into mass production in late 2016 and is still being rolled out, is Kaby Lake; this will be followed by Cannonlake (Cannonlake was due to be next, but it's been delayed until the second half of 2017). Then Ice Lake in 2018 and Tiger Lake in 2019, for those who enjoy this sort of thing. Kaby Lake uses a 14nm process, same as Broadwell and Skylake, but Cannonlake switches over to a more accurate 10nm process. If Apple does manage an iMac update before the end of 2016 the machines could feature Kaby Lake processors, but remember that Apple skipped Broadwell and delays are common in the chip sector - so we're not banking on anything. Intel started shipping its Kaby Lake processors in July 2016, and the chips offer support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. It's therefore now possible that Apple will squeeze Kaby Lake chips into the next iMac update, but by no means guaranteed, given Apple's past behaviour. Some of the Kaby Lake chips aren't expected to ship until very late 2016 or more likely early 2017, so be prepared for a wait. Read more on MacRumors. Processor models The specific model of Kaby Lake processor we're expecting to appear in the next iMac is the i7-7700. And as luck would have it, Tom's Hardware has got hold of what they understand to be a pre-release sample of that chip. Naturally they promptly overclocked it and put it through rigorous speed tests. Those speed tests found that the i7-7700 (or rather the i7-7700K - the K in the name denoting that the clock multiplier has been unlocked to allow for overclocking) was capable of 4.2GHz under normal circumstances, and 4.8GHz when overclocked. Serious speed which, as BGR observes, would give the new iMac bragging rights over the rival Surface Studio, launched before the relevant Kaby Lake chips became available. Micosoft could always launch an updated Surface Studio with Kaby Lake, of course, although that might hack off the early buyers. Evidence for Kaby Lake Back in October 2016, the US retailer Best Buy leaked a listing for a new iMac, and it had a Kaby Lake chipset - a "7th Gen Intel Core i7 processor". As Technobuffalo points out, this isn't necessarily genuine: an employee could have created this as a placeholder until official information is available. But slip-ups of this kind more often happen because a retailer has been given advance warning of an imminent launch and somebody sets it live too early by mistake. We'd say - based on this and other clues - that a Kaby Lake iMac is looking like a decent bet for launch in the near future. In November 2016, further evidence emerged that sheds light on the prospects of a Kaby Lake iMac. Intel briefly made documents available on its website, intended for PC manufacturer partners rather than consumers, that detail specs of new Kaby Lake processors - and Anandtech spotted and grabbed them. The documents detail 11 new processors, including seven i5 chips and three i7s; 10 of them are designated for desktop use and one is for worktop. There's still no sign of the Kaby Lake laptop processors we expect to use as part of a MacBook Pro update in early 2017. AMD processors We expect Apple to choose Intel-based CPUs, but there's a chance AMD could also make an appearance in certain iMac models. With the new AMD Zen processor, we hope to see the CPU make an appearance in a lot of high-end machines, given its tremendous processing power. The new processor boasts 8 cores and 16 threads - a massive amount of raw processing power. Given the suggested price tag of the Zen CPU, we expect it either to be in the top-spec iMacs or be an upgrade option. The inclusion of other AMD processors is also not far-fetched, as we still see it being an option for cheaper iMac models. New iMac 2017 specs: Graphics chips It's believed that Apple's next generation of iMacs (or its higher-specced models, at least) will feature graphics chips from AMD's Polaris set, which were announced at the start of 2016. WCCF Tech reports that AMD won the contract last October but was only able to get confirmation from additional sources in April 2016. The contract is for two chipsets: Polaris 10 (previously known as Ellesmere) and Polaris 11 (previously known as Baffin), and WCCF Tech says these processors will appear in "new desktops and notebooks from Apple, which the company plans to bring to market later this year". With the MacBook and MacBook Air having recently seen updates, and the Mac mini highly unlikely to incorporate a discrete graphics unit, the remaining candidates are the MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Pro. MacRumors reasons that the power range of these chips makes Polaris 11 a strong fit for the MacBook Pro, while Polaris 10 suits the iMac. The Polaris chips offer improved graphics performance compared with previous generations (as much as twice the speed per watt) and potential reductions in both power consumption and waste heat. They are built using a 16nm or 14nm FinFET production process, compared to 28nm on AMD's earlier chips, which means that the chip maker can fit more transistors in a given space (which makes the chips ideal for ultraportable laptops and ultraslim desktops - the latter fitting recent iMac designs) and, because the transistors are closer together, less power is needed to move a signal across them. Apple's current iMac line-up features AMD Radeon graphics chipsets as standard in the 27-inch models. The 21-inch models come with integrated Intel Iris Pro 6200 graphics. Read next: New Mac Pro rumours | New Mac mini rumours New iMac 2017 specs: Virtual reality Talking about graphics architecture can be a little dry, but the Polaris rumour discussed above has a sexier element to it: VR. AMD has consistently talked up its Polaris graphics chips as a way of bringing VR within the reach of a wider market of PC users. At present Macs are basically unusable for VR, as we discuss in our articles Can you use Oculus Rift with Mac? and How to use a Mac for VR, and Oculus founder Palmer Luckey specifically cited underpowered Mac GPUs as the reason why the company was focusing on Windows: "People have said, 'Why don't you support Macs? So many people have Macs.' It's true. A lot of people have Apple hardware, especially in the laptop space. But the GPUs in those, they're not even close to what we're pushing for our recommended spec." But adding Polaris GPUs to the iMac could change Luckey's mind. AMD's Roy Taylor thinks the company's new GPUs are about to massively expand the available market for VR. "AMD has just completed the shrink to 14nm [with Polaris]," he said. "This means we can produce GPUs that will run the minimum spec of VR at a lower cost, in larger volume, consuming less power and running faster. That means in the second half of this year and going forward, more people will be able to run those headsets." Visit WCCF Tech for more info. VR remains a niche topic in tech - the number of people actually willing to shell out for the whole shebang remains small, even if casual gamers who try the Vive or the Oculus Rift tend to love it - but it gets a lot of press at the moment. And it can't be nice for a company that prides itself on the quality of its products to hear them disparaged as "not even close" to being up to a task. As Jim Lynch on CIO colourfully phrases it, "As far as VR goes, it's not something that I have paid much attention to, but it certainly couldn't hurt for Apple's computers to be able to do it adequately... If VR lights a fire under Apple's rear end and gets the company to put out a pro version of the iMac, then it will be a good thing for all users." New iMac 2017 specs: Flash storage We'll repeat our hope, expressed this time last year while waiting for the 2015 update, that Apple makes flash storage standard across the entire range of iMacs. At present the 27-inch iMacs get a Fusion Drive by default (Fusion Drives are a high-performance hybrid blend of flash and conventional storage) and the 21.5-inch models can add them as a build-to-order option for an extra £80. We think it should be offered as standard in all Apple's desktops. The current 21.5-inch iMac range is crippled somewhat by its hard drives, which are a lot slower than the flash drives used in all of Apple's laptops - to the extent that Mac laptops with similar processors will perform noticeably better than the equivalent iMac because of their faster SSD drives. Read next: Best external SSD flash drives for Mac New iMac 2017 rumours: Could the iMac replace the Mac Pro? In our roundup of rumours about the next Mac Pro, we discuss the possibility that Apple is planning to wrap up that line - and one way such a move could work is by ramping up the top spec of the iMac line so that it meets the needs of professional users, rendering the Pro irrelevant. TechRadar has speculated about the specs of a theoretical 'iMac Pro' - "that glitzy, 27-inch 5K display paired with a 10-core Intel Xeon E7 (or two) and the latest and greatest AMD FirePro W9100" - and in this day and age the number of Mac buyers who really need the top spec appears to be dwindling. All of this is certainly a possibility. But while the Mac Pro doesn't appear to be tearing up trees commercially, it was never a line that was about making money. The Mac Pro is a flagship product, a niche offering and a positioning exercise - a way of reassuring Mac buyers that Apple is still a company that makes products for pro users. In some senses it's like the Apple Watch Edition: a glamorous, unnecessarily expensive aspiration point that passes on some of its stardust to the more affordable diffusion lines below.

Of the 3.2 Gigawatts of renewable energy purchased in 2015, more than two-thirds of that was from internet companies, Greenpeace notes. Some vendors are better than others at going green though. Apple, Google and Facebook have led the field in years past and do so once again in Greenpeace’s 2016 wrap-up report. Switch, the Las Vegas-based data center and collocation provider, is named a leader for the first time. Greenpeace calls out AWS for needing to do more. The Canadian-based environmental advocacy group says AWS has taken “important steps” in recent years, but they haven’t gone far enough. “Given AWS’s continued lack of transparency and its rapid growth in Virginia and other markets largely served by dirty energy, it remains unclear whether the AWS cloud is actually on a path to becoming renewably powered,” the Greenpeace report notes. Greenpeace says AWS, along with Asian data center provider Tencent, LG CNS and Baidu are each leaders in their respective markets, which “(makes) their lack of movement toward more transparency even more egregious.” Greenpeace AWS, for its part, has committed to being 100% powered by renewable energy, and it most recently said it hopes to be half way to its goal by the end of this year. “AWS has to date enabled 10 renewable energy projects in the United States that will deliver a grand total of 2.6 million MWh of energy annually onto the electric grid powering AWS data centers and four of these projects are already online,” an AWS spokesperson said. “That said, we are nowhere near done. We will continue to make progress toward our 100 percent goal and have many exciting initiatives planned.” Greenpeace gave AWS an overall grade of “C”, but gave it an F for energy transparency and C grades for energy efficiency and mitigation and renewable procurement. Meanwhile, AWS’s biggest competitors in the IaaS public cloud market are leaders in Greenpeace’s report. ALSO ON NETWORK WORLD: Whatever happened to Green IT? Google received and overall “A” grade, with a B in transparency and A's for mitigation and renewable procurement; Microsoft meanwhile got an overall B grade, with B's for mitigation and procurement. By comparison, some of Asia’s largest web services vendors like Baidu and Tencent got overall failing grades. See the full list of Greenpeace’s scores for Internet companies here. Greenpeace says one of the most disturbing trends is the growth of data centers in areas like Asia and Virginia, where there are limited options to power those operations from green energy. Greenpeace While some IaaS cloud vendors argue that a shift to using public cloud resources is good for the environment – because it consolidates workloads into providers who have a better opportunity to use green energy – Greenpeace questions this claim. “The transition to the cloud could in fact increase the demand for coal and other fossil fuels despite significant gains in energy efficiency and adoption of a commitment to 100% renewable energy because of the dramatic growth in new data center construction by cloud and collocation companies such as AWS and Digital Realty in Virginia and other hot spots that have some of the lowest percentages of renewable electricity in the U.S.” Tech vendors have an opportunity to drive toward a green energy future: Greenpeace estimates that the IT sector consumes more energy than Russia, Japan and India; only the U.S. and China consume more energy than the aggregate IT international sector.

The revenues from iOS product sales will reach $980 billion by middle of this year. In addition to hardware Apple also books iOS services revenues (including content) which have totaled more than $100 billion to date. This means that iOS will have generated over $1 trillion in revenues for Apple sometime this year. Dediu notes that in its first ten years, the iPhone has sold at least 1.2 billion units and enabled an empire that includes the iPod touch, iPad, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Combined total unit sales reach about 1.75 billion units over 10 years and could top 2 billion by the end of next year. Additionally, developers who are building apps for iOS have been paid $60 billion and the rate of payments has now reach $20 billion/yr. More details in the full report linked below...

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Pixel 2 : How Pixel XL’s success could shape the next release Chris Burns - Jan 12, 2017 23 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The release of the Google Pixel 2 (and Pixel XL 2) will refine an already-shining example of how good, and simply good, an Android device can be. Google seems to have reached a point at which they’re ready to handle consumers directly, instead of relying on big brands to do all the heavy lifting. As the HTC-manufactured, Google-designed Pixel and Pixel XL had sparkling reviews upon release in 2016, the next generation won’t likely change in any drastic way. The war of smartphone hardware is all but over – take a peek at the stack of the devices above and you’ll see. We’re no longer seeing massive design differences between smartphones made by major brands. There’s no reason to risk the time and effort necessary to design and ship a smartphone that’s odd just to appeal to a niche market. Google is taking Apple’s approach to smartphone manufacturing and marketing. Just like the iPhone-selling company, Google designs and ships their own smartphone. Just like Apple, Google designs its own phone, but has an ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) do its hardware manufacturing. A lot of Google’s methodology can be found in Nate Swanner’s article “Reasons why Google’s Pixel 2 could be the best phone ever.” There, Nate explains how Google and HTC set only a 9-month period to design and manufacture the Pixel. Now imagine how much better a second iteration could be, building on the first instead of starting from scratch, working for 12 months instead of just 9. Above you’ll see our first Unboxing of the Google Pixel XL. You’ll notice that the combined might of both Google and HTC’s past in packaging makes for a professional presentation already here in the first wave. We look forward to inspecting and judging every aspect of the second-wave release. With the second Google Pixel we’ll expect that the newest in Qualcomm Snapdragon processor technology will be used. That means – quite likely – a Snapdragon 835 and many of the key features that are made possible by it. This means more battery life through power optimizations, more capacity for power-hungry processing tasks, and the ability to handle a two-camera array at once (at the chip level). The display sizes of both the Pixel 2 and the Pixel XL 2 won’t likely change. There’s no good reason why Google should change the size of the panels – especially since we’re already at a point where our eyes can’t discern anything sharper. The extra-long battery life of the devices as they stand now will be enhanced with Qualcomm’s first 10nm silicon – keeping the display sizes as they are now will only push that battery life further. Expect that Google will reveal both the Pixel 2 and the Pixel XL 2 sometime around October of 2017. At this point there’s no good reason why Google would do anything different.

The move is reportedly part of an effort to raise the profile of Apple Music, which has been growing (revenue was up 22 percent in the quarter ending September 24) but still lags well behind Spotify in terms of total subscribers. The effort to boost Apple Music revenue could also help offset slowing sales of iPhone and iPads. Some other takeaways from the Journal report on Thursday: The shows Apple is looking to develop would reportedly be comparable to HBO's "Westworld" and Netflix's "Stranger Things." While Apple's planning to make a big investment in creating original TV shows and possibly movies, "it doesn't appear" that it's ready to sink the huge sums required to compete head to head with Netflix and Amazon's Prime Video. Apple hasn't bought any scripted content yet. This could "mark a significant turn in strategy for Apple as it starts to become more of a media company, rather than just a distributor of other companies' media." Until now, it's been limited to producing a series about Dr. Dre, the rapper turned Apple music exec, that's scheduled to appear later this year. Apple hopes to offer "original scripted content by the end of 2017."

 The latest sign that Apple has long-term ambition to break into the transportation industry Kif Leswing Jan. 12, 2017, 11:33 AM 684 facebook linkedin twitter email print An unmarked Apple van.Alexei Oreskovic In the latest sign that Apple has long-term ambition to break into the transportation industry and self-driving cars, one of its top officials has joined a new Department of Transportation committee. Lisa Jackson, Apple's Vice President of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives, and a former Obama administration official, will join a new federal committee that advises on transportation automation. She's not the only tech titan on the committee, either. She'll be joined by John Krafcik, the CEO of Alphabet's self-driving project Waymo, as well as officials from Uber, Amazon, Zoox, Lyft, and Hyperloop One.   The committee will be co-chaired by Mary Barra, the General Motors CEO. The committee will hold its first meeting next week and will "immediately begin work on some of the most pressing and relevant matters facing transportation today, including the development and deployment of automated vehicles, and determining the needs of the Department as it continues with its relevant research, policy, and regulations." From the announcement:  As technology develops, automation may play a larger role in a number of modes of transportation, including cars, buses, trains, planes, and UAS (drone) systems. This committee will play a critical role in sharing best practices, challenges, and opportunities in automation, and will open lines of communication so stakeholders can learn and adapt based on feedback from each other. In December, Apple sent a comment to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration confirming its work in self-driving cars. It currently has a team of about 1000 working on "Project Titan," according to reports, although it may be working on the underlying technology and software instead of manufacturing its own car.  Here's the complete list of committee members:  Co-Chair: Mary Barra- General Motors, Chairman and CEO Co-Chair: Eric Garcetti- Mayor of Los Angeles, CA Vice Chair: Dr. J.

Original TV Shows Andrew E. Freedman Staff Writer Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)January 12, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Apple may finally be making good on rumors that it will make its own TV shows. A report from The Wall Street Journal claims that the company will produce its own scripted shows by the end of the year.Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's Guide Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's GuideMore The report says that the new shows will be made available as part of Apple Music, rather than a separate TV subscription service. Apple hopes that the shows will make its music-streaming service a more compelling offer than Spotify, which it has failed to take down. This move could also help Apple take on Google's premium YouTube Red service, which offers both exclusive YouTube shows and unlimited music streaming via Google Play Music. Additionally, the report says that Apple is "considering" original movies, but that those plans aren't as far along. MORE: The Best Streaming Services In July 2016, Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue told The Hollywood Reporter that "we're not in the business of trying to make TV shows," but it seems plans may have changed. Other rumors last year suggested that Dr. Dre was going to star in a scripted TV series for Apple. Apple is currently working on a reality show, Planet of the Apps, and has the rights to Carpool Karaoke. We don't know what kind of scripted shows the company is considering, but the Journal compares them to highly regarded programs like Westworld and Stranger Things.

That’s according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal which claims Apple is poised to make a play with all-original shows and movies which would be available via the Apple Music service for a monthly subscription fee of $10.  Don't Miss: Apple’s ‘boring’ iPhone 7 just stole a ton of market share from Android The report says Apple has been shopping around for original content and has been in talks with producers to purchase the rights to a number of episodic shows. Apple has also reportedly been getting advice from — and could potentially poach — television marketing professionals from various other companies to help jumpstart the efforts. Apple has set a timeline for the new content plan and wants to offer scripted shows by the end of the year. Apple’s programming efforts will allegedly start rather modestly, with only a handful of shows and/or movies, and as such it would not necessarily strike fear in the hearts of its larger competitors. However, Apple’s plan is apparently to produce shows along the same lines as those offered by Netflix and Amazon — think House of Cards or Transparent. Apple has been dabbling a bit in original content recently, with documentaries on Apple Music and even a standalone version of The Late Late Show‘s Carpool Karaoke. However, according to the report, the shows Apple is currently eying don’t have any link to music as its current video product does, and would instead be positioned as an added value to the Apple Music service — perhaps in the same way Prime Video is a bonus to Amazon’s Prime membership.

Last summer, the company launched Apple Music, a service similar to Spotify except with a whole lot more of Taylor Swift. Not long after, Apple announced their plans to buy James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” segment and turn it into an exclusive, streamable 16-episode series for Apple Music subscribers. The company launched a few other TV-esque projects but for the most part, there hasn’t been much movement to increase original programming since then, until now. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Apple now has plans in place to create original scripted content that will be available through the $10-a-month Apple Music Subscription. Apple Music has struggled to compete with other streaming providers. Since launching, Apple Music has only acquired 20 million subscribers to Spotify’s 40 million, so adding original programming might be the niche it's needed to differentiate itself. According to reports, Apple is sitting on a cash pile of $237 billion, regardless of missing their internal revenue targets this year for the first time since 2009, making them the most valuable tech company in the world. And with that kind of money we’re expecting some pretty great content, potentially surpassing all that we’ve seen come out of any other streaming service thus far.

The technology giant has been in talks with veteran producers in recent months about buying rights to scripted television programs. It also has approached experienced marketing executives at studios and networks to discuss hiring them to promote its content, said people with knowledge of the discussions. In addition to TV, Apple indicated to these people that it is considering offering original movies, though those plans are more preliminary. Apple is reportedly planning to offer original scripted content by the end of this year. The programming would be available to Apple Music subscribers who pay $10/month for the service. The shows being considered are likely comparable to Westworld on HBO or Stranger Things on Netflix, says the WSJ. One of the first shows to be aired by Apple is Carpool Karaoke based on the Late Late Show bit by James Corden. It will consist of 16 half-hour episodes each with a different host. It's also been reported that Apple is working on a Planet of the Apps reality show, has a 'Vital Signs' show in the works based on Dr. Dre, and has signed that deal with Cash Money to fund a documentary.

Home Entertainment by David Carnoy January 12, 2017 7:13 AM PST @DavidCarnoy Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Enlarge Image Apple is apparently considering creating shows that would compete with HBO's "Westworld."Photo by HBO Apple is aiming to become a player in Hollywood, according to a Wall Street Journal report, and has been in "talks with veteran producers in recent months about buying rights to scripted television programs" that subscribers to Apple's $10-a-month music streaming service could access. The move is reportedly part of an effort to raise the profile of Apple Music, which has been growing (revenue was up 22 percent in the quarter ending September 24) but still lags well behind Spotify in terms of total subscribers. The effort to boost Apple Music revenue could also help offset slowing sales of iPhone and iPads. Some other takeaways from the Journal report on Thursday: The shows Apple is looking to develop would reportedly be comparable to HBO's "Westworld" and Netflix's "Stranger Things." While Apple's planning to make a big investment in creating original TV shows and possibly movies, "it doesn't appear" that it's ready to sink the huge sums required to compete head to head with Netflix and Amazon's Prime Video. Apple hasn't bought any scripted content yet. This could "mark a significant turn in strategy for Apple as it starts to become more of a media company, rather than just a distributor of other companies' media." Until now, it's been limited to producing a series about Dr. Dre, the rapper turned Apple music exec, that's scheduled to appear later this year. Apple hopes to offer "original scripted content by the end of 2017."

 Apple fortifies CareKit security BI Intelligence Jan. 12, 2017, 10:48 AM 434 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Fitbit plans to launch a wearables app store in 2017 Wearables could surpass tablets in China THE SMARTWATCH REPORT: Forecasts, adoption trends, and why the market isn't living up to the hype This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Apple is increasing the security of CareKit, its health app framework, partnering with security firm, Tresorit, according to Mashable. The security technology supports user and healthcare worker authentication as well as end-to-end encryption for health data, and it inhibits the sharing of data between services as it's transferred — a system called "zero knowledge." The new security features will help apps reach HIPAA compliance, which is a major barrier to the adoption of apps in the US healthcare system.  CareKit is Apple's next big play for the mobile health (mHealth) market. The mHealth solutions market — of which health apps account for roughly 20% — is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 33.4% through 2020, reaching $59.2 billion, according to Markets and Markets. Furthermore, the biggest markets on a regional basis are North America and Europe, both of which house large shares of iOS devices. This gives Apple ample opportunity to capitalize on this market. The health sector is the most promising area for wearables adoption. Several emerging consumer and professional healthcare trends, which dovetail with advances in health technology over the past five years, are driving interest in wearables. And where wearables are most commonly used for fitness-tracking purposes at the moment, they show great potential for widespread adoption in the healthcare sector. BI Intelligence, Business Insider’s premium research service, has compiled a detailed report entitled The Wearables in the Healthcare Sector Report that examines the use cases for wearables in health, ranging from consumers collecting fitness data to healthcare providers and insurers using wearables to improve health outcomes. The report also explores barriers to widespread adoption of wearables in healthcare and how tech giants, including Apple, Google, and Samsung, are developing devices and platforms that will help bridge the gap between fitness tracking and actual medical care. Here are some key points from the report: While adoption levels are growing, the wearables market is still in the early phases of expansion. We estimate global shipments will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.8% over the five years, reaching 162.9 million units in 2020. Emerging consumer and professional healthcare trends are driving interest in wearables. For consumers, interest in quantifying personal health metrics is translating into demand for fitness tracking devices and smartwatches. Meanwhile, businesses in a variety of industries have been quick to sense the opportunities for harnessing health data from employees, consumer, and patients to help drive efficiencies and enhance services related to healthcare. Barriers remain blocking the widespread adoption of wearables in the healthcare sector. Device accuracy and regulation are two major sticking points for device makers and technologists to address. Concerns surrounding privacy and a lack of utility must also be addressed. Consumer-facing products will eventually be used for more advanced medical care. Tech giants, including Apple, Google, and Samsung, are investing significant resources into developing devices that will help bridge the gap between fitness tracking and actual medical care. Future products will serve both consumer and professional markets. In full, the report: Looks at areas of the healthcare sector where wearables may have a tangible impact in years to come.

Apple set to take fight to Netflix and Amazon with original content in 2017? by Joe Roberts 12 January 2017 0 shares Read Comments Apple is reportedly considering producing original TV shows and movies in 2017, expanding its streaming services to compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon. The Wall Street Journal report, citing 'people familiar with the matter' claims Apple has set its sites on original content to offset sales of iPhones and iPads. Apple has already managed to build an impressive music streaming service, which has racked up 17 million subscribers since launching in June 2015. But the company is yet to expand into original TV and movie content. Related: Apple TV review Last March, Apple executive Eddy Cue spoke to the New York Post following the news that the firm was working on a TV show about app developers Cue told The Post: "This doesn’t mean that we are going into a huge amount of movie production or TV production or anything like that.” But it seems, if the WSJ report is anything to go by, that things have changed, though Apple has had some significant trouble establishing its own streaming service since last March. Apple TV In September the company was reported to have put its TV streaming ambitions on hold, which was seemingly confirmed by CBS CEO Les Moonves. Moonves also told CNNMoney last November: “We had conversations awhile back, and we haven’t had recent conversations with them,” suggesting the streaming plans had been postponded. This week's report that Apple is indeed moving forward with the plans follows the firm's acquisition of James Corden's Carpool Karaoke. There's been no official word from the company, of course, so there's no way to know exactly what Tim Cook and co. have planned in the TV/film department. Whatever's happening behind the scenes, we wouldn't be surprised if we heard more about Apple's original content ambitions in the coming months so stay tuned.

And now, you can get Apple's 4-inch handset unlocked, and with a two-year guarantee for a very reasonable price thanks to John Lewis. The retailer has discounted both the 16GB and 64GB models of the handsets on its website, so you can pick up both for £30 cheaper than on Apple's online store. GET DEAL: iPhone SE 16GB for £349 at John Lewis Right now you can get the 16GB model for £349, while the 64GB version is currently going for £399, which is also cheaper than you'll find the phones for on Carphone Warehouse's site. The iPhone SE is a solid choice, that impressed us with its compact design, great camera, and solid battery life when we reviewed it. On top of that, the phone performs incredibly well for a handset in this price range, thanks to its A9 dual-core processor GET DEAL: iPhone SE 64GB for £399 at John Lewis We were so taken with Apple's 4-inch handset, we concluded: "It may not be the most exciting phone Apple has ever released, but the iPhone SE will be a godsend for those who want a high-quality phone that isn't massive." If you're tempted to pick up a smaller phone, the iPhone SE is a great choice, and since John Lewis is selling the handset unlocked, it can be used with any SIM you choose.

Apple is granted a patent for a see-through display Apple has been granted a patent for a display with openings between pixels These would allow external objects to be viewed through the screen The technology could pave the way for Apple's step into augmented reality By Abigail Beall For Mailonline Published: 11:00 EST, 12 January 2017 | Updated: 11:00 EST, 12 January 2017 e-mail 171 shares 65 View comments Apple's next iPhone could come with a transparent screen, according to a patent granted to the company. The technology could pave the way for Apple's step into augmented reality. The patent also includes an OLED screen - something that has been rumoured from a number of sources to feature on the iPhone 8. Scroll down for video  Apple's next iPhone could come with a transparent screen, according to a patent granted to the company. Stock image of a futuristic transparent phone, pictured IPHONE 8 RUMOURS  Several rumours have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have: - Dual-lens 3D camera - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen - Wireless charging - A folding element - New 5 inch (12.7 centimetre) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimetre) models - A new 'pure white' model - Aluminum back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  'One or more openings in the display may form a window through which a user of the device may view an external object,' the patent says.  'Display pixels in the window region may be used in forming a heads-up display.' Current features on the phone's face, like the camera, ear speaker and light sensors, could be hidden beneath the screen. This is not the first evidence that points towards the world of augmented reality, that was made popular last year with the rise of Pokemon Go. The iPhone maker is believed to be working with Carl Zeiss on an augmented reality project, which could go on sale this year. The wearable headset would connect wirelessly to iPhones and show information that is superimposed onto a user's view of the real world.  'A Zeiss employee confirmed the rumors that Apple and Carl Zeiss AG are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year,' blogger Roberty Scoble wrote earlier this week.  The firm has talked about the project with potential suppliers for Google Glass-style headsets.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next iPhone 8 to have stainless steel frame, all glass front and...

Share this article Share 171 shares 'Openings in the display may form a window through which a user of the device may view an external object,' the patent says Earlier this week, another rumour surfaced saying the new phone will be designed with a stainless steel forging process that brings together two reinforced glass panels supported by a metal frame. The rumour was first reported by Chinese newspaper DigiTimes, which revealed the new components would be ordered from Foxconn electronics US-based Jabil – firms who worked with Apple in creating the iPhone 4, reports 9To5Mac. 'The metal bezel will be made of stainless steel using a forging process to enhance its sturdiness and reduce costs and manufacturing time,' reports DigiTimes.  THE END OF GOOGLE GLASS  Alphabet discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year. This ends its attempt to popularise the expensive devices with consumers. The device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording. Other than giving the iPhone 8 a sleeker design, this move will ensure the glass panels in the front and back hold together. And it should decrease costs by 30 per cent to 50 per cent. Using stainless steel could send the iPhone 8 back in time, as this metal alloy was originally used on the iPhone 4 variants. However, it would also mean this will be one of Apple's strongest smartphones yet. This speculation is consistent with a major rumour – the iPhone could feature a curved OLED, which lets Apple include an edge-to-edge screen. Aside from the rumours regarding the iPhone 8's body design, Apple received a new patent that also points to an edge-to-edge screen. The patent, titled ‘Electronic devices having displays with openings’ describes a method that places electronic components – such as cameras and speakers – underneath the screen. The latest rumour to hit the web comes from an ‘upstream supply chain’ that says the Cupertino company is ditching the aluminium back cover. Instead, it will be designed with a stainless steel forging process .Pictured is an iPhone 8 concept render The patent, titled ‘Electronic devices having displays with openings’ describes a method that places electronic components – such as cameras and speakers – underneath the screen. The openings would be so small they would be ‘imperceptible to the human eye’ According to AppleInsider, the openings on the screen would be so small they would be ‘imperceptible to the human eye’ – resulting in a ‘true edge-to-edge screen’. This setup would also make it possible to add in various sensors inside of the phone that could transmit information across the display. ‘An electronic component may be mounted in alignment with the one or more openings in the display,’ reads the patent filed in February 2015. ‘Signals associated with the electronic component may pass through the openings.’ Apple could be moving forward with this design, as the firm is up against other smartphone makers to design the thinnest and compact smartphone. And the best way to do this is to remove all of the features from the outer areas and hide them underneath the screen ‘The signals may include acoustic signals, electromagnetic signals such as radio-frequency electromagnetic signals, and light.  ‘The electronic component may be a structure that uses light such as a camera, a light sensor, a light-based proximity sensor, a status indicator light, a light-based touch sensor array, or a secondary display that has display pixels that may be viewed through the openings.’ Apple could be moving forward with this design, as the firm is up against other smartphone makers to design the thinnest and compact smartphone. And the best way to do this is to remove all of the features from the outer areas and hide them underneath the screen. The new design will bring together two reinforced glass panels supported by a metal frame. This will allow for an edge-to-edge screen, which is another rumour that has been floating around the web (pictured are artists impressions of the iPhone 8) Just a month after the iPhone 7 hit the market, rumours began circulating about what to expect in 2017. One of these speculations was the handset could feature an all-glass casing. Experts say that the transition from metal to glass casing is key if Apple is to introduce a wireless charging feature in its next iPhone. The rumours were obtained by MacRumours, and come from Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at KGI Securities. Mr Kuo is uncertain whether a wireless charger will be bundled with all new iPhones, but is convinced that the feature will appear in the iPhone 8. A metal alloy phone casing could potentially cause wireless charging speeds to be reduced, which is why a glass chassis could be used instead. iOS users may have also heard that there could be three iPhone 8 smartphones to choose from this year – oppose to the traditional two Apple releases every year. IPHONE 7 IN JET WHITE?  When Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 in September, its brand new 'jet black' design sold out in a matter of hours. But it appears that a new 'jet white' version could soon be hitting stores. A video has emerged online which hints at what the white version could look like, if Apple does release such a device. Could this be the Jet White iPhone 7? pic.twitter.com/pHoDiZ63ON— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 27, 2016 Reports of a new white version first appeared in November, when Japanese site, Mac Otakara, suggested that Apple would add a sixth color option to its iPhone 7 line-up. Sources speaking to the website said: 'Apple seems to have a plan to add a pure white model to iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus.' The website cited the source as a 'supplier'. 'But this information may be unreliable,' the site added. While no official 'jet white' iPhone has emerged yet, a video has appeared on Twitter which hints at what the device may look like. The post, by Sonny Dickson, a technology leaking site, says: 'Could this be the Jet White iPhone 7?' alongside a video showing an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 7 Plus, both with white casings.  According to Nikkei, there will be one premium model with a curved edge-to-edge OLED display alongside two models that have standard LCD displays. Citing a supply chain source, Nikkei says Apple will release the three iPhones in the following sizes: 5.5 inches, 5 inches, and 4.7 inches. 'Apple has tentatively decided that all the 5.5-inch, 5-inch and 4.7-inch models will have glass backs, departing from metal casings adopted by current iPhones, and Biel and Lens are likely to be providing all the glass backs for the new iPhones next year,' the source said. All three iPhone 8 models will use glass supplied by Biel Crystal Manufactory and Lens Technology in China for both the front and back, However, these rumours say all three of them will be held together with an aluminium frame.  Read more: Apple new iPhone to use forging process for stainless steel frame; adding Jabil as supplier New report supports glass design for iPhone 8, with iPhone 4-style stainless steel frame | 9to5Mac Apple patent paves way for iPhone with full-face display, HUD windows United States Patent: 9543364 Share or comment on this article e-mail 171 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

The original programming would be included in subscriptions for Apple Music. In a move that would pit it against the likes of Netflix, Amazon and HBO, Apple is reportedly on the cusp of unveiling film and TV programming of its own. According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple wants to "build a significant new business in original television shows and movies," a move that could raise its profile in Hollywood and potentially soften the financial blow from slowing hardware (iPhones, iPads) sales across the company. WSJ sources said the original programming could arrive by the end of 2017 and would be included in subscriptions for Apple Music, much like Amazon does with its Prime service. Apple Music currently has roughly 20 million subscribers paying $10 per month -- that's half of Spotify's paid user totals -- so adding premium video content as an incentive could make a difference in closing that gap. (Apple may have provided a clue to its programming aspirations with the hiring last year of Scott Seviour, a veteran marketing executive whose resume includes RCA and ABC News, to Apple Music's original content team.) Apple is apparently eying scripted TV first, with original movies coming later. According to the report, the tech giant has been talking with various stakeholders in recent months in order to secure rights to the scripted shows, and has been formulating plans on how to promote the content.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Such a move into scripted content from outside producers would be a first for Apple, which has so far only dabbled in music-related nonfiction and documentaries in the video arena.

According to the department’s press release, the newly formed committee will have its first meeting later this month on January 16 and the focus of the group will be to address “the development and deployment of automated vehicles, and determining the needs of the Department as it continues with its relevant research, policy, and regulations.” As technology develops, automation may play a larger role in a number of modes of transportation, including cars, buses, trains, planes, and UAS (drone) systems. This committee will play a critical role in sharing best practices, challenges, and opportunities in automation, and will open lines of communication so stakeholders can learn and adapt based on feedback from each other. Jackson isn’t a surprising pick for the committee, having served as Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) until 2013 when she joined Apple. The committee includes a number of experts in various fields, including General Motors Chairman and CEO Mary Barra, and Mayor of Los Angeles Eric Garrett as Co-Chairs, and Stanford University Professor of Engineering Dr. J. Chris Gerdes as Vice Chair. Others include executives from FedEx, Zipcar, Hyperloop One, Uber, National Safety Council, Lyft, Amazon and others (full list below). While Jackson serves as Apple’s Vice President of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives, and often appears as a face of the company related to environmental efforts, Apple’s role on the committee is notable due to its secretive Apple Car initiative known as Project Titan. As of September, after reports that Apple was looking to reboot the project to focus on an autonomous self-driving platform, one report claimed the company already has fully autonomous vehicles being tested on closed routes. Apple even confirmed interest in autonomous systems to transform ‘the future of transportation’ in a letter it sent to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that was uncovered last month. That news came amid reports that Apple was attempting to refocus the team and even laying off some employees in the process. Earlier this week we reported that Swift creator and Apple’s longtime leader of Xcode/dev tools team left the company to join Tesla, while another high profile Apple employee who worked on many iconic Macs also left for Tesla this month. There have been many reports over the last year of a poaching war between the two companies, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in June last year that he thinks Apple may have left it too late on its car project. Full list of committee members below: Co-Chair: Mary Barra- General Motors, Chairman and CEO Co-Chair: Eric Garcetti- Mayor of Los Angeles, CA Vice Chair: Dr. J. Chris Gerdes- Stanford University, Professor of Engineering Gloria Boyland- FedEx, Corporate Vice President, Operations & Service Support Robin Chase- Zipcar; Buzzcar; Veniam, Co-founder of Zipcar and Veniam Douglas Chey- Hyperloop One, Senior Vice President of Systems Development Henry Claypool- Community Living Policy Center, Policy Director Mick Cornett- Mayor of Oklahoma City, OK Mary “Missy” Cummings- Duke University, Director, Humans and Autonomy Lab, Pratt School of Engineering Dean Garfield- Information Technology Industry Council, President and CEO Mary Gustanski- Delphi Automotive, Vice President of Engineering & Program Management Debbie Hersman- National Safety Council, President and CEO Rachel Holt- Uber, Regional General Manager, United States and Canada Lisa Jackson- Apple, Vice President of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives Tim Kentley-Klay- Zoox, Co-founder and CEO John Krafcik- Waymo, CEO Gerry Murphy- Amazon, Senior Corporate Counsel, Aviation Robert Reich- University of California, Berkeley, Chancellor’s Professor of Public Policy, Richard and Rhoda Goldman School of Public Policy Keller Rinaudo- Zipline International, CEO Chris Spear- American Trucking Association (ATA), President and CEO Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger- Safety Reliability Methods, Inc., Founder and CEO Bryant Walker Smith- University of South Carolina, Assistant Professor, School of Law and (by courtesy) School of Engineering Jack Weekes- State Farm Insurance, Operations Vice President, Innovation Team Ed Wytkind- President, Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO John Zimmer- Lyft, Co-founder and President blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Cable ONE joins ten other providers that let customers authenticate once through the Settings app to access content in paid video apps. The full list of TV provider partners now includes these eleven providers: Cable ONE CenturyLink Prism DIRECTV Dish GTA GVTC Communications Hawaiian Telcom Hotwire MetroCast Service Electric Cablevision Sling TV Big name TV providers like Comcast and Verizon are still not yet supported. Single Sign-on also requires paid video apps to add support for the feature on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. Apple currently points to these apps on iOS and tvOS as updated for SSO: ABC (iOS and tvOS) A&E (iOS only) Bravo Now (tvOS only) DIRECTV (iOS only) Disney Channel (iOS and tvOS) Disney Junior (iOS and tvOS) Disney XD (iOS and tvOS) E!

Single Sign-on launched late last year alongside Apple’s new TV app on iOS and tvOS. Apple’s TV app integrates with iTunes and paid video apps from various channels and services including Hulu. Separately, Apple is rumored to be developing a scripted TV series intended for Apple Music subscribers. Beats by Dre co-founder Dr. Dre is said to be involved in one series, while Apple has publicly shared plans to bring a version of the popular Carpool Karaoke series to Apple Music soon.

Ben Lovejoy - Jan. 12th 2017 7:43 am PT @benlovejoy Feature Opinion Siri View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit There has been speculation that Apple may be planning to build its own home speaker device to compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home, with some expressing the view that Apple is already late to the party. But does Apple need to compete in this space, when it arguably already has its own version of Echo or Home? The one that’s either on your wrist or in your pocket … Each approach has pros and cons, of course. A speaker provides more convenient access. If you want to switch on your lights or ask a question or play some music, you have only to speak and the always-listening speaker will respond. No buttons to press, nothing to pick up, just speak. And it can be used by anyone in your home. But unless you’re going to lay out the cash for one speaker per room (which isn’t cheap with either Amazon Echo or Google Home), a speaker only works in limited areas of the home. If you have an Apple Watch, you have convenient access to Siri anywhere in the home. Without a Watch, things are more finely balanced. If you keep your phone in one room at home, it’s not really any different to a speaker. If you carry it in your pocket, you can pull it out to use it in other rooms, but it’s less convenient in the living room. I suspect much of it may come down to the type of household makeup. For couples who both own a Watch, that’s going to win out almost every time; if you have a larger family, especially one where not everyone owns an Apple device, a speaker or two makes far more sense. However, there’s also the security issue of an always-listening device. While both Amazon and Google say that recognition of the trigger-word happens locally, and only then is speech passed to the cloud to decode the rest of the command, not everyone will be happy with a device that could potentially eavesdrop on everything said in the home. Some have suggested, for example, that a government agency could get a court order requiring Amazon to set your Echo to listen at all times and effectively use your own speaker as a wiretapping device. While the average consumer may have no concerns about criminal investigations, if that capability does indeed exist then there is the obvious risk that the functionality could be internally misused or externally hacked. While some describe Echo and Home as more capable than Siri, able to understand and act on a wider range of requests, that’s an argument for Apple to make Siri smarter, not one for the company to start building speakers. Indeed, it could be argued that an Apple speaker that can be used by anyone in the home would reduce demand for the Watch or additional iOS devices, as one device would serve multiple people. However, if Apple were to adopt the speaker approach, it seems to me that there could be a halfway-house solution which again employs existing Apple devices. Given that the majority of usage of smart speaker systems probably occurs in the living-room, perhaps microphones could be added to the Apple TV to allow it to perform this role? Since TV sets won’t be switched on all the time, it’s probably not practical to rely on the television speaker for responses, so the Apple TV box would need a speaker too, so we might be talking about an Apple TV Plus model, allowing people the choice of a smaller device without the added capabilities or a larger one with them. With a little intelligence, the box could use its own speaker when the TV is off and the existing TV speakers when it’s on. What’s your view? Would a smarter Siri on existing Apple devices be enough? Would you prefer an Apple TV Plus with smart speaker capabilities? Or should Apple follow Amazon and Google and make a standalone smart speaker?

Add Original TV Shows To Apple Music Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple’s Plan To Compete With Spotify? Add Original TV Shows To Apple Music Image courtesy of Cheri Sundra January 12, 2017 9:31 am EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave Apple Music PrimeFlix apple apple music netflix amazon prime spotify A new report claims that Apple now has plans to produce original TV shows and movie, just like Amazon and Netflix have been doing for several years. However, the goal isn’t to compete directly with these streaming video platforms, but to bolster the Apple Music streaming audio service. This is according to the Wall Street Journal, which reports that Apple wants to produce the same kind of original programming that has garnered awards, positive reviews, and audience buzz for Netflix and Amazon Prime. What Apple doesn’t want to do is spend the billions of additional dollars that would be required to license other studios’ content in order to offer a subscription video plan. Instead, say the Journal’s sources, Apple would offer its original content as a bonus to Apple Music, the $10/month plan Apple launched in the summer of 2015, but which still has only about half the subscriber base as Spotify. Apple has recently produced a handful of music-related original videos, but nothing on the level of the scripted original content the company reportedly hopes to begin producing this year. In an effort to woo producers, Apple would reportedly be more open to sharing ratings and demographic information with the studios it teams with. Netflix has been notoriously guarded about viewership data.

Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version 10:06 12 Jan 2017 The tech giant is rumoured to be in the planning stages of developing an original television show and movies production arm Apple is rumoured to be moving into the TV and movie production space as it looks to offset declining iPhone sales US tech giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly set to pit itself against the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime by moving into the film and television arena. The Wall Street Journal cites “people familiar with the matter” who claim that Apple is looking to develop an original television show and movie arm. California-based Apple has allegedly been in talks with several big-name Hollywood producers about buying rights to scripted television programs. The insiders said that the new service would be available to subscribers of Apple’s music streaming service, which has so far struggled to keep up with its main rival Spotify. Apple Music already offers a few documentaries to customers, but this move would make the firm a much bigger player in Hollywood, and would help to offset the declining sales of its iPhones and iPads. As well as original television series, there are rumours that Apple is planning to make its own original movies, although these ideas are thought to be at a less advanced stage. If Apple does indeed embark on this new path, it would likely be a transformative period for the company and for Hollywood. Shares in Apple were down 1%, or US$1.40, to US$11.45 in early trading.

A #TalkingTech video. Apple (Photo: AP) Apple is preparing to challenge Netflix and Amazon -- and Hollywood -- by increasing the creation of its own online TV and movie content. Remember earlier this month when Apple announced plans to produce 16 episodes of Carpool Karaoke, the hit sketch on The Late Late Show with James Corden, for this spring (Corden won't appear in them all). And how back in July Apple said it would create its first reality show Planet of the Apps, executive produced by entertainer will.i.am. Rumors also had a six-episode series in production by Dr. Dre at Apple prior to that. These moves, as many have expected, appear to be all part of a bigger plan, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal Thursday. Apple has been in talks with Hollywood producers about buying rights to scripted TV shows, the Journal says, citing people familiar with the matter. USA TODAY Who's on tap for James Corden's 'Carpool Karaoke' Apple Music spinoff? The iPhone maker also has talked with studio and network marketing executives about hiring them to promote Apple's upcoming original content, the persons told the Journal. Subscribers to Apple Music would get the content, an addition that if desirable enough could boost Apple's fortunes against Spotify, as well as Netflix and Amazon's video streaming service. The $10 monthly music service has about 20 million paid subscribers, compared to Spotify's 40 million. Over the years, many Wall Street analysts have theorized Apple would create a TV service or dive into original content since its nest egg -- the company had more than $230 billion in cash and investments at the end of the last quarter -- would allow it to compete with the likes of Netflix, which plans to spend $6 billion this year on content. USA TODAY Cutting the Cord: Netflix, Amazon seek streaming content crown Apple declined comment on the report. Apple (APPL) shares were down 0.8% Thursday to $118.82; shares are up 18% over the last 12 months. As a major tech company, Apple must offer and create original content to nurture its overall ecosystem, says analyst Joel Espelien of research firm The Diffusion Group. Increased content will help drive Apple's services revenue, which rose 24% to $6.3 billion last quarter, while hardware revenues declined. "If you have got a billion users, you need people to use those devices and services that come with those devices," he said. Still, Espelien doesn't see Apple immediately developing content in bulk as Netflix and Amazon do. "I don’t see them doing obscure scripted dramas that take a long time to explain or are an acquired taste," he said. "I think it's going to be more one-offs, shorts, and maybe miniseries that involve people who are already stars."

One thing is for sure, the market is a lot more expensive than it was this time last year, and the going could be a touch more difficult. While the Trump rally has been solid, and hopes are high for an improving economy, it still makes sense to stay with market leaders. In a recent research report, the analysts at Baird offered with their top ideas for 2017. It is an eclectic and solid group, many of which are small or mid-cap companies, as that is a research niche the company excels in. However, when it came to technology this year, the firm went large cap with five of their top picks, all of which make good sense for growth portfolios with more risk tolerance. Alphabet The search giant continues to expand and is even working on a driverless car now. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) provides online advertising services in the United States, the United Kingdom and rest of the world. It offers performance and brand advertising services, and it operates through Google and Other Bets segments. The Google segment includes principal internet products, such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Apps, Cloud, Android, Chrome and Google Play, as well as technical infrastructure and newer efforts, such as virtual reality. The Google segment also sells hardware products, comprising Chromecast, Chromebooks and Nexus. The Other Bets segment includes businesses such as Access/Google Fiber, Calico, Nest, Verily, GV, Google Capital, X and other initiatives. The Baird team cite the company’s innovation in machine learning and artificial intelligence, which they feel can support the core search business and is now being applied across all the company’s growth initiatives. They also point to Google Cloud, which is the largest cloud infrastructure and engages in more technology, infrastructure research and development in headcount and dollars than any other company. This gives the company the strength and wherewithal to compete and differentiate itself from Amazon AWS and Microsoft’s Azure. The Baird price target for the stock is $930. The Wall Street consensus price objective is $968.75. Shares closed Wednesday at $829.86. Apple This technology giant had a wild 2016 and is still down over 10% from highs posted in the spring of 2015. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, and it is among the leaders in the world in innovation with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, OS X, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services, including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple shares have shown a nice move in the Trump rally but volatility has crept into the stock. Top analysts have noted that the iPhone 7 family performed much better than the prior model, and there is big consumer interest in iPhone 8. They also stress that the company remains committed to its capital allocation program, and Baird sees the possibility for not only an increase in the dividend but continued share buybacks. Baird also thinks the iPhone 8 opportunities are solid and, like others, feels the product will have significant upgrades. Toss in the easier comparisons and the strong average selling prices, and the new phone is a distinct positive going forward this year. Baird also stresses the benefit from lower taxes and more so the cash repatriation, given Apple’s $238 billion cash reserve, 91% of which is offshore. Both President-elect Trump and Congress have indicated they want to lower the tax rate on repatriating cash to the United States, with some seeing the rated dropped to as low as 8% to 10%. Apple investors receive a 1.9% dividend. Baird has a $133 price target. The consensus target is $132.96, and shares closed on Wednesday at $119.75.

(Photo: HTC) With much of the tech world recalling the iPhone's original announcement earlier this week, it's easy to forget how much the smartphone market has changed in the decade since Apple's hit phone was announced. As with BlackBerry and Palm, HTC was one of the early innovators in the space that has watched its standing fall in recent years to Apple's product. In a bid to recapture some of the lost glory, the company on Thursday announced a new smartphone it claims is specifically focused on the user, the HTC U Ultra. Featuring a new "Sense Companion," HTC's own digital assistant to rival Google Assistant, the company is placing an emphasis on providing information before you need it as a way to stand out. If snow is in the forecast, for example, the phone will alert you to dress warmly or leave a little earlier. It also can recommend a restaurant and then book a reservation. In addition to the new software feature, the U Ultra brings a redesigned glass styling, a shift from the aluminum design HTC has previously relied upon. The new look is similar in appearance to Samsung's recent line of Galaxies, though it lacks the Galaxy S7's water resistance. The front of the device packs a high-resolution 5.7-inch main display with a secondary 2-inch screen above it for a "dual display" that can quickly toggle settings, favorite apps or contacts as well as giving a glimpse of notifications. HTC U Ultra's second display.  (Photo: HTC) Rival LG has offered a similar "dual display" for its V20 phone, though the feature has struggled to catch on as more than a gimmick. It remains to be seen if HTC's offering can change that. Sadly as with other recent phones, HTC has decided to drop the headphone jack on the U Ultra, instead having users use the USB-C port or Bluetooth to for their headphones. A revamped 12-megapixel camera, designed with an emphasis on better low-light photography, sits on the back while a 16-megapixel shooter on the front can be used for selfies and video chats. Android  7.0 "Nougat," last year's speedy Qualcomm 821 processor and 64 GB of storage (which you can increase through a microSD card) round out the specs. While it certainly packs a lot, at $749 unlocked the phone will not be cheap when it hits the U.S. in March.

ADVERTISEMENT The AirPods were announced in September when Apple released details about the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones, both shipping without a 3.5mm headphone jack. They were released on sale in the UK in December after being pushed back from an October release date, and cost £159. Hands on with Apple's wireless AirPods: are they really worth the £159 price tag? Hands on with Apple's wireless AirPods: are they really worth the £159 price tag? Apple 13 Sep 2016 Read more Streaming shows online could be damaging the environment Streaming shows online could be damaging the environment By James Temperton Despite the high price point and gimmicky look, which online commentators have taken Apple to task over, the headphones appear to be selling pretty well from Apple’s online store according to online shopping analyst Slice Intelligence. Slice Intelligence's data shows that 75 per cent of headphones sold in December online were wireless. The day the AirPods were released, December 13, was the largest single day of online headphone spending for the whole of 2016 – bigger even than Black Friday and Cyber Monday, when retailers slash their prices ahead of the Christmas period. Subscribe to WIRED Before the AirPods were launched, Apple-owned Beats headphones were top of the wireless headphone market, with around a 24.1 per cent share, with Bose coming in second with 10.5 per cent. Once the AirPods launched, though, the market share shifted to Apple’s new product with a 26 per cent share, leaving Bose and Beats in its wake. And men are predominantly shoring up Apple’s stock when it comes to the AirPods. More than 85 per cent of AirPod owners are male, with millennials making up the biggest purchasing group; over one-third of the men who bought a pair. ADVERTISEMENT When WIRED briefly tested the new headphones in September at the launch of the product, it found the new design to be a little awkward, albeit much more comfortable than previous Apple earphones. The lack of wires was found to be a bonus, though, as it reduces the weight and pull on your ears as you wear them. It is worth noting that the data is only from online sales. E-commerce data provider Slice Intelligence, measures its data from e-recepits, but doesn’t focus on in-store purchases. It could be a different story in Apple’s stores, however judging by how strong the sales appear to be going online, probably not.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Business Apple’s ‘boring’ iPhone 7 just stole a ton of market share from Android Zach Epstein @zacharye January 12th, 2017 at 9:01 AM Share Tweet Before, during and after launch, there was a narrative that existed on a handful of tech blogs. Because the new handsets used the same hardware design for the third consecutive year, they were “boring.” Now, there’s precious little question that Apple fans would have liked to see a fresh new design on the iPhone 7. After all, Apple typically introduces new designs every other year and after the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s, the iPhone 7 was due for a visual refresh. But in 2016, Apple chose not to change the look of the phones, instead reusing its iPhone 6 design for a second time. Why? As we explained months before the iPhone 7 was even unveiled, Apple is planning a big design overhaul for the iPhone 8 so it chose to focus on performance and features in 2017 rather than the housing design. Does that make the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus boring? Was this a misstep on Apple’s part? Will iPhone sales take a hit as a result? Apple doesn’t report its holiday-quarter earnings for another three weeks so we don’t yet know sales numbers, but early market share data from Kantar suggests Apple’s new iPhones are a hit. Don't Miss: Exclusive: This image could be the world’s first look at the Galaxy S8 According to new data released this week by leading market research firm Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, Apple’s new iPhone models stole a significant amount of market share from Android during the holiday shopping period last year. Of the 10 markets covered in Kantar’s report, Apple saw year-over-year growth in six key regions while Android’s share of the smartphone market grew in four regions. In the United States, Apple’s iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 6s were three best-selling smartphones during the three-month period ended in November. According to Kantar, the three devices combined to account for 31.3% of all smartphone sales in the US. Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge took the numbers four and five spots, combining to account for 28.9% of all smartphone sales in the region. Apple’s share of the US smartphone market climbed 6.4% on-year to 43.5% in the three months ended in November, while Android slipped 5.1% to 55.3%. The iPhone enjoyed its largest gains in the UK, where sales of Apple’s iPhone lineup grew 9.1% year-over-year to 48.3%. At the same time, Kantar says Android’s share of smartphone sales slid 1.8% to 49.6%. iPhone’s share of the market also grew in France, Italy, Spain and across the EU5 region as a whole. Google’s share of the smartphone market grew slightly across EU5 as well, in addition to Germany, Italy and China.

Cramer said the tech Giant will need to develop more revenue streams, considering its iconic device, the iPhone, is a decade old. "The iPhones are 10 years old and that's a long time. That's a very long time for a product that we still care about, right? Most products 10 years ago we don't use anymore," he said on "Squawk on the Street." Cramer was responding to comments by Silicon Valley investor and Donald Trump transition team member Peter Thiel in a Q&A with The New York Times. When asked if "the age of Apple is over," Thiel confirmed. "We know what a smartphone looks like and does. It's not the fault of Tim Cook, but it's not an area where there will be any more innovation," Thiel told the Times. Apple has recently seen a fall in its iPhone sales. On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported the company is planning to build a significant new business in original TV and movies. Disclosure: Jim Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple.

From glitchy displays to subpar battery performance and eventually receiving a negative recommendation from the Consumer Reviews. Many consumers were asking why Apple even bothered releasing the laptop in the first place. A lot of fans were banking on Apple releasing the MacBook Pro with an Intel Kaby Lake processor. However, due to delays from Intel’s side, Apple was forced to release the laptop with the current Skylake. Now, rumors have it that Apple is gearing up for the MacBook Pro 2017 release as the Kaby Lake processors become available in the market. Intel has finally officially unveiled the seventh generation processor to come out of its foundry. The Kaby Lake was formally introduced during this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES). According to Intel, availability of the new processors will be some time in the first quarter of the year. This announcement led many to believe that Apple is now considering re-releasing the MacBook Pro this year. The MacBook Pro 2017 is said to feature the latest Kaby Lake chip from Intel. Not only that, the laptop is also rumored to get a new display – a much better one – on its release. MacBook Pro 2016 (via apple.com) According to Digitimes, market watcher IHS Markit made it public that Apple will proceed with the indium gallium zinc oxide display panels this year. These metal oxide or IGZO panels are to be used for notebook devices, possibly the MacBook Pro 2017. The report also mentioned that Sharp will be the major supplier of Apple for the said display, with deliveries starting mid-2017. The new MacBook Pro 2017 could benefit from the new display owing to its increased power efficiency. This is due to the inherently high electron mobility of the semiconductor material. This may result in increased display brightness and a much wider color gamut. IGZO displays may pave the way for a much longer performing MacBook Pro 2017. Perhaps with the use of the display technology, Apple may be able to extend battery life by a couple of hours on average. This is highly probable with the combination of the more efficient Kaby Lake processor and the metal oxide display. Although Apple has yet to comment on the MacBook Pro 2017 release, many believe that it will happen some time in September this year.

The last update done by Apple on the 8-inch tablet is around 16 months ago with the release of the iPad Mini 4. Now, experts believe that Apple may be gearing up with another batch of hardware releases some time in March. However, it would seem that the iPad Mini 5 will not be included in the roster. Instead, earlier rumors suggest that Apple will replace it with an iPad Pro Mini. According to reports by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is considering releasing at least three different models of iPad Pros this year. Included in this list is the run-of-the-mill 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch versions. In addition to these two, the analyst also mentioned that there might be a 10.5- or a 10.9-inch version as well. This particular model will assume the same form factor as the 9.7-inch albeit with thinner bezels. Apart from these three, rumors of an iPad Mini revamp have been thrown into the mix as well. As reported many times in the early months of 2016, Apple is upgrading the iPad Mini to the pro status. However, recent news seem to suggest that this may not be the case anymore. iPad Mini 4 (via apple.com) According to the Apple Insider, Apple might stick to the rumored iPad Pro releases and drop the iPad Mini altogether. This probably has something to do with the declining iPad sales for the past few months. On top of this, the report also suggests that Apple is considering making its iPad product lineup more homogenous with each other. That being said, many are still expecting to see a new iPad Mini 5 or iPad Pro Mini come this March. Various reports agree that Apple will be holding another event in the first quarter of the year just like last year. However, to this point, it is still uncertain as to what products Apple will introduce. For more updates on the iPad Pro Mini or iPad Mini 5, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

The plan calls for premium shows along the lines of HBO’s “Westworld” and Netflix’s “Stranger Things” that don’t have any particular relationship to music. Unlike existing Apple-produced video content offered on Apple Music like music videos, a documentary about Roland’s famous drum machine, a scripted drama starring Dr. Dre or the upcoming shows such as Planet of the Apps and Carpool Karaoke, Apple is aiming to buy rights to scripted television programs, not produce them on its own. “Executives at Apple have told people in Hollywood they hope to start offering original scripted content by the end of 2017,” according to people familiar with the matter who spoke with the newspaper. The iPhone maker allegedly told producers that it would even share details on how many people are watching the content. Here’s an excerpt from the report: Because it is looking at just a handful of carefully selected shows, and potentially films, it doesn’t appear Apple is preparing to spend the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars it would need to spend annually to become a direct competitor to Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Video or premium cable networks. The report states that Apple approached veteran producers in recent months about buying rights to scripted television programs and has talked with marketing executives at studios and networks to discuss hiring them to promote its content. The Cupertino company is reportedly serious about building “a significant new business” in original programming. By offering unique scripted content, Apple aims to attract users to its ecosystem and boost Apple Music subscriptions because this rumored new content would be allegedly made available to Apple Music subscribers. Source: The Wall Street Journal Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend No Related Post Bacillus OMG the continuing “Eddy Cue went out for everything but got nothing” content jingle that pops up every month … Apple, get your act together and launch some innovative hardware. Forget Maps, AppleCar, automotive. Forget TV content – Youtube and Netflix are platform-neutral and can’t be beaten. And Spotify can’t be beaten either except with a price cut. askep3 What’s in Spotify that’s better? I’ve been comparing them for a while, just wanna know what you think. Bacillus I prefer the quiter and more logical UI. But it is highly subjective and I am not a Music Pro.. Rowan09 Forget maps and Car Play? Why in the Lords would Apple do such a stupid thing? I use Apple Music since I got rid of CDs and stream it over Bluetooth in my car with no issues. I’ve never had Spotify premium but my friend that canceled his likes Apple Music better. Apple has to focus on both hardware and software especially since software is usually a monthly charge while hardware is once every year and the usual iPhone user may not upgrade but once every 2-3 years. Bacillus I would agree that Apple can diversify as long as their mainstream businesses is OK. But diversification has lead to dramatic loss of focus, nuisance and mediocre services. Apple Maps and CarPlay are more than five years behind the nearest competition, for various reasons. Rowan09 Apple maps is five years behind who?Apple maps transit directions is better on Apple maps and they released a temporary stop on your route and included it in your total time traveled. That’s a huge stretch. I never used Android Play before and used CarPlay for a little while so I can’t even compare the two. Bacillus Ok if that’s your favorite Maps feature – I am with you. But Google succeeds in linking its vast resources with map locations (companies, tourist attractions, historic/political places) The Google datamine is so rich that Apple can never match it. Both CarPlay and Android have been overtaken with OEM infotainment – car manufacturers will NEVER let IT companies come between their customers and themselves. Rowan09 Maps and Google maps are not that far off anymore. I agree Google has more POIs because they’re Google, but both maps work well and Apple maps GUI is better in my opinion. Bacillus Mmmh, 3D is certainly better @Apple, but for the rest (…) Rowan09 Transit directions is also better and GUI. Google still has if for POIs though.

The latest list for 2016, released on Thursday by the Boston Consulting Group, has Apple, Google, Tesla, Microsoft and Amazon in the top five positions. Among these, the top-four have retained their positions while Amazon has replaced Samsung on the fifth slot. There is no Indian entity on the latest list, though the ranking for 2015 had Tata Motors at 26th place. Before that, another Tata group firm TCS was ranked 43rd in 2014 list. The 2016 list has 34 companies from the US, 10 from Europe, and 6 from Asia. The top 10 most innovative companies for 2016 include, Netflix at the 6th place, Samsung Group (7th), Toyota (8th), Facebbok (9th) and IBM (10th). "Long standing tech giants hold down the top places once again, new digital disruptors such as Uber and Airbnb have joined the list, and the expanding role of digital innovation is readily apparent in the presence of some traditional manufacturers and process driven companies such as General Electric and Diamler," the report noted. General Electric was ranked in the 15th place followed by Diamler (16th), Uber 17th and Airbnb was placed at the 21st rank. The coveted list revealed the 50 companies that global innovation executives ranked as the most innovative and explores the increasing imperative for companies to bring in innovations from outside.

Apple said to be seriously pursuing Netflix-style scripted TV and movies Posted Jan 12, 2017 by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story Karhoo rides again: Nissan/Renault buys failed on-demand ride startup It’s no secret that Apple has had its eye on original programming for a while. The hardware giant has already dipped its toes in the water with the purchase of James Corden’s perennially trending Carpool Karaoke, along with a smattering of documentaries for Apple Music. There’s also that biographical series based on the life of DJ/rapper/producer/headphone mogul Dr. Dre in the works for later this year. But the company’s reportedly looking to get a whole lot more serious about content. According to The Wall Street Journal, Apple is actively courting veteran producers in an attempt to start offering up scripted shows and movies, akin to successful plays by media companies like Amazon and Netflix. The offering would start with “a handful of carefully selected shows, and potentially films” – nothing akin to the scale of the aforementioned platforms – not at first, at least. Apple hasn’t closed any deals on scripted content of that nature reportedly due to some questions surrounding precisely how it will disseminate the shows. Interestingly, such a deal could be aimed at making its existing streaming service more competitive, rather than launching a full-on assault on the likes of Netflix or Amazon Video. The company could offer up programming through its Apple Music service, which has been steadily growing in subscription numbers, but has failed to overtake Spotify. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

This new technology could be the start of Apple's augmented reality future, which the company's chief executive Tim Cook has hinted at repeatedly in recent months. Users would potentially be able to hold up the transparent phone and view the world through it. Information could be overlaid onto real-world images - from arrows marked along roads for navigation to personal information about people using facial recognition. Read More Apple's next iPhone could come in THREE sizes - including a 5-inch model According to an Apple patent the new technology will use an OLED screen for the iPhone 8 - something that has been rumoured from a number of sources . This will allow the spaces between pixels to be used as a way to let light through. The transparent screen would allow digital information to be overlaid onto real-world images (Photo: Dakota Adney/YouTube) Current hardware seen on the phone's face, like the camera, ear speaker and light sensors, would be hidden beneath the screen. That would create an effect of a seamless bezel-free display. In order to hide those components when in transparent mode, it is conceivable that the rear camera could relay images onto the display to make it appear totally see-through. Alternatively, since this is just a patent guide at this stage, Apple may opt for a transparent screen only, with the components hidden in the top and bottom bezels.

Apple is poised for a push into Hollywood, but it’s starting small. The Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant aims to start stocking its Apple Music subscription service with original scripted TV shows by the end of this year, with plans for movies also in the mix, according to a report. The move, however, is seen as an attempt to give Apple’s $10-a-month streaming service a leg up against No. 1 music streamer Spotify, rather than go head-to-head with Netflix and Amazon’s production studios. Apple is now looking to bring shows with the caliber of HBO’s “Westworld” and Netflix’s “Stranger Things” to Apple Music by the end of 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. The report characterized the Apple move into scripted entertainment original as a “significant” new business strategy, but said the company is looking at acquiring only a “handful of carefully selected shows.” Apple has already cut deals for some original video content for Apple Music, whose programming slate includes a deal with CBS for a 16-episode spinoff of James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke,” as well as a scripted show from Beats founder Dr. Dre. The Thurday report didn’t include details about what shows or genres Apple is looking at, and said the company’s interest in movies was “more preliminary.” The tech giant has been actively recruiting marketing execs at studios and TV networks as part of the originals effort, according to the report, which cited anonymous sources. In fact, Apple CEO Tim Cook has publicly said the company is interested in boosting original entertainment content. “We’ve got a few things going there that we’ve talked about. And I think it’s a great opportunity for us — both from a creation point of view and from an ownership point of view,” Cook said on Apple’s earnings call in October. “And so it’s an area that we’re focused on.” Apple and Time Warner execs met in late 2015, which has led to speculation that Apple might have been vying for the media conglomerate. AT&T is in the midst of an $85 billion takeover of Time Warner. Apple also has ordered “Planet of the Apps,” a reality-competition TV show featuring aspiring app developers pitching their creations for a chance to win venture-capital funding. That, however, is more akin to branded content — a project designed to highlight Apple’s App Store business. “Planet of the Apps” is being produced by Propagate’s Ben Silverman and Howard Owens with Will.i.am, Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow and tech investor Gary Vaynerchuk on board as executive producers and mentors appearing on the show.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Apple has come around to the idea of buying scripted TV series from outside producers and is thought to be looking for something that could become comparable in popularity to Westworld or Stranger Things. The TV series would reportedly be bundled with Apple Music, Apple’s $9.99 per month subscription service, as a way to help it stand out from Spotify. Spotify by and large offers the same library of music as Apple Music, and it’s generally thought to have a better interface and recommendations. A few good TV series could help to differentiate Apple Music in a real way, even if it strays from the service’s core focus — music. The Journal says Apple’s goal does not appear to be competing with Netflix or Amazon, let alone cable, on original video. It’s still not clear that Apple knows what it wants from original TV Apple is hoping to debut its own scripted TV series by the end of the year, according to the Journal. That’s a quick timeline, though the Journal could be referring the scripted Dr. Dre series that Apple put into the works, with Dre starring and executive producing, last year. In many ways, despite details saying that Apple is about ready to buckle down and buy some shows, this report makes Apple’s plans for original content continue to sound tentative and uncertain. It’s still in talks over shows, remains undecided on buying movies, doesn’t have a concrete business strategy, and is seemingly unwilling to spend all that much money on this effort, according to the report. It’s entirely possible this just means Apple is approaching the difficult jump into original content with caution. But it could also mean that Apple is underestimating the work and money that goes into picking and crafting great original series — after all, HBO may have Westworld and Netflix may have Stranger Things, but both also have their many misses. In addition to its six-episode Dre series, Apple has also picked up a spinoff of James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke segment. Apple has ordered 16 episodes, though it’s not clear when they’ll premiere.

Alexa has a clear lead in the smart home, but how long will it last? Matt Kapko (CIO (US)) 13 January, 2017 01:08 - - - - print email Comments Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant was impossible to miss at CES 2017. The surprise hit service that powers Amazon's smart home hub, Echo, is being embedded into a growing arsenal of connected products, inside and outside the home. In many ways, Alexa is the feature of the moment for consumer electronics such as refrigerators, vacuums, DVR boxes, robots, TVs, washers and dryers, cars, and an important product category in which Amazon has thus far failed spectacularly: smartphones. Amazon was center stage during the annual tech gathering in the desert, as dozens of companies announced plans to integrate Alexa into their upcoming products. Ford, LG, Whirlpool, GE, Lenovo, Samsung, Hyundai and Huawei are a few of the big names that joined the race to bring Alexa to the masses. Apple and Google both approach voice-enabled assistants based on their install bases in mobile and desktop computing, but Amazon entered the market "completely sideways" by bringing Alexa to "all these other connected products," says Tuong Nguyen, principal research analyst at Gartner. With Alexa, Amazon tries to extend universal behavior Instead of relying on a smartphone to be the mobile hub to manage daily tasks, Amazon capitalizes on universal behavior and enables it in different products, according to Nguyen. Conversational interfaces are great extensions to existing products, he says. "It's probably, as far as I can think of, the most natural way to interact with something." The smart home market is young, but it's growing rapidly as IoT makes its way into virtually every product that can benefit from some level of connectivity. Smart home device ownership in the United States more than doubled during the last two years, to 26 percent of U.S. broadband households, and companies are expected to sell nearly 55 million smart home devices in 2020, according to new research from Parks Associates. Amazon grabbed momentum away from Apple and other players in the space and pushed Alexa to a leading position in the U.S. market, according to Brett Sappington, senior director of research at Parks Associates. "With each new partner, the barrier for others to bump Amazon becomes more difficult … to overcome," he says. However, some deep pocketed competitors, including Apple, Google, Microsoft and Baidu, have a real opportunity to recapture momentum, Sappington says. "Amazon has a good lead in everything around us, but Google and Apple are literally in your pocket," Nguyen says. "The challenge (for Amazon) is still not being on a mobile device." Amazon has momentum but lacks market share Amazon has gained quite a bit of momentum in terms of mindshare, but Apple's Siri and Google's various assistants are in far more devices today, according to Jan Dawson, chief analyst and founder of Jackdaw Research. Siri and Google Assistant are "merely features of devices that do many other things," he says. "Alexa, on the other hand, is the only feature on Echo and the other devices that support it, and so voice is the only thing people really think about there." "The challenge for Amazon in circumventing the operating systems is that it's basically impossible to supplant Siri as the default assistant on iOS, and it will be hard to gain much traction on Android devices too," Dawson says. "So although Alexa can be an assistant on smartphones, it's unlikely to be the assistant on the vast majority of those devices." [ Related: 2017 will be big year for AI thanks to tech giants ] Smartphones are the key component to primary assistants, he says. "An assistant is only really useful over the long term if you can use it everywhere, and that's the big advantage that Google and Apple have today." Dawson is also concerned about how well Alexa will perform on smaller gadgets that don't have the hardware benefits of large, dedicated devices. Alexa may only be as good as the hardware that houses it, which makes it more likely to underperform compared to Siri or Google, he says. Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, says he doesn't believe Amazon will hold the lead if Apple, Microsoft and Google respond across platforms. "Amazon has been most successful because they targeted where the competition wasn't," he says. "Google and Apple are focused on mobile devices, Microsoft on PCs and smartphones, and that left speakers, TVs, vacuum cleaners and other miscellaneous devices for Amazon." Consumers largely gravitate to the defaults on their devices, so once Apple, Google and Microsoft realize the cross-platform and wider home-automation capabilities of their OSes, the respective default agents will likely win, Moorhead says. "A challenge for all voice assistants is that connected devices are, for the most part, siloed, making interoperability of devices and apps a challenge," says Sappington of Parks Associates. "For example, asking Alexa (or Siri or Microsoft's Cortana or Google Assistant) to play 'House of Cards' for you requires the voice assistant to have access to and control of both your television and your Netflix app. Getting it all to work together will be no small task."

Tech News | 09 Jan 2017 | Print  | Comment (7) CES 2017: From Laundry to Play-Doh at Showstoppers by Jeff Porten My final media-only stop at CES 2017 is Showstoppers, the last of the exhibition halls where exhibitors have anted up more cash and we members of the press are fed and watered. But for you, dear readers, it’s all for a good cause, since Showstoppers featured some fascinating products. From here on in, I’ll be slogging through miles of corridors with 100,000 others, stopping frequently when the crowds need to gawk at something shiny. We’ll see if those stops will bear fruit or merely slow me down in my quest to find more neat gadgets for you; most of the time, crowds gather for innovations in exhibitor booth technology rather than what’s actually being demoed. Foldimate -- CES is famous for bizarre Jetsons technology. This year we have a laundry-folding robot: the Foldimate. Like the best Jetsons technology, it isn’t slated to ship for over a year (late 2018), it’s the size of the dryer, and it will cost between $700 and $850. And you can’t just dump a load of laundry on top and have it come out folded; instead, you put each item into a rack, and then the Foldimate can handle it. You have to really hate folding laundry to buy one of these. For the rest of us, just check out this guy’s video. eBlocker -- If you’ve gotten your head around the idea of blocking Web ads in your Mac or iPhone browser, how about doing it automatically for your entire home network? That’s the premise behind eBlocker, a Wi-Fi device that, when deployed on your network, employs deep voodoo to block ads and trackers for every other device there, without reconfiguring your base router. I know something about networking, and I have no idea how it accomplishes this feat. It’s priced at $219 for the currently available eBlocker Pro version, with a $59-per-year subscription after the first year to keep its database of sites to filter up-to-date. If you want more control, eBlocker Family will let you create 10 different profiles of sites to allow and block for the various individuals on your network — due in February 2017, it will retail for $249 and cost $99 per year for the subscription. Coros Linx Bone Conduction Bike Helmet -- Riding a bike with your earbuds in so you can’t hear overtaking vehicles qualifies as one of the stupider things you can do. Coros has a solution with the Bluetooth-enabled Linx helmet that leaves your ears clear and communicates sound to you through your jawbone. A microphone allows for a phone conversation and is shielded from the wind by being placed near your forehead. Finally, you can control your phone with a remote you can mount on your handlebars. It’s available now for $200, and my editors tell me that the fact that it got a positive review from DC Rainmaker means that it’s pretty good. Cherry MX Board Silent -- There’s a type of keyboard connoisseur who despises the keys in the new MacBooks and misses the touch feel of the Apple Extended Keyboard. Cherry has been making keyboards for these people for a while, but those clacky keys make a lot of noise. For folks who don’t want to become the pariah of their offices, Cherry has introduced the MX Board Silent, which takes away the noise. It will be available later this month for $149. Cherry’s Web site says it’s available only in an “international EU configuration,” but aside from the € symbol added to the 5 key (in addition to the %), I can’t tell the difference from a U.S. layout. Glide CMRA Band for the Apple Watch -- The Apple Watch may have finally brought us Dick Tracy’s two-way wrist radio, but this is the 21st century… what about video calls? That’s one of the features of Glide’s CMRA, which replaces an Apple Watch band with one that has both a front-facing and forward-facing camera. Glide has released a software development kit for these cameras, so additional functionality can be built into other video apps, alongside what the CMRA’s own software can do. The charging stand does double duty, charging both the CMRA band and the Apple Watch. It’s due in “Spring” for $249, but you can pre-order for $169 until 9 January 2017. Cameras on Your Glasses: PogoCam and SunnyCam -- If lifting your wrist seems like too much effort, how about a camera that attaches to your eyeglasses? PogoTec’s PogoCam connects magnetically to the earpiece of special prescription glasses or sunglasses; PogoTec is working with several manufacturers to make lines of eyewear that can hold the PogoCam but look stylish regardless. Don’t expect to film all day; PogoCam’s capacity is 100 photos or 2 minutes of 720p video. It’s due in Spring 2017 for $149. For athletes, 2 minutes of video is nothing, so check out SunnyCam’s Activ, Sport, and Xtreme sunglasses, which embed a video camera in the nosepiece of well-designed sunglasses. They can record over 11 hours of video, albeit with recharging, since they can only record for 1 hour at a time. SunnyCam’s glasses range from £120 to £150 and are available now, at least in the UK. ZVOX Accuvoice -- I often watch TV with closed captions turned on because a fair amount of the time I can’t make out what’s being said well enough. If you’re in the same boat, you might want to try a ZVOX AccuVoice, a speaker bar for your TV that uses hearing aid technology to enhance the frequencies of dialog, so they can be heard clearly even when the overall volume is set low. It’s available now for $250. Yubico YubiKey 4, 4 Nano, and 4C -- Two-factor authentication is becoming an increasingly necessary method of ensuring your accounts can’t be compromised with a cracked or guessed password. (If you’re unclear on what two-factor authentication is, Joe Kissell explains it well in “Take Control of Your Passwords.”) Yubico’s 🎁 various YubiKey USB products store cryptographic keys that can be used as one of your two factors, after some setup with the various services you use. In general, use of a YubiKey changes an account from “anyone with a password can use it” to “only people who have approved keys can log in.” YubiKey seems to have done everything it could to make two-factor authentication as easy as possible, but that’s still nowhere near simple. I’ve spent twenty minutes reading the YubiKey documentation trying to summarize the service, and even though I understand the concepts, I don’t feel like I grasp the company’s implementation, and I wouldn’t recommend its products to someone who didn’t have some technical knowledge. Beyond that, there’s avoiding the “losing your factor” problem (see Glenn Fleishman’s “Dancing the Two-Step: Coping with the Loss of a Second Factor,” 28 August 2013), and the short answer appears to be this: You don’t buy one YubiKey, you buy two or three and hide the extras safely. YubiKey’s USB options are the stick-like 4 ($40), the tiny 4 Nano ($50) which seats nearly flush and is designed to be left in the port, and the upcoming 4C ($50) for USB-C ports (due in February 2017). One important limitation to keep in mind is that for Web logins, YubiKey doesn’t support Safari. Stern Pinball -- When I was a kid, I knew that when I grew up, I’d have a basement filled with classic pinball machines (and not knowing that owners had free-play buttons, I also envisioned a large bucket of quarters). Now it’s 2017, and I’m just glad that Stern is still making the darn things after the rest of the industry collapsed. If you want to live up to my childhood dreams, there’s the new Batman ’66 game available starting at $8599, but for less expensive and more mobile pinball play, try the free Stern Pinball Arcade for iOS (it’s also available for other platforms, like PlayStation 4), which features two free playtables a month, and lets you get about a dozen others as in-app purchases. Seed-Up Moore “Infinite” USB Stick -- Seed-Up pitches an impossibility: a USB flash drive with an “infinite” amount of storage, even when it’s offline. In fact, the Moore stick is a 64 GB USB flash drive with onboard AI tasked with figuring out what you’re going to need and when. In theory, it uploads anything you’re not using to Backblaze storage and downloads anything you’re going to need. It currently works with Macs, and Seed-Up plans to release an iOS app as well because the hardware already works with the USB-to-Lightning adapters the company has tested. It’s due in July 2017 for between $40 and $70, which includes a six-month subscription to unlimited Backblaze storage, with pricing of “less than $9” per month after that. Obviously, how well it works will depend on the quality of that AI. I’m curious to know if I’ll see “∞ GB available” in the Finder. GeniCan -- I would have thought that a smart trashcan that helps you buy more of things you’ve used up would be as silly as a laundry-folding robot, but GeniCan’s demo (watch it on their site) impressed me out of my jaded predispositions. GeniCan is a barcode scanner that clamps to the side of a standard trash can, and you use it to scan packages as you’re tossing them in the garbage or recycling — it automatically adds the scanned product to your shopping list. If there’s no barcode to scan, GeniCan asks you what you’re throwing out and uses voice recognition to add it to your list. So, if you’ve just finished a roll of paper towels, just hold the cardboard tube in front of the scanner and say “paper towels.” Items you scan get added to a shopping list app that runs on iOS or Android devices, and you can optionally set them for automatic ordering from Amazon. It will ship in March 2017 for $149; you can save $25 by pre-ordering. Play-Doh Touch Shape to Life Studio -- This product is not new, having been in some Apple Stores for two months already, but I was astounded by Play-Doh’s Touch Shape to Life Studio, which is functionally a 3D scanner designed for a 5-year-old. Mold a Play-Doh creature and put it on the studio pad, take a picture of it with an iPad, and the thing comes to life in a 3D environment on the iPad, where it cavorts with the other creatures you’ve already scanned. Considering the dozens of 3D scanners I’ve seen that require an engineering degree to comprehend, I was blown away by the ease of use. It’s only $40 at a retail Apple Store or from Apple’s Web site.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

I didn't even know bone conducting headphones are available but there are several on Amazon. I could use them biking, walking, driving, and where I have to hear what people say. Reply gastropod  2017-01-09 19:11 eBlocker sounds like a box running privoxy or similar, though the mostly automated setup is weird. The price seems steep, but if the filters are well done, and iff it's properly secure, it might be worth it for the lack of linuxy hassle. Unfortunately, it only protects browsing. "Nevertheless, our eBlocker is no “magic pill” for privacy that works under all circumstances. Apps in particular which are installed in your device/OS natively, represent an increased risk for your privacy. Therefore we recommend to not use any apps at all if possible." If they'd do the same thing with a gateway router running something like pfsense, they could protect everything and I'd be putting my order in (pfsense is ugly). That Play-Doh thing, though, looks great--I'm going to have to get one, even though I have no sculpting skills whatever. Reply gastropod  2017-01-09 23:09 I was wrong about privoxy. I've been catching up on RSS feeds, and coincidentally found a link to Pi-hole, which looks more like what eBlocker does and explains why it almost self-configures. Haven't dug into it, but it appears to become the default DNS server, tailored to deep-six domain names from ad/tracking sites. Sort of like a network wide hosts file blocker. Runs on any linux, even raspberry pi, so in principle you could do it quite cheaply. But it does look like eBlocker adds a better interface and maybe a few more features (like IP spoofing). https://pi-hole.net Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-01-10 13:21 eBlocker is not just custom DNS because IP-Anonymization is a part of what it does. The manual talks about it taking over as the DHCP server, I don't know how it could do that automatically, I assume it's through UPnP. https://www.eblocker.com/en/products-eblocker/ Reply gastropod  2017-01-10 17:17 Which is what I said. I have mixed feelings about the IP spoofing, which is the likely way that their IP anonymization works. IP spoofing is useful for the honest, but it's enabled such a lot of illegal activity that I'm firmly on the side of ISPs being required to block spoofed IPs. I guess they could be including a VPN service, which would make the yearly fee more worth while--iff they're using a trustworthy service. But if they had VPN I'd think they'd want to brag about it. UPnP seems likely. They do have a short note about how to set up manually if automatic doesn't work. A border router with something like pfsense connected via a good VPN service is better protection for a similar cost. Except for the having to manage it yourself part, which most people wouldn't want to do even if it was reasonably easy. Heck, I don't even want to do it myself. Reply Jeff Porten   2017-01-10 18:37 I'm enjoying this thread. All I know is that it employs a deeper level of network voodoo than I understand. Reply Jesse the K  2017-01-10 09:58 I've been delighted with the intelligibility of dialog from my ZVOX 350 sound bar, which has the Accuvoice tech as well. (Sound engineers intentionally mix music & SFX as loud as dialog to make programs "more exciting.")

 Why iPhones are much better for emojis than Android Kif Leswing Jan. 12, 2017, 9:30 AM 5,211 facebook linkedin twitter email print All the new emojis that most Android users can't see Apple Emojis are a universal language. People around the world who speak hundreds of different languages send the little pictograms when words won't do.  But there are some emojis that get lost in translation, especially between iPhone and Android users.  One example: the latest batch of emojis, including critical icons like the avocado, fingers crossing, and the shrugging person, were added to iPhones in late 2016 thanks to a series of software updates. But currently, less than 4% of Android users can see them, according to analysis done by Jeremy Burge at Emojipedia.  And when an iPhone user sends them to most Android users, they see blank boxes instead of colorful emojis. The reason why there's an emoji gap between iPhone users and Android users is because Apple is great at getting its users to upgrade to the latest version of its software.  Unicode, the organization that approves new emojis, has been creating new emoji on an annual basis recently. Google and Apple rapidly integrate the new emojis into their software, but Apple users actually download the new software, giving them the new emojis. Android vendors, like Samsung or LG, aren't as quick as Apple is to upgrade to the latest version of Android. In fact, according to Google's own statistics, less than 1% of Android devices are running version 7.0 or higher — the version with the new avocado emoji.  Compare that to Apple, which has 84% of its users using iOS 10 or higher. The vast majority of iPhone users are seeing the new emojis.  It's gotten so bad that some popular Android apps, like WhatsApp, are hardcoding in emoji support into their apps, instead of simply using the built-in operating system support. Burge says this approach "requires more effort from app developers" because "native emoji support is much simpler to support." One of the newest emojis — "Singer" Apple Another side effect is that it means that Apple's own emoji designs are spilling out into Android apps. For example, WhatsApp uses Apple's emoji symbols — not Google's.  There are Android phones that get regular updates, most notably, Google's own Pixel, which will get the latest Android update as soon as possible for at least a few years. But right now, most of the more popular Android phones, such as Samsung's, don't have that same promise.  Which means, at least for heavy emoji users, Apple and Google are the phonemakers of choice. "The answer for users is very clear: if you care about new emoji support, be careful which phone you purchase," Burge writes.  "A phone that can't see the 12+ months of new emojis is crippled as a communication device."

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's Future Headset to work with Gaming Overlays, Take Commands via Siri & use Haptics for Experiences | Main | Amazon's Bezos who met with President-Elect Trump last Month Announced 100,000 new U.S. Jobs on the way » January 12, 2017 Original Movies and TV Series could be coming to Apple TV Subscription Service Later this Year Back in August 2015 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Reportedly Looking to Create Original Netflix-Like Programming for Apple TV." In that report we noted that Apple was actually considering a direct run a Netflix and Amazon Prime by creating their own original content for Apple TV. Many in the Apple community had wondered for years why Apple wasn't trying to create original content or buy a studio to beef up Apple TV. Well it looks like Apple may take a bite out of the competition in the not-too-distant future." Well today we learn this is exactly what might be in the works.   According to the Wall Street Journal, "Apple Inc. is planning to build a significant new business in original television shows and movies, according to people familiar with the matter, a move that could make it a bigger player in Hollywood and offset slowing sales of iPhones and iPads.   The shows that Apple is considering would likely be comparable to critically acclaimed programs like "Westworld" on Time Warner Inc.'s HBO or "Stranger Things" on Netflix.   These people said the programming would be available to subscribers of Apple's $10-a-month streaming-music service, which has struggled to catch up to the larger Spotify. Apple Music already includes a limited number of documentary-style segments on musicians, but nothing like the premium programming it is now seeking.   The technology giant has been in talks with veteran producers in recent months about buying rights to scripted television programs. It also has approached experienced marketing executives at studios and networks to discuss hiring them to promote its content, said people with knowledge of the discussions.   In addition to TV, Apple indicated to these people that it is considering offering original movies, though those plans are more preliminary.   Executives at Apple have told people in Hollywood they hope to start offering original scripted content by the end of 2017.   Nonetheless, the entry of the world's most valuable company into original television and films could be a transformative moment for Hollywood and mark a significant turn in strategy for Apple as it starts to become more of a media company, rather than just a distributor of other companies' media. For more on this, read the full Wall Street Journal report here.   Last April we posted a report titled "With Amazon set to take Netflix Head-On, is Apple Far Behind?" We noted in that report that Amazon began blurring the line with their Amazon Prime TV content with Prime Music and it seemed to be a red flag for Apple to respond to.   It now appears that this could be the business model that Apple could be preparing. While I have no interest in a subscription to Apple Music, I would be willing to dish out a few bucks a month if Apple Music were to offer a steady stream of quality TV and original movie programming – and I don't think I'm alone on that one.   Apple has an advantage in the market and they should use it to keep their current fan base happy while winning over a new base of customers who are hungry for Mobile TV.   Lastly, here are a few of Apple's Latest Apple TV patents on record:   Apple Invents a FaceTime Virtual Noticeboard Application for Apple TV with Built-In Camera A New Granted Patent Covers Apple TV Extending Siri's Services to Include Live TV & Sporting Events Apple's Siri to Control Apple TV, Stereo Speakers working with Apple's Streaming Music Service Apple Patent Shows that Real TV Channel Listing App for Siri is coming to Apple TV the Set-Top-Box and beyond New Apple TV Inventions show Possible Future Features such as Broadcast TV & Presence Technology   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.
