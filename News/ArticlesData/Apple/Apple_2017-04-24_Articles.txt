(Photo: Reuters) New York: Cautioning against protectionism, RBI Governor Urjit Patel has said where giant American would corporations like Apple, Cisco and IBM be if they had not sourced the best products and talent from across the world. "I don't think that we have heard the last word on US policy talk about this because there is a push back internationally that the world has benefited from an open trading system," the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor said after delivering a lecture. He made the remarks in response to a question on the rise of protectionist tendencies in major world economies after he delivered the Third Kotak Family Distinguished Lecture, sponsored by the Raj Center on Indian Economic Policies at the Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. He said the share prices of the most efficient corporations in the world, including in the US, are where they are because of the global supply chains. "Where would Apple be, where would Cisco be, where would IBM be if they were not sourcing the best products and talent from across the world. And if policies come in the way of that, then the big wealth creators in a country that advocates protectionism are ultimately affected," he said yesterday. Patel said the calls for protectionism in the US were on account of equity and domestic distribution issues which"textbook economics tells us should be addressed through domestic fiscal policy" such as taxation and income transfers. He noted that using trade instruments for protectionism may take a nation on a trajectory different from that of growth. "Using trade instruments like customs duties, border tax etc is not the most efficient way to do this. In fact you could end up at somewhere else. You do not know what are the implications of some of these policies on equity and distribution besides objectives that you want to address," he said. "It should be a domestic policy issue, using domestic fiscal policy if those are the objectives that need to be addressed," Patel said. Talking about the Indian Rupee, the RBI governor said it was totally market determined and the intervention by the central bank was only to mitigate volatility. "I think that is a fair policy for us to follow going forward," he said. Asked about the autonomy of the RBI, he said, "We have been imbued with a legislative responsibility of flexible inflation targeting framework only means that that is a plus for the autonomy and independence of the central bank." On financial inclusion, he said the most important step that was taken was when every Indian household was given a bank account. He said it was now up to a variety of players including the Non Banking Financial Companies to use that opportunity. "I think the government should not use its fiscal resources for that. It has used its ownership of the public sector banks to open up these accounts and I think that's a large subsidy," he said. Asked if the federal compromise reached to implement the GST would structurally weaken the tax reform and not reach the potential growth opportunities projected, Patel said the manner in which the GST has been structured as cooperation between the central and the state government was a "great example of fiscal federalism" and that strengthens the GST as a policy. Patel was also questioned about the troubles and difficulties faced by non-resident Indians in exchanging the old currency notes following demonetisation. He said it was decided by the government and the RBI that at some point "there has to be an end to the demonetization exercise." "Every country that has done this has followed a certain course and so have we," he said. Patel said under Foreign Exchange Management Act regulations people were only allowed to take Rs 25,000 abroad and people were given enough time post-demonetisation. "We needed to draw a line at some point. I think it hasbeen a fairly generous time," he said. On loan waivers, he said such measures do impact the credit culture. "The honest borrower and the taxpayer pays for this, we need to be very careful with this. There are other micro implications if this amount becomes large, they impact the fiscal situations of the state governments and ultimately could lead to some national balance sheet implications," Patel said. He also said that China's exchange rate policy has become more market determined.

By Andrew Bary Biography Updated March 23, 2009 11:59 p.m. ET FRANKLY, WE HAD SOME concerns about drawing up our annual list of the 30 Most Respected CEOs. In a year of devastating losses, plunging stock prices and endless scandal, could we really find 30 CEOs worthy of great respect? To our surprise, there were actually many more -- leaders who are not only weathering the tumult relatively unscathed but positioning their companies to thrive when conditions finally improve. A group of Barron's editors winnowed the field to 30, after speaking with investors, analysts, executives and others. Strong financial controls, client focus and innovation have been keys to survival. Randy Jones for Barron's The final list is made up of chief executive officers from around the world who are doing outstanding jobs of keeping their companies out of trouble and on course. That means conservative financial management, a strong focus on the customer and relentless innovation. The roster includes no fewer than 12 new names. Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, for instance, has transformed his company from an online bookseller to one of the world's top retailers, with a true hot product in its Kindle wireless e-book reader. Under Jim Skinner, McDonald's started growing again as the company capitalized on healthier foods like salads, while not ignoring its core customers who crave Big Macs. In financial services, few leaders stand taller than JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, who has avoided major mishaps and become the go-to guy for regulators looking to unload crippled companies like Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. Of course, adding a dozen names meant kicking a dozen off. They included Kenneth Chenault of American Express (now mired in credit-quality problems), Lew Frankfort of Coach (groping to find his way in the collapsed luxury market) and Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric (sitting on pile of potentially troubled real-estate investments). The list includes 12 executives from outside the U.S. -- from a supermarket baron in England to an electronic-games whiz from Japan. But for all its surprises, the list also includes some old standbys, corporate luminaries who were just were just bound to be there. Like Warren Buffett. Despite a 50% drop in the stock market from its 2007 peak, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway brka 1.4503396364971544% Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Cl B U.S.: NYSE USD165.78 2.37 1.4503396364971544% /Date(1493067696494-0500)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 3872503 AFTER HOURS USD165.78 % Volume (Delayed 15m) : 262971 P/E Ratio 16.979914578062743 Market Cap 403435830888.86 Dividend Yield N/A Rev. per Employee 606296 More quote details and news » brka in Your Value Your Change Short position remains a financial Fort Knox, with a cash hoard of $24 billion. TOP 30 CEOS: B-D | F-J | L-Ma | M-Sc | S | T-W THIS RANKING ISN'T BASED on any statistical formula. Barron's has an investment focus, and we pay close attention to how stocks perform during a CEO's tenure. It shouldn't be surprising, then, that most of the 30 stocks have beaten the Standard & Poor's 500 index during the CEO's tenure. In the year ended Feb. 27, the average performance of the stocks has been a loss of 31.8% -- not good, but significantly better than the S&P 500, which was off 44.8%. To make the grade, CEOs need to have been on the job for at least three years, and we prefer those with at least five years of experience. It takes time to affect corporate cultures and establish a reputation in the investment community. While the stock prices of these companies often shine, most of the CEOs in our Hall of Fame aren't obsessed with creating "shareholder value." That mantra, which was embraced by a broad swath of Corporate America, often involved acquisitions or financial gimmicks like massive share repurchases that left companies burdened with debt and ill-prepared to deal with the business and financial challenges of the past year. Barron's Andrew Bary talks about the world's top 30 CEOs, including leaders from some familiar names: Berkshire Hathaway, JP Morgan, FedEx. Costco Wholesale COST 0.9135093986063126% Costco Wholesale Corp. U.S.: Nasdaq USD172.33 1.56 0.9135093986063126% /Date(1493067600301-0500)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 1854431 AFTER HOURS USD172.33 % Volume (Delayed 15m) : 52472 P/E Ratio 31.79520295202952 Market Cap 74957958071.3422 Dividend Yield 1.0445076307085244% Rev. per Employee 555936 More quote details and news » COST in Your Value Your Change Short position CEO Jim Sinegal is a prime illustration. Sinegal is proud that his stock has consistently maintained one of the highest price/earnings ratios in the retailing industry. Yet Costco is no slave to Wall Street. Sinegal's view is that if a company treats employees fairly and provides good value to customers, shareholders will benefit in the long run. When commodity prices started to decline in the fall, Costco moved to cut prices, even before its suppliers did. A popular item like rotisserie chickens, for instance, dropped by $1, to $4.99 -- and Costco sells a million of them each week in its 400 domestic stores. "It's easy to raise prices," Sinegal said last week. "It benefits you today, but will hurt you tomorrow" by alienating customers. Costco refuses to mark up the price of any product by more than 15%. THE BEST CEOS HAVE A passion for the job, and many of those on our list have been at it for a long time. The 73-year-old Sinegal, a Costco co-founder, says he "loves coming to work," despite a grueling travel schedule that takes him to nearly all of the 400 domestic stores once a year. Buffett has famously said that he "tap dances" to work every day. Apple aapl 0.9629577563787165% Apple Inc.

While Jobs has been rightly criticized for being evasive about his health problems in the past year, he remains one of the most valuable CEOs on the planet. Apple comes up with a steady stream of innovative tech products, including, most recently, an iPod the size of a paper clip. The company has managed to create a cachet around a commodity product, the personal computer: Buyers pay as much as twice the price for a Macintosh relative to comparable PCs, which Apple mercilessly mocks in its clever TV ads. No wonder that Apple's market value of $90 billion is more than four times that of Dell's, which used to dominate Apple. One test of a great CEO is whether Wall Street greets a departure with displeasure or relief. Jobs is the ultimate CEO on that score. Apple shares probably will fall if he's unable to resume an active role as CEO in the summer, after his health-related leave of absence.

CEO Larry Fink is viewed as one of the smartest and most capable executives in the field, and there is periodically speculation that he will leave to head a larger company. Fink was under consideration to succeed Stan O'Neal at Merrill Lynch in 2007 -- and luckily for him, he didn't get the job. The buzz on 56-year-old Fink is that while he loves BlackRock, a firm that he helped found 20 years ago, he may want the challenge and recognition that comes with a higher-profile position. If Fink wants to leave, there certainly are plenty of turnaround situations awaiting him in financial services. OUR LIST DOES COME WITH a caveat: Inclusion is no guarantee of continued success. The biggest embarrassment from the 2008 list was Fred Goodwin, the former CEO of Royal Bank of Scotland. The bank, once one of the largest in the world, has effectively been nationalized by the U.K. government after loan problems and a disastrous deal to buy ABN Amro. Known as Fred the Shred because of his cost-cutting zeal after the bank's many acquisitions, Goodwin has been shredded in the British media, and he got shown the door by his new boss -- an unhappy British government. Some of this year's CEOs may be risky bets, too. Consider Lakshmi Mittal of ArcelorMittal, the world's leading steel company. Mittal is a controversial choice because of the company's heavy debt after a series of acquisitions, but we are betting that Mittal can handle it. Not everyone is going to agree with our choices. We're bound to make some mistakes, and we welcome feedback. Let us know which CEOs we should add, drop or retain. For potential additions, we generally prefer larger companies with market values of at least a few billion dollars. Please e-mail your suggestions to editors@barrons.com.

By Nandini Yadav | Published: April 25, 2017 9:44 AM IST Email @NandiniYadav08 comments Tags: Apple uber News Travis Kalanick and his ride-hailing business Uber recently added another star to their book of defamation. Uber is said to have been tracking individual iPhones even when the app on those devices were removed. Taking the privacy breach a step ahead, Uber apparently geofenced Apple headquarters in Cupertino, changing its code so that it would be hidden from Apple employees. However, despite that, Apple found out about the practice, which earned Kalanick a threat from Apple CEO Tim Cook to remove Uber from the App Store. Now, Uber is pushing back the allegations saying that the tracking is a common industry practice used to prevent fraud and account compromise. Uber said in an statement sent to BGR India, “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app. As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users’ accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users.” Further, according to TechCrunch, Uber said that it still uses a form of device fingerprinting in order to detect fraudulent behavior. ‘If a device has been associated with fraud in the past, a new sign-up from that device should raise a red flag. Uber suggested that the practice of fingerprinting was modified to comply with Apple’s rules rather than discontinued altogether.’ RELATED: Uber tried to deceive Apple; Tim Cook threatened to remove app from App Store: Report In addition to that, the publication quotes an analysis by Will Strafach, president of Sudo Security Group, on a version of Uber’s app from late 2014. The analysis revealed a code that showed how Uber tracked its users’ devices. “They were dynamically loading IOKit.framework (a private framework), then dynamically loading some symbols from it to iterate through the device registry (also very much forbidden). They have code to nab a few things from the registry, but the only persistent identifier they actually use appears to be the device Serial Number,” Strafach noted. ALSO READ: Uber CEO orders ‘urgent’ probe after ex-employee alleges sexual harassment, gender bias at company “I believe that in iOS 9 and beyond, this is blocked by the iOS sandbox. Just to clarify, this also shows the initial concern of ‘tracking after uninstall’ was bad phrasing. The case here is tracking between uninstall/reinstall, which is still a privacy violation as Apple forbids this kind of tracking (that is why they removed the APIs for getting device UDID),” Strafach further added. ALSO READ: Waymo-Uber lawsuit: Ex-Google employees accused of stealing files for self-driving car technology Uber had been using a small piece of code, a practice called “fingerprinting,” which allowed the company to identify an iPhone and prevent itself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its contents. However, fingerprinting iPhones was a big violation in Apple’s rule book. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no trace of the owner’s identity remained on the device. Uber was however making the iPhone still trackable. ALSO READ: Snapchat to Amazon India: A timeline of companies landing in a soup for being ‘anti-India’ Published: April 25, 2017 9:44 AM IST | Updated: April 25, 2017 9:44 AM IST Mashable Tech The Galaxy S8 blew up Samsung's record for pre-orders Should we be worried about the future of the U.S. Digital Service?

With Samsung Galaxy S8 finally out, the focus now shifts to other upcoming flagships for this year. And you wouldn’t deny that probably the most rumoured device of the entire year is the next iPhone. This year being the 10th Anniversary of iPhone, Apple is planning something really interesting. After a plethora of rumours, a famous tipster named ‘Benjamin Geskin’ has now leaked a bunch of images which does shy off quite a bit of previous rumours.   The images show a glass back along with a vertical dual-camera setup. The volume rockers along with the quick silent toggle are on the left while the power button is on the right. The device seems to have a metal frame running through the sides with a glossy polish on it. Interestingly, there is no Home Button on the front as well as on the back, which is opposite to what recent rumours had to say. Also, the power button on the right looks to be a little too elongated which is where the possibility of Apple putting a fingerprint scanner there might arise. Otherwise, it will be really fascinating if Apple manages to put it on the display.   We cannot comment on the front bezels, as the display is switched off but given there is no Home Button on the front, we expect it to be fairly bezel-less. Also, at the front, it appears to be a 2.5D curved glass over the display which also contradicts the rumours of the upcoming iPhone sporting a curved OLED display. On the other hand, the device does look to be similar to the original iPhone from 2007, in terms of the design.   Recollecting some previous rumours, Apple is said to launch three new iPhones this year. The 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone (probably iPhone 7s and 7s Plus) devices will be up much before, probably in September. Further, as per Brian White (analyst), the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will be available for pre-orders along with the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone devices, however, the availability of the 5.8-inch variant is likely to happen sometime in October-November.   Further, the US-based multinational is said to be working on a 3D front facing the camera to boost up Augmented Reality in future iPhones. Apple is also expected to bring wireless charging to the iPhone platform as well.

However, new reports that have surfaced hint that the iPhone 8 will be in short supply for the initial months and that it may not come to market until October, or even November. Ming-Chi Kuo, a KGI Securities analyst dubbed foremost expert on Apple, has told website 9to5Mac that the production of the iPhone 8 will only start in October or November. Kia says that the delay is because iPhone 8 will have some new components and that Apple is still figuring the supply chain for these components. Also Read: Apple iPhone 8 may come with AR features, smart glasses Earlier reports have hinted that the iPhone 8 will come in three variants. Of these three phones, the two will be the successor to the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, with the big screen in the Plus version being the major differentiator. Along with these two, there will be another version that will be called the iPhone 8 Anniversary Edition, and it will mark the 10 years of the iPhone. This version will have a more slicker design, with glass and metal frame. The iPhone 8 is also expected to use an AMOLED Panel and will possibly do away with the home button. To ensure that users still get the functionality of the fingerprint scanner, the iPhone 8 is expected to sport one on the rear cover. Another big change likely in the iPhone 8 compared to the existing iPhones that all variants are expected to come with dual cameras. Also Read: iPhone 6 for Rs 25,660, iPhone 5S for Rs 17,499 as Flipkart kicks off Apple Days sale The information from Kuo comes days after a report in Bloomberg noted that the iPhone 8 would be delayed by one or two months. This year, the iPhone 8 will be competing with the likes of the Galaxy S8 that has been already launched in India. The iPhone 8 will also compete with the phones like the Galaxy Note 8, supposed to launch around August and September, and OnePlus 5 that will come in the next two to three months.

By Mark Gurman. Added by Agency Staff on 25 April 2017. Saved under Top, World Tags: Apple, Jeff Norris, Microsoft, Mike Rockwell, Nasa, Tim Cook Tweet Tim Cook Apple has gone to space to find additional talent for its augmented reality efforts. The iPhone maker has hired Jeff Norris, a specialist in the new technology from Nasa, to help build future products, according to people familiar with the matter. Norris founded the Mission Operations Innovation Office of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Lab, where he led efforts to create new ways to control spacecraft and robots in space with virtual and augmented reality, according to his website. Norris joined Apple earlier this year as a senior manager on the company’s augmented reality team run by former Dolby Labs executive Mike Rockwell, the people said.  They asked not to be identified talking about the company’s private hiring moves. Rockwell’s team is working on a pair of AR glasses and related features for future versions of the iPhone, people familiar with those plans said in March. Representatives of Apple and Nasa’s JPL declined to comment. Norris didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Norris’s Nasa projects included issuing headsets to scientists on the ground so they could experience live views on Mars and providing Microsoft HoloLens headsets to astronauts living in the International Space Station. He joined Nasa in 1999 and helped create software for controlling Mars exploration rovers from the ground. Below is a video of Norris’s Project Sidekick on the Space Station. No technology has fired up Apple CEO Tim Cook quite like augmented reality, which overlays images, videos, games and other digital content on a person’s view of the real world. Cook has likened AR’s potential to that of the smartphone, predicting at a conference last year that people will “have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you.” Apple hopes to bring AR-related hardware to market as soon as 2018. Norris — along with other AR team hires from the movie industry, Facebook’s Oculus and Microsoft — will be working to bring that vision to reality.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 15DSL dead within five years: Vox CEO 7Gigaba aide calls for nationalisation 6Biometric bank cards coming to SA 3‘Rot has set in’: Ramaphosa 3Commission won’t prosecute Vodacom, MTN Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media
Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews iPhone iPhone 8 Production Gets Delayed; Official Release Pushed to 2018 Instead By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on April 25, 2017 12:24 PM Apple is probably in a panic mode right now as there have been numerous reports of the iPhone 8 production hitting roadblock after roadblock. Now, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has put in his two cents on what exactly is happening within Apple. In a report by 9to5Mac, Kuo says that Apple might not start the mass production of the iPhone 8 until much later. The original plan, according to the analyst, was to start mass production of the phone around August or September. Now, it would seem that this might get pushed sometime in October or November due to various reasons. iPhone 8 delays One of the reasons why the manufacturing will be delayed is the production difficulties on some of the new components for the said phone. Top of which is the display-embedded TouchID sensor that has been reported to cause its manufacturers much headache. This bit of news only means that Apple is going for the embedded fingerprint sensor instead of the one mounted at the back of the phone. Furthermore, based on Kuo’s pronouncements, it would seem that even the other hardware components of the iPhone 8 are affected by some manufacturing issues. iPhone 8 concept (via idropnews.com) Another reason for the delay is possibly the 10nm production node issues that TSMC has been having for a long time. A few months ago, it was reported that TSMC has been experiencing very low yield on its 10nm process due to some technical difficulties. Since the rumored A11 chip of the iPhone 8 is based on the 10nm process node, it is highly likely that its yield is also affected by the issue. iPhone 8 release date Because of the delay, Apple will not be able to launch the iPhone 8 anytime this year. Perhaps it could still push for a December limited release. However, this is less likely to happen as Apple would not want to release the device half-baked. Evidently, the supposed release date is now sometime in the early months of 2018. Nevertheless, consumers can still look forward to the iPhone 7 upgrades sometime in September. Impacts of iPhone 8 delay on Apple The iPhone 8 delay can impact Apple in more ways than one. Top of which is it might lose a lot of opportunity to get ahead of the competition especially on the Android market. From now until the end of the year, there are a number of Android phone makers who will be releasing their respective flagship products. Furthermore, its arch-rival, Samsung, is scheduled to release another flagship phone sometime between September and October this year. Samsung will definitely use Apple’s predicament to its advantage to peddle the upcoming Galaxy Note 8. Another possible repercussion is Apple might lose customers as they start to get impatient about the iPhone 8. The delay would be enough for them to make a switch especially when Samsung also offers premium phones that are within the iPhone’ price range. iPhone 8 specs Based on the new report, it would seem that Apple has chosen to employ an embedded fingerprint scanner on the iPhone 8. Perhaps it deemed it impractical to put the TouchID sensor at the back of the phone. Alleged iPhone 8 dummy by Benjamin Geskin In terms of external design, there are rumours flying around about the alleged dummy model for the iPhone 8. In the said leak, it can be seen clearly that the phone will have a stainless steel frame sandwiched by two glass panels. The display, or what it seems to be, covers the entire front part of the phone with the absence of the phial button very evident. At the back of the dummy, one can clearly see that the cameras are arranged vertically instead of horizontally. Of course, all of these are mere speculations made by Kuo based on market research. Readers are urged to take this with a grain of salt. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Monday, April 24, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Uber Used Private API to Access iPhone Serial Number Mike Isaac (Hacker News, MacRumors): For months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple’s engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased — a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple’s privacy guidelines. But Apple was onto the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared. “So, I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Mr. Cook said in his calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then demanded, or Uber’s app would be kicked out of Apple’s App Store. Why did they do this? At the time, Uber was dealing with widespread account fraud in places like China, where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that were erased and resold. Some Uber drivers there would then create dozens of fake email addresses to sign up for new Uber rider accounts attached to each phone, and request rides from those phones, which they would then accept. Since Uber was handing out incentives to drivers to take more rides, the drivers could earn more money this way. […] Mr. Kalanick told his engineers to “geofence” Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., a way to digitally identify people reviewing Uber’s software in a specific location. Uber would then obfuscate its code for people within that geofenced area, essentially drawing a digital lasso around those it wanted to keep in the dark. Apple employees at its headquarters were unable to see Uber’s fingerprinting. Some thoughts: If Uber was just transmitting the device serial number (obtained via private API) to their servers, and only using it for this type of fraud prevention, that doesn’t seem very harmful. It’s a far cry from what people were initially speculating about—personal location tracking and messing up the phone’s software in a way that persisted after it was erased. Some sloppy wording in the original version of Isaac’s article has since been revised, so it no longer sounds like Uber hacked anything or that iOS has a major security flaw. I can sympathize with Uber here. They had a business problem with a simple technical solution that was unavailable due to Apple’s rules. What they wanted to do was not really against the spirit of the rules. That is a frustrating situation to be in. But this wasn’t an innocent mistake. Uber knew it was violating the rules—IOKit is definitely private API—and went to great lengths to try to prevent Apple from figuring out what they were doing. Despite the blatant violation and deceit, there was no punishment (that we know of). Uber’s app remained in the App Store the entire time, even though the guidelines say that “If you attempt to cheat the system[…] for example, by trying to trick the review process[…] your apps will be removed from the store and you will be expelled from the Developer Program.” There’s little incentive for any (big) developer to follow the rules if the worst case scenario is that you temporarily gain a competitive advantage, until caught, and then nothing further happens. App Review was not able detect the private API usage, even though the IOKit calls seem to be directly visible in the compiled code. I wonder how well Uber is currently addressing the fraud problem, without access to the serial numbers. It seems like there could be multiple legitimate reasons to want to know whether an app has previously been installed on a given device. Apple likes to talk about how privacy is not at odds with features. Perhaps that could be the case here, too, if iOS had an API to answer this question without the app needing to access or store a device identifier. Apple didn’t say anything publicly, so even though this happened in 2015 (with the offending behavior likely in 2014), customers didn’t find out about it. There definitely seem to be different rules for different developers. Smaller developers get their apps pulled from the store, with an automated e-mail giving a day or week’s notice (or even none). Without proof of wrongdoing, they get slimed in the press and banned from the store even if they write a blog post absolving Apple. But if you’re Uber, you get a one-on-one meeting with Tim Cook, your app stays in the store, and your customers are kept in the dark. Uber probably needs iPhone users more than Apple needs Uber, but this may not be universally true. What would happen if Facebook, which has also been accused of various hijinks, got into a dispute like this with Apple? That said, it’s got to be a tough situation for Apple to be in. They’re trying to protect their customers, but denying them access to an important transportation service would harm them far more than what Uber did. And what if this were an app that provided an essential medical function? The store is full of apps that flout the rules, but I don’t think Apple could ignore the geofencing. It looks like it tried to thread the needle by getting Uber to comply with the rules but then being lenient. I, too, wonder what Uber’s Android app does. App Store Business GPS iOS iOS 8 iOS App Privacy Private API Tim Cook Uber 5 Comments 5 Comments Chucky April 25, 2017 12:23 AM "Despite the blatant violation and deceit, there was no punishment." I find this utterly appalling. If Apple didn't want to permanently ban a major app, they still should have banned them for a month or two, just to make a point. "There definitely seem to be different rules for different developers. Smaller developers get their apps pulled from the store" Of course. And that's always going to be there. It's just the complete lack of punishment for Uber that appalls me. "That said, it’s got to be a tough situation for Apple to be in. They’re trying to protect their customers, but denying them access to an important transportation service would harm them far more than what Uber did." Here, I think you're dead wrong, Michael. Banning the Uber app from iOS permanently would've hurt Apple a bit, but it would have literally killed Uber. And I do mean literally; the company would have gone out of business. The two companies had very different stakes in the game here. If Apple had banned Uber for merely a month, with the duration announced ahead of time, it would have caused only very, very minor damage to Apple, but major damage to Uber, and would have ensured that no one would have ever tried to screw with Apple in this way again. "The store is full of apps that flout the rules, but I don’t think Apple could ignore the geofencing." Yup. The geofencing is where it goes from skirting around the rules to intentional fraud. (And not about Apple, but worth noting that Uber has a track record of these type of shenanigans.) Michael Tsai April 25, 2017 12:36 AM @Chucky Yeah. The rules are totally clear that deceit means you get expelled, i.e. your other apps, too. Instead, nothing. What I was trying to say in that sentence was harm to the customers, not to Apple. I fully agree that a ban would have been devastating to Uber. (Perhaps they could have been reincarnated under a different corporate entity with a “new” app.) Did Uber already have that track record in 2014/2015? Total April 25, 2017 1:01 AM @Chucky Harmed the customers is MS's point. But I think there would have been a substantial PR hit for Apple, too. Some obscure rule gets broken -- the narrative goes -- and you shut down a major form of transportation for a month? Cripple the company? That would not play well. But if you’re Uber, you get a one-on-one meeting with Tim Cook, your app stays in the store, and your customers are kept in the dark Well, now, I do wonder who the source for the article was -- if it was Kalanick & Cook in the room together, it wasn't Kalanick telling the Times about it, with exact quotes, and everything. Total April 25, 2017 1:01 AM MT's point, sorry. Philippe April 25, 2017 1:07 AM Like Chucky, I find Apples response quite appalling. There is so much rule violation going on. How can I further trust Apple that it will act honestly if another “flashy”, “Fashionable”, TBTF corporation does the same? (I never used Uber and never will) @Michael (comment) > Did Uber already have that track record in 2014/2015?

CBS Television Studios, which is producing the series, also issued a statement. “We’re excited about our ‘Carpool Karaoke’ for Apple Music, and look forward to everyone seeing it later this year.” As recently as February, Apple content czar Eddy Cue had been promoting the upcoming launch, sharing a trailer at an industry conference. Unknown is the fate of another original series, “Planet of the Apps,” that Apple had designated for spring. “Karaoke,” will feature a unique pairing of celebrities in each episode, such as John Legend with Alicia Keys and Billy Eichner with Metallica. Corden appears in one episode as well, with Will Smith, which footage revealed takes the “Karaoke” concept to a helicopter for a singalong to R.

That is because this year is different compared to every other iPhone launch event by Apple in the past. This is year is special, because Apple is expected to launch a third new model of the iPhone, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of its hero product. From what we have witnessed through leaks and rumours, there are a lot of expectations. Analysts however say that fans and customers should not get too excited. While Apple’s usual flagships (standard and ‘Plus’ models) will go on sale shortly after the big announcement, the third new iPhone (tagged as the iPhone 8) will probably not. According to a report by Digital Trends, KGI and other Apple watchers say that the Cupertino giant will most likely, not put the iPhone 8 up for sale at the same time as the upcoming iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models. What this means is that Apple may announce all three iPhones at its big event, but only the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus will go on sale, leaving the iPhone 8 for a later date. And there are reasons for this. These are to do with problems with acquiring a fingerprint reader with a touch sensor that is hidden beneath the display, one that Samsung also tried, but failed to implement due to time constraints in its just launched Galaxy S8 and S8+ devices. Instead, Samsung went with facial recognition along with iris recognition on the front, with the fingerprint reader located at the back of the device, thanks to the restrictions put in place with the new Infinity display. At the same time fresh new images have leaked out of what appears to be an iPhone 8 dummy unit. As you can see from the images leaked by Twitter user, Benjamin Geskin, both the front and back get the 2.5D glass treatment, with the center frame (or chassis) being made out of stainless steel. This would be similar to the Apple Watch Series 2 models that feature a stainless steel case for durability. Again, the stainless steel case will also allow Apple to add some colour to their lineup without the worry of smartphones getting scratched, like on the recent Jet Black models of the iPhone 7. According to the tipster, the dummy is a CNC model from Foxconn. If this truly turns out to be the iPhone 8, Apple would, in a way, be going back to its roots. The iPhone 8 you see above looks eerily similar to the first iPhone by Apple with blacked out bezels and a chromed body. iPhone 8 Dummy (This is CNC model according to Foxconn) Back is 2.5D Glass.#iPhone8 #iPhoneX #iPhoneEdition pic.twitter.com/Z8mH7b7z4r — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) April 23, 2017 What is interesting here is the lack of a home button on the front. On the left, we have the usual ringer switch with the volume buttons, while the right side gets two cutouts. While the one closer to the top is the power button, the cutout below is the place for the usual single SIM tray. The rear, as with recent leaks, showcases a cutout for the dual camera setup laid out in a vertical manner. It isn’t clear as to what Apple would name this third iPhone model, but the rumour mill so far hints at iPhone 8, iPhone X or the iPhone Edition, which would also hint at it premium price tag.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Entertainment Apple delays the release of upcoming ‘Carpool Karaoke’ spin-off Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 24th, 2017 at 11:30 PM Share Tweet With a whole lot of hoopla, Apple in January of last year excitedly announced that it was turning the popular “Carpool Karaoke” segment from The Late Late Show with James Corden into a new show available exclusively for Apple Music subscribers. While Apple’s plans in the TV space have long been frustratingly nebulous, the marriage of “Carpool Karaoke” and Apple Music seemed like a strategic step in the right direction. Don't Miss: When will Samsung release the Galaxy Note 8? “We love music, and Carpool Karaoke celebrates it in a fun and unique way that is a hit with audiences of all ages,” Apple executive Eddy Cue said at the time. “It’s a perfect fit for Apple Music, bringing subscribers exclusive access to their favorite artists and celebrities who come along for the ride.” Apple Music was set to launch sometime in April, but now comes word via Reuters that the show’s release date has been pushed back indefinitely. All we know is that the show’s new launch window is scheduled for sometime before 2018. A premiere party for “Carpool Karaoke” scheduled for March in Los Angeles was postponed without explanation days before it was to take place. This week, the company again postponed its launch party, which had been rescheduled for Monday. Apple, a company known for its precisely coordinated product launches, declined to explain the delays, but said in a statement that “Carpool Karaoke: The Series will premiere on Apple Music later this year.” Apple debuted an ad for the show during the Grammy Awards a few weeks ago, and believe it or not, the show doesn’t look half bad. What’s more, the list of celebrities Apple managed to wrangle up for the series is rather impressive and includes Will Smith, Metallica, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Chelsea Handler, John Cena, Shaquille O’Neal, and many others. While this is admittedly speculative, perhaps Apple wants the release of “Carpool Karaoke” to coincide with WWDC.

An in-depth profile of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick by The New York Times revealed that he directed employees to hide a feature from Apple engineers that allowed the taxi app to secretly identify and tag iPhone users. “So, I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Cook reportedly told Kalanick during a meeting at Apple’s headquarters in 2015. Try Newsweek from $3.25 per week Cook told Kalanick to stop the fraud-detection measure or else he would remove Uber’s app from Apple’s App Store. Uber has gained a reputation for flouting rules and regulations in its quest to overhaul the taxi industry and become the world’s biggest ride-hailing service, though this has come at a cost. The company is currently in the process of shutting down operations in Denmark and suspending its service in Italy over conflicts with local regulators. “Uber burst onto the scene in 2009 as a ‘disruptor’ and its culture was designed and cultivated to fit that mentality,” Dan Hill, a crisis and brand expert, wrote recently for Newsweek. “Today we see a company that still behaves with the same level of brashness that launched it to where it is today.” According to the New York Times , the tracking feature could identify and tag iPhones even after the Uber app was deleted by the device. Uber denied this practice in a statement to tech site The Verge. "We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app,” an Uber spokesperson said on Sunday, April 23. “As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users' accounts."

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Spotify Wants to Compete With Apple, Inc. on Hardware Now, Too? Good luck with that. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 24, 2017 at 9:33PM The war between Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Spotify over music-streaming subscribers is heating up, and it looks like the competition may soon expand to a new battleground: hardware. Spotify recently posted a job listing seeking a product manager for some type of hardware project, first spotted by Zatz Not Funny's David Zatz. Spotify has since taken down the listing after it got some unwelcome attention, but not before Zatz could take a screenshot of what the company is looking for. Spotify is hoping to deliver Spotify "via fully connected hardware devices" and wants to create "a category defining product akin to Pebble Watch, Amazon Echo, and Snap Spectacles." The hardware will come "directly from Spotify" and "affect the way the world experiences music & talk content." Furthermore, Zatz says the device will be some type of wearable device, citing an anonymous source and other job listings that could play a role in developing the device, such as a voice product manager. Apple Music. Image source: Apple. What is Spotify up to? It should probably be pretty obvious that Spotify isn't looking to create just a portable music player, a product category that smartphones marginalized long ago (even though Apple still sells iPods in small volumes). Since the Swedish music streamer lacks expertise in other areas, it seems likely that whatever it wants to make would focus singularly on music streaming without venturing too deeply into other functions. Voice-controlled virtual assistants are on the rise, but it's not realistic for Spotify to develop an entire assistant without deep artificial intelligence (AI) proficiency. A voice-controlled speaker that integrates with Spotify could make sense on some level, but it would be extremely hard for Spotify to compete with voice-controlled speakers that offer a broader set of functions through virtual assistants and third-party integrations. Spotify names two wearables as examples, potentially hinting at its plans, but the same fundamental challenge arises: Is there demand for a single-purpose wearable that only plays music? Broadly speaking, single-purpose product categories have been declining as multipurpose devices like smartphones become increasingly powerful and can handle just about any task you can imagine. Apple is working on a Siri-powered speaker Considering the rising popularity of Echo and products like it, I've been arguing for nearly a year that Apple should make a Siri-powered speaker. Reports surfaced last year that Apple is indeed hard at work creating a Siri-powered speaker, one that could also serve as a smart home hub just like current incumbents. Apple employees had reportedly already begun testing the device in their own homes, but the project could still get axed before ever seeing the light of day. Incumbent devices may already offer music-streaming services, but Apple Music and Spotify are the clear leaders in the subscription music-streaming space: Apple Music had 20 million paid subscribers as of December 2016, while Spotify announced last month that it had reached 50 million paid subscribers. Combined, those two services represent the majority of the roughly 100 million paid subscribers that the music-streaming industry now has. As the No. 2 in the market, Apple could strengthen its position with a Siri-powered speaker that streams Apple Music. Spotify will have a tough time competing on hardware.

Posted 24 Apr 2017 Roxanne RitzkeFeed 6up 1 comment Image by :  opensource.com If you are reading this, you probably care about, or are at least mildly interested in, open source. Like you, I care about and am interested in open source. Perhaps unlike you, I am also a webcomic artist. You can find my work at Herpaderp.party. This is a story about how I came to use and, indeed, vaunt open source. I'll also tell you about how and why I produce my comic using open source tools and infrastructure. The story begins in 2005 when I got my first computer as an off-to-college gift. It was an iBook G4. I carefully booted it and set it up according to the manual. It worked. I didn't feel as excited as I expected. I didn't feel cool, or dangerous, or in control, or like I should start wearing a leather trench coat like in The Matrix five years before. I knew a place called SourceForge, which had programs that weren't written by Apple, but I didn't see anything I really needed there. I installed The Matrix screensaver and moved on to my next challenge. In 2009, my computer ended its useful life. Apple abandoned the G4's PowerPC architecture, and my laptop fossilized under my fingers as I typed my senior thesis. In a youthful episode that I don't regret, but that I'm also grateful not to remember clearly, I got engaged to my computer-loving boyfriend and allowed him to install and reinstall and fix and reinstall a series of PowerPC-compatible Linux distros. That and I finished my senior thesis, all over a period of three months. The evidence of the transition is still in my documents folder: five ClarisWorks drafts, one plaintext draft, and one OpenOffice draft. Admittedly, I was salty about the change. Linux at the time was not as sleek and well fed as it is today, although it was a miracle of usability compared to the last time I'd seen it, which was in the late 90s. The obscure Apple drivers and already-obsolete processor made it a less-than-ideal platform for anyone's open source test drive. But for some reason, both the boyfriend (let's start calling him Rtzq0, since that's his name) and I stuck with it. Maybe it was the immediate post-college poverty. Aside from being cheap, however, I am also extremely stubborn and don't like being told what to do. And the fact that my still-working computer was taken away by those that made it ground my gears considerably. Those first Xfce installs were hair-pulling painful, but there was something else there too—something different. It had a sense of lightness, of freedom, of control, and of power. That was the feeling that had been missing from my first boot-up—a sense of defiance and even, perhaps, of hope. Eight years on, @Rtzq0 and I run a purely open source-based household (aside from the firmware on the inkjet printer, the coffeemaker, and miscellaneous clocks). It's pretty great. Inexpensive, morally correct, and intellectually demanding open source software and ideology are pillars of our lifestyle. So when I committed to producing a daily webcomic, options like Tumblr and ComicPress didn't feed my enormous appetite for security, control, and flexibility. What are the alternatives when you're bootstrapping yourself into the webcomics industry? There aren't many, and I was fortunate that @Rtzq0 already had enough experience in web stacks to advise me to consider building a custom one. Using the Pelican static blog generator as a base, we created a fairly decently robust webcomic creation framework that was robust enough to slap it into a new project so other people could mess with it. The barest alpha version of PeliComic is available for your pleasure, lulz, and bug testing on GitLab. "kernel inception" by Roxanne Ritzke Open source tools for webcomics Now that we've got something to work with, here's how I produce my comic from beginning to end, using free and open source tools. This is how I went from zero to full-on webcomic artist in less than a month. The laptop I draw my comics on is a Lenovo X230T I got off of eBay. Along with enough RAM to max it out, it cost about $300. Two SSDs, one for the OS and one for /home, plus an i7 processor make it plenty speedy for comics. It runs Linux Mint and MATE, my go-to distro and desktop environment. Comics are made in Krita, the open source digital painting application, with some tweaks done in Inkscape and GIMP. All-important daily backups are made automatically to a local wireless NAS (Network-Attached Storage), running NAS4Free on 18TB of RAID 6. Once I have a finished comic stored locally, it's time for git to shine. Git manages the PNG image files of the comic, the reStructuredText files of the corresponding pages on the website, and the HTML and Jinja files associated with Pelican/PeliComic that actually build the website. I write the reStructuredText file with the comic's title and alt text, save it, and then move into a Python virtual environment for testing. Pelican has a neat feature in which you can automagically create a local development server to preview your website, so I use this to ensure everything looks good. When that's done, I stop the server, add and commit the files, and push them to GitLab. On GitLab, GitLab CI takes the content files and all the files for Pelican and gives them to a Docker container running Alpine to build. The files for the completely rebuilt website then get sent to GitLab Pages, a static website hosting system. The entire pipeline runs in under 10 minutes, and a fresh, perfect website is presented to the world. If anything in this sequence breaks, the website is kept available by Cloudflare, the one free-but-not-open component. Cloudflare keeps the website up if GitLab goes down, and it can reduce load times for visitors. It also takes some of the strain off of GitLab services, making HerpaDerp a "better neighbor" to GitLab. As you can see, I get a great deal of mileage out of open source. It supports my daily life and my work as well. Sometimes, I used to feel bad for not being able to contribute more fully to software projects. Now, I think I just hadn't found my own "itch to scratch" yet. Producing a free and open webcomic turned out to be what I cared about enough to make my own solution when existing options weren't satisfactory. Give PeliComic a pull request if you're so inclined, and thanks for reading.

And after a lengthy stint in beta, the iOS 10.3 update is now available for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. As expected iOS 10.3 is a huge update for Apple’s mobile devices bringing new features, fixes and a ton of security patches with it. An iOS 10.3 release is confirmed. Today we want to take an updated look at the most important things to know about the iOS 10.3 update and its release. We’ll continue to update this roundup with new details so check back for frequent updates as we push into the month of April. iOS 10.3 Review We’ve downloaded the iOS 10.3 update on the iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 5. The iOS 10.3 update is massive, over 600MB for the iPhone 7, and the installation process took a lot longer than usual due in part to Apple’s new APFS file system. We didn’t run into any issues but the download/installation took upwards of 20 minutes on all of these devices so make sure you set aside some time to monitor the download and the installation. So far, we haven’t noticed any major problems with any of these devices. In fact, we’ve seen some nice improvements on the eldest device. Battery life is currently holding up on all four phones. We haven’t experienced any weird drain when in use or standby. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and cellular data are also stable. We’ve noticed some improvements to the iPhone 5’s boot speed and its UI. The user interface feels faster and more fluid than the previous versions of iOS 10. As of right now, iOS 10.3 is treating these three devices well and it’s recommended if you’re interested in iOS 10.3’s features, protecting your device from potential harm, or if you’re suffering from an unfixable iOS issue. If you’re doing fine on iOS 10.2.1, you might want to wait a few days for more long-term feedback to emerge. We’ll keep you posted. In the meantime, we’ve put together a list of reasons to, and not to, install the iOS 10.3 update right now. If you’re having an excellent experience on iOS 10.2.1 or below, we highly recommend digging into those reasons before making the move to iOS 10.3. iOS 10.3 Problems iOS 10.3 went through a lengthy beta but problems have slipped through the cracks. iOS 10.3 users are complaining about a wide range of issues including weird battery drain, issues with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, lag, random reboots, and issues with third-party apps. As of right now, these issues are isolated. They’re also extremely common after a major iOS update release. Most of these iOS 10.3 problems can be solved from the comfort of a computer chair at work or your home. If you’re seeing an issue after downloading iOS 10.3, take a look at our list of fixes. You’ll also want to report it to Apple so that its engineers can get to work on a fix. Downgrade & iOS 10.3.1 If you decide to download the iOS 10.3 update know that there is no longer a way to drop down to another official version of iOS 10. If iOS 10.3 is causing problems for you you’re stuck until Apple rolls out a new version of iOS 10. Apple’s no longer signing off on iOS 10.2.1 which means you can’t drop down to it if you’re unhappy with the iOS 10.3 update’s performance on your iPhone or iPad. Unfortunately, you can’t drop down to anything older than iOS 10.2.1 either. Also note that you can now “upgrade” to iOS 10.3.1. Apple’s released an iOS 10.3.1 update with bug fixes for iPhone and iPad. The update is tiny but it could have an impact on your device’s performance. For more on the iOS 10.3.1 update, take a look at our walkthrough. It goes over performance, problems, and more. Clips Now Available for iPhone & iPad A new feature, which requires the iOS 10.3/iOS 10.3.1 update is now available. Earlier this year, Apple announced a new Clips application. The company promised a release in April and Clips is now out on the App Store. Clips allows select iOS 10.3/iOS 10.3.1 users to create unique videos. It lets you combine video clips, photos and music that you can share via iMessage, Instagram, Facebook or another popular social networking platform. It also features Live Tiles which will let you create animated captions and titles using your voice. You’re then able to add effects like comic book filters, speech bubbles, shapes and full-screen animated posters. For more on Clips, take a look at our roundup. Clips isn’t available for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or iPad 4. What’s Next Apple’s already confirmed the next iOS 10.3 update. The iOS 10.3.2 update is currently in beta ahead of an unknown release date. As of right now the update appears to be a maintenance release which means it’ll probably deliver bug fixes and security patches as opposed to features. While you might be tempted to try the iOS 10.3.2 beta ahead of time, be aware that Apple’s early software can cause problems. Issues with apps and services, connectivity, and battery life are common beta issues and we expect these, and other problems, to plague the iOS 10.3.2 update as it passes through the company’s beta program. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 8 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 12 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 12 14 Responses 01/10/2017 Stephen Reply Really a very terribly written article, with numerous grammar mistakes.

(AAPL) Stock Is More Than iPhone 8 Beyond iPhone 8 and smartphones, development in autonomous driving awaits By Chris Lau, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 24, 2017, 7:03 pm EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     Popular Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(AAPL) Stock Is More Than iPhone 8 Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Has Nothing to Worry About Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is a Buy, Regardless of Earnings View All Posts After International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) reported a drop in profits in its quarterly results, Apple stock investors may think twice about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Source: Shutterstock Strong sales of iPhones are hardly assured. Even though valuations between the two companies are similar on a forward price-earnings basis (12 for IBM and 13.8 for Apple), Apple will probably please the market when it reports results next month. Investors should also ignore rumors about the iPhone 8. Sales for the existing models are only starting to ramp up now. iPhone 8 Versus Samsung Galaxy S8 Apple’s impending release of an iPhone 8 would mark the tenth-anniversary for the device. Yet the company just released the iPhone 7 in September 2016. Refreshing the model just after a year may not make much sense. Apple stock isn’t under significant pressure by competition from Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) or any other Android device maker. Still, consumers may overlook the expensive initial price of nearly $800 for the Galaxy S8. Samsung is releasing the latest phone on April 21. Fans may like the Galaxy S8’s biometric scanners, which include iris and fingerprint scanning. Those are some of the ways the phone may get unlocked. Samsung will introduce an assistant named Bixby, but this feature could underwhelm its users. Chances are high that the AI software will be buggy and will need fixing. That is typical for any technology product that is in its first generation. By comparison, Apple introduced Siri on the iPhone 4S, way back in October 2011. Bixby is competing against six years of iterations on Siri. Expectations for Second Quarter Analysts expect Apple will report revenue in the range of $51.7 billion to $54.6 billion. That translates to earnings of between $1.91 to $2.14 per share. If Apple meets those expectations, that would imply revenue growing in the single digits, at around 5%. The company will likely report that its cash balance grew again. Apple stock ended its last quarter with $230 billion in offshore cash. The massive cash balance will only fuel rumors of the company making a big acquisition. Apple stock is strategically better positioned if it waits for the government to allow for repatriating the cash at a lower tax rate. The company may invest the proceeds in the business or make smaller, local acquisitions. Historically, Apple does not buy companies in the $100 billion range. Its biggest acquisition to date was Beats Electronics for $3 billion in August 2014. Diversifying Business Through Autonomous Driving Apple’s management may give more details on its ambitions in building self-driving car technology. On April 14, the company received a permit that allows it to test auto-driving cars in California. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) need not worry about Apple as a competitor. Apple is working only on the software part of ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems). Tesla develops both the all-electric hardware and the software. Still, staying away from the hardware aspect of automotive development should keep profit margins high for Apple. Car manufacturing is inherently a low-profit business. Similar to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) selling Windows software and not low-commodity PCs, Apple will sell the software that self-driving cars will use. Apple is very deliberate on the products it produces. The company is in no rush to release the next iPhone 8, but it is keen on diversifying its business outside of smartphones. Apple’s progress in developing autonomous driving software ultimately makes the company a solid investment for long-time shareholders. As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The latest incident comes from a report in the New York Times, which claims that Apple CEO Tim Cook threatened to remove Uber's app from the App Store after learning it tracked former users even after being deleted. But the company denies it did anything wrong. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick reportedly told his staff to use this “fingerprinting” technique, which is banned by Apple’s privacy requirements, as a fraud prevention method in locations such as China, where drivers were registering multiple Uber accounts on stolen iPhones and using them to request rides. All those extra rides meant Uber paid out more bonuses to the drivers. To stop Apple finding out what it was up to, Uber reportedly geofenced the iPhone maker’s Cupertino headquarters to hide the code used in the fingerprinting process. But Apple engineers at other offices discovered what it was doing, leading to a confrontation between Cook and Kalanick. In an early 2015 meeting, Cook told Kalanick that he’d “heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” warning him that if the practice wasn’t stopped, the Uber app would be removed from Apple’s store. “Mr. Kalanick was shaken by Mr. Cook’s scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting,” writes the Times. Understandable, given the damage Uber would have suffered if Cook followed through on his threat. Since the article was published, Uber has released a statement on the matter. The company suggested to TechCrunch that it has modified the fingerprinting technique to comply with Apple’s rules, rather than removing it completely. “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app. As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users’ accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users,” an Uber spokesperson said. The news is the latest in long line of bad publicity for Uber. It’s had to deal with revelations over its Hell software, Greyball, sexism allegations, a lawsuit from Alphabet over self-driving technology theft, Kalanick’s argument with a driver, and the CEO's visit to an escort bar in South Korea.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Spotify Wants to Compete With Apple, Inc. on Hardware Now, Too? The war between Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Spotify over music-streaming subscribers is heating up, and it looks like the competition may soon expand to a new battleground: hardware. Spotify recently posted a job listing seeking a product manager for some type of hardware project, first spotted by Zatz Not Funny ‚s David Zatz. Spotify has since taken down the listing after it got some unwelcome attention, but not before Zatz could take a screenshot of what the company is looking for. Spotify is hoping to deliver Spotify „via fully connected hardware devices” and wants to create „a category defining product akin to Pebble Watch, Amazon Echo, and Snap Spectacles.” The hardware will come „directly from Spotify” and „affect the way the world experiences music & talk content.” Furthermore, Zatz says the device will be some type of wearable device, citing an anonymous source and other job listings that could play a role in developing the device, such as a voice product manager. Apple Music. Image source: Apple. What is Spotify up to? It should probably be pretty obvious that Spotify isn’t looking to create just a portable music player, a product category that smartphones marginalized long ago (even though Apple still sells iPods in small volumes). Since the Swedish music streamer lacks expertise in other areas, it seems likely that whatever it wants to make would focus singularly on music streaming without venturing too deeply into other functions. Voice-controlled virtual assistants are on the rise, but it’s not realistic for Spotify to develop an entire assistant without deep artificial intelligence (AI) proficiency. A voice-controlled speaker that integrates with Spotify could make sense on some level, but it would be extremely hard for Spotify to compete with voice-controlled speakers that offer a broader set of functions through virtual assistants and third-party integrations. Spotify names two wearables as examples, potentially hinting at its plans, but the same fundamental challenge arises: Is there demand for a single-purpose wearable that only plays music? Broadly speaking, single-purpose product categories have been declining as multipurpose devices like smartphones become increasingly powerful and can handle just about any task you can imagine. Apple is working on a Siri-powered speaker Considering the rising popularity of Echo and products like it , I’ve been arguing for nearly a year  that Apple should make a Siri-powered speaker. Reports surfaced last year that Apple is indeed hard at work creating a Siri-powered speaker , one that could also serve as a smart home hub just like current incumbents. Apple employees had reportedly already begun testing the device in their own homes, but the project could still get axed before ever seeing the light of day. Incumbent devices may already offer music-streaming services, but Apple Music and Spotify are the clear leaders in the subscription music-streaming space: Apple Music had 20 million paid subscribers as of December 2016, while Spotify announced last month that it had reached 50 million paid subscribers. Combined, those two services represent the majority of the roughly 100 million paid subscribers that the music-streaming industry now has. As the No. 2 in the market, Apple could strengthen its position with a Siri-powered speaker that streams Apple Music. Spotify will have a tough time competing on hardware. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Home Macs | 20 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (9) iLife and iWork Apps Now Free for Everyone by Josh Centers Once upon a time, Apple used to charge for nearly all its software, and especially productivity apps like the iLife and iWork suites. However, back in 2013, Apple made those apps free with the purchase of any new Mac or iOS device (see “New Free iLife and iWork Apps Share across Devices and Platforms,” 22 October 2013). Now, with no announcement or fanfare, Apple has made the current iLife and iWork apps entirely free for all users. Just to be clear, the change affects the following apps: GarageBand for macOS (requires 10.10 Yosemite) and iOS (requires iOS 10.2) iMovie for macOS (requires 10.11.2 El Capitan) and iOS (requires iOS 9.3) Keynote for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Numbers for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Pages for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) This is good news for holdouts who haven’t purchased a new eligible Apple device since 2013 but are running a supported version of the operating system and would like copies of the iLife and iWork apps. And it makes explaining the pricing easier for Apple. Why didn’t Apple just make these apps free for everyone in the first place? The answer likely lies deep within Apple’s accounting department. Back in 2013, Apple made iLife, iWork, and OS X 10.9 Mavericks free and bundled them with every new Mac and iOS device sold. That move enabled the company to delay recognition of a portion of its sales receipts. That’s because the product (a Mac or iOS device) wasn’t “fully delivered” without updates to the software — it’s a “subscription accounting” approach. In its Q4 2013 financial quarter, Apple delayed recognition of $900 million in revenue, in essence hiding that money from the quarterly report (see “Apple Q4 2013 Results See Lower Profits Again,” 28 October 2013). That may answer the question of why Apple is now making these apps free for everyone. According to Daniel Eran Dilger of AppleInsider, the deferred revenue trickles back into Apple’s reported revenues over 2 years for iOS and 4 years for the Mac. It has been about 4 years since this deferral likely began, implying that Apple has finally cleaned the associated deferred revenue off its books. In the end, this change doesn’t mean much. Any effects from iLife and iWork becoming free — on competing apps, on Apple’s revenues, and on the perceived value of Apple hardware, for instance — have already taken place. Most people who want to use the iLife and iWork apps have likely either bought copies already or purchased new hardware since October 2013. We suspect that sales to owners of older Macs and iOS devices have dropped to the point where it was no longer worthwhile for Apple to bother charging for the apps anymore.

Reply Jim Schmidt  2017-04-24 12:32 Yep, I found that out last night. I went to download Pages on my iPad, and found out I couldn't because I don't have iOS 10 on it. I went to upgrade the OS... and found out my iPad is too old for 10. Sad. Reply Ian Orchard  2017-04-24 20:08 I've got the same problem with my beloved MacBookPro that is now deemed to be obsolete by Apple. I can't upgrade my current copies of iWork because it can't run Sierra. Now if only I could find a way to stop Pages & Numbers from nagging me to upgrade. Reply Jeffrey Puritz  2017-04-20 17:33 You're an optimist but my lengthy experience with Apple tells me that like Aperture these apps are in for a long slow death by neglect. Sadly, I think that this is true for the mac as well. Apple is only interested in the products with the most revenue and it shows. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-04-20 18:15 Free may seem like a good thing, but nothing is really free. In this case we will be paying for these apps through hardware purchases, if we use an app or not. Then there is the question of app quality. Since Apple is not making any money off them anymore there is no stimulus to make these apps so good people will be willing to pay for them. The option to vote with our wallet has been taken from us. One sad example is the latest version of Numbers for iOS. The complaints and 1 star reviews are pouring in but Apple seems to be deaf and blind to them. Now that Numbers is free there is even less reason te expect Apple to do anything about this bad update. Reply Paul F Henegan   2017-04-21 03:55 No, they are not "free for everyone", only for those who have also upgraded to macOS X 12 or later. As Alfonso Scenna observes above, unless one is willing and able to run the very latest OS, there is no invitation to the party. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-21 09:39 You're right that these apps have specific system requirements, and we've updated the article to make this completely clear. However, that doesn't change the fact that the apps are indeed free for everyone. Your ability to run an app is separate from its price. Reply Karen Kirtland  2017-04-24 19:55 The upgraded 5.2 version of Pages I tried using was terrible when compared with the older 4.0 versions. It functions too much like the awful Word program for me to use it. I wouldn't upgrade any of my perfectly functioning iWork programs, free or not, based on the extremely negative experience with Pages alone. Reply Phil Seymour  2017-04-24 21:15 They are free because the latest versions are crap compared to 09 versions. Thankfully I have kept the older versions of Pages, Keynote, Numbers, iMovie, GarageBand and iPhoto. I have the new versions, too, but if I have creative work to do, I use the older versions that were designed with uninterrupted creative workflow in mind.

PDT April 24, 2017 A wind farm in Gilliam County, Oregon. (Photo: KGW) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST PORTLAND, Ore. -- One of the world's biggest brands is making an environmental investment in Oregon. Apple has announced it's financing two solar panel and wind farms in Central Oregon. The electricity they'll generate will power Apple's three data centers near Bend. It's going to save enough fossil fuels to power 65,000 homes every year. Experts are hoping a company as big as Apple is enough to push others like Walmart and Facebook, which has also data centers in Oregon, into the same mindset. From Portland, if you fly over the Cascades and zoom in on Southwest Millican Road in Prineville, Google Earth shows nothing but juniper and sagebrush. But under construction there right now, is a huge solar panel farm, commissioned for Apple. It will be completed next year. In their environmental report released on Earth Day, the company says 100 percent of the solar energy harnessed at the farm will go to power the company's three data centers a few miles away. Farther north in Gilliam County, Apple says it's also backing construction of a new wind turbine farm to funnel power back to Prineville. Apple's goal is to have all it's facilities worldwide on renewable energy. "You need to have leaders in this kind of thing," said Rachel Shimshak, executive director of Renewable Northwest. Shimshak says not only is it great public relations for Apple to stop using fossil fuels, it's obviously good for the environment, it's getting comparable in price to regular electricity and it helps local counties with jobs and subsidies. "Customers really value companies who want to do well by the environment and I think Apple has stepped to the front of the line, along with others, to recognize what customers want from them and show they're going to give it to them." Facebook also has three data centers in Prineville, but hasn't delved into renewable energy yet in our state. It's because Oregon's Public Utility Commission doesn't make the "transition charge" cheap to switch from regular fossil fuels to solar or wind. Walmart agrees, saying it's not cost effective yet in Oregon. The legislature is working on it, but Apple didn't seem to mind. Shimsahk says you'll see more households and companies moving that way as more of these farms get built. "Over the next several years, the utilities are going to transfer out of coal resources and grow the amount of renewable resources that meet their needs," she said. Nike is another company that has made the transition to buying renewable energy in Oregon. According to research by the Portland Business Journal, Nike buys wind power from a plant in the Gorge. It's also beneficial for household customers. Right now, if you're a Portland General Electric or Pacific Power customer, you can call them and ask to switch to renewable energy. It might cost a few cents more a month, but Shimshak says it's getting closer to the same price every year. And instead of installing solar panels on your own roof, thanks to a new bill passed in 2016, soon you'll be able to invest in a community solar panel farm to share the electricity with your neighbors. © 2017 KGW-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Boat hits whale near Whidbey Island Car of missing Camas teen found, body inside Ilani casino grand opening draws thousands American Airlines suspends flight attendant George Fox University student is missing Child molester assaults girl in her bedroom George Fox University student missing Raw video: Boat hits whale in Puget Sound Northeast Portland church hit with hateful graffiti Recycling is in trouble and you may be part of the problem More Stories Apple makes big environmental investment in Oregon Apr 24, 2017, 6:47 p.m. Warriors sweep Trail Blazers with 128-103 win Apr 24, 2017, 10:26 p.m. Man arrested after attack at Iraqi restaurant caught… Apr 24, 2017, 10:35 p.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather 7 Day Forecast Closings Weather Alerts Radars Live Cameras hyperlocal-radars More...

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube Earlier this year it was revealed that after Apple had acquired the rights to “Carpool Karaoke” that the series would be launching in 2017. It was originally suggested that the launch party would be taking place in March in Los Angeles, but given that we’re now in April that clearly did not happen. Now according to a report from Reuters, it seems that the series might have been delayed again. The report claims that Apple was supposed to host a launch party on Monday this week, but once again those plans have since been postponed. We’re not sure what’s with the delay, but a statement provided to Reuters reads, “Carpool Karaoke: The Series will premiere on Apple Music later this year.” For those who are unfamiliar with the series, it was originally launched as part of the “The Late Late Show with James Corden” where the host, James Corden, would drive around in a car with a celebrity (or multiple celebrities) and he would conduct an interview and sing with them. It has attracted quite a bit of attention as it has featured some pretty big names. The show is expected to debut on Apple Music, and we’ve also seen how Spotify is trying to do something similar with “Traffic Jams”, where hip-hop artists and producers try to create a song on the spot while driven around in a car.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple, Inc. Earnings: Will Growth Continue? After three quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue declines, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) returned to growth in its most recently reported quarter. First-quarter revenue and EPS increased 3% and 2%, respectively, compared to the year-ago period. With the tech giant returning to growth, shares have soared about 20% in the past three months. Now, with Apple’s second-quarter earnings report coming up next week, investors will look to see if Apple can sustain its upward growth trajectory. Ahead of Apple’s earnings, here are three metrics for investors to watch. Image source: Apple. iPhone sales As usual, Apple’s iPhone sales for the quarter will be key. As the iPhone accounts for 64% of Apple’s trailing-12-month revenue, it’s no wonder analysts watch the figure closely. What should investors expect from second-quarter iPhone sales? Considering that Apple guided for second-quarter revenue to rise between 1.8% and 5.7%, year over year, it’s likely that management expects a similar trajectory for iPhone sales, since the massive segment usually determines the general direction of Apple’s overall revenue. In Apple’s second quarter of 2016, the company sold 51.2 million iPhones, generating $32.9 billion in revenue. Therefore, Apple will need to beat these figures for the company to continue growing the important segment on a year-over-year basis. Gross margin Another area for investors to check on will be Apple’s gross profit margin. Consistently reporting gross profit margin well over 35% for years, the company’s lucrative margin is telling evidence of Apple’s pricing power and its economies of scale. For Apple stock to continue performing well over the long haul, investors should ensure that the company can continue to maintain its heady gross profit margin. For Apple’s second quarter, management said it expected Apple to have a gross profit margin between 38% and 39%. While this range is notably below Apple’s gross profit margin of 39.4% in the year-ago quarter, it’s still robust enough to suggest Apple’s operational prowess and its clout with customers remain intact. Data source: Apple quarterly SEC filings. Asterisk indicates a figure based on the midpoint of management guidance. Chart by author. Investors should look for Apple to report a gross profit margin within its guidance range. Revenue guidance While Apple’s reported iPhone sales and gross margin for its second quarter are important, the one figure that may be scrutinized the most could be Apple’s revenue guidance for its third quarter. Since Apple has only recently returned to revenue growth, investors will look not only for growth in the current quarter but also for expected growth in Apple’s third quarter. Ahead of an expected major overhaul to the iPhone this fall, it’s possible that an unusually high number of customers are holding off on iPhone purchases until Apple reveals its 2017 iPhone models. Investors will get an idea of what to expect from iPhone sales ahead of the company’s annual iPhone launch when Apple shares its revenue guidance for its third quarter. For Apple to continue growing its top line on a year-over-year basis, management’s revenue guidance for its third quarter will need to exceed the $42.4 billion in revenue Apple reported in the third quarter of 2016. Apple is scheduled to report its second-quarter results after market close on May 2. The company will host a live conference call to discuss the quarter’s performance at 2:00 p.m. PDT on the same day. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It looks like Apple fans are going to have to reset their countdowns. Mashable reports that the iPhone 8 is facing a few delays and might not make it to market this September. According to the site, the release date could move to October or November. 9to5Mac reports that Apple analyst KGI Ming-Chi Kuo says many of the parts that Apple has ordered for the new iPhone are custom to the product and that manufacturing is taking much longer than expected. Many rumors that surround the new phone, including its fancy under-glass fingerprint sensor, ultra-vivid OLED display, and 3-D front camera are causing major delays as Apple works to make sure that each component is up to snuff. However, since announcements and press events don't need actual prototypes, Apple's announcement of the new iPhone 8 — or iPhone X, in reference to the device's 10-year anniversary — and iPhone 7S/7S Plus models should proceed as scheduled. The iPhone 7S and 7S Plus will not face the same delays as their upgraded counterparts and analysts predict that they'll ship on time. Mashable adds that the iPhone 8's release will likely hamper sales of new gen-7 phones. After all, there's no reason to upgrade if the 8 is just a few months away and includes a bevy of brand-new features. But there may be one reason that Apple's not sweating that minor detail: If rumors are to be believed, the iPhone 8 will be considerably more expensive than the updated iPhone 7. Predictions place the cutting-edge phone at over $1,000 for a 256 GB model, which may put it out of reach for many shoppers. While the iPhone 8 remains shrouded in mystery, plenty of predictions are spreading across the internet. You can find out exactly what's happening here.

Nick Whighamnews.com.au@NWWHIGHAM news.com.au April 25, 201711:56am Uber CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick. Picture: Paul Sakluma UBER boss Travis Kalanick has been a very naughty chief executive at times. The CEO of the world-conquering ride sharing app has seen no shortage of controversies in his rise to the top. He was filmed berating one of his drivers over a fare, been compelled to hire a former US Attorney General to carry out an investigation into sexual harassment at the company, and penned an open letter to employees admitting that he needs to grow up. But perhaps nothing captures the turbulence of his leadership better than a tense meeting Mr Kalanick endured with Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2015. The previously unreported meeting was a moment the Uber boss was dreading and when the two Silicon Valley heavyweights were in the room together it was fraught with tension, according to an in-depth feature by The New York Times. “So, I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Mr Cook said in his calm, Southern tone, the paper reported. The problem was Uber had deliberately broken Apple’s rules when it comes to the App Store in a plan that was destined to come unstuck but was nonetheless impressive in its audacity. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly gave Uber CEO a serious dressing down over its app shenanigans. Picture: Bernd ThissenSource:AFP Uber was pulling a fast one on Apple and using software to identify iPhones even after their owners deleted the app, or even wiped the phone completely. It’s known as fingerprinting and it’s not an overly uncommon technique in the tech world and is often used in anti-fraud measures. But it does breach the rules Apple sets out for clients using its App Store. If you uninstall an app that uses fingerprinting, it leaves behind a small piece of code that can be used as an identifier if the app is ever reinstalled on the device. In order to prevent Apple from finding out, Mr Kalanick ordered a his engineers to “geofence” Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California, the Times reported. He had them set up a way to digitally identify when someone was reviewing Uber’s software in a specific location and obfuscate the code they were looking at, effectively creating something akin to a force field of deception. Eventually Apple cottoned on, hence the uncomfortable 2015 meeting. In the session, Apple CEO Tim Cook played the ultimate trump card. He told Mr Kalanick to cut it out or he would yank the Uber app from the Apple Store — a move that would all but cripple the service. Of course, the Uber CEO acquiesced. It’s better to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission, as the old adage goes. And it’s clearly a philosophy that Mr Kalanick has embraced during his time turning Uber into arguably the most disruptive global company in the iPhone era. Uber has spread to more than 70 countries and achieved an eye-watering market valuation of $92 billion, as it continues to grow. During that time Mr Kalanick has shown a willingness, if not an eagerness, to flout laws and government regulations, exploit legal grey areas and even deceive law enforcement agencies for his own benefit. In some cases it has paid dividends, but in others like the run in with Apple, it has brought the company to the edge of potential disaster.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo 2/2 By Piya Sinha-Roy | LOS ANGELES LOS ANGELES Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Apple Music has delayed the release of its first original video series, an adaptation of comedian James Corden's popular "Carpool Karaoke" segment, the company said. At the Code Media conference in February, Apple said the show would debut in April and be available only to Apple Music subscribers. Apple's senior vice president of internet software and services, Eddy Cue, showed a trailer for the series featuring celebrities such as Will Smith, John Legend, Ariana Grande and Alicia Keys. A premiere party for "Carpool Karaoke" scheduled for March in Los Angeles was postponed without explanation days before it was to take place. This week, the company again postponed its launch party, which had been rescheduled for Monday. Apple, a company known for its precisely coordinated product launches, declined to explain the delays, but said in a statement that "Carpool Karaoke: The Series will premiere on Apple Music later this year." The series is an adaptation of a segment than runs during CBS' "The Late Late Show with James Corden" and sees him driving with a celebrity and singing a medley of songs. A representative for CBS Television Studios said in an email on Monday: "We're excited about our 'Carpool Karaoke' for Apple Music, and look forward to everyone seeing it later this year." In January, Corden told reporters at a Television Critics Association panel that he was "incredibly proud" that it would be Apple Music's first show. Launched in mid-2015, Apple Music has struggled to gain traction. The company said that the service, which sells for $9.99 a month and is heavily promoted to iPhone users, had 20 million subscribers at the end of 2016. Rival streaming platform Spotify, which offers both a free version and a $9.99 monthly subscription, said in March it had 50 million subscribers. Apple Music has primarily offered streaming music to its subscribers, but hoped additional exclusive video content would lure new customers. Apple has said that each of the 16 half-hour episodes it is planning of "Carpool Karaoke" would pair two celebrities spending the day driving around together. Apple Music has also announced plans for a reality show, "Planet of the Apps," which Cue said was due this spring.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile iPhone 8 To Account For 50% Of Apple’s Total Smartphone Output This Year Claims Morgan Stanley By Ramish Zafar 12 hours ago 15Shares Share Tweet Submit The iPhone 8 is becoming a regular feature of the rumor mill once again. This is despite the fact that a good five months are left until Apple launches the smartphone. A couple of important reasons underlie an increase in this hype so early on. Firstly, innovation and upgrades have come to a virtual standstill on the smartphone lineup. Apple’s been scurrying around under the shelter of upgrading colors and changing materials, while refusing to accept that there really isn’t much left to upgrade. Secondly, its competitors have upped the stakes. The strongest example of this is Samsung, who launched vastly overhauled Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ smartphones this year. Finally, it’s also interesting to note that a majority of upgrades rumored for the iPhone 8 more or less resemble the Galaxy S8 lineup. Now, we’ve got more details for Apple’s upcoming smartphone. Take a look below to find out more. Morgan Stanley Doubles Its OLED Forecast For The iPhone 8; Range Expanded To 100m High Point OLEDs on the iPhone are a controversial feature. Apple has waited far too long for the upgrade. Now that Cupertino is finally ready to consider improved screens, the rumor mill is ready to churn out fresh speculation around the matter. The latest scoop claims that Apple’s being over ambitious with the iPhone 8’s alleged OLED displays. Allegedly, Apple wants to top the Galaxy S8’s screen-body ratio on the iPhone 8 and is pushing Samsung to produce such panels. Related iPhone 8 Production Delay Rumors Are Grossly Exaggerated; Samsung Will Commence OLED Assembly In May It’s not every day that we hear about Samsung’s resources turning up short but do expect such a situation in an order from none other than Apple. However, sources now claim that reports of a production delay around the iPhone 8 are exaggerated. Not only will Samsung deliver on time, but today, investment bank Morgan Stanley upgrades its OLED forecast for the smartphone in a latest research note to investors. Advertisement Related iPhone 8 Production Delayed Due to Supply Constraints – October/November Potential Months of Production Phase “Back in November, our checks pointed to 50M [million] OLED panel supply to Apple but the range has expanded to 50-100M with production yields at Samsung the key variable. With an expected (second half 2017) total iPhone production plan of 100-110M, this suggests OLED could be closer to 50% mix, versus our prior conservative assumption of 33%.” says the bank. It goes on to add that, “Our analysis assumes upgrade rates (shipments as a % of two-year old “upgradeable” iPhones) remain at trough levels as the market matures. But we see upside potential if the upgrade cycle shortens temporarily on the strength of promised new features, such as more power efficient OLED display, wireless charging, 3D sensors, and a new curved form factor.” A very interesting fact related to this note is that it also goes on to mention 3D sensors for the iPhone 8. The brand new tech is seeing a lot of mentions lately, especially from strong sources. Apple’s recent hiring of developers related to the technology points towards a strong probability that 3D will be a strong feature for the iPhone 8. It’s open season folks and Apple needs a lot of geese to keep numbers up. So far, we’re optimistic for the iPhone 8. Are you? Let us know what you think in the comments section below and stay tuned. We’ll keep you updated on the latest.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 25 April 2017 | MYT 8:00 AM Mechanical and digital watchmakers struggle for control of wrists Smartwatches were billed as the next big thing in electronics following the success of the smartphone, but that hope quickly turned to disappointment when big sales failed to materialise. — dpa Smartwatches were billed as the next big thing in electronics following the success of the smartphone. But that hope quickly turned to disappointment when big sales failed to materialise.  Mechanical watches have remained stubbornly popular. But it's still too early to ring the death knell of the smartwatch.  The two biggest tech players in smartwatches, Apple and Google, have kept these products alive by integrating their digital assistants into them. Apple's Siri first became available on the Apple Watch in early 2015 while Google installed its Assistant only lately into its Android Wear 2.0.  "We see huge potential in how useful Assistant will be. You can simply tap the smartphone on your wrist and receive the information you need," says Android Wear product manager David Singleton.  The Apple Watch has been the undisputed leader since its launch. But Google is determined that its Android Wear will become the preferred operating system for most smartphone makers.  Even mechanical watchmakers like TAG Heuer, Montblanc and Movado have dipped their toes into the smartwatch market and launched products powered by Android Wear.  But it's the fashion watchmakers who have really embraced smartwatches. Every man's watch produced by the label Michael Kors will have a microchip and touchscreen.  But hybrid watches – a combination of classical mechanical watch face and digital technology such as a camera – are on their way. "In one year Michael Kors will be the second-largest smartwatch maker in the world," the label's chief executive John Idol said at the recent Baselworld watch fair.  Smartwatches were relatively rare at the trade fair. TAG Heuer, however, did present the second generation of its Connected smart watch.  Company boss Jean-Claude Biver is pursuing a strategy of selling both smartwatches and mechanical watches to his customers. A Connected watch costs about US$1,600 (RM7,036) to buy. For an additional US$1,600 (RM7,036) the watch owner can upgrade to a mechanical TAG Heuer.  Biver is a living legend in the world of watch making. "The smartwatch could be dangerous for the Swiss watch industry but not for the art of watchmaking," he says. "Art is eternal and eternity cannot combine with anything that will become obsolete."  But Google manager Singleton is optimistic that smartwatches have a future. "Very few luxury watches are sold in comparison to cheap models. We're going to see big price differentials in smartwatches. Anything you wear on your body will always have a function as an expression of personality and style."  But what if technology one day changes human's habits so much that they no longer value the art of the watchmaker? "When that happens, humans have become robots," says Biver. "Humans will no longer be humans when they no longer have emotions and no soul." — dpa Related Stories You May Be Interested Lyft drivers sue Uber saying it spied on them to gain edge Interpol-led operation finds nearly 9,000 infected servers in Southeast Asia Uber, France spar over whether company is a transport service Borrowers have a funny way of showing gratitude How to own your first home with zero down payment Save the planet with a fun day out this May Others Also Read Serena fires back at Nastase for 'racist' comments Hong Kong couple arrested for fighting over restaurant bill Safe drivers to gain from easing of motor insurance tariffs advertisement Latest News Microsoft's Nadella banks on LinkedIn data to challenge Salesforce Brexit could imperil UK’s lead in AI, The Royal Society warns Tesla’s big Model 3 bet rides on risky assembly line strategy Sina chief steers China’s Twitter deeper into Internet finance FCC chairman expected to unveil strategy to reverse net neutrality Most Viewed in Tech Samsung to update software over ‘red screen’ smartphone Lyft drivers sue Uber saying it spied on them to gain edge Tesla’s big Model 3 bet rides on risky assembly line strategy FCC chairman expected to unveil strategy to reverse net neutrality Apple delays release of first original series Carpool Karaoke Old droids, new tricks We’re clueless about the coming robot job takeover, report says ‘Titanfall 2’ to welcome free update, ‘A Glitch in the Frontier’ Galaxy C9 Pro: On cloud nine Sina chief steers China’s Twitter deeper into Internet finance Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

The Apple iPhone 6s silicon case is $35 and it comes in a variety of colors that match up well with the four available iPhone 6s color options. Here’s a look at how the official Apple iPhone 6s silicone case feels, protects and looks on the new iPhone. Is the iPhone 6s Silicone case worth buying? After using the leather iPhone case last year, I opted for the Orange Apple Silicone iPhone 6s case that looks a lot better in person than it does in photos. If you love orange, this is certainly a case to consider. If you aren’t a fan of orange, there are 10 other colors to choose from. This is a very thin case so it does not add much to the thickness of the iPhone 6s — which is itself slightly thicker than the iPhone 6. You can use these new cases on the iPhone 6 if you want access to the new colors. A soft interior prevents any scuffs or scratches. The inside of the Apple iPhone 6s case is covered in microfiber to protect the finish of your iPhone while inside. One of the nice things about this thin case is that there is a lip that keeps the screen off tables and other surfaces when placed face down. This is something you may do more often thanks to a new iOS 9 feature that doesn’t light up the display when it is face down with Low Power Mode on. Edges keep the screen off rough surfaces. The raised edges don’t interfere with the new iPhone 6s 3D Touch feature that includes a press on the edge of the screen to activate multitasking and quick action home screen shortcuts. Apple’s design allows full access to ports and buttons without any compromises, which is common in thin cases like this. There is an Apple logo on the back in a slightly different shade of orange, that is similar to the logo on the iPhone. This silicone is much easier to grip than an iPhone 6s without a case. It is not too grippy to put in a pocket or get out of a pocket, but I noticed after almost a week of use that it does catch slightly more on gym short pockets than it did on the first day, so this is something I will continue to monitor. The official Apple iPhone 6s silicone case matches the Apple Watch band in orange. With a thin design this will not protect your iPhone 6s from huge drops, but it makes the phone easier to hold and will prevent scratches. Users who are prone to repeatedly dropping their iPhone may want to consider other options. You can buy the iPhone 6s Silicone case from Apple for $35 in 11 colors online or in stores. Apple sells a larger version for the iPhone 6s Plus for $39. Check out a collection of the best iPhone 6s cases you can buy in the slides below. 23 Best iPhone 6s Cases Speck CandyShell Clear iPhone 6s Case   1 / 23 The Speck CandyShell Clear is the first clear iPhone 6s case from Speck, and the first clear case from the company overall. This form-fitting, minimalist iPhone 6s case delivers a decent amount of protection with a military drop test 810G rating. Speck assures us that the clear case will not yellow with use like many cheap clear case options. The clear finish is perfect for showing off your iPhone 6s color choice while protecting it. Buttons move perfectly and are easy to find by touch and there is a raised front bezel to keep the iPhone 6s display off hard surfaces. $34.95 at Speck   1 / 23 6 Responses 10/01/2015 Tom Reply Is the silicone case is like the silicone case from last year ?

The series, which will premiere on Apple Music, was supposed to launch in April, but its debut has been delayed. Apple, a company known for its precisely coordinated product launches, declined to explain the delays, but said in a statement that "Carpool Karaoke: The Series will premiere on Apple Music later this year."Apple was originally planning to hold a premiere party for "Carpool Karaoke" in March, but the party was postponed. The party was then supposed to take place on Monday, but it was again pushed back due to the show's delayed launch. "Carpool Karaoke: The Series" is based on the popular Carpool Karaoke segment from "The Late Late Show with James Corden." Apple purchased rights to the show back in mid-2016 and showed off the first trailer for the series in February of 2017. The show, composed of 16 half-hour episodes, will feature celebrity pairs "riding along in a car together as they sing tunes from their personal playlists." According to Apple, the show's stars will also "surprise fans" who are not expecting to see "big stars belting out tunes one lane over." "Carpool Karaoke: The Series" will star James Corden, Will Smith, Billy Eichner, Metallica, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Chelsea Handler, Blake Shelton, Michael Strahan, John Cena, Shaquille O'Neal, Maisie Williams, Sophie Turner, and more, with a different host for each episode. Apple is aiming to drive more subscribers to Apple Music with "Carpool Karaoke," and the show, when it launches, will be available only to Apple Music subscribers.

They'd be beloved by many, could probably steal a bunch of you tubers if they wanted and they'd have at least entertaining content. But no, they insist on this crap. They have contact info for cooking, sports and entertainment podcasts with a built on audience but they'd rather pay for celebrities to sing karaoke.

This is the type of stuff that pisses me off. iTunes turned into a s-show because it was no longer "tunes". Apple Music is a brand new service and it's already debuting....a TV series? Don't they have something called Apple TV? I wouldn't be surprised if Cue was behind this. Everything he touches is a mess. Is this Iovine's "vision of the future" or something. My mom, a 65 year old lady that gets introduced to technology through me, HATES Apple Music. She always tells me how poorly it's designed. She does rave about her iPhone though, so she's no hater! Apple Music needs to be music and only music, otherwise it turns into iTunes... and we all know how that ended.

Apple Inc. has filed suit in China challenging Qualcomm Inc.’s fees for technology used in smartphones. Two suits filed by the iPhone maker accuse Qualcomm of abusing its control over essential technology to charge excessive licensing fees. (Ng Han Guan/AP) By Drew Johnson Monday, 24 Apr 2017 05:06 PM Current | Bio | Archive Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Apple recently filed a lawsuit in an attempt to bully the mobile technology company Qualcomm into giving away its intellectual property for next to nothing. The troubling move by the tech titan could harm U.S. workers, stall vital research and development efforts, and threaten America’s lead in the wireless technology sector. Intellectual property developed by San Diego-based Qualcomm is found in just about every smartphone in the world. Consequently, Qualcomm is one of Apple’s key suppliers, licensing thousands of mobile technologies it invented for use in Apple’s products, and selling the chips used in many iPhones. In exchange for licensing its crucial intellectual property for use by Apple, Qualcomm collects a small fee for every iPhone and iPad Apple sells. Analysts estimate the fee amounts to as little as $15 for a $650 iPhone. This agreement allows Apple to spend a miniscule amount on research and development— — publicly available data show Apple annually spends about 2 percent of its revenue in research and development, compared to more than 20 percent by Qualcomm — and enjoy an astronomical 60 percent profit margin. Still, that’s not good enough for the world’s second most valuable company. Apple is declaring war on Qualcomm, the very company whose inventions allow the iPhone to work. The corporate giant is suing Qualcomm to lower its already reasonable licensing fee. A careful look at the facts of the case show the lawsuit isn’t so much Apple vs. Qualcomm, but rather another step in Apple’s overarching effort to systematically squeeze its supply chain, exploiting the unique position of iPhones in the telecommunications market. Qualcomm licenses allowed hundreds of cellular device suppliers around the world to easily enter the market without incurring the billions of dollars in research and development costs necessary to invent the technologies used by their products. As a result of this cooperation between Qualcomm and cellphone makers, there are now more smart devices than there are people on Earth. When it entered the mobile market, Apple benefitted from the same easy-entry deal with Qualcomm. But now, nearly a decade after the introduction of the iPhone made Apple the most profitable company in history, Apple wants to bite the hand that feeds it. Apple decided squeezing its suppliers and devaluing the very intellectual property that built the mobile ecosystem is an easier way to increase profits than inventing its own technology. The company determined a dubious lawsuit was the simplest way to make that happen. This relatively unknown lawsuit will ultimately impact every American who uses a smartphone, as well as threaten thousands of jobs. The technology that powers the software and hardware inside your smartphone is what really makes it "smart." While most people have never heard of Qualcomm, it’s the engineering company that invented so much of the technology necessary for calling, tweeting, hailing an Uber, sharing a Snapchat and pretty much everything else we do with our smartphones. Apple is able to include Qualcomm technology throughout its devices thanks to the industry’s standard practice of calculating patent royalties as a percentage of the selling price for the device – a practice that has existed since the cellular industry began. These royalties allow Qualcomm to invest in expensive research and devlopment projects to create new technologies that make possible even faster, more reliable and more useful connected devices. This cycle of innovation ensures continued advancement in the mobile industry, and is already helping to usher in groundbreaking new technologies like 5G and the Internet of things. But Apple wants to upset that cycle, even though Apple alone already makes 90 percent of all global smartphone profits. Apple’s strategy is troubling  — intimidate a key supplier and alter the longstanding marketplace rules for paying fair market value for essential technology. If Apple succeeds, U.S. companies like Qualcomm will no longer be able to sustain their traditional role as the inventors of next-generation wireless technology. This vacuum will likely be filled by ambitious upstarts in China who can rely on the support of the nation’s communist government instead of licensing revenues to fuel their research and development. That may suit Apple fine, since the company already outsources virtually the entirety of the manufacture of the iPhone to Chinese contractors. But it would be a painful loss for U.S. workers and American innovation. Drew Johnson is a Senior Scholar at the Taxpayers Protection Alliance and National Director of Protect Internet Freedom.

Home Macs | 20 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (9) iLife and iWork Apps Now Free for Everyone by Josh Centers Once upon a time, Apple used to charge for nearly all its software, and especially productivity apps like the iLife and iWork suites. However, back in 2013, Apple made those apps free with the purchase of any new Mac or iOS device (see “New Free iLife and iWork Apps Share across Devices and Platforms,” 22 October 2013). Now, with no announcement or fanfare, Apple has made the current iLife and iWork apps entirely free for all users. Just to be clear, the change affects the following apps: GarageBand for macOS (requires 10.10 Yosemite) and iOS (requires iOS 10.2) iMovie for macOS (requires 10.11.2 El Capitan) and iOS (requires iOS 9.3) Keynote for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Numbers for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Pages for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) This is good news for holdouts who haven’t purchased a new eligible Apple device since 2013 but are running a supported version of the operating system and would like copies of the iLife and iWork apps. And it makes explaining the pricing easier for Apple. Why didn’t Apple just make these apps free for everyone in the first place? The answer likely lies deep within Apple’s accounting department. Back in 2013, Apple made iLife, iWork, and OS X 10.9 Mavericks free and bundled them with every new Mac and iOS device sold. That move enabled the company to delay recognition of a portion of its sales receipts. That’s because the product (a Mac or iOS device) wasn’t “fully delivered” without updates to the software — it’s a “subscription accounting” approach. In its Q4 2013 financial quarter, Apple delayed recognition of $900 million in revenue, in essence hiding that money from the quarterly report (see “Apple Q4 2013 Results See Lower Profits Again,” 28 October 2013). That may answer the question of why Apple is now making these apps free for everyone. According to Daniel Eran Dilger of AppleInsider, the deferred revenue trickles back into Apple’s reported revenues over 2 years for iOS and 4 years for the Mac. It has been about 4 years since this deferral likely began, implying that Apple has finally cleaned the associated deferred revenue off its books. In the end, this change doesn’t mean much. Any effects from iLife and iWork becoming free — on competing apps, on Apple’s revenues, and on the perceived value of Apple hardware, for instance — have already taken place. Most people who want to use the iLife and iWork apps have likely either bought copies already or purchased new hardware since October 2013. We suspect that sales to owners of older Macs and iOS devices have dropped to the point where it was no longer worthwhile for Apple to bother charging for the apps anymore.

Reply Jim Schmidt  2017-04-24 12:32 Yep, I found that out last night. I went to download Pages on my iPad, and found out I couldn't because I don't have iOS 10 on it. I went to upgrade the OS... and found out my iPad is too old for 10. Sad. Reply Ian Orchard  2017-04-24 20:08 I've got the same problem with my beloved MacBookPro that is now deemed to be obsolete by Apple. I can't upgrade my current copies of iWork because it can't run Sierra. Now if only I could find a way to stop Pages & Numbers from nagging me to upgrade. Reply Jeffrey Puritz  2017-04-20 17:33 You're an optimist but my lengthy experience with Apple tells me that like Aperture these apps are in for a long slow death by neglect. Sadly, I think that this is true for the mac as well. Apple is only interested in the products with the most revenue and it shows. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-04-20 18:15 Free may seem like a good thing, but nothing is really free. In this case we will be paying for these apps through hardware purchases, if we use an app or not. Then there is the question of app quality. Since Apple is not making any money off them anymore there is no stimulus to make these apps so good people will be willing to pay for them. The option to vote with our wallet has been taken from us. One sad example is the latest version of Numbers for iOS. The complaints and 1 star reviews are pouring in but Apple seems to be deaf and blind to them. Now that Numbers is free there is even less reason te expect Apple to do anything about this bad update. Reply Paul F Henegan   2017-04-21 03:55 No, they are not "free for everyone", only for those who have also upgraded to macOS X 12 or later. As Alfonso Scenna observes above, unless one is willing and able to run the very latest OS, there is no invitation to the party. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-21 09:39 You're right that these apps have specific system requirements, and we've updated the article to make this completely clear. However, that doesn't change the fact that the apps are indeed free for everyone. Your ability to run an app is separate from its price. Reply Karen Kirtland  2017-04-24 19:55 The upgraded 5.2 version of Pages I tried using was terrible when compared with the older 4.0 versions. It functions too much like the awful Word program for me to use it. I wouldn't upgrade any of my perfectly functioning iWork programs, free or not, based on the extremely negative experience with Pages alone. Reply Phil Seymour  2017-04-24 21:15 They are free because the latest versions are crap compared to 09 versions. Thankfully I have kept the older versions of Pages, Keynote, Numbers, iMovie, GarageBand and iPhoto. I have the new versions, too, but if I have creative work to do, I use the older versions that were designed with uninterrupted creative workflow in mind.

In a report from Mark Gurman over at Bloomberg, it has been revealed that Apple’s latest hire comes in the form of Jeff Norris, a specialist who used to work at NASA where he founded the Mission Operations Innovation Office of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab. Norris also led the efforts in creating new ways of controlling spacecraft and robots while in space through both virtual and augmented reality technology, so safe to say that he has some expertise in that area. It is unclear as to what Apple has planned for the technology, but we have heard rumors that the company could be working on some kind of AR-based smart glasses. A recently leaked document has hinted that could be the case but we can’t say that with 100% certainty. It is possible that it is true, but since testing and working on prototypes and trying out new ideas is pretty common practice for many companies, it shouldn’t be surprising. What the main question should be is whether what Apple is working on will eventually end up being a commercialized product. In any case this is just something we’ll have to wait and see for ourselves hopefully in the not-so-distant future. Filed in Apple >General. Read more about augmented reality and nasa.

Bloomberg reported that Apple has hired Jeff Norris, an 18-year veteran of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Unnamed sources told Bloomberg Mr. Norris was brought on to be a senior manager on Apple’s AR projects team. He is answering to former Dolby Labs executive Mike Rockwell. Apple Is Serious about AR Apple CEO Tim Cook has been speaking in Cook Code about AR for the last 18 months. While he previously dissed the idea of wearable computing on your face (i.e. Google Glass), he has more recently said that AR will become a daily part of everyone’s life. In that AR—by definition—involves one’s eyes, it would seem that some kind of eyewear is inevitable. To that end, Bloomberg reported in March that Apple was working on “a pair of AR glasses” that would be matched to iPhone. Current rumors and leaks have Apple intent on releasing some kind of AR product in 2018, and it’s going to be very interesting to see what Apple does. Hires like Mr. Norris, as well as VR plugin maker Tim Dashwood, show Apple’s commitment to being a serious player in this space. This is true both from the investment needed to secure such talent, but also from the standpoint of having something interesting enough to interest these people.

It happened in 2015, but went unreported until Monday. The New York Times offered an account of Tim Cook threatening to pull Uber’s app from the App Store if it didn’t stop behaving like a spoiled bully on at least one front. And, according to the story, Mr. Kalanick cried uncle. Uber’s Uber-Egregious Behavior I’m no fan of Uber. I love the idea behind Uber’s business model, but I find its entitled behavior, threats to journalists, misogynistic culture, and treatment of its drivers to be beyond the corporate pale. There’s a not-fine line between being disruptive and being a dick, and Uber has been on the wrong side of that line over and over and over again. The story behind the confrontation with Tim Cook involved Uber “fingerprinting” iPhones through the Uber app. This is the concept of identifying a device in a way that goes beyond app usage. Uber wanted to fingerprint iPhones to improve its ability to detect fraud in the form of generating fake accounts to earn referral bonuses. Fingerprinting iPhones, however, is against Apple’s developer guidelines because Apple is the one platform provider focused on protecting our privacy. But to Uber and its CEO, Apple’s rules were merely an obstacle to circumvent, and the company fingerprinted iPhones anyway. Then, in order to keep from being busted, they geofenced iPhones tied to people who worked at Apple offices. Those geofenced iPhones obfuscated the fingerprinting code—or tried to—so it would be hidden from Apple’s engineers. Well, lo and behold, Apple caught them anyway and Tim Cook called Mr. Kalanick to his office. It makes me think Mr. Kalanick should have been called to the principal’s office a lot more when he was a kid, but maybe that’s just me. During the meeting, Tim Cook told Travis Kalanick that he’d kick the Uber app off the App Store if he didn’t stop breaking Apple’s rules. And the thing is Uber needs Apple and its App Store. As The Times put it: For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was fraught with tension. If Uber’s app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers — essentially destroying the ride-hailing company’s business. So Mr. Kalanick acceded. Never Ending Uber Nonsense It’s just nonstop with Uber. It’s one bad story after another of truly obnoxious personal and corporate behavior, even while the company burns through cash like nobody’s business. And the problems always seem to come back to Travis Kalanick. From The Times: “Travis’s biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals,” said Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire investor who has mentored Mr. Kalanick. “Travis’s biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals. That’s the best way to describe him.” I personally suspect this is going to come back and bite Uber in its corporate butt. Even enormously valuable corporations have karma.

There are many other corporations that committed deplorable acts –financial fraud, toxic dumping, etc. But when Enron was manipulating the energy markets and defrauding whole states and millions of energy consumer, its energy traders were said to have been reveling in the very act of screwing other people. Uber/Kalanick is the only other major company I know of that is afflicted with a corporate culture that takes pride and pleasure in their misbehavior. A moral and ethical cesspool.

Mello Jr. Apr 24, 2017 2:54 PM PT Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has a reputation of playing fast and loose with rules, but it appears that a maneuver his company performed on iPhones took his ride-hailing outfit to the brink of ruin a couple of years ago. When Apple discovered Uber was planting code on iPhones that persisted on the devices even after the ride-hailing app was removed, Apple CEO Tim Cook warned Kalanick in a face-to-face meeting to stop the practice or the Uber app would be kicked out of Apple's App store, The New York Times reported Sunday. Uber cooked up the code in 2014 to fight fraud, according to the Times. Some drivers were buying black market iPhones, creating multiple email addresses on them, and using the addresses to establish Uber accounts. The drivers then hailed rides to themselves from the bogus accounts in order to collect incentives Uber was handing out to drivers who were taking on more riders. The code added to the iPhone helped Uber "fingerprint" the mobile device and foil the multiple account scammers. The only problem was the practice violated an Apple rule requiring that nothing belonging to a previous owner should be left on an iPhone after an app was wiped. Kalanick knew the rules, so he devised a way to hide the app's fingerprinting feature from Apple's engineers -- a ruse that was eventually discovered by Apple, the NYT reported. Not Tracking Individuals The article has raised concerns that Uber may have tracked people's movements, unbeknownst to them. "We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they've deleted the app," Uber said in a statement provided to the E-Commerce Times by spokesperson MoMo Zhou. The fingerprinting technique used by the company is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone -- over and over again, according to the company. Similar techniques are used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect Uber users' accounts, the Uber noted. "Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users," the company added. Uber's assessment of its fingerprinting code is correct, said Benjamin Mayo, an iOS developer in the UK. Saying that Uber 'tracked' users after the app was deleted is misleading. The app couldn't get location info or anything like that. — Benjamin Mayo (@bzamayo) April 23, 2017 No Stranger to Controversy The Times' story about Uber's subterfuge with Apple is just the latest in a string of negative stories about the company and its volatile CEO. The company recently has undertaken an investigation of its internal management practices, following allegations that managers routinely abuse employees verbally, physically and sexually. Because Uber isn't always welcome in the jurisdictions roamed by its drivers, some of them were using an app called "Greyball" to hide Uber activity from law enforcement. After The New York Times exposed the app earlier this year, Uber prohibited the software from being used against law enforcement. Although Uber has had a measure of success in Europe -- 7.5 million people hailed rides in 21 countries last year, the company said -- a case pending before the European Union's top court could result in the company's recategorization as a transportation concern and not a digital service, which would make things more difficult. And, of course, there is that viral video of Kalanick going ballistic on one of his Uber drivers who'd just given him a ride. New Breed of CEOs Kalanick, 40, isn't alone in his damn-the-rules management style, noted Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "There's a new batch of CEOs we're seeing, especially in the tech industry, that think they can do whatever they want to do," he told the E-Commerce Times. "They're pushing the boundaries of technology -- and in some cases, the boundaries of what's legal." In the past, two checks on CEOs who behave badly have been Wall Street -- through stock dips -- and Washington -- through regulation. Neither seems bothered by cheeky behavior at the moment. "The market has rewarded this new batch of brash CEOs," McGregor said, "and now we have a president that is unlikely to hold them accountable for not paying attention to rules and regulations." Disregard for Stakeholders However, there's a fine line between stretching the rules and systematically ignoring or breaking them, or believing they don't apply to you, cautioned Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. "The details that have come to light about Kalanick's personal behavior and his management of Uber suggest that he has little if any respect for his employees, investors, partners and customers," he told the E-Commerce Times. "I find that reprehensible," King said. "Evidence suggesting that a senior leader is a consistently bad actor can impact a company's reputation and its bottom line. It can also can lead to customers, partners and employees heading for the exits, and the talent needed for future growth and progress avoiding the company like the plague," he added. "That's the situation Uber appears to be facing today." John P. Mello Jr. has been an ECT News Network reporter since 2003.

Thanks for checking out our new design, please let us know if you have feedback SFist is a website about San Francisco View Pretty | Blog Arts & Entertainment Food News Popular Advertising Contact Newsletter RSS Feed Staff Our Cities Chicago London Los Angeles New York City San Francisco Shanghai Toronto Washington DC Profile Of Uber CEO Obsessed With Winning, Even At Nintendo, Reveals He Deceived Apple by Caleb Pershan in News on Apr 24, 2017 2:05 pm Travis Kalanick speaking in October 2016 via Getty Images Tech world talk on Twitter yesterday was devoted pretty much entirely to a profile of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick by New York Times writer Mike Isaac, a persistent tweeter and thorn in the ride-hailing company's side. Although the thesis of the article will be familiar to many — Kalanick has "openly disregarded many rules and norms" and his philosophy has become the defining strategy at Uber — some new details, including a telling tiff with Apple, illustrate that claim to great effect. Kalanick, writes Isaac, is a man driven to the point that "he must win at whatever he puts his mind to and at whatever cost." From the piece, we even learn Kalanick once held the world’s second-highest score in Nintendo Wii Tennis — who knows what he did to achieve that result, and the lengths to which he might go to take the top slot. Uber is currently under siege for using questionable tools and tactics to evade regulators, allegedly stealing technology from Google's self-driving car program through the defection of a former Googler to Uber, and fostering an environment in which "high-performing" male employees are allegedly granted impunity for harassing female employees (the subject of previous reporting by Isaac). From the new reporting, we learn of an, until now, undisclosed incident in which Uber was caught deceiving Apple. "Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased — a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple’s privacy guidelines," Isaac writes. When the deception was discovered, Apple CEO Tim Cook summoned Kalanick, demanded Uber stop the practice or be kicked out of the Apple App Store, and Kalanick gave in. "Crossing that line was not a one-off for Mr. Kalanick," Isaac asserts. After interviewing more than 50 current and former Uber employees, investors, etc., Isaac's portrait of Kalanick, 40, is one of a guy whose deeply driven attitude could also be a fatal flaw. Kalanick declined to be interviewed for the piece. "Mr. Kalanick’s pattern for pushing limits is deeply ingrained," the piece states, starting with his childhood in suburban Los Angeles, "where he went from being bullied to being the aggressor." Kalanick was also entrepreneurial from a young age, starting his own SAT test prep company before entering college at UCLA, where he dropped out to work on a startup called Scour, a Napster-like file-exchange site which was sued for 250 billion for alleged copyright infringement and filed for bankruptcy in 200 to protect it from the suit. Kalanick's next venture was Red Swoosh, where "Mr. Kalanick started exhibiting his hallmark aggressiveness," according to Isaac. "When the company struggled, Mr. Kalanick and a partner took the tax dollars from employee paychecks — which are supposed to be withheld and sent to the Internal Revenue Service — and reinvested the money into the start-up, even as friends and advisers warned him the action was potentially illegal." Despite serious investments from the likes of Mark Cuban, Red Swoosh struggled to the extent that Kalanick moved back in with his parents. Kalanick eventually moved to San Francisco and sold the company for $19 million. Some advisers, like Pete Yorke, were disillusioned already: Kalanick, said Yorke, a longtime tech executive, was "relentless in pursuit of his goals at the expense of those who supported him along the way, deluded by his own embellished personal narrative, and a serial prevaricator.” Kalanick, who lived in a Castro townhouse he nicknamed the "Jam Pad," got onboard with the idea for Uber, née UberCab, which friend Garett Camp in 2009. The rest is a history we're more familiar with, although there are some new details here. Kalanick, for example, considered running for governor, even registering a website, travs4gov.com, to position himself as a potential independent candidate. At one point during Uber's rise, he and Gary Cohn, the Goldman Sachs president-cum-chief economic advisor to President Donald Trump, spoke daily. He also began palling around with LA celebrities like Leo DiCaprio, many of whom invested in the company. In this phase, and until today, Kalanick's philosophy has been "growth above all else," and some described the exec as "emotionally unintelligent." A funny example there: "One friend recalled a night out with a group of married couples at the Gold Club, a San Francisco strip club, a few years ago. Mr. Kalanick, who was single, pulled out a laptop to work on a spreadsheet, crunching Uber’s numbers while friends watched the dancers onstage." Some of the tactics Uber employed to fulfill Kalanick's goals have already been revealed, but in the new piece, Isaac adds details like the fact that Uber dispatched employees to order and cancel Lyft rides en masse to frustrate its drivers. "Uber employees were also told to create computer programs known as scripts that would automatically vote for the ride-hailing service in city-administered surveys," Isaac reports. To get a sense of how Lyft was doing, the piece reveals that Uber bought info gathered by an email digest service, Unroll.me, run by Slice Intelligence. Unroll.me is a free email client that purports to help clear your inbox. What happened there is that "Slice collected its customers’ emailed Lyft receipts [through Unroll.me] from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber." Uber then used the data "as a proxy for the health of Lyft’s business." This revelation, by the way, has Unroll.me apologizing profusely on its website. Uber responded to the NYT story in a statement to TechCrunch, addressing in particular the claim of tracking users after they delete the app. “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app," a representative said. "As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users’ accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users,” an Uber spokesperson said.

Lovato told the Daily Press he won the award in honor of his friend, Jason Hadley, who passed away last summer. “Our team kept our promise to break last year’s fundraising goal,” Lovato said. “We did it to help High Desert families who have suffered a major tragedy in their lives.” Lovato, the president of Apple Valley Communications, was part of the nine-man team that campaigned for $1 votes and shattered last year’s fundraising record of $30,162. Foundation founder Julie Norton said this year’s candidates raised a combined $53,000 through aggressive fundraising events during the two-week voting period. The Man About Town celebration was attended by nearly 200 guests who enjoyed music by the Alley Cats, food, drinks and a chance to win prizes during the event held at Sunset Hills Memorial Park in Apple Valley. A highlight of the evening included candidates dancing to the 1960s chart-topping song “The Twist,” made popular by singer Chubby Checker. Business owners Carlos Sarmiento and John Thompson were runners-up, respectively, in the campaign that also saw Brad Smith, Pat Orr, Tony Colver, Chris Martin, Sergio Quesada and Dave McConnell make a run for the prestigious crown and bragging rights. Former Man About Town winner Eric Schmidt, who served as emcee, told the audience the record-breaking fundraising total was the result of spirited camaraderie, not competition. Lovato, who praised the hard work of his fellow candidates, said he enjoyed meeting them, making new friends and winning the crown for Hadley. “I wanted to win Man About Town to honor my good friend Jason who passed away last July,” Lovato, 40, told the Daily Press. “Jason and I were friends since seventh grade and he played a big role in my life.” Hadley died after he was struck by a vehicle on Interstate 15 south of Dale Evans Parkway. The 40-year-old from Apple Valley had pulled over to the right shoulder of the freeway to change a tire, according to the California Highway Patrol. “Jason and I would challenge each other in areas of business and life,” Lovato said. "We kept each other accountable and he made me a better person. I miss Jason every day." Hadley worked for the BNSF Railroad and ran a pool cleaning business. “He was a hard worker” and a father “who loved his five kids,” Lovato said. “I heard about the Phoenix Foundation, but never understood what they did until I saw them spring into action to help Jason’s family,” Lovato said. “That’s when I really understood what this organization is all about.” Lovato said campaigning for Man About Town helped his own “healing process” in grieving for Hadley. He also remarked that he took pride in spreading the word of the Phoenix Foundation’s work in the community. Founded in 2008, the Phoenix Foundation assists families when a loved one dies from an accident or a crime. For more information, go to www.hdphoenixfoundation.com.

In its annual environmental progress report, issued late last week, Apple disclosed that it has a deal to buy 200 megawatts of power for the Montague Wind Power Project in Gilliam County. Apple said this is the first wind project the company created itself. It’s due to begin generating energy late next year. Separately, Apple said it has a deal to buy power from a 56-megawatt project called Solar Star Oregon II, under construction a few miles from the Prineville, Ore., complex. Apple had previously disclosed it also is generating a small amount of electricity from a hydroelectric project on the Deschutes River. And the company said it’s also buying solar power from a collection of smaller Oregon arrays. Prineville, Ore., has just 9,200 residents, about 30 miles northeast of Bend, Ore. But it’s become a go-to locale for two of Silicon Valley’s largest companies, Apple and Facebook, because of large property tax exemptions that save those companies several million dollars annually. The data centers themselves aren’t huge employers — each company has several dozen Oregon employees. But they’ve brought hundreds of temporary construction jobs to the city, creating a housing crunch. And franchise fees generated by their electricity use have provided a substantial boost in city revenue. Apple has two data centers in Prineville, Ore., and is building a third. The site used 115,000 megawatt hours of electricity last year, according to the report, more than double what it used the prior year. It’s now Apple’s third-largest data center by energy consumption. Overall, Apple’s data centers — including facilities the company leases — used 778,000 megawatt hours of electricity in 2016. Pressured by environmentalists, concerned about the effect of that energy consumption on global warming, most large data center operators have committed to using clean electricity to power the facilities. Apple said nearly all its data center power came from renewable energy. Data centers also use huge volumes of water. Apple said it used 630 million gallons of water last year, a third of that at its data centers, which require extensive cooling to keep tens of thousands of computers from overheating. Last year, Apple reached a deal with Prineville, Ore., to use treated water from the city’s sewage system to cool its facilities there.

Edison, "genius is one per cent inspiration, ninety-nine per cent perspiration".   When Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak presented their 1st baby, a kit-form computer, to 'Byte-Shop' owner Paul Terrel back in 1976, Terrel was quick to see a potential problem and a gap in the market. "What I needed was an assembled and tested unit that could sell to people that really wanted to use them and not just to the technical audience", he recalled in a 2015 interview.      (Photo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/492319/Auction_Team_Breker_1.jpg )      (Photo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/492320/Auction_Team_Breker_2.jpg ) Convinced, the young entrepreneurs made their first sale of 50 assembled Apple-1 units for $500 each. The 1st ready-to-use PC was born! Wozniak and Jobs contributed genius and perspiration in equal measures while Terrel, as "honorary co-founder", provided the bolt of inspiration at just the right moment.

Starting next month, the rate for developers of apps that primarily promote online services will be reduced from 7 percent to 2.5 percent. Members of Apple’s link affiliate program received a notice Monday saying the commission rate from their apps and in-app purchases has been reduced to just 2.5 percent. The change will be implemented May 1, so from then on, link affiliates will claim a smaller percentage of earnings from their apps. AppleInsider, who also has an iTunes app, said though Apple did not state why the commission rate is being changed, it’s obvious the company is looking to retain more profit from apps and in-app purchases. The site also predicted this sharp reduction will greatly impact the small- to mid-sized websites that offer news content and reviews. On the other hand, Apple has decided to retain the 7 percent commission rate for affiliates managing media apps for music, movies, books and TV shows. The company has also indicated that affiliate commissions on Apple Music memberships will remain intact. This means there would still be a one-time 50 percent commission on subscriptions, MacRumors reported. READ: Apple hires NASA engineers for Project Titan App developer David Barnard posted the notice Apple sent him on his Twitter account. Based on the screenshot he shared, Apple has also informed affiliates about changes to the Affiliate Resources site. The tech giant has introduced a new Getting Started Guide, so partners can follow the step-by-step instructions on how to set up their accounts and make money. The Program Overview page has also been updated with more details.  The news comes less than a year after Apple announced a new revenue model for Apple Store subscriptions. The model implemented a year ago reduced Apple's take to 15 percent from 30 percent. AppleInsider said the company likely now is trying to make up for the lost revenue.  Apple has informed its link affiliates to a change in its commission rate.

Uber headquarters Ryan Young,New York Times Uber employees work in the company's headquarters in San Francisco. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By Mike Isaac     SAN FRANCISCO — Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, visited Apple's headquarters in early 2015 to meet with Tim Cook, who runs the iPhone maker. For months, Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple's engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased — a fraud detection manoeuvre that violated Apple's privacy guidelines. But Apple was on to the deception, and when Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting, Cook was prepared. "So, I've heard you've been breaking some of our rules," Cook said. Stop the trickery, Cook then demanded, or Uber's app would be kicked out of Apple's App Store. If Uber's app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers — essentially destroying the ride-hailing company's business. So Kalanick acceded. In a quest to build Uber into the world's dominant ride-hailing entity, Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered. He has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and grey areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow. But the previously unreported encounter with Cook showed how Kalanick was also responsible for risk-taking that pushed Uber beyond the pale. According to interviews with more than 50 current and former Uber employees, investors and others with whom the executive had personal relationships, Kalanick, 40, is driven to the point that he must win at whatever he puts his mind to and at whatever cost — a trait that has now plunged Uber into its most sustained set of crises since its founding in 2009. "Travis' biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals," said Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire investor who has mentored Kalanick. "Travis' biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals. That's the best way to describe him." A blindness to boundaries led Kalanick to a pattern of repeatedly going too far at Uber, sabotaging competitors and allowing the company to use a secret tool called Greyball to trick some law enforcement agencies. That quality also extended to his personal life, where Kalanick mixes with celebrities like Jay Z and businessmen including President Donald Trump's chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn. For the last few months, Uber has been reeling from allegations of a machismo-fueled workplace where managers routinely overstepped verbally, physically and sometimes sexually with employees. Uber's detractors have started a grassroots campaign with the hashtag #deleteUber. Executives have streamed out. Some Uber investors have openly criticized the company. Kalanick's leadership is at a precarious point. He has publicly apologized for some of his behaviour and is interviewing candidates for a chief operating officer. He has also been working with senior managers to reset some of the company's stated values. Through an Uber spokesperson, Kalanick declined an interview request. Apple declined to comment on the meeting with Cook. Many of the people interviewed for this article asked to remain anonymous because they had signed nondisclosure agreements with Uber or feared damaging their relationship with the chief executive. Selling efficiency After attending the University of California, Los Angeles, to major in computer engineering, Kalanick dropped out in 1998 to form a startup with several classmates. The company, Scour, became a peer-to-peer file exchange similar to Napster. Scour, which was eventually sued for $250 billion for alleged copyright infringement, filed for bankruptcy in October 2000, a move that protected it from the suit. The failure did not stop Kalanick from helping to found another Los Angeles startup, Red Swoosh, four months later. Red Swoosh made a technology to efficiently transfer large files of digital data; one of its investors was Cuban. With Red Swoosh, Kalanick started exhibiting his hallmark aggressiveness. When the company struggled, Kalanick and a partner took the tax dollars from employee paychecks — which are supposed to be withheld and sent to the IRS — and reinvested the money into the startup, even as friends and advisers warned him the action was potentially illegal. In 2007, Kalanick sold Red Swoosh to Akamai, a cloud services company, for roughly $19 million. The deal turned the executive, who had headed north to San Francisco, into a millionaire. Uber's rise The idea for Uber came in 2009 from Garrett Camp, a friend of Kalanick's, who became fixated on hailing a private luxury car with a smartphone app after being unable to catch cabs in San Francisco. UberCab, as it was called at the time, started its service in San Francisco in May 2010. Kalanick quickly positioned the startup as an alternative to the taxi industry. City-by-city regulations required procedures like base stations for cabs, safety measures and other stipulations. Kalanick ignored those rules. The company typically sent a small strike team into a new city to aggressively recruit new drivers through Craigslist and other online listings. Then the team marketed UberCab's app to increase ridership. That drew attention from regulators. In October 2010, the company shortened its name to Uber after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from San Francisco officials for marketing itself as a taxi company without the proper licenses and permits. Uber plunged into China in 2013, and Kalanick spent billions of dollars to outgun the local incumbent Didi Chuxing — only to have to retreat last year, partly because of heavy losses. Kalanick is now spending heavily in India to win there. For the win With Kalanick setting the tone at Uber, employees acted to ensure the ride-hailing service would win no matter what. They spent much of their energy one-upping rivals like Lyft. Uber devoted teams to competitive intelligence, purchasing data from an analytics service called Slice Intelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named Unroll.me, Slice collected its customers' emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyft's business. Slice confirmed it sells anonymized data based on ride receipts from Uber and Lyft, but declined to disclose who buys the information. The idea of fooling Apple, the main distributor of Uber's app, began in 2014. At the time, Uber was dealing with widespread account fraud in places like China, where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that were erased of their memory and resold. Some Uber drivers there would then create dozens of fake email addresses to sign up for new Uber rider accounts attached to each phone, and request rides from those phones, which they would then accept. Since Uber was handing out incentives to drivers to take more rides, the drivers could earn more money this way. To halt the activity, Uber engineers assigned a persistent identity to iPhones with a small piece of code, a practice called "fingerprinting." Uber could then identify an iPhone and prevent itself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its contents. There was one problem: Fingerprinting iPhones broke Apple's rules. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no trace of the owner's identity remained on the device. So Kalanick told his engineers to "geofence" Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., a way to digitally identify people reviewing Uber's software in a specific location. Uber would then obfuscate its code for people within that geofenced area, essentially drawing a digital lasso around those it wanted to keep in the dark. Apple employees at its headquarters were unable to see Uber's fingerprinting. But Apple engineers outside of Cupertino caught on to Uber's methods, prompting Cook to call Kalanick to his office. Kalanick was shaken by Cook's scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting. But only momentarily. After all, Kalanick had faced off against Apple, and Uber had survived. He had lived to fight another day.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple announces environmental progress in China Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple’s industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” “Our power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,” said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei. “We’re pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.” Lens’ manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes.

Norris has reportedly joined Apple as a senior manager working on the augmented reality team led by Mike Rockwell, who formerly ran Dolby Labs. The team is said to be working on the previously-rumored augmented reality smart glasses as well as AR features for future versions of the iPhone. Prior to joining Apple, Norris worked at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where he was employed since 1999. Along with founding the Mission Operations Innovation Office, he founded the JPL Ops Lab for developing human-system interfaces for mission operations, and he led multiple projects focused on human-system interaction with an emphasis on virtual and augmented reality. On his website, Norris features a speech he gave on augmented reality and Nasa's JPL Ops Lab, much of which was focused on augmented reality headsets and their uses. Under Norris' leadership, the JPL Ops Lab provided the Microsoft HoloLens to astronauts onboard the International Space Station and developed software for virtually working on Mars with the HoloLens. For the last couple of years, Apple has taken a deep interest in augmented and virtual reality, and is said to have a large team of employees working on the technologies and exploring ways they could be used in future Apple products. Apple has been working on both virtual reality headsets and augmented reality smart glasses, with the aim of launching the latter in 2018. We've also heard rumors suggesting augmented reality functionality could be incorporated into the iPhone, perhaps as early as the iPhone 8 set to be released this September. Apple CEO Tim Cook has expressed his excitement about augmented reality several times in recent months. "I think AR is that big, it's huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives," he said in February of 2017.

According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple has hired Jeff Norris, a specialist in new technology at NASA… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover The report cites “people familiar with the matter” and says that Norris joined Apple earlier this year, working as senior manager on the company’s augmented reality team. At NASA, Norris founded the Mission Operations Innovation Office of its Jet Propulsion Lab. Here, he led efforts to “create new ways to control spacecraft and robots in space with virtual and augmented reality.” As part of these efforts, Norris issued headsets to scientists on the ground so they could experience live Mars images. When he first joined NASA in 1999, Norris helped create software for controlling Mars exploration rovers from the ground. Apple has been ramping up its own augmented reality efforts. In March of 2015, the company hired Mike Rockwell, Dolby’s technology chief, to bolster audio and display technologies. Now, Rockwell heads Apple’s augmented reality team. Apple has also made a number of other notable hires and acquisitions in the space, most recently Apple hired the developer responsible for a number of virtual reality plugins for Final Cut Pro. It has been reported in the past that Apple is working on a pair of augmented reality glasses that could launch as soon as 2018. While specifics about this effort are unclear, a recently leaked document suggested that the glasses are in the testing phase at Apple. Meanwhile, a separate report claimed that Apple has at least 1,000 engineers working on an augmented reality project. Tim Cook has spoken fondly of augmented reality in the past, notably praising the technology on numerous different occasions. It has also been reported that augmented reality could be a headlining feature of this year’s iPhone 8, but again, specific information regarding its implementation is unclear. Tim Cook earlier this year: I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don’t have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it’s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it’s huge. While we still lack quite a bit of specific information about Apple’s augmented reality efforts, it’s clear the company has quite a bit up its sleeve in regards to the technology.

Apple typically announces new iPhone models in September and ships them out by the end of the month, but according to reliable KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via 9to5Mac), who regularly reports on Apple's plans, the OLED iPhone 8 won't enter production until October or November. The analyst pointed to the upcoming smartphone's "significant hardware upgrades", including the OLED screen and depth-sensing front camera and new 3D Touch module, as reasons for the delay. Apple iPhone 8 in pictures: Renders and leaked photos Which iPhone is best for you? KGI is warning customers of severe supply shortages "for a while” after launch. That means you may have to wait months before you can get the OLED iPhone 8, which is rumoured to be the most exciting of the three new phones. The other two are thought to bring moderate upgrades to the iPhone 7. You can read all about the three different models and what they're reported to feature from here. We still think Apple will announce the OLED iPhone 8, which will be Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone, alongside the other iPhones at the same event. You'll probably even be able to pre-order at the same time, as Apple could just list a later shipping date for the OLED one.

When Apple reports its second-quarter results, watch iPhone sales, gross margin, and guidance. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Apr 24, 2017 at 6:03PM After three quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue declines, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) returned to growth in its most recently reported quarter. First-quarter revenue and EPS increased 3% and 2%, respectively, compared to the year-ago period. With the tech giant returning to growth, shares have soared about 20% in the past three months. Now, with Apple's second-quarter earnings report coming up next week, investors will look to see if Apple can sustain its upward growth trajectory. Ahead of Apple's earnings, here are three metrics for investors to watch. Image source: Apple. iPhone sales As usual, Apple's iPhone sales for the quarter will be key. As the iPhone accounts for 64% of Apple's trailing-12-month revenue, it's no wonder analysts watch the figure closely. What should investors expect from second-quarter iPhone sales? Considering that Apple guided for second-quarter revenue to rise between 1.8% and 5.7%, year over year, it's likely that management expects a similar trajectory for iPhone sales, since the massive segment usually determines the general direction of Apple's overall revenue. In Apple's second quarter of 2016, the company sold 51.2 million iPhones, generating $32.9 billion in revenue. Therefore, Apple will need to beat these figures for the company to continue growing the important segment on a year-over-year basis. Gross margin Another area for investors to check on will be Apple's gross profit margin. Consistently reporting gross profit margin well over 35% for years, the company's lucrative margin is telling evidence of Apple's pricing power and its economies of scale. For Apple stock to continue performing well over the long haul, investors should ensure that the company can continue to maintain its heady gross profit margin. For Apple's second quarter, management said it expected Apple to have a gross profit margin between 38% and 39%. While this range is notably below Apple's gross profit margin of 39.4% in the year-ago quarter, it's still robust enough to suggest Apple's operational prowess and its clout with customers remain intact. Data source: Apple quarterly SEC filings. Asterisk indicates a figure based on the midpoint of management guidance. Chart by author. Investors should look for Apple to report a gross profit margin within its guidance range. Revenue guidance While Apple's reported iPhone sales and gross margin for its second quarter are important, the one figure that may be scrutinized the most could be Apple's revenue guidance for its third quarter. Since Apple has only recently returned to revenue growth, investors will look not only for growth in the current quarter but also for expected growth in Apple's third quarter. Ahead of an expected major overhaul to the iPhone this fall, it's possible that an unusually high number of customers are holding off on iPhone purchases until Apple reveals its 2017 iPhone models. Investors will get an idea of what to expect from iPhone sales ahead of the company's annual iPhone launch when Apple shares its revenue guidance for its third quarter. For Apple to continue growing its top line on a year-over-year basis, management's revenue guidance for its third quarter will need to exceed the $42.4 billion in revenue Apple reported in the third quarter of 2016. Apple is scheduled to report its second-quarter results after market close on May 2. The company will host a live conference call to discuss the quarter's performance at 2:00 p.m. PDT on the same day.  Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

We hear you. So did Apple and Nike. The tech and fitness giants are releasing a more subtle edition of the Apple Watch NikeLab this week—one that won’t look so out of place off the running track. The new Apple Watch NikeLab design features a space grey aluminum casing against a “Light Bone/Black” band—so, off-white on top and black underneath. Unlike the previous options (solid black or white, or black with neon green accents), the more laid-back color pairing doesn’t scream “fitness tech.” You can track your workout progress or wear it casually—without everyone in a 10-yard radius instantly knowing about it.

Our editor tested the watch's features out in December, and the Apple Watch NikeLab completely changed his feelings on running. You can only buy this edition of the watch on Nike's website, at NikeLab doors, and the Apple Watch Store at Isetan Shinjuku, starting April 27. No word yet on the price, but we'll pretty sure it’ll match or exceed the $369 sticker on the past options. Tags: fitness gearwatches Privacy Policy  |  About Us Copyright © 2017 Rodale Inc.

Email | 24 Apr 2017 | Print  ExtraBITS for 24 April 2017 by TidBITS Staff In ExtraBITS this week, Apple has apologized for erroneous email messages saying that iCloud storage or Apple Music subscriptions were discontinued, and Apple CEO Tim Cook chastised ride-sharing company Uber for spying on iPhone users. Apple Acknowledges Weird “Discontinued” Email Messages -- If you subscribe to iCloud storage or Apple Music, you may have received an odd email message from Apple saying that your subscription was discontinued last week. There was speculation at the time that the messages were sent by mistake due to a server hiccup, and that now seems likely. A few days later, Apple apologized to affected users, acknowledged that it had sent the messages in error, and confirmed that no changes to iCloud storage or Apple Music subscriptions were made. Mistakes happen — what matters is that Apple took responsibility for it. Read/post comments Tim Cook Dressed Down Uber for Spying on iPhone Users -- Ride-sharing company Uber has had a rough 2017 so far, getting caught in one sleazy business practice after another. But Mike Isaac’s report in the New York Times may be the last straw for many Apple users. It turns out that Uber was using its popular app to secretly identify and track iPhones, even after the app had been deleted and the phone erased. Uber went so far as to hide that code for anyone inside a geofence surrounding Apple’s headquarters. In early 2015, Apple CEO Tim Cook summoned Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to his office to order him to stop. Uber did, but as you’ll read in this lengthy biography of Uber founder and CEO Travis Kalanick, there have been plenty of other shenanigans since.

The update comes following the more significant update of macOS 10.12.4, which brought Apple’s color shifting Night Shift feature to the Mac for the first time. As for iOS 10.3.2, which is available for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch, we’re looking at another bug fix and security related update. Apple’s iOS 10.3 release included Find My AirPods, a new APFS file system, CarPlay improvements, and much more. iOS 10.3.1 was released a few weeks back, bringing its own share of  security and performance improvements, as well as 32-bit device support. To update your iOS device, head into Settings and search for the update, while macOS can be updated via the Mac App Store.

Essentially, Apple announced on Monday that it would be cutting the affiliate commission publishers make via the download of apps available on the iOS App Store and Mac App Store – to 2.5%. To give you some further perspective on this, before RazorianFly became RAZMAG at the beginning of February, over 60% of our monthly generated revenue –that ultimately keeps the site operational– would have relied upon this. Today, it’s more like 30%. But, that’s not the point. The point here is that Apple is ridding the need for sites like AppChase, TouchArcade, and AppShopper. 7% per sale was low, granted. However when that 7% reflects upwards of 50% –perhaps even, 100% in some cases– of the monthly revenue your site, app or service generates, a cut to 2.5% (a 64.2-percent reduction per sale) could be considered not just potentially detrimental – but the difference between your favourite site continuing to exist, and not. Ouch! Apple just slashed the affiliate commission on apps and IAP. This will impact lots of great sites/apps. pic.twitter.com/dbv7CboMX3 — David Barnard (@drbarnard) April 24, 2017 Apple knows this. I have a feeling that the firm eventually wants to become the sole curator of the app experience on iOS, (hence the reduced incentive for third-parties to cement themselves as ‘curators’). Either that, or it wants its affiliates to work harder. Or maybe, the decision is solely in light of wanting to make more profit … Whatever the reason, the cut is bad news for publishers. Those same publishers that recently embraced the firm’s own publishing platform – Apple News, likely in the hopes of taking full advantage of the bounties offered by the program at the time. Whilst I don’t believe that the company is doing this to intentionally cause the sudden shuttering of popular app-driven portals and review sites, (after all, the existence of these sites is directly beneficial as they help to drive traffic to Apple’s many digital stores – and if it wanted to do that, it could just remove ‘apps’ from being eligible in the program), I do believe this week’s reduced incentive is signalling a shift in focus for not just the program – but Apple, itself. Today, thanks to you, RAZMAG relies less on revenue generated from apps, and instead – just as we announced with our rebrand, earlier this year, has its focus on highlighting the latest across music, movies, TV, books and more … so, as of right now at least; we’re not going anywhere. But this week’s announcement could spell a worrying trend for those solely relying on the fruits offered by the iTunes Affiliate Program, going forward. Wrote a note on Apple’s decision to cut the rate of commission on apps. Seems counterintuitive. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ …https://t.co/YYV5Mq1UV8 — Arron Hirst (@ArronHirst) April 24, 2017 Sure, those aforementioned digital commodities are sticking at their 7% per sale commission bounty – for now, and Apple has also confirmed that it will continue to pay out on subscriptions to Apple Music (for both individual listeners, and students), so there are “a number of ways to [still] earn with the program” the firm wrote in its e-mail to affiliates. If Apple does start believing that its affiliates are deadwood, however, it’s not to say we couldn’t also see those rates reduced in the future – too. That would leave sites like this one to rely on other monetisation options such as Google Ads, or selling ads ourselves … and with ad-blocking solutions now rife, (even built into the mobile OS itself, in some cases) that could eventually spell the end. In a Cupertino meeting room: “App Store discoverability sucks! How do we fix this?” … “What if we kill sites that help people find apps?” https://t.co/xc66ye1zxt — Paul Haddad (@tapbot_paul) April 24, 2017 In conclusion, I’m not exactly sure why the rate is dropping … but I can assure you it will affect a lot of sites. Blogs, web publications and magazines that you love, you support … and that, I imagine, you would rather not want to wake up one morning and find … gone. The rate adjustment which will also apply to commissions made via in-app purchases is set to take effect, globally – on May 1. / Image Credit: @drbarnard Continue Reading You may also like...

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Share Written by Mike Murphy April 24, 2017 It’s been two years to the day since Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the Apple Watch, the company’s first new product line under his leadership, but revenue figures suggest consumers still aren’t sold. Apple’s biggest launch since the iPad in 2010, the Apple Watch was expected to be a hit: Given the massive financial success of the iPhone, it stood to reason that a companion device might be something customers craved. Not so much. Apple has never shared hard numbers on how many wearables it has sold, and doesn’t even break out Watch sales in its quarterly earnings report. Instead, the device is bundled into Apple’s “Other products,” which the company says includes, “Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories.” In the April-June quarter of 2015, the first quarter that the Apple Watch was on sale, “Other products” revenue jumped to $2.6 billion from around $1.7 billion in the preceding quarter. But after that initial spike, plus a slight bump the following quarter, “Other products” sales have been on a downward trend, and currently represent just 5% of Apple’s overall revenue. An updated version of the Watch, which debuted in September, doesn’t appear to have significantly impacted sales. Of course, a multibillion-dollar revenue stream is nothing to scoff at. But “Other products” is Apple’s smallest revenue stream, and only part of it is comes from the Watch. Even in quarters that saw a record number of iPhone sales, Apple could not entice a comparatively larger group of people to try the Apple Watch. Two years and two iterations after its launch, the Apple Watch has not proven to be as indispensable as the iPhone, or even as lucrative as the Mac, the iPad, or Apple’s services businesses. It’s unclear whether an iPhone-like overhaul, or attempts to market the watch directly to athletes or millennials, will ultimately make a difference. Apple’s second-quarter earnings, out May 2, could offer new insight into the Watch’s shelf life, but even that picture won’t be clear. This marks the first quarter since the newest member of Apple’s “Other products” category went on sale: the $160 AirPods headphones.

It looks as if the company now wants to become a quasi app store similar to Apple or Google's mobile versions. Amazon on Monday created a single spot for people to sign up to digital subscriptions from companies including the Los Angeles Times and digital file cabinet Dropbox. For the hundreds of millions of customers who have Amazon accounts tied to their credit cards, it's easier to buy from Amazon than handing over their personal information multiple times to sign up individually for Dropbox, the New Yorker and SlingTV.

Amazon has previously sold subscriptions such as these, but this is first time it has packaged them in one place for customers to browse and purchase. If what Amazon is doing sounds a lot like Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store for Android phones, you are correct. For now, Amazon's new digital subscription storefront is a pipsqueak. Amazon announces new products or services all the time that don't go anywhere. But the potential is intriguing. Related Content The three-second rule for online shopping Amazon ponders robot-run supermarket with three human staff The app stores from Apple and Google are hugely powerful gatekeepers for sales of online music, newspapers and magazines, digital video packages, food delivery subscriptions and software. If you're a company that offers a digital service -- particularly ones like Spotify or newspapers that are commonly accessed on smartphones -- Apple and Google call the shots that influence your business and stand between your success and failure. Amazon is giving companies an alternative to distributing their digital subscriptions without relying on the storefronts controlled by Apple and Google. Advertisement The new service is part of a trend at Amazon that isn't broadly understood. Of course everyone knows Amazon is the supreme gatekeeper for products. If your shoes or headphones aren't sold on Amazon, they don't exist in the minds of many shoppers. More quietly, Amazon has also become an influential storefront for non-physical things, too, like software subscriptions and online TV services. And indeed, the new digital subscription storefront mimics one Amazon started in 2015 for online video subscription services like Starz and Seeso, a comedy-focused Web video service. Entertainment companies were initially skeptical about Amazon's motives but changed their minds. For some digital video channels, Amazon quickly became the single largest seller of their subscriptions, according to a report last fall in tech news outlet The Information. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Amazon announces new products or services all the time that don't go anywhere. But the potential is intriguing. Photo: AP For companies that aren't well known -- and even ones that are -- selling subscriptions is a grind. They have to splurge on ads to get noticed, try free marketing tricks or hope that Google or Apple decide to feature them in the highly visible home pages of their app stores. Subscription services can easily get lost in the cacophony of Amazon, too, but the company can also suggest that customers who buy a book of New Yorker cartoons also purchase a digital subscription to the magazine. Amazon is good at selling subscriptions to its own Prime shopping club, which analysts estimate has 60 million to 70 million members, and it could bring that expertise to bear to sell outsiders' subscriptions, too. The real intrigue is whether Amazon would change the rules of the distribution game if it can join Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc's Google as the gatekeepers for all sorts of digital goods. For companies that opt to sell digital subscriptions through Amazon, it is offering similar revenue sharing as Apple's recently revised business terms for companies that sell digital services. For a customer's first year as a subscriber, the owners of a digital subscription keeps 70 percent of the revenue and gives 30 percent to Amazon. After the first year, the company's cut goes up to 85 cents of every dollar from the subscription fee. But what if Amazon decided to take an even smaller share of revenue from subscriptions, or none at all? Presumably that would put pressure on Apple and Google to follow suit. Companies have complained for years that they are giving away too much money to the owners of mobile app stores and would welcome an upstart who lets them keep a bigger slice of the pie. Spotify has gone so far as to recommend people pay for the music service away from Apple's App Store. For people who don't, the price of a Spotify subscription is 30 per cent higher to offset the revenue it has to share with Apple. For companies that rely on powerful gatekeepers like Google and Apple for their livelihood, an Amazon alternative for selling subscriptions could be a breath of fresh air.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The Case for Apple and Space Internet Go for it, Tim. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 24, 2017 at 3:41PM The more I think about it, the more it makes sense. There are some pretty compelling indications that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is interested in space internet, given the company's recent hiring of spacecraft and satellite experts. While Apple could be up to something else, building a constellation of satellites to beam gigabit internet to Earth could make sense on so many levels. Let's look at this potential moonshot from every angle, and by the end I think you'll agree with me: Apple should do it. Image source: Getty Images. Steve Jobs wanted to create a cell network There are old stories about how Steve Jobs had envisioned Apple creating a cell network for the iPhone, vertically integrating into that part of the value chain. Apple originally thought of building a network on unlicensed spectrum bands (like the ones that Wi-Fi currently operate in). While removing dependence on carriers sounds appealing on a strategic level, the idea didn't make it that far, probably since building a network is massively expensive; the largest U.S. carriers spend $20 billion per year in capital expenditures. Separately, there had been more recent rumors of Apple creating a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), buying wholesale capacity from the carriers and reselling it under its own brand. CEO Tim Cook promptly squashed that scuttlebutt in 2016, but there should be little doubt that Apple considered the idea. Why Apple keeps thinking about networks At the same time, you may have noticed that depending on third-party carriers has become a liability for Apple in some markets, particularly emerging ones. LTE coverage is quite poor in many parts of the world, which severely compromises the value proposition of mobile devices. For example, Cook has cited poor LTE penetration as one of Apple's key hurdles in India, but India isn't alone in this regard. Creating a space internet network has the potential to free Apple from third-party network road maps, directly bringing high-speed connectivity to every corner of the Earth. Importantly, this would allow Apple to sell an iPhone to anyone, anywhere. Satellite phones have been around for decades, but have historically been relegated to military and industrial uses due to the high costs. Regular cellphones are perfectly sufficient for the average consumer. But Apple has a long history of democratizing high-end technologies and bringing those technologies to the mainstream. Services revenue potential We already know that SpaceX is planning its own space internet network, which could launch as early as 2019. Thanks to documents leaked to The Wall Street Journal earlier this year, we also know the company's financial forecasts. SpaceX estimates that it could generate $30 billion in revenue in 2025 from delivering space internet service to 40 million subscribers. If we use those figures, that translates into about $750 per subscriber per year -- more than the average price of an iPhone ($695 in the fourth quarter). At $62.50 per month, that's just slightly higher than what consumers currently pay for cell service. SpaceX launch from January 2017. Image source: SpaceX. Another challenge for Apple in emerging markets has been the premium pricing of the iPhone. Imagine if Apple were to bundle iPhones with integrated service beamed down from the stars. Knowing that it could collect recurring revenue, Apple could justify lowering the upfront cost of the device itself in order to spur unit sales. On top of that, the company could improve its already high user retention, and still count on hardware upgrades at regular intervals. Let's call it iPhone-and-Space-Internet-as-a-Service (iPSIaaS). (Kidding.) This is all in line with Apple's growing services ambitions, and I think we can all agree that space internet is the ultimate service. A small price to pay Of course, we have to consider the cost to build and deploy such a network. Facebook had tapped SpaceX to launch an internet satellite to bring connectivity to rural Africa last year, but the rocket unfortunately exploded on the launch pad. It was a $200 million satellite intended for geostationary orbit, hovering above the Earth with an orbital velocity matching the Earth's rotation so that it would appear fixed to terrestrial observers. That would allow the internet satellite to provide continuous coverage for a designated geographical region. Apple could surgically launch internet satellites in regions that have the most strategic value -- namely, emerging markets where cellular network infrastructure is immature. Over time, perhaps Apple could expand to developed markets, threatening carriers in the process, but there would be much less need to start there. Each SpaceX launch costs a little over $60 million, a dramatic reduction from traditional launch costs, and that's before factoring in any discounts for customers that agree to launch on a reused rocket. For Apple, those costs are quite reasonable given how much a space internet initiative would make sense. Go for it, Tim. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple and FB.

Uber allegedly used a technique known as persistent digital fingerprinting on Apple devices in 2014 and 2015 which allowed the transportation tech company to track iPhones even after the app had been uninstalled or the device was wiped entirely. “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app… Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users,” an Uber spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement.  ‘My beliefs not shared at #Uber’: President of ride-sharing firm gives reasons for shock exit https://t.co/96Uc6Ogr9Xpic.twitter.com/m5T4qGpFkw— RT (@RT_com) March 22, 2017 According to an exposé about Kalanick published in the New York Times, Uber’s reasoning behind the digital fingerprinting was to fight fraudulent claims by drivers who hoped to take advantage of the company’s bonus scheme. Unscrupulous Uber drivers around the world would use stolen iPhones that had been wiped of their digital information to set up dummy email accounts, and thus dummy Uber accounts, and create multiple fake rides to earn more bonuses. The persistent ID tags helped combat such practices but were in direct breach of Apple’s terms of service which are aimed at protecting consumer privacy. In order to subvert Apple’s engineers, Uber then created a fake version of their app’s code which did not contain the persistent ID tag. The fake code would display any time a person at the physical address of Apple’s headquarters attempted to view it, in a technique known as ‘geofencing.’ #Uber CEO caught on cam having a heated discussion with driver https://t.co/R3mRSG7bws— RT (@RT_com) March 1, 2017 The limitations of Uber’s geofencing strategy soon became apparent, as Apple engineers located anywhere other than the headquarters in Cupertino, California could clearly see the suspicious code, and soon raised the alarm with Apple’s top brass, including Tim Cook. The tactics were so egregious that Apple CEO Tim Cook summoned Kalanick to his office and threatened removing Uber's app from Apple’s App Store if he did not end the practice immediately. Uber is already known for employing digital smoke and mirrors throughout its history, however. The VTOS (Violation of Terms Of Service) program was created by Uber to subvert authorities in areas around the world where Uber was resisted or outright banned. ‘Greyballed’: #Uber software identifies, avoids and deceives police https://t.co/AwTqquRWCZ— RT America (@RT_America) March 4, 2017 In particular, the Greyball tool was developed to identify, track and deceive authorities who attempted to use the app in an attempt to expose Uber’s operations in prohibited areas. Greyball would identify such targets and then send them phantom cars on the app that never arrived in the real world. Uber is also embroiled in a lawsuit which alleges that an Uber engineer stole 14,000 files from Google’s self-driving car program.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Introducing Nina, Case/Stand Hybrid for the Apple Pencil and iPad Pro One company, by the name of Datum Products, has spotted an unseen opportunity for the Apple Pencil in conjunction with the iPad Pro and has produced a new product named Nina to exploit it. In 2015, Apple released its Apple Pencil for the iPad Pro. The creative fields were at first skeptical, but for those who consistently make any drawing on any piece of technology, they soon learned that the Apple Pencil is a godsend. As a result, the Apple Pencil has become widely adopted as the stylus of choice for industrial designers, graphic designers, illustrators, architects, artists, doodlers, and more. However, there lie a few innate problems with the Apple Pencil and iPad Pro combo. Today, a new product by the name of Nina is here to efficiently and elegantly solve these problems.  The first issue is mobility. While the iPad Pro and Apple Pencil are relatively light, it is frustrating e to keep track of the Apple Pencil’s spare tips and minuscule lightning cable adapter. For this reason, the Apple Pencil needs a case, or else users will find themselves purchasing sets of pencil tips every other week. To remedy this issue, Datum Products created an elegant Apple Pencil case, easily holding all accessories in an intuitive and organized way. Inside the case are four tiny slots for the extra tips which can be removed by inserting the pencil into one of the tips. This storage system saves valuable space, making the case just twenty-two millimeters tall and thirty millimeters thick. What’s more is that the Datum Products team also built their case into a stand to provide the ergonomic ten-degree angle that is required for professional design. When the case is open, the top half can securely grip the iPad Pro to create a stand. Beyond this dual functionality, the design of Nina is just breathtaking. As an up-and-coming company created by product designers, Datum Products has created a product that fits with the Apple aesthetic, is sleek, and contains subtle, yet intuitive functionality. However, the road to mass producing this product is certainly not an easy one. Optimization, test production batches, and mass production are expensive obstacles to overcome. To remedy this issue, the Datum Products team has launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. Within the campaign, a supporter who is pre-ordering Nina will be treated to special discounts while supplies last. With this support, the Datum Products team hopes to make using the Apple Pencil more ergonomic and organized for users everywhere.

Uber headquarters Ryan Young,New York Times Uber employees work in the company's headquarters in San Francisco. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By Mike Isaac     SAN FRANCISCO — Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, visited Apple's headquarters in early 2015 to meet with Tim Cook, who runs the iPhone maker. For months, Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple's engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased — a fraud detection manoeuvre that violated Apple's privacy guidelines. But Apple was on to the deception, and when Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting, Cook was prepared. "So, I've heard you've been breaking some of our rules," Cook said. Stop the trickery, Cook then demanded, or Uber's app would be kicked out of Apple's App Store. If Uber's app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers — essentially destroying the ride-hailing company's business. So Kalanick acceded. In a quest to build Uber into the world's dominant ride-hailing entity, Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered. He has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and grey areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow. But the previously unreported encounter with Cook showed how Kalanick was also responsible for risk-taking that pushed Uber beyond the pale. According to interviews with more than 50 current and former Uber employees, investors and others with whom the executive had personal relationships, Kalanick, 40, is driven to the point that he must win at whatever he puts his mind to and at whatever cost — a trait that has now plunged Uber into its most sustained set of crises since its founding in 2009. "Travis' biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals," said Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire investor who has mentored Kalanick. "Travis' biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals. That's the best way to describe him." A blindness to boundaries led Kalanick to a pattern of repeatedly going too far at Uber, sabotaging competitors and allowing the company to use a secret tool called Greyball to trick some law enforcement agencies. That quality also extended to his personal life, where Kalanick mixes with celebrities like Jay Z and businessmen including President Donald Trump's chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn. For the last few months, Uber has been reeling from allegations of a machismo-fueled workplace where managers routinely overstepped verbally, physically and sometimes sexually with employees. Uber's detractors have started a grassroots campaign with the hashtag #deleteUber. Executives have streamed out. Some Uber investors have openly criticized the company. Kalanick's leadership is at a precarious point. He has publicly apologized for some of his behaviour and is interviewing candidates for a chief operating officer. He has also been working with senior managers to reset some of the company's stated values. Through an Uber spokesperson, Kalanick declined an interview request. Apple declined to comment on the meeting with Cook. Many of the people interviewed for this article asked to remain anonymous because they had signed nondisclosure agreements with Uber or feared damaging their relationship with the chief executive. Selling efficiency After attending the University of California, Los Angeles, to major in computer engineering, Kalanick dropped out in 1998 to form a startup with several classmates. The company, Scour, became a peer-to-peer file exchange similar to Napster. Scour, which was eventually sued for $250 billion for alleged copyright infringement, filed for bankruptcy in October 2000, a move that protected it from the suit. The failure did not stop Kalanick from helping to found another Los Angeles startup, Red Swoosh, four months later. Red Swoosh made a technology to efficiently transfer large files of digital data; one of its investors was Cuban. With Red Swoosh, Kalanick started exhibiting his hallmark aggressiveness. When the company struggled, Kalanick and a partner took the tax dollars from employee paychecks — which are supposed to be withheld and sent to the IRS — and reinvested the money into the startup, even as friends and advisers warned him the action was potentially illegal. In 2007, Kalanick sold Red Swoosh to Akamai, a cloud services company, for roughly $19 million. The deal turned the executive, who had headed north to San Francisco, into a millionaire. Uber's rise The idea for Uber came in 2009 from Garrett Camp, a friend of Kalanick's, who became fixated on hailing a private luxury car with a smartphone app after being unable to catch cabs in San Francisco. UberCab, as it was called at the time, started its service in San Francisco in May 2010. Kalanick quickly positioned the startup as an alternative to the taxi industry. City-by-city regulations required procedures like base stations for cabs, safety measures and other stipulations. Kalanick ignored those rules. The company typically sent a small strike team into a new city to aggressively recruit new drivers through Craigslist and other online listings. Then the team marketed UberCab's app to increase ridership. That drew attention from regulators. In October 2010, the company shortened its name to Uber after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from San Francisco officials for marketing itself as a taxi company without the proper licenses and permits. Uber plunged into China in 2013, and Kalanick spent billions of dollars to outgun the local incumbent Didi Chuxing — only to have to retreat last year, partly because of heavy losses. Kalanick is now spending heavily in India to win there. For the win With Kalanick setting the tone at Uber, employees acted to ensure the ride-hailing service would win no matter what. They spent much of their energy one-upping rivals like Lyft. Uber devoted teams to competitive intelligence, purchasing data from an analytics service called Slice Intelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named Unroll.me, Slice collected its customers' emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyft's business. Slice confirmed it sells anonymized data based on ride receipts from Uber and Lyft, but declined to disclose who buys the information. The idea of fooling Apple, the main distributor of Uber's app, began in 2014. At the time, Uber was dealing with widespread account fraud in places like China, where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that were erased of their memory and resold. Some Uber drivers there would then create dozens of fake email addresses to sign up for new Uber rider accounts attached to each phone, and request rides from those phones, which they would then accept. Since Uber was handing out incentives to drivers to take more rides, the drivers could earn more money this way. To halt the activity, Uber engineers assigned a persistent identity to iPhones with a small piece of code, a practice called "fingerprinting." Uber could then identify an iPhone and prevent itself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its contents. There was one problem: Fingerprinting iPhones broke Apple's rules. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no trace of the owner's identity remained on the device. So Kalanick told his engineers to "geofence" Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., a way to digitally identify people reviewing Uber's software in a specific location. Uber would then obfuscate its code for people within that geofenced area, essentially drawing a digital lasso around those it wanted to keep in the dark. Apple employees at its headquarters were unable to see Uber's fingerprinting. But Apple engineers outside of Cupertino caught on to Uber's methods, prompting Cook to call Kalanick to his office. Kalanick was shaken by Cook's scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting. But only momentarily. After all, Kalanick had faced off against Apple, and Uber had survived. He had lived to fight another day.

Right now, Galaxy smartphone and tablet users are focused on the Android 7.0 Nougat update and the problems its causing. And for good reason. The Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat update is starting to make significant progress in the United States and other countries around the world. While your focus is and probably should be on Android Nougat, there’s another piece of Android software lurking above ground. That update is Android O, the unnamed successor to Google’s Android Nougat (formerly known as Android N) update. The Android O update is confirmed and it’s available in beta form for Pixel devices and select Nexus devices. We expect Google to outline the next batch of details as Google I/O, its annual developer event, in May. Android Nougat is in focus right now but Android O and its release will slowly but surely creep into the heads of many Galaxy users around the world. Maybe it’s already in yours. Today we want to help you set some realistic expectations regarding the Samsung Galaxy Android O update and its release. These expectations aren’t aimed at power users. Instead, we want to help set proper expectations for new, and average, Samsung Galaxy smartphone and tablet owners. We also want to inform prospective Galaxy smartphone and tablet buyers. Nothing is confirmed but here are a few things we expect from Samsung’s Android O release based on its Android Nougat release for Galaxy devices around the world. Samsung Android O Beta Pixel and Nexus users have access to the Android O update right now, well ahead of its official release date later this year. Samsung Galaxy users can expect something similar down the road. Last year, Samsung launched a Galaxy S7 Nougat beta that allowed owners in select regions with select versions of the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge try out the software ahead of time. Samsung also ran an Android Marshmallow beta on the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, and Galaxy Note 5 back in 2015. These betas confirmed features and tweaks and they also provided Samsung with valuable feedback about bugs and other problems. It’ll probably be awhile before the company confirms its plans but we fully expect Samsung to launch an Android O beta for its flagship devices, a list that currently includes the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. The company is rumored to be working on a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 for release later this year and we’d expect it to make the cut as well. Samsung probably would’ve released a Nougat beta for the Galaxy Note 7, had it not started to blow up. If you want to be among the first people to try out Samsung’s next major operating system upgrade, you’ll want to think about picking up one of Samsung’s higher-end devices. Flagships Will Get Android O First Unlike Apple and Google, there’s a pecking order when it comes to Samsung Android software releases. Apple’s iOS updates go out to all compatible devices at the same time. Google’s Android updates typically do too. Samsung’s roll out process takes a lot longer and its often a painfully long wait for those with non-flagship smartphones and tablets. Samsung’s Android 7.0 Nougat update is starting to move a little faster but its been a long, drawn out process. The first updates started rolling out to the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge in January (Google first released Nougat back in August) and we’re finally starting to see other popular devices like the Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5, and Galaxy Tab S2 get their bump to Android Nougat. The company’s got a long way to go though. Many Galaxy smartphones and tablets haven’t received Android Nougat and many users will be waiting into the second half of the year for the upgrade. It’s impossible to predict how the Android O release will go but if we use Nougat as an indicator, most of you will probably get the Android O update in 2018. If you want new software as soon as possible, you’ll probably want to invest in a device like the Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S8 and not a mid-range phone like the Galaxy J3. Devices Will Probably Get Cut If you own a Galaxy smartphone or tablet that’s two years old or older start bracing for a life without Android O. Samsung and its carrier partners typically keeps Galaxy devices updated for two years before discontinuing support for major software upgrades. Popular devices like the Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Note 4 are still getting security updates and bug fixes but neither device is expected to get Nougat. Unless Samsung surprises (and it might), Android Nougat could be the end of line for popular phones like the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 5. Slow Updates for Unlocked Models The Samsung Galaxy S7 Android Nougat update started rolling out in January. And while it’s hit many devices, the U.S. Cellular models included, Android 7.0 still hasn’t rolled out to the unlocked models in the United States and other countries around the world. It’s unclear if this treatment will extend to the unlocked Galaxy S8 and the Android O release but it’s something you’ll want to certainly keep in mind if you already own an unlocked model or if you’re thinking about buying one in the future. Missing Features Those are a few things we think you can expect from Samsung’s Android O release. Now we want to talk about something you can expect from the Samsung Android O update. The Android O update is currently in beta which means a lot can (and probably will) change between now and Google’s official release later this year. It’s difficult to predict what features and changes Samsung might keep and what be different in its version of Android O. What we can say though is that you can expect Samsung’s Android O updates to be different from one another with older devices getting the short-end of the stick. Much like Apple’s iOS updates, newer devices tend to get more robust software. Take the Galaxy Android Nougat update for example. Samsung held back the Galaxy S7’s Always On Display feature from the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 5. It also declined to offer Nougat’s Video enhancer feature. We expect the Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+, and Galaxy Note 8 (if there is one) to get the best versions of Android O. Of course, there will likely be ways to get Android O’s best features on older devices but not everyone wants to deal with going through a bunch of hoops to get them on board. 3 Reasons Not to Install Galaxy S7 Nougat & 7 Reasons You Should Install Nougat If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 Let's start with some basics. If you value your security, and most of you probably do, you'll want to think about installing the Galaxy S7 Nougat update soon after it arrives for your device.  Every month, Google and Samsung release important security patches for Android devices. The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Android Nougat updates should bring the latest security patches to your device. Samsung's initial batch of Galaxy S7 Nougat updates delivered the company's January security update while upcoming updates could deliver the patches from the February security update. You can read more about their contents on Samsung's website.  If you failed to download or receive an older security update (December, November, etc), the patches from those updates might be baked into your version of Nougat. If not, you might be forced to install them manually before you can download Nougat.  On top of the patches, Samsung's Galaxy S7 Nougat update brings Samsung Pass, a way to secure your identity using biometric data rather than entering your password or ID.  Samsung Pass is like a master key for your various logins and it relies on Galaxy S7's fingerprint scanner. The biometric data is encrypted and stored safely by Samsung Knox.   1 / 10 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Leased footprint now consumes close to one-quarter of Apple’s total data center energy consumption. Fiscal 2016 was the first year Apple started tracking its exact energy use in colocation facilities using meters and reporting it as part of the company’s global footprint in its environmental report, offering for the first time a glimpse into the scale of its leased capacity and how quickly that scale has increased over the years. This rate of growth illustrates just how much hyper-scale cloud platforms still rely on leased data centers, despite also spending enormous sums on building out their own server farms around the world every year. In addition, Apple’s focus on energy supply of these third-party facilities is an example of the growing demand for colocation services powered by renewable energy, which many providers and their customers have been observing recently. See also: Here’s How Much Energy All US Data Centers Consume More than 99 percent of energy powering its leased data centers came from renewable sources, Apple said in the report. All energy powering data centers the company owns and operates on its own comes from renewable sources, according to the company. Apple started using leased data centers in a big way in 2012; before then, it relied almost exclusively on its own capacity. As Data Center Knowledge reported at the time, it signed one of its first major data center leases in 2011 with DuPont Fabros Technology — a 2.3 MW deal in Silicon Valley. Its leased capacity has been growing by leaps and bounds since. Apple’s newly released historical colocation energy use figures illustrate the trajectory (click chart to enlarge): (Data source: Apple Environmental Responsibility Report 2017) Companies like Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon all rely on leased data centers to expand the reach of their global networks in addition to building their own mega-server farms. Third-party providers enable them to move into hot new markets quickly or get into new markets whose future growth prospects are uncertain, making investment in big local construction projects too risky. The cloud giants also take small amounts of capacity in various colocation data centers around the world to cache content closer to their end users, which improves their application performance. While its colocation footprint is growing, the bulk of Apple’s computing power still lives in data centers the company builds and operates on its own. Those data centers are in Maiden, North Carolina; Newark, California; Prineville, Oregon; Reno, Nevada; and Mesa, Arizona. New Apple data centers are under construction in Viborg, Denmark, and Athenry, Ireland. Together, its live data centers, including both owned and leased (colocation) facilities, consumed about 780,000 megawatt-hours of energy in fiscal 2016 (Click chart to enlarge): (Data source: Apple Environmental Responsibility Report 2017) Leasing a lot of capacity around the world makes the cloud giants’ goals of reaching 100 percent renewable energy supply for their operations harder to meet. Colocation providers have to take all their customers’ needs into consideration, as well as their own interests, factors that often lead them to build data centers in places where clean power is not easily obtainable or not obtainable at rates that work for their bottom line. But since more and more companies want third-party data centers that use renewable energy, and since the cost of renewable energy has come down in recent years, more and more data center providers have been willing to make the extra investment required to help their clients meet their sustainability goals. For example, Infomart Data Centers, which serves hyper-scale customers (including LinkedIn), this year started buying renewable energy to power its entire Silicon Valley data center campus. The price premium for renewables, the company said, is about 6 percent more than the “higher-carbon alternative.” Had it done the deal a few years earlier, it would’ve had to pay a lot more. “We could’ve cut this deal five years ago; the price premium would’ve been higher,” John Sheputis, Infomart president, told DCK in an interview. Today, “the premium to be all green is acceptable.” Data center providers that recently made big investments in renewables also include Equinix, Digital Realty Trust, and Switch, among others. Results of a colocation user survey Data Center Knowledge conducted last year showed a clear uptick in interest in third-party data center services powered by renewable energy.

(AAPL) Self-Driving Car Technology Looks Like AAPL's platform is called the Apple Automated System, and it has been outed by a training manual By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 24, 2017, 11:38 am EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     Popular Posts: Intel Corporation (INTC) Reportedly Rushing New Chips Because of AMD’s Ryzen Apple Inc. Wants to Make Recycled iPhones Apple Inc. (AAPL) Rumor Points to Multi-User Support for iOS 11 Recent Posts: What Apple Inc. (AAPL) Self-Driving Car Technology Looks Like Intel Corporation (INTC) Reportedly Rushing New Chips Because of AMD’s Ryzen Apple Inc. Wants to Make Recycled iPhones View All Posts The rumors have been flying for several years that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is secretly working on autonomous driving technology. We even had the code name for the effort: Project Titan. However, the cat was officially out of the bag two weeks ago when AAPL received a permit to test an autonomous car in California. Source: Apple Now, thanks to official training documents obtained by Business Insider, we know what Apple’s self-driving car technology looks like. Why Apple Is Interested in Autonomous Car Technology The closest Apple has ever come to releasing a product for automobiles is its CarPlay standard for integrating an iPhone into a car’s entertainment system. So why the apparent fascination with futuristic auto technology like an autonomous car? The company has exploded in value and influence over the past decade because of the iPhone, but it’s looking for the next big hit. With the success Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has had, and the publicity Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has reaped from it’s self-driving car program, Apple clearly saw an opportunity. Over 88 million cars and light duty trucks were sold in 2016 and the revenue for automotive suppliers alone surpassed $670 billion in 2015. Even carving out a small slice of this market would be huge for AAPL stock holders. We started to hear about Apple’s Project Titan in 2015. At first, it was thought to be an electric car to compete with Tesla. Even Tesla’s Elon Musk seemed convinced Apple was preparing to directly take on his company. However, last fall there was an apparent shake-up in Project Titan. It was believed that Apple was pivoting from developing its own electric Apple car to instead developing an autonomous car software platform it could sell to automakers. Two weeks ago, Apple officially tipped its hand. The company received a permit to drive three Lexus vehicles equipped with autonomous car technology on California roads. Apple’s Self-Driving Car Technology Outed by Training Manual Business Insider got the scoop on what AAPL is up to by obtaining a copy of a training manual and official government documentation filed by the company. Called the Apple Automated System, AAPL’s self-driving car platform uses a combination of hardware and software. Apple says its system is “capable of sending electronic commands for steering, accelerating, and decelerating and may carry out portions of the dynamic driving task.” The documentation describes the testing Apple drivers must undergo on a private course before being allowed to take the Lexus autonomous car onto public roads. It also includes photographs of the cockpit of the cars and even details the modifications made to the vehicles. AAPL has equipped its test cars with a steering wheel and pedals made by Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) –the manufacturer of video game peripherals. The human “driver” can instantly take over control of the self-driving car by touching the brakes or grabbing the steering wheel. Where Does the Apple Automated System Go From Here? The end game for the Apple Automated System is clearly not to power an Apple car. At least not yet. Instead, AAPL will take aim at the traditional auto makers, hoping to convince them to license its system in their vehicles instead of spending the time and money to develop their own in-house technology. Even though it’s now public knowledge, expect AAPL to remain tight-lipped on its autonomous car project. The Apple Lexus test vehicles will be spotted on California roads, but with so much at stake — Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) recently dropped $15 billion on Mobileye to develop its own autonomous vehicle platform — Apple is likely to keep its cards close until it’s ready for the big reveal. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The engineers reportedly will work on the company's self-driving venture, said the Wall Street Journal, which obtained documents related to the company's autonmous vehicle plan.  The NASA engineers, who will test Apple's self-driving car software, have previously worked on detection of 3D objects and motion planning algorithms.

The documents include a copy of the testing process Apple used to certify six drivers who will pilot three modified 2015 Lexus RX450h SUVs. Read: Apple Self-Driving Car Program To Be Tested In California Last week, it was reported Apple was moving away from its self-driving car plans and focusing on developing apps instead. The report said the fact that only three vehicles are involved in the tests suggests the company is focusing on its CarPlay connectivity and infotainment platform, rather than autonomous technology. Meanwhile, a March report said Apple was quietly operating a research lab in Switzerland and had hired computer visions and robotics researchers, possibly for Project Titan. Other tech companies, such as Uber, Amazon and Google, are also working on autonomous cars. On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported Amazon has created a 12-person team focused on driverless-vehicle technology to improve shipping operations.

The LG G6 will be available exclusively via Amazon India for online sales, and can also be purchased from offline stores starting Tuesday, April 25. LG has some launch offers like Rs. 10,000 cashback for HDFC and SBI credit card holders, applicable only on Tuesday on Amazon India, a 50 percent off on the LG Tone Active+ HBS-A100 wireless headset, which is valid till May 31 and the company has also detailed a Reliance Jio offer, where LG G6 users will get additional 10GB on every recharge of Rs. 309, translating to an additional 100GB until March 2018. A report states that LG Electronics India, also plans to launch a new range of affordable smartphones equipped with features tailored for local requirements around Diwali. With smartphone revenue currently accounting for a minuscule part of the total business, LG Electronics India Managing Director Ki Wan Kim said the company will try to understand consumer feedback with the new products without setting any targets. Flipkart Apple Days Sale offers big discounts on Apple products Flipkart is back with its Apple Days Sale, hosting discounts and offers on iPhone, MacBook Pro, Apple Watch, and more Apple devices for three days, which ends on Wednesday, April 26. The biggest deal is a flat Rs. 20,000 discount on the iPhone 7 256GB variant. There's a further exchange discount applicable of up to Rs. 19,000 depending on the phone you exchange it with and extra 5 percent off on Axis Bank Buzz Credit Cards as well. The new Apple MacBook Pro range has the exchange offer of up to Rs. 15,000 while the MacBook Air is priced at Rs. 54,990 with the Axis Bank Buzz Credit Card offer. The iPhone 6 16GB gets Rs. 26,010 off, and can be bought for as less as Rs. 25,990 while there are varying discounts are also offered on the iPhone 6s, iPhone SE, and iPhone 5S.  Nokia 3310 (2017) said to release on April 28 The Nokia 3310 (2017) has certainly been the Nokia phone that has grabbed the most attention and headlines than others since the company announced its comeback, and now it seems like it will be made available later this month. The device's pre-order listings for Germany and Austria have tipped a release date of April 28. However, the Nokia 3310 may be a little more expensive than the price announced at the time of global unveiling, if listings spotted across Europe are any indication. HMD Global has confirmed that the feature phone will only support 2G, despite some recent reports to the contrary. iPhone 8 leaked images tip conflicting designs Apple is set to launch an anniversary edition iPhone alongside the iterative updates this September and now, few live images of a purported iPhone 8 dummy model have been leaked by tipster Benjamin Geskin shed light on its design. These images indicate that it will sport a glass back with 2.5D curved glass and a vertical dual camera setup. The front is also all glass, with no bezel visible. There is also no fingerprint scanner at the back, and no Home Button in the front, indicating that the fingerprint scanner could indeed be embedded underneath the display. The tipster also states that the iPhone 8 will sport dual front cameras as well - a first for the series if true - and will be 7.1mm thin. Geskin also notes that the camera bump is still visible, and is not flushed as expected. RCom-Aircel merger gets shareholders' approval  Reliance Communications (RCom) has received 99.99 percent shareholders approval for merger of its wireless business with Aircel, a company statement said in New Delhi on Monday. It was also approved by shareholders of RTL at their meeting held on Monday pursuant to the order of the NCLT, the statement from the company added. The shareholders of Aircel have also approved the said scheme at their meeting held on April 22, 2017, convened under the order of the NCLT. Vodafone's new international roaming pack offers unlimited calls and data in three countries  Vodafone India on Monday unveiled a new international roaming pack, called Vodafone i-Roam FREE. It offers "home-like tariffs while roaming in 47 countries," and offers free unlimited calls and high-speed data in the US, UAE, and Singapore - in other countries, pack users will get incoming calls free, while data will be chargeable at Re. 1 per MB and outgoing calls at Re. 1 per minute. The Vodafone i-Roam FREE pack is available in four denominations. A Rs. 500 pack is valid for 24 hours, a Rs. 2,500 pack is valid for 7 days, a Rs. 3,500 pack is valid for 10 days, while a Rs. 5,000 pack is valid for 30 days.  Samsung Galaxy S8's Bixby button can now be remapped Soon after the launch of Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ smartphones, it was found that the dedicated Bixby button on the devices could be reconfigured and Samsung wasn't helping when it blocked a remapping workaround by pushing out an update. Now, the Bixby Button Remapper app on Android, as the name suggests, allows users to remap the dedicated physical Bixby button to launch most of the services on the device. Notably, the app is able to remap the button to launch the camera app, flashlight, power menu, and even Google Now among others, but doesn't seem to be capable of launching Google Assistant as of now. Some early adopters of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ also complained about a red-tint issue on the display. Now, Samsung has said that a software update would fix the problem by allowing users to readjust colours over a wider range than at present. Apple CEO threatened to drop Uber's app over iPhone tagging If a new in-depth report is to be believed, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick was once warned by Apple CEO Tim Cook for not following the App Store guidelines, even threatening that the Uber app would be kicked out of the App Store. A New York Times report says that Kalanick met Cook early in 2015 at Apple's headquarters, and was pulled up for the app's ability to persistently identify iPhone devices in a process called "fingerprinting", which violated Apple's privacy guidelines. Contradicting the New York Times report, Uber has told Engadget that it "absolutely" does not track individual users after they've deleted the app. Gionee M6S Plus with 6GB of RAM and 6020mAh battery launched Gionee on Monday launched its new M6S Plus smartphone in China, which comes with some really interesting specifications to say the least like a 6020mAh battery and 6GB of RAM. The phone will be made available in two storage variants with - 64GB and 256GB of inbuilt storage. The pricing for the phone starts from CNY 3,499 (roughly Rs. 32,800) and goes up to CNY 4,299 (roughly Rs. 40,200) for the 256GB storage variant. It has gone up for bookings, with the first sale on May 2. Moto Z2 Play render images leak Many Moto smartphones are in the works for release this year, according to recent leaks, and now the Moto Z2 Play has joined the bandwagon. The device has been leaked by TechnoBuffalo this time, and it shows the back, front and side of the phone. All in all, the Moto Z2 Play looks a lot like its powerhouse predecessor Moto Z Play, except for probably the Home Button design. The phone also has the connected pins at the back bringing support for Moto Mods. TCL launches new VR Goggles for its 562 smartphone in India  TCL India launched the 562 smartphone in India last year, and now it has introduced a new VR headset in the country. The company's new VR Goggles can be purchased alongside the TCL 562 smartphone from Amazon India at Rs. 13,999. The VR Goggles have a Micro-USB port to connect the TCL 562 seamlessly, and will allow users to stream virtual reality content. Games can also be downloaded onto the device from the VR Store built-in app. uTorrent will soon be available in your Web browser, says BitTorrent founder  While online piracy has faced some setbacks in the past few years, it seems like Web pirates now have something new to look forward to. BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen said that the "new revision" of the uTorrent client will run in user's default browser and will provide a "nicer experience" than the current version, as per a report by TorrentFreak. However, it seems that the company realises that pushing out such a major change to the torrent client can easily back-fire if users do not react to it positively. This is why the transition to browser will be pushed out widely only after receiving feedback from users. Microsoft tipped to take on Chromebooks at May 2 event  Microsoft is set to host a special software and hardware event on May 2 and a fresh leak seems to give clarity on what may be launched at the event. The Redmond-based giant is looking to unveil its Windows 10 Cloud software - a more metered down OS targeted at students - and is also expected to launch a device running on the previously rumoured Windows 10 Cloud platform, in a bid to beat Chromebooks at its own game.  Windows Central has leaked a screenshot of minimum specifications required for a device running on Windows 10 Cloud, which includes a quad-core Celeron (or better) processor, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB or 64GB of storage. Optional pen or touch support is also included.

We already knew the iPhone 8 will face delays, as multiple reports detailed some of Apple’s component-related problems. But a new report from the most reputable Apple insider in the world  indicates things may be even worse than we thought. Don't Miss: Apple’s new W1-equipped BeatsX earbuds are discounted on Amazon for the first time ever KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, a steady source of accurate Apple reports, said in a note seen by 9to5Mac that the iPhone 8 will be delayed by one to two months. iPhone 8 mass production will be pushed back to October/November rather than the expected August/September timeframe. As a result, Apple’s bottom line will take a serious hit, as buyers are expected to wait for the iPhone 8 rather than upgrade to the iPhone 7s. Kuo says the iPhone 8 features “significant hardware upgrades” that are responsible for the production delays, including the custom OLED display, the A11 10nm chip, the new 3D Touch module and the 3D sensing cameras. The analyst says that Apple has custom-ordered several “major cutting-edge components,” which might explain the manufacturing delays. He also says that the iPhone 8 will see shortage supplies “for a while” after launch. The report offered a more pessimistic outlook for the iPhone 7s as well, as the phone might not seem like a great alternative to all the full-screen smartphones launching from Samsung and other Android device makers this year. KGI now expects Apple to sell 80-90 million iPhones in the second half of the year, down from the firm’s initial forecast of 110 million units.

Michael McConnell April 24, 2017 24-04-2017 5 minutes Apple IDs, AirPods, and APFS: What’s New in iOS 10.3? Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email Apple has released iOS 10.3, and you may find yourself asking, “What makes it worth the update? iOS 10 Is Here! Why You Should Upgrade Right Now iOS 10 Is Here! Why You Should Upgrade Right Now Apple's tenth revision of its mobile operating system is here. This is how to upgrade right now for free. Read More ” Turns out there are quite a few new features to make it worth your while. There’s a new way to manage your Apple IDs all in one place, find my iPhone now includes support for AirPods, and there are new Siri and Carplay features Siri vs. Alexa: Which Personal Assistant Is Better? Siri vs. Alexa: Which Personal Assistant Is Better? The answer to "Alexa or Siri?" is likely going to depend a lot on your personal needs and opinions. We've come up with a head-to-head comparison in the areas that matter. Read More . Safari has also had a small update, along with security and bug fixes. Finally, this is the public debut of APFS. Wondering what all of that means? Let’s take a closer look at these changes. All Your Apple IDs and Devices in One Place You have always been able to keep separate accounts for iCloud and iTunes. However, managing each account has involved going between several menus on iOS. Now, iOS 10.3 consolidates your account settings into a single menu within settings. When opening the Settings app, there is a new banner at the top with your name. Tap that to open a page that shows your iCloud, iTunes Store, and Family Sharing settings. After scrolling down, you see a list of devices you have registered to your iCloud account. If you want to update the info on your account, tap through the first three entries on the list. The Name, Phone Numbers, Email menu holds your basic contact information. Also listed are your available email addresses for the Messages app. The next entry is Password & Security, which lets you change your password or contact email. This menu also allows you to turn on 2-factor authentication, but hopefully you have already done that. Protect Your iCloud Account With These 4 Easy Steps Protect Your iCloud Account With These 4 Easy Steps Have you taken steps to make sure that no one gets access to your iCloud information? Here's what you need to do to make sure your iCloud account is as secure as possible. Read More  Payment and Shipping covers your default credit card. If you have a shipping address on file with the Apple Store, it is listed here as well. The next set of entries applies to your various accounts. The first entry is the iCloud account. Tap this to see a summary of your storage usage on iCloud Drive, as well as granular permissions for each app you use. The second entry is your iTunes account. Here you can turn on automatic downloads from iTunes, iBooks, and the App Stores. The third is Family Sharing where you can add and remove the family accounts you share Set Up Family Sharing & Share Apps, Music & Other iTunes Purchases Set Up Family Sharing & Share Apps, Music & Other iTunes Purchases You and your family members probably have separate iTunes accounts for your app and music purchases, but there's no reason you should be paying for the same apps multiple times. Read More . These three entries previously existed as separate menus throughout the Settings app. It is not a significant change, but it is a nice touch to bring this account management into one place. The next section consists of your devices tied to your iCloud account. You can click each one, and see if it has Find My Device activated. In fact, if you have lost a device, you can get straight to the Find My iPhone app (for devices with location services) to see its last logged location. If there is a connected device you already wiped, you can remove it from your account. The entry for your current device allows you to turn these features on or off. Also, you can see cards you have paired with Apple Pay. Where Did I Leave My Airpods? Judging by the wait time to order a pair, AirPods are both popular and hard to get. So, the last thing you want is to lose one or both devices. iOS 10.3 has you covered there, adding them as an available device in Find My iPhone. Now, you can see the last place your phone connected to your Airpods on a map. If you cannot see them, it can play a tone. This feature works even if you lost only one Airpod. Although most people do not yet have AirPods, it is nice to see that Apple is responding to user complaints about how easy it is to lose them Apple Will Charge You $69 for Lost AirPods Apple Will Charge You $69 for Lost AirPods It's almost as if this courageous decision to ditch the headphone jack is a license for Apple to print money. But that can't be true, can it?! Read More . Hopefully, you are lucky enough to get your hands on some Airpods and can utilize this feature. Ladies and Gentlemen: APFS It is rare that we nerds get to drool over a new filesystem From FAT To NTFS To ZFS: File Systems Demystified [MakeUseOf Explains] From FAT To NTFS To ZFS: File Systems Demystified [MakeUseOf Explains] Do you really know what your hard drive does whenever you read a file from it or write one to it? Our hard drives can now store massive amounts of data, and that massive space... Read More . Apple’s last filesystem, HFS+, has its roots back in the original Mac operating system. Though updated in the interim, it is designed for spinning disks on older hardware. The new file system, aptly named Apple File System, is built for modern storage needs. The conversion to APFS is seamless during the upgrade to 10.3. Many of the things bolted on to HFS+ are integral to the design of APFS. Designed for large data sets and Flash Storage, Apple says the file system can handle up to 9 quintillion files and can handle advanced encryption. Image Credit: Elvis Santana via FreeImages There is an interesting way that the file system works with multiple versions of the same file. It uses clones and change-tracking to save space. Then, changes to the first file or the copy are saved as deltas. The files’ shared data is still stored as a single file, saving disk space. For iOS most of the file systems’ advanced features are invisible. However, if you are looking for technical details, they are on Apple’s Developer Site. What Else Has Changed? There are many smaller changes in 10.3. Siri now has hooks for billing apps to let you make payments with the assistant. You can also ask Siri to order you a Lyft or Uber if you have the app installed. Cricket Fans can get scores from the Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council from Siri.

There are a lot of smaller details that you can check out on Apple’s release notes. If the security fixes in this point update interest you, find that on this page. (Be sure to grab 10.3.1 as well to patch a Wi-Fi vulnerability.) Webkit got a little love for web developers in this update as well — you can see that on their blog.

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT PODCAST NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS IPAD DIARIES STORIES APPLE HISTORY IOS AUTOMATION GAMES Introducing AppStories iPad Diaries: Numbers, Accounting, and Currency Conversions The Future of Workflow Apple Cuts Affiliate Commissions on Apps and In-App Purchases By John Voorhees Today, Apple announced that it is reducing the commissions it pays on apps and In-App Purchases from 7% to 2.5% effective May 1st. The iTunes Affiliate Program pays a commission from Apple's portion of the sale of apps and other media when a purchase is made with a link that contains the affiliate credentials of a member of the program. Anyone can join, but the Affiliate Program is used heavily by websites that cover media sold by Apple and app developers. The announcement, which was made in the May Affiliate News email that Apple sends to participants in the program says: Starting on May 1st 2017, commissions for all app and in-app content will be reduced from 7% to 2.5% globally. All other content types (music, movies, books, and TV) will remain at the current 7% commission rate in all markets. We will also continue to pay affiliate commissions on Apple Music memberships so there are many ways to earn commissions with the program. With ad revenue in decline, affiliate commissions are one way that many websites that write about apps generate revenue, MacStories included. Many developers also use affiliate links in their apps and on their websites to supplement their app income. This change will put additional financial pressure on both groups, which is why it’s especially unfortunate that the changes are being made on just one week’s notice.

While the reveal date for an Apple Event hasn’t been pinpointed yet, it’s expected that it’ll appear somewhere in early September. The delayed iPhone would also be the OLED model, one of three devices that’d be presented at the Apple Event, the others coming with LCD displays not unlike what comes with the iPhone 7. Breaking Precedent In traditional form, it’s expected that the next set of Apple smartphones will come in at least 2 sizes with a tick-tock naming schedule. That means that since last year was the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, this year would be the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Both of the devices that’d come in this year’s collection would have better cameras, battery life, and processor power, if all goes according to precedent. There’d also be a third device, according to anonymous tips and rumors of all sorts. This third device has several potential names, none of which have been confirmed by Apple. The device itself hasn’t been spoken of by Apple, either, to be entirely clear. This device has been rumored as iPhone 8, iPhone X, iPhone Edition, and iPhone Pro. Hurry up and wait This device was tipped today to be delayed by a few weeks by KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo according to 9to5Mac. The delay would push mass production of the most extravagant iPhone back to October and November instead of the standard August and September. It would still seem that the production schedule for iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus would be as expected (in August and September, that is). If the delay is indeed true, it will indicate that Apple has likely decided on one of two iterations of the OLED iPhone. One had a Touch ID sensor on its back, the other had a Touch ID sensor under its front display panel – all according to leaks and rumors. Once this OLED iPhone is out, it’ll likely suffer from supply shortages according to Kuo. NOTE: The images in this article come from various sources including leaker and illustrator Benjamin Geskin. Have a peek at Geskin’s previous work with the Galaxy S8 to see whether he’s got the gift. When will the OLED iPhone arrive? If the delay spoken about by Kuo is true, it remains likely that Apple would reveal all three smartphones at one time. There is no significant reason why Apple would change the timing of their standard iPhone reveal event – that being targeted for early September, 2017. In the past, that’s meant a release date of around a week after reveal. If all is what Kuo (and some other analysts) predict, the release in stores of the iPhone 8 (OLED model) wont come for a couple months after the Apple event in which it ends up being revealed. Don’t be shocked when we don’t see massive lines around the block for the iPhone 7s if Apple’s iPhone X is delayed – there’ll be waiting en masse, instead.

All other iTunes content types, including music, movies, electronic books and TV subscriptions, shall remain at the current seven percent commission rate in all markets. “We will also continue to pay affiliate commissions on Apple Music memberships so there are many ways to earn commissions with the program,” reads Apple’s message. Apple’s Affiliate Resources webpage has received a facelift with optimized navigation, a new Getting Started guide on becoming an affiliate partner, an updated Program Overview section providing information on the commission raters, reporting, creating links and more.

This just makes them seem greedy. I mean there’s no way to reduce the commission and make the affiliates happy, but they could have reduced prices, or promised some new feature, or service. All they could come up with is, that affiliates can still make money they just have to work even harder now?! racerhomie No ,not greedy . Maybe it wasn’t making business sense MadeInNY How’s that different? Rowan09 Because the purpose of all businesses is to make money and not go broke or to restructure a service that’s not profitable enough. Apple is a publicly traded company and they must do what’s best for the company profits to keep from getting sued or the losing valuation. techfreak23 I also feel like a lot of affiliates misuse the program by spamming their audiences with ads for various apps. I know there are definitely quite a few sites that happen across and they will try to pop me into the app store for some stupid spam type app. You can’t really spam with the iTunes content… MadeInNY Business is rarely that cut and dried. A business will often take a loss in the public interest because they believe it’s in their long term benefit. The classic example of giving away razor handles while betting on people paying for the blades that fit those handles. Cutting the commissions doesn’t make the affiliates happy, so they’ll be less likely to promote apps so sales will possibly go down. Will they go down more than 4 1/2 percent. I guess someone thinks not. They now have to deal with the bad PR of people like me who think it’s a greedy move. People who are just a little less likely to continue feeding the Apple machine. So what do they get? They get bad PR, which is deadly. And maybe they’ll not pay quite as much in commissions. Apple has had more than enough bad PR for a while. They don’t need more. Rowan09 In regards to your comment about razor handles it’s not a loss at all. No one cares about the handle if the blades are changeable. The blades makes the money not the handles. The affiliates program is a bad business model. The developer off an app get 70% and websites that spam about apps or promote them were getting a 7% kickback once that app was downloaded from the site. If I make an app I would just need to have tons of sites with the links to get extra cash. There is a reason Android stopped and doesn’t do it anymore (even though it’s rumored to bring it back).

Name: Subject: Message: Bixby vs Google Assistant vs Siri Features Newsby Robert Triggs11 hours ago 8 720 20 2017 is shaping up to be the year of the virtual assistant, with Google and Amazon already rolling out their new Assistant and Alexa software to more devices over previous months. Not forgetting that Apple’s Siri has already nabbed a big share of the smartphone market, tucked away in every iPhone, and Microsoft continues to focus on Cortana. Samsung has also announced its new virtual assistant – Bixby – this year. However, Samsung’s voice assistant is only available in South Korea at launch, will be rolling out to the US later in the spring, and other parts of the world over the coming year. Here’s how the big three – Bixby, Google Assistant, and Siri – stack up against one another. The first major difference between the three is the way that users interact with them. Google Assistant and Siri rely on the tried and tested method of a hot word command, triggered either by a long press on the home button or always-on listening. “OK Google” and “Hey Siri” are terms that consumers are probably quite familiar with, but Samsung’s Bixby views these as an unnecessary step. Bixby is instead started up with a quick press of the dedicated button on the left side of Samsung’s Galaxy S8. From there, users can simply speak whatever command they wish, without the need for a polite precursor. 'OK Google' and 'Hey Siri' are terms that consumers are probably quite familiar with, but Samsung's Bixby views these as an unnecessary step. Opting for a dedicated button immediately makes Bixby feel quite different to use. If you don’t feel like speaking, all three are also capable of fulfilling requests via text inputs. Bixby takes this one step further by also supporting image inputs, either directly from the camera, by searching through your gallery of existing pictures, or by looking up pictures through the company’s web browser. Bixby then provides contextual information, such as business listings, information on a landmark, or even details about a famous face identified in the picture. This isn’t entirely new though, Google Now on Tap can accomplish similar results by performing a search based on what’s currently on your screen. See also: Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus review: Almost to Infinity 7 days ago The key thing here is that Bixby offers a slightly different take on how users will interact with it, compared with Google Assistant and Siri, for better or for worse. But the Bixby Button is not the feature that’s going to define the user experience. App integration The other big differentiator with the other three is just how far Samsung has gone with integrating Bixby into its other apps. For instance, Bixby can create a new album from pictures in your gallery or change your wallpaper to a newly taken picture. Samsung is looking to take the hassle out of scrolling through multiple menus, but this functionality is limited only to the handful of apps that Bixby supports – just 10 at launch. Samsung says that more apps on the way after launch, including support for third party applications once it opens up its Bixby SDK. That being said, the Bixby Home page does support cards and information from a wider variety of apps already. Samsung isn’t the only assistant with notable app integration though, both Google Assistant and Siri work with a selection of compatible apps too. Google Assistant is integrated into the company’s Allo messenger, Photos, and Play Music. Google Assistant also lists Youtube, Spotify, Netflix, Uber, and other among the third-party apps that are currently supported, with more on the way.   Bixby Siri Google Assistant Trigger Dedicated button Hot-word ("Hey Siri") Hot-word ("OK Google") Voice Search Yes Yes Yes Text Search Yes Yes Yes Camera Search Yes No No Contextual Info Yes Yes Yes Reminders Yes Yes Yes Smart Home Yes Yes Yes Info cards Yes No Yes Third-party apps Supported Yes Yes Languages 2 (more on the way) 21 40 (Voice Search) 5 (Assistant Voice) Similarly, Siri, iOS 10, and SiriKit have gotten a number of developers on-board with Apple’s virtual assistant too. Yelp, Facebook, Pinterest, WhatsApp, PayPal, Lyft, Uber, and others are currently supported on Apple’s platform, allowing users to perform a wide variety of tasks using just their voice. Of course Google Assistant, Siri and Bixby are all integrated with the phone’s core functions to similar extents. Doing the basics, such as making calls, sending messages, setting reminders, and adding dates to your calendar, among other things, is done in pretty much the same way with all three assistants. All in all, there’s a different selection of apps with varying levels of support across these different assistant platforms, so picking the one for you might come down to the apps you use the most. Being the newest platform, Bixby is at a disadvantage in terms of third-party apps, but it will likely catch up in time. If you’re a big fan of Samsung’s own apps though, Bixby does offer deeper integration in certain situations than other virtual assistants. Wearables and fitness One of the major announcements with Android Wear 2.0 was the introduction of Google Assistant, bringing the smart features to wearables. Unfortunately, with few of the existing wearables being updated to Android Wear 2.0, only a selection of Android smartwatches will get to make use of this feature in the immediate future. See also: Best Android Wear watches 2 weeks ago Siri, on the other hand, is a big part of the Apple Watch, offering up voice commands for a lot of the smartwatch’s main features. Playing music, sending messages, and even toggling many of the watch’s settings can be done through voice commands, making it particularly useful given the limited screen space. Given that Bixby is making its debut in the Galaxy S8, there’s no wearable implementation yet, but that doesn’t mean that Samsung is neglecting the market. Samsung Health is a prominent card on the Bixby homepage, meaning that step, workout, and other fitness information from Samsung’s lineup of wearables can already be brought into the assistant. The smart assistant looks like it will eventually find itself installed inside Samsung wearables in the future too, although the company hasn’t confirmed and official plans outside of suggesting that at least the Gear S3 will see an upgrade. Building your smart home Apple’s Siri may still be mostly an iPhone- and Watch-centric feature, but the assistant is compatible with a range of third-party smart home production on the market, through the company’s HomeKit initiative. Google and Samsung are going further by developing their own smart home products with integrated assistants. Samsung has already demoed Bixby transferring the Galaxy S8’s display directly to one of the company’s smart TVs and viewing the contents of its latest smart fridge, and these Samsung Home features will work with Bixby at launch. We don’t know exactly how far Samsung plans to extend its smart home integration with Bixby, but we imagine that the focus will be on the company’s SmartThings range of products first and foremost. See also: Sony’s Android TVs will be the first televisions with Google Assistant February 10, 2017 Google Assistant is already well ahead in this regard, with support integrated into a number of IoT devices and already playing nicely with Google Home, Google WiFi, and Nest thermostats. Using IFTTT also means that you can users can link Google Assistant up with a wider range of gear. There’s some setup required, but this grants user control over their lights by saying something like “OK Google, switch on the living room lights”, providing that you have compatible hardware. Don’t miss: The complete list of services with Google Home support Compatible devices Of course, a virtual assistant is only useful if you can actually use it. Samsung’s Bixby is only launching on the Galaxy S8, meaning that it’s going to have a smaller market share in the immediate term than its competitors. However, Samsung has stated that Bixby will be coming to other devices, including smart home products, and it’s possible that other handsets launched this year and updated older models may receive the assistant in the future. Google Assistant originally launched on the company's Pixel handsets, but is now compatible with handsets running Android 6.0 or newer. Google Assistant originally launched on the company’s Pixel handsets, but has since appeared inside LG, HTC, and Samsung flagships via updates. In fact, it’s now officially supported on Android 6.0 and newer smartphones that receive an updated Google Search app. This means that around 30 percent of Android phones either already have or could soon have access to Google Assistant. Siri can be found on a large share of smartphones, particularly in the West, thanks to the market share held by iPhones and the fact that the company has been using the same assistant for multiple generations. It’s going to take Bixby a while to catch up with Siri, but it might not take as long as some expect, given Samsung’s wider range of handsets sold each year. Bixby Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus (smart home and wearables in the future) Siri iPhone 4S and newer Apple Watch Google Assistant Google Pixel & Pixel XL Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches Google Home Rolling out to other phones running Android 6.0 and up Wrap up Picking a winner at this early stage isn’t really possible, especially as there are a number of different capabilities and aims spread across the three virtual assistants. Google’s effort has a notable advantage as it will be arriving on many more devices going forward. Meanwhile Siri has no real competition on the iPhone, leaving it with a comfortable market share also. Bixby is perhaps in the most precarious spot, as it’s going to be competing directly against Google Assistant on some devices. Bixby’s capabilities sound quite impressive thanks to its integration with other Samsung apps, but third party support is going to be the key to competing with Google, and this is where Samsung has some serious catching up to do. Comparing features side by side, all of these assistants look to offer up very similar experiences, the differences at the moment are mostly down to app support and implementation.

He’s the guy behind the Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premier 360VR Toolbox plugins for creating virtual reality video, and now he’s on Apple’s payroll. Apple hires 360VR Toolbox maker Tim Dashwood Apple isn’t saying what Dashwood will be doing, but considering his expertise, it’s likely he’ll be bringing something to the Final Cut team. It’s also possible he’ll be working on something else for the company, and could be part of Apple’s augmented reality and virtual reality efforts. The big clue that he might not be developing in-app augmented reality and virtual reality tools for Final Cut comes from the plugins he already makes. They’re all available for free now, including 360VR Toolbox, which previously cost over US$1,000. Had Apple planned to add his work to Final Cut, the plugins wouldn’t be available at all now. Or, Apple is rolling Dashwood’s apps into its own products, so now they’re free. That said, Apple has pointed to video editing as a big part of its pro user community. We know a new Mac Pro is coming potentially next year, and an iMac with pro user features will ship before the end of the year. It’s possible Apple wants Dashwood on its pro video team to help make sure Final Cut takes advantage of the hardware enhancements that are on the way. Since Apple typically stays quiet about who it hires, we can only speculate on what Dashwood will be doing. Still, it’s interesting Apple hired the man, but didn’t want his Final Cut plugins.

Click here to support us on Patreon. ★ News Apple Slashes Referral Commission Rates, Directly Impacting the Future of TouchArcade - Please Consider Supporting Us on Patreon Author Eli Hodapp Posted On2017-04-24 19:45:39 Watch App   News It's days like today that make it feel like Apple just isn't going to be happy until TouchArcade as well as all other third party content creators and web sites that focus on the App Store just don't exist at all, leaving the App Store featuring process as the sole curation point for all things iOS. Just as we were formulating a solid plan for what to do with the TouchArcade app (which we can't update) as it dies with iOS 11, Apple announced that they're dropping their affiliate program commission from 7% all the way down to 2.5%. To give you an idea of how much this sucks, let's get into how the TouchArcade sausage is made. Back in the good ol' days, TouchArcade existed as a business through selling ads and through referral links. Developers looking to promote their game would email ads@toucharcade.com, and work with us to buy ads on the site to coincide with their game launch. Before the days of free to play, ad sales were great. Today? Not so much. (You can tell when we have actual ads we sell running because things that relate to iOS games will be on the site, instead of just basic placeholder ads for Verizon or whatever else.) Ouch! Apple just slashed the affiliate commission on apps and IAP. This will impact lots of great sites/apps. pic.twitter.com/dbv7CboMX3 — David Barnard (@drbarnard) April 24, 2017 While ad sales dropped off significantly, referral links still did pretty good. Any time you clicked a link on TouchArcade, the TouchArcade forums, or inside the TouchArcade app to grab a game on the App Store, we got a tiny percentage of that sale as a commission payment from Apple. This also saw a significant drop with the advent of free to play, as 7% of $0 is, well, $0. We post about a ton of premium games because that's largely what we (and our community) are interested in, so while there was a decline, it wasn't as severe as ad sales. When the continued existence of TouchArcade through a severe drop in ad sales became threatened, we launched a Patreon. Between Patreon support, App Store referral commissions, and severe corner-cutting to reduce operating costs as much as realistically possible without affecting the quality of our content, we made things work. A 65% cut in those referral commissions once again puts TouchArcade in incredibly scary financial territory. not great news for @AppShopper and @TouchArcade https://t.co/fYttjgbdtT — Arnold Kim (@arnoldkim) April 24, 2017 It has become increasingly clear that if TouchArcade is going to survive, we need additional support from our audience. Whether you love TouchArcade for our update roundups and Hearthstone news on Mondays, our new game release posts on Wednesdays, Shaun's RPG Reload series on Thursdays, our podcast on Fridays, our forums, our Discord chat, event coverage and/or all the latest iOS game news, reviews, and more... Please consider supporting us on Patreon. Patreon backers get access to a video version of our podcast, as well as special rewards both in Discord and our our forums. Additionally, we're always soliciting feedback from Patreon backers for what other things they'd like to see us do both on TouchArcade as well as exclusively for Patreon backers- So you can play a real part in steering the direction of what sort of thing we focus on and what kind of stuff we do. That’s odd - affiliate commission on apps is being dropped from 7% to 2.5%. That’s going to badly hit sites that monetise through links. pic.twitter.com/NoclzKijHH — James Thomson (@jamesthomson) April 24, 2017 Think of it as paying for a magazine subscription, except instead of subscribing to a magazine that you get once a month, we post constantly every day, with way more content than you'd ever see in a magazine. Right now, less than 0.03% of the people who read TouchArcade every month are contributing to our Patreon (which is totally fine, as I know people are used to getting everything on the internet for free) but if even 1% of our audience tossed us a buck a month, we'd be back to operating on all cylinders without worrying about navigating seemingly endless curve balls being thrown our way that are just constantly pushing TouchArcade's continued existence into question. I hate needing to post this kind of stuff, but, for real, if you value TouchArcade on any level, please support us on Patreon. TouchArcade - The Best New Games by TouchArcade.com, LLC Free Watch Button Watch App 'Stomped' is a Stylish Snowboarding Game Looking for Beta Testers chank Wow Sean That's a little disconcerting for me. If I'm understanding this correctly, you're saying this whole time that you guys were making money each time someone clicked a link to the App Store to buy a game? What's to stop us from thinking that you guys were inflating your review scores in order to make more people click on those referral links, thereby increasing your revenue? lifeat78 I have to think the review scores would be a whole lot higher on average if there was any sort of truth to this sort of conspiracy theory. HelperMonkey Carter would have been fired. benexclaimed This is how the internet works. Essentially every website that reviews anything includes a link to purchase that thing, and they almost always get some kind of referral incentive for doing so. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Because we've had a 9 year reputation now of putting our readers first, even to the detriment of our own financial survival? Less than 7¢ (now less than 2.5¢) per 99¢ game download that we get a clickthrough on isn't a great way to inflate your revenue. Also, referral links are a very standard thing across every site on the internet, this is in no way a unique thing we're doing. Sean Okay. But from the sound of things, it was a primary source of your revenue, was it not? Or was that sort of a split with ads as well? http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Ads were our primary revenue source, then it became Patreon. Jerutix If only you got paid every time someone accused you of inflating reviews... OrangeKnickers How do you think sites survive otherwise? And did you get the impression that review scores were too high consistently over the years? Sean Not saying that at all. Just posing the question. OrangeKnickers But for what purpose? Can you give examples of inflated review scores? Because if not, this is a very unfair and unsupported insinuation, whether posed as question or statement. Sean It's not an accusation. It's a possibility. That is why I phrased the question the way I did. I'm not saying they would or would not inflate scores. I was simply asking if there was anything to stop them from doing so. It's not a fun question, granted, but I think it is a good one. Matthew Johnston Thank you for attempting to destabilize the site with vague implications of wrongdoing; I was worried it wasn't a legitimate gaming website. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Eh, it's not a big deal. This kind of dog whistle stuff has been going on for a real long time in the games editorial world. Sean I was attempting nothing. It's a valid question. I'm sorry it wasn't a fun one nor a popular one, but it's still worth asking. Can we all please stop acting like I just kicked your collective dog and move on? It was just a question. Jeez. dancj It's not a totally unfair question and it wouldn't surprise me if there are websites out there that do this sort of thing. Reading TouchArcade for years though, it's pretty clear that they are not one of those types of sites. lezrock Agreed! Just think of all the evil carter scores. Impossible with that suspected agenda. But one can ask this question. dancj Limbo? Ethan Invalid reviews would be a terrible long-term business strategy as it would erode visitor's trust. Touch Arcade clearly has a high reputation, so the argument really makes no sense. Plus, anyone with a bit of tech know-how could see the links were affiliate-driven. They didn't hide it (and you can't hide it really). It's a common practice on the Internet in order to keep websites and the content free. You didn't think Touch Arcade did this all for free, did you? lifeat78 Supported. Long overdue, but better late than never, I guess! akridge I think most of us knew the reviews or the look what's on sale etc was somewhat pushed to the front of the line for paying customers. I'm ok with that. Mrbestapps Could someone please educate me what exactly affiliate commission is? I know it's probably a very dumb question. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp When you click a link to the App Store, Amazon, or whatever else on a web site. That web site typically gets a (often very small) percentage of whatever you buy through that link. ThePawn Toucharcade has been my go to site for everything about iOS gaming for years. I'm happy to support the patreon each month as well as the mobcrush streams where I can see new iOS games i might want to purchase in action. Thank you to the great staff at Toucharcade for all you do for your readers. bigghurt Eli I'm curious why couldn't u make a ad revenue share with a developer to make like a snake type game that has an integrated app in it for your site? Maybe make a news button that links to a mobile version of the site. Just curious? Also could you guys do any merchandise with the logo or anything to generate sales like a double entendre like a snake based game that has touch controls then sell merch that says touch my snake and have the touch arcade logo on the back? Booch138 O.O elekchron Merch is always a good idea. Milotorou Ouch... im honestly so sorry to hear that Ill continue making sure i buy all my apps through TA links, ill be even extra careful now... every penny counts right ? 😕 GreatWizard I actually asked in comments once if when buying games, I should go through the TA link. And I didn't get a reply but I assumed that it was so, and made sure to make all my purchases through TA links. You should appeal to your readers to do so, I think, to increase the income based on reviews Booch138 Probably something you have to balance on... I suppose they refrain from doing this sort of thing as to not seem like pandering/begging but it's not like I don't agree. That being said I've pretty much always made purchases through the links myself because it's usually reading TA that I end up deciding on a game XD Poo I do the same thing, buy all my games through links on TA. adz4u28 I will do the patreon thing in a couple of days, wise old saying - you don't know what you got till it's gone. ZeroVoid I know it's kind of out of your hands, but if we had some kind of assurance that the app would continue to function past iOS 11 I would sign up for Patreon in a heart beat. As it is, 99.99% of my visits to the site are through the app and when that goes, I don't know how much I'll continue coming here. dancj On average I probably use links from AppShopper more than TouchArcade. I know they're your sister site, but I'm guessing that it would help you more if I popped over and used the TouchArcade links? mezmorki I'm signing up on the Pateron. It's time. As an aside - why don't you consider making a new TA app (seems like you might have to?) and have a way for people to use IAP to help support you directly? Rohit Bhatia Just a suggestion I don't know if it will work or not. What about Google Play? Start posting links of that too? Sexy Pirate Well this sucks as I use the ta app for all my iOS news and the app shopper app for keeping track of my purchases and price drops etc. I didn't even realise that all this time (probably every purchase I've made ) has contributed in a small way to keep ta alive. Anonomation Stay sexy Matthew Johnston Re-pledged. Sorry I had to stop for a while, but I can afford it again. Good luck!! http://adamsimmersive.com Adams Immersive I can't imagine wading blind into the ocean of App Store garbola without TA to help me find good stuff! I supported TA via Patreon before, then let it lapse due to uncertainties about Patreon security. Patreon seems to have turned out fine, though. Time to jump back on! zhadum Without some sort of app or a much better mobile site I can say with a fairly high degree of certainty that I will stop visiting - because your website is pretty much useless for navigation and keeping track of what stories I have seen. It is ok coming from a desktop computer or tablet, but the phone site simply sucks. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Yep, I get it. Not a whole lot we can do about it unfortunately. We're working on improving our mobile site to get ready for when the app is no longer a thing, but there won't be an app that's anything close to what we had before. We're struggling to operate day to day, there's no budget for any sort of significant improvements unless we see some incredible resurgence in Patreon support. Thanks for visiting in the meantime though. 🙂 dancj Have you tried Feedly? I find it incredibly useful for feeding all of my comics and technology news to me and I can flag any article to read later. I'll almost certainly use that for TouchArcade when the app stops working. It'll be a shame, but I think the biggest loss when the app goes will be the forums. MarsMachine This sucks. I will probably increase my Patreon donation by a few bucks. Why not make toucharcade like a magazin subscription? Paid monthly but to you directly instead of Patreon? Your post and the forums are a gold mine! Any developer will agree on that! How many games have been updated & improved by our local ta community? How many ta members are busy in beta's? Why don't some local regular developers, make an app in the name of Toucharcade? I know those Indie devs also don't have it easy, but let's work together! http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Managing all the payment processing stuff that goes into that is... quite a hassle. Having Patreon manage all of it is definitely worth the tiny percentage they take. tamon76 Why can't you update the App? JosephWelke For you, Eli: because Apple simply won't allow it. adin As far as I understand it, it's because the TA app contains TA's own list of 'Hot New Games' and such that Apple feels duplicates functionality (and competes with) the App store itself. Paul Kohler o....m....g....that pisses me off to no end. I NEVER thought I would see any advantage of android over apple...this is absolutely ridiculous, as MANY of the mobile games I end up enjoying I would have never even know about, played, or known to search apple's dumbass store for in the first place if not solely for the benevolence of Touch Arcade. Why do rich people make SUCH bad decisions? Is the bottom line really THAT intoxicating....sigh ahem....rage against the machine. MarsMachine Better Idea! Get bought up by apple! Call it apple arcade or whatever & make you guys rich! This dedication and passion for iOS gaming should be rewarded, not punished! Ok, I am dreamer, but I am not the only one... Anonomation I'm sure apple would interfere with the integrity of the site if that was the case Spudboy Well this sucks. Sad to see the slow painful death of TA. :/ slamraman I can hardly think of any game over the last 6-7 years that hasn't been purchased via the TA App. Whilst I don't post as much any more it's the best iOS games site in the universe. I stopped Patreon as my wife thought I was mental and there was a minor hack a while ago, but I think I'll re-subscribe tonight as I'd hate for TA to disappear. I like it more than Apple itself! Lickzy I'm shocked that commissions was such a surprise to so many. Regardless, please support patreon as I do. 1 friggin dollar a month... it's not asking much, even for those on the tightest of budgets. If you're reading this from a mobile device, personal computer or tablet, you ought to have enough change kicking around to shell out a buck a month. I am positive that more than Three in TEN THOUSAND of us can help TA out. Rise to the occasion and support those who provide you with top notch information and very often entertainment. Lastly, with such reliance on Patreon, perhaps TA should work on less vilification of those that disagree with their opinions of games, as you'll be getting a 65% smaller kick back. jspiro While I love and support TA financially with a recurring donation, an app update is years overdue. My continued support is contingent on it. The app needs to be recompiled so it doesn't stop working, but there are a few tiny bugs that would go a long way for enjoying the content. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp The app violates Apple's policies. We haven't been able to update it since shortly after it initially launched because Apple rejects our updates. I'm sorry you won't be supporting us, but hopefully you keep visiting anyway. The situation with the app is completely outside of our control, so it sucks to see how many people are withholding support because of it. But, eh, we'll figure stuff out. Or we won't. 🙂 Philip Stroffolino What are the benefits to the TA App being a native app? Costs aside, would it lose much functionality if distributed as a web app? http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Not really, that's why we're working on greatly improving just the mobile browser experience and exploring the possibilities of a stripped down notifier app. Lickzy Why do you even need an app? I find browsing on mobile superior to many apps and yours is no different... lezrock Thats an awesome alternative. Looking forward and holding my breath. jspiro Thanks for clarifying. Why haven't they pulled the app then? Or have they and I'm just using an old app? I'd be happy with more ads in the app if there were a way to bring it back in some light form. What might have to be removed to comply? How does TA differ from e.g. IGN's app? As for why? Because native experiences are better. Because it literally sits on my home screen. Because the game watch notifications work and re-engage me. Because I already have 20 tabs open that I ignore for months. Because old habits die hard and I'll most likely just forget about it if there's no app (I'm an adult that has money to spend, but no time; I only find games via TA, but if it doesn't remind me it exists, I'll just forget to see or care what's new). Maybe I'm unique. I don't think I am. It'll be a terrible day for me when the app stops working. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp If I could tell you why Apple does what they do, we wouldn't be on Patreon, that's for sure. 😉 Spudboy MacOS 11 will take care of all of that. I'm assuming after installation, you will get a list of incompatible apps on your device. That won't be installed ever. In my case that will be 29 apps, that are abandonware. dancj 119 apps for me 🙁 loox What is the connection between ad sales and free-to-play? I don't see it lezrock When ta links to a ftp game which is free to download (costs nothing), they get of course 7% of that sweet nothing, which is still nothing (zero $) in the end. dancj That's the game links, not the ads. ZeroVoid Well, that wouldn't be ideal but I suppose it's better than nothing. I really don't understand Apple's rulings on this point. JosephWelke Simple. Apple wants all the things, so they can control their message, things, and how both are presented to you. captainugboots Would it be viable to just have the App without the sales referrals, and charge a buck for the App? If you purchase the app then you also get access to the video version of the podcast through the app as an incentive. I would buy the app for a buck or two even. Obviously you can no longer have sales links from the app but could still have all other content just within the links. captainugboots Meant to end "without the links" vectorarchitekt I finally pledged as a Silver supporter. As soon as I pay off the IRS I'll up it. I've read this site multiple times a day since my first iPhone 4s. vectorarchitekt Also, can you write a summary as to why you can't update the app or create a new one? At least you can link web pages as icons.... http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp We have a bunch of times, click the link in the first paragraph. 🙂 vectorarchitekt Ah, duh. Thanks. lezrock FTP gamers like FTR? 😈 fabell Sad to say, if this app goes away, I'll probably stop buying iPhone games. Not out of spite (that would be funny), but more because that's how I've always bought games for iOS ever since I got an iPhone. The App Store is notoriously unreliable and works about as well as using a pair of shoes to try and eat your dinner - yes, it can be done, but no, it's not pleasant and often leaves you swearing you'll never do again and just commit yourself to Steam full-time. I nearly gave up on my iPhone a month after I got one for the first time, until I found the TA app. Have been using it every day, ever since. HelperMonkey I feel like putting forum participation behind a paywall would improve forum quality and maybe bring in a few bucks. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp I completely agree, but that's a big move that is hard to. come back from if it doesn't work. Bagellios My biggest issue is with the concept of an ongoing payment plan. Right now I've read your post, I understand the situation, appreciate your transparency regarding financials/commissions and would be happy to flip your team a once off payment of, say, $10 (noting that I'm in Australia). Wikipedia gets an annual payment from me if they ask (and I've been using their website enough to actually be on it during their annual drive). You would too. If you ask me again next year - and I'm still reading quality reviews and updates - I'd do it again. Hey, I'd pay a different amount if the argument made sense: the amount of time and money you've saved me on buying dud apps has to be worth something. But I still hate ongoing payment plans, subscriptions I can't easily cancel and other 'easy to set and forget' payment methods - and you haven't provided another option. If you asked me to gross up my payment to cover the processing fee of my chosen payment method, I'd look at that favourably - so long as I felt that I had a genuine choice of payment method. Asking me every month or couple of weeks to support you through a payment system I oppose is just annoying me at this stage. It has reduced my view of TA, making me less inclined to drop into your App and it won't change my mind. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Patreon is the polar opposite of difficult to cancel or easy to forget payment methods. As a Patreon backer, at minimum you'll get one email a week from us, and additional emails throughout the month like a warning that you're about to be charged from Patreon. You can cancel at any time, with no obligation. Payments are processed the first couple days of the month, so as long as you cancel before your card is charged on the 1st of any given month (which you are warned of, via email), you won't ever be charged again. The idea of being a backer is you get greater interaction from us, so it isn't going to be something you forget about unless you elect to unsubscribe from all Patreon emails and notifications. More and more content creators are being pushed to subscription models as the advertising model is broken, and has been broken for a long time. I'm sorry you find this annoying, it's our only option at this point. Hopefully more people value TouchArcade's continued existence so folks who find themselves annoyed that we need to ask our readership for contributions can continue to get our content. 🙂 FuZion You have me. Just supported you on Patreon. I've been a fan of TA for so many years now, you've introduced me to some absolute gems of gaming which I may not have found & the savings you've helped me make on the store more than warrant me giving something g back. I hope others feel the same & help to make ends meet for you. Best of luck. Styrixa Is there a way to send the funds directly in a lump sum rather than pay recurring processing fees? http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Not really, the processing fees aren't that big of a deal and pretty universal across all the good options we have for this sort of subscription thing. Alex K Maybe you could talk to the guys of a german apple-related news site called appgefahren.de, they have an app which is regulary updated and apparently allowed by apple. The app features e.g. a news section, featured app of the day and a price tracker including price alerts. Michaelbacon I have been using TA for a long time now. You guys and another kinda similar site have been my go to for anything worth going to when it comes to game reviews and whatnot. I have no idea what you guys were making before but it seems like this would be a pretty big blow. I hope Apple will see the error in this. I am going to pop on over to your Patreon and see about supporting you all. I appreciate the info your site has made available for me over the years. Michaelbacon Hahaha. I love the $10,000 tier reserved for Apple. So true. Well said. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Not really, Patreon isn't for everyone but we appreciate you visiting the site regardless. 🙂 elekchron Why cant you have Paypal donation amounts? http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Because Patreon handles all the rewards and offers us an amazing portal for interacting with all of our backers, PayPal doesn't. Greg Beatty There may be a way. Could I subscribe via Patreon then cancel my subscription? I would subscribe at the a higher dollar tier then cancel after one payment. I believe this wouldn't cancel my Patreon account, but would just suspend the subscription. Would this work? http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Yes. Greg Beatty Find a way to take my money 😉 Jerome Well, I signed up to donate $1 a month. This seems very reasonable for a website that I have looked at multiple times daily for literally years! I hope you guys make your goal and if I had more money to give, I would. Gray Games How much money per month does the site need to sufficiently run ? Like a ballpark range not a specific number at minimum? This way we can kind of help you meet a goal and know we are actually giving money in which it's helping and know it's helping. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Our original $10k goal would have us back to bringing on new writers, attending events, and things like that instead of rocking back and forth in the car seat to try to keep it going. daftman As has been said numerous times above me, this sucks. I have used the internet less and less since getting out of college (raising kids is busy, exhausting work) and the main reason I remember to come read TA is the icon sitting on my home screen. I will really miss the price drop updates once the app goes away. I've bought so many games because of those notifications. Of course, maybe I just won't update to iOS 11... RB I'm jumping in here a bit late (comments are TL;DR) so my apologies if I am duplicating questions and suggestions... 1. Do you monetize your YouTube videos? I heard they recently lowered the minimum number of views required. 2. Are videos you have in Patreon posts exclusive for members? Do you eventually make them available to everyone else? If not, you should (and monetize them). I am a patreon supporter and to be honest I don't even bother watching the videos. I'm just happy to support TA. So don't keep those videos private in perpetuity ( if you do) 3. Who's your ad provider? Try adding more networks to the mix. Don't rely just on Adsense. Try applying to Conversant. 4. Post more videos. 😉 RB 5. Maybe also provide a cheaper tier of ads for game devs/publishers and reach out to them. Like, thumbnail sized ads that run for extended periods. Make it cheaper than market rates. Make it an offer that can't be refused. 6. How about you stop favouring Apple and start giving Android as much coverage? Apple aren't loyal to you.... stop being loyal to them. Chris If the is in fact a buck a month tier, I am IN. Who will join me??? Anonomation We can't forget that there could be a considerable amount of people who don't have a way to pay Patreon, such as kids or people with no credit or debit cadaei Supported! You are going to review all my apps now right? (Not serious - disclaimer intended for those easily offended forum people...you know who you are) I have found so many great games by reading your site that it's long overdue I kick back a bit. You have even tempted me to repeatedly try out new types of games that I never would have found out about otherwise. Tychaeus MUCH love. Tychaeus WTH....it still looks like my post is not posted when I look at this comment section on my PC, anyone know what the deal is?

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology Samsung Galaxy S8+ vs. iPhone 7 Emily Ferron April 24, 2017 A side-by-side-look at the specs and features of the Samsung Galaxy S8+ and the iPhone 7 View gallery - 36 images If you're considering one of the Samsung Galaxy S8 series flagships versus one of the latest iPhones, you'll want to examine all your options. Here, we compare the specs and features of the top-of-the-line Samsung Galaxy S8+ with the iPhone 7. Size Sick of Ads? More than 700 New Atlas Plus subscribers read our newsletter and website without ads. Join them for just US$19 a year.More Information The S8+ is the larger of Samsung's recent flagships, so it makes sense that it's bigger than the iPhone 7, the smaller of Apple's most recent offerings. Still, the S8+ is significantly larger in every dimension, despite its taller and narrower overall proportions. It's nearly 14-percent taller, 8-percent wider and 12-percent thicker. Weight The S8+ is 20-percent heavier than the iPhone 7. Build materials The S8 series phones have glass backs that curve into a low-profile aluminum frame. The iPhone has a familiar aluminum unibody. Colors Both phones have a number of color variants, though not all them are available in all markets. In the US, the S8+ is only currently available in black, silver and orchid gray, and the red iPhone is a special edition. Water resistance The Galaxy S8+ has a slightly higher water resistance rating than the iPhone 7, but either should be able to withstand splashes or a brief dip. Display size The S8+'s 6.2-inch Infinity Display stretches from edge to edge, and packs in significantly more screen space than the 4.7-inch display on the iPhone 7. Display resolution Resolution-wise, the S8+ also packs in 38-percent more pixels, so it has significantly sharper resolution. While the Infinity Display has earned accolades from display experts, the iPhone display does have qualities like high color accuracy and contrast, so it does provide a better viewing experience than resolution specs alone might suggest. Display type Samsung has long used AMOLED displays; Apple sticks with IPS. HDR display The S8 series flagships are the first to receive the UHD Alliance's Mobile HDR Premium certification. Among other things, that means it can support HDR content. Curved display It can be difficult to tell from straight-on pictures, but the Galaxy S8+ preserves the curved displays found on previous generations' "edge" devices (though not quite as pronounced here). The screen has rounded edges that gently slope off around the sides of the phone. Pressure-sensitive display There is one display trick up the iPhone's sleeve that the S8+ doesn't have – pressure sensitivity. The iPhone 7 display includes Apple's 3D Touch technology, which lets you navigate differently based on how long and hard you press the display. Home button Since the S8+ display covers so much area, it makes sense that its home button has been moved onscreen. The onscreen home button contains some pressure sensitivity, which comes in handy when in full screen mode where the virtual buttons are faded out. (Long pressing in the invisible home button spot will take you home, without having to activate the navigation bar.) The iPhone 7 has a solid-state physical home button below the display. The capacitive button provides haptic feedback that makes it feel like you're pushing a physical button. Fingerprint sensor Samsung has moved the fingerprint sensor to the back of the phone, to the right of the camera lens. Apple keeps its sensor embedded in the home button. Face recognition The S8+ includes face recognition technology that lets you quickly unlock your phone. However, keep in mind that it's not the most secure biometric measure. Samsung's face recognition seems closer to the Trusted Face feature in Android than the super-protected facial scanning seen on Windows Hello products like the Microsoft Surface Book. Iris scanning The S8+ also has iris scanning for secure biometric access. It's much more convenient to use than the first instance of this technology which we saw on the Note 7. Processor Samsung uses the latest Snapdragon 835 processor in the US and other markets. Elsewhere, it uses its own Exynos-branded processor which has slightly higher clock speeds. The iPhone 7 contains Apple's similarly capable A10 chipset. RAM The S8+ has twice the RAM of the iPhone 7, but to be fair, the two operating systems use memory differently. Storage The S8+ has one 64 GB storage size, while the iPhone 7 is available in three sizes ranging from 32 GB to 256 GB (though the glossy jet black color isn't available in the 32 GB size). MicroSD If you're worried about storage, however, Samsung still has you covered. The S8+ has a microSD slot for expandable storage; no such luck on the iPhone 7. Headphone jack Apple infamously axed the headphone jack, but it sticks around on the Samsung flagships. Bundled headphones Both makers bundle headphones with their flagships. The S8+ comes with a pair of wired AKG headphones that retail on their own for US$99. The iPhone 7 comes with a wired pair of Apple's Lightning port earbuds as well as a headphone-jack-to-Lightning adapter if you want to keep using an older pair. Battery The Galaxy S8+ has a significantly larger battery, but many factors go into overall battery life. We'll investigate the S8+'s staying power in our full-length review. Fast charging The S8+ supports Qualcomm Quick Charge, but there's no similar technology on the iPhone 7. Wireless charging The S8+ also supports wireless charging and even fast wireless charging (with a Samsung-made charging pad). Camera megapixels In terms of pixel count, the two cameras are neck-and-neck, though the S8+ has a one-megapixel advantage in its front camera for slightly higher-resolution selfies (though that alone is far from a "true" measure of photo quality). Camera aperture (rear) The S8+ also has a slightly larger camera aperture, which could spell out some advantages like better low-light shooting. Dual-lens camera To be clear, neither of these flagships have a dual-lens rear camera (the iPhone 7 Plus has one, but not the iPhone 7). Optical image stabilization (OIS) Both cameras have OIS technology to minimize image blur. Mobile payments The S8+'s Samsung Pay could be more convenient than Apple Pay for most US customers. Samsung Pay can work with both NFC and MST terminals, so you can use it at merchants where magnetic strip cards are accepted. Voice assistant The S8+ includes Samsung's all-new Bixby virtual assistant (with a dedicated Bixby activation button on the side) as well as Google Assistant. The iPhone 7 has Siri. At launch, though, Bixby's voice control component isn't yet ready or enabled, which goes a long way in explaining why the phone also includes Google Assistant. VR-ready Beyond basic Google Cardboard functionality, the iPhone 7 does not support the major mobile VR headsets. The S8+ is compatible with the Samsung Gear VR. Desktop PC dock With the (sold separately) Samsung DeX dock and a keyboard, monitor and mouse, you can use the S8+ to power a desktop PC-like computing experience. Operating system The S8+ runs Android Nougat with Samsung's TouchWiz UI layered on top. The iPhone 7 runs on iOS 10. Release Apple released the iPhone 7 last September, while the S8+ has just begun to hit shelves. Starting price (full retail) Prices for the Samsung Galaxy S8+ vary depending on carrier and payment plan, but it's one of the most expensive phones on the market. Count on paying around US$200 more than you would for the iPhone 7 (or $100 more than an iPhone 7 Plus). Stay tuned – New Atlas will post a full-length review of the Samsung Galaxy S8 series in the near future.

Apple boss Tim Cook reportedly told Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick the ride-hailing service would be removed from the App Store unless changes were made because the technique breached Apple's privacy rules. However, Uber said it tagged devices in this manner for fraud purposes designed to prevent criminals using stolen phones on the service, and had now complied with Apple. "We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they've deleted the app," a company spokesman said. "As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber on to a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone - over and over again. "Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users' accounts. "Being able to recognise known bad actors when they try to get back on to our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users." The report claims Mr Cook summoned Mr Kalanick to a meeting in 2015 to warn him to comply with Apple's App Store rules or have the Uber app deleted from the store. It was also claimed Uber used code within its software to initially try to hide the feature from Apple. The ride-hailing service has been hit by a series of controversies in recent months, including the release of video which showed Mr Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver over fares earlier this year. The company has also seen several high-profile employees depart, including president Jeff Jones and head of engineering Amit Singhal.

By Ross Rubin | April 24, 2017 -- 17:58 GMT (10:58 PDT) | Topic: Samsung (Image: Jason Ogulnik/dpa/Corbis) Samsung's rollout out of the Galaxy S8 provided an opportunity for the electronics leviathan to remind the world its interests extend far beyond the sloped edges of its phone's Infinity Display. The company followed the precedent set by Google last fall by announcing a mesh Wi-Fi router at the premiere of its flagship phone. But it went beyond that by reviving its broader cross-device integration messaging. Getting all of its devices to play together more smoothly has long been one of Samsung's quests, one that it sought to accelerate by purchasing SmartThings in 2014. Read this Yes, Apple TV will be a HomeKit hub It's official: the Apple TV can be the bridge to your connected home for remote access and information. Best of all, you won't need to buy new hardware. Read More The S8 and Samsung router form an always-present control point and always-on automation hub akin to what Apple has created with the iPhone and Apple TV. Apple, of course, has worked to bridge its (disparate platforms) via its Continuity architecture. Beyond that, though, it has acted as a pure-play platform provider for the slowly democratizing smart home with HomeKit, soliciting support from established brands and startups rounding out an ever-increasing variety of products including smart blinds, video doorbells, and ceiling fans. CNET Smart Home Guide From connected light bulbs, to plant sensors, to smart locks, and beyond, smart home tech is growing and evolving rapidly. Here you'll find the latest product reviews, news, and how-tos to help you connect your surroundings to the internet in the smartest way possible. Read More Beyond the smartphone, Samsung has another key smart device in many homes: The TV. Apple never entered that now-struggling category despite earnest predictions to the contrary. For a platform company, TVs create a lot of upgrade drag. Both Samsung and Sony have tried to overcome that with a modular approach that allowed consumers to upgrade the smarts of their TV separate from its display, but that approach fared about as well as modular phones have, not offering much advantage over purchasing an inexpensive HDMI-based peripheral from Apple or Roku. Indeed, recently liberated Vizio may have cracked the upgrade nut by offloading virtually all the intelligence to an external device with its SmartCast-compatible TVs, but that won't do anything to accelerate the upgrade cycle. Things may be even worse for other products in Samsung's extensive home product portfolio that largely features appliances such as refrigerators, ovens, washing machines, and a Roomba-like robot vacuum. None of these tend to draw big crowds for an annual upgrade cycle. In fact, most consumers use them until they break down. And the chances that a consumer would buy Samsung for all of these home mainstays is rather small -- although there may be opportunities to work with home builders for pre-populating new homes. Samsung has a better shot than many to become the strongest influence in the smart home, particularly given the phone's important role in controlling it both within and beyond the domicile. Apple, for example, relies on cross-technology bridges to control devices that don't support HomeKit directly; many products support both HomeKit and other automation options. But the smart home is developed by consumers taking chances on isolated use cases often tied to security and lighting. Samsung also makes products here, but through a commercial group that has even more tenuous ties to its mobile division. The bottom line is that Samsung will find it tough for the foreseeable future to derive marketing or strategic value to integration with most of its own smart home devices, expected as it may be be. Those who love the idea of a connected vacuum may find the prospect of a long-term marriage between it and a Samsung phone compelling. But such ties won't do much to sweep up most consumers.

However, according to noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, the Cupertino company may have a big problem on its hands.  According to his sources and estimates, the iPhone 8 is running two months behind schedule if it's to fulfil mass production supply requirements. New hardware, new headaches According to Kuo, the iPhone 8's "significant hardware upgrades" are to blame for the production slip, with the iPhone 8's significantly tweaked design causing headaches.  The usual August/ September ramp up in production as a result will likely slip to October or November, which could cause supply problems for customers at the busy Christmas period – and dampen Apple's holiday sales outlook.  It may be that the phone is still released in the normal September launch period, it just may be that stock will be limited to start with. Kuo also predicts both the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus models will launch alongside the iPhone 8, and avoid the production issues mentioned above. But being relatively minor upgrades in the face of the 8, the expectation is consumers will hold fire and sit it out for the more impressive iPhone 8 model to hit shelves. As a result, the analyst is now predicting Apple will sell 80-90 million handsets in the second half of the year, compared to the 110 million previously suggested. That's still a substantial number, but one that might make investors hold fire on adding that second swimming pool to their estates, at least before Christmas.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple scolds Uber after discovering it continued to track users’ data Over the weekend, Apple nearly put an end to Uber after it found out the ride-sharing app was flouting its rules. One of the most fascinating parts of a recent profile by The New York Times on Uber’s controversial chief executive, Travis Kalanick, was an anecdote that describes an encounter between Kalanick and Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook. The meeting happened after Apple employees discovered that Uber was tracking iPhones—even after users deleted the app. The practice enabled Uber to continue tracking phones that were wiped by users who intended to create new Uber accounts to essentially defraud the company. Not only did they add code to capture the phone’s digital footprint—a huge no-no for iOS developers—the company also put a geofence around Apple’s headquarters to prevent employees from discovering the added, illicit code. [RELATED: Keep your cool in a crisis with these tips.] The Times describes the encounter in its profile: When Mr. Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared. “So, I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Mr. Cook said in his calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then demanded, or Uber’s app would be kicked out of Apple’s App Store. For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was fraught with tension. If Uber’s app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers — essentially destroying the ride-hailing company’s business. So Mr. Kalanick acceded. The Times also reported: Mr. Kalanick was shaken by Mr. Cook’s scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting. But only momentarily. After all, Mr. Kalanick had faced off against Apple, and Uber had survived. He had lived to fight another day. Kalanick and Uber are no strangers to controversy. The company has a track record of rule breaking and all-around bad corporate behavior. However, it’s valued at roughly $70 billion, is available in 70 countries and is continuing to grow, despite campaigns such as #delteUber, which attempts to thwart its success.

Follow @ShiraOvide Facebook Twitter Email Print Share April 24, 2017 2:04 PM EDT AMAZON.COM INC +8.88 At Closing, April 24th 907.41 USD APPLE INC +1.37 At Closing, April 24th 143.64 USD A recurring theme at Gadfly is Amazon.com Inc.'s ambitions to do everything under the sun. It looks as if the company now wants to become a quasi app store similar to Apple or Google's mobile versions. Amazon on Monday created a single spot for people to sign up to digital subscriptions from companies including the Los Angeles Times and digital file cabinet Dropbox. For the hundreds of millions of customers who have Amazon accounts tied to their credit cards, it's easier to buy from Amazon than handing over their personal information multiple times to sign up individually for Dropbox, the New Yorker and SlingTV.  Amazon has previously sold subscriptions such as these, but this is first time it has packaged them in one place for customers to browse and purchase. If what Amazon is doing sounds a lot like Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store for Android phones, you are correct.  Amazon Power Hundreds of millions of people buy something from Amazon each year, which gives the company enormous influence over purchases Source: Amazon disclosures on earnings calls Note: Amazon defines active customers as accounts that have purchased something over the prior 12 months. The company discloses this figure sporadically and has not updated the metric since early 2016. For now, Amazon's new digital subscription storefront is a pipsqueak. Amazon announces new products or services all the time that don't go anywhere. But the potential is intriguing. The app stores from Apple and Google are hugely powerful gatekeepers for sales of online music, newspapers and magazines, digital video packages, food delivery subscriptions and software. If you're a company that offers a digital service -- particularly ones like Spotify or newspapers that are commonly accessed on smartphones -- Apple and Google call the shots that influence your business and stand between your success and failure. Amazon is giving companies an alternative to distributing their digital subscriptions without relying on the storefronts controlled by Apple and Google. The new service is part of a trend at Amazon that isn't broadly understood. Of course everyone knows Amazon is the supreme gatekeeper for products. If your shoes or headphones aren't sold on Amazon, they don't exist in the minds of many shoppers. More quietly, Amazon has also become an influential storefront for non-physical things, too, like software subscriptions and online TV services.  And indeed, the new digital subscription storefront mimics one Amazon started in 2015 for online video subscription services like Starz and Seeso, a comedy-focused Web video service. Entertainment companies were initially skeptical about Amazon's motives but changed their minds. For some digital video channels, Amazon quickly became the single largest seller of their subscriptions, according to a report last fall in tech news outlet The Information.  For companies that aren't well known -- and even ones that are -- selling subscriptions is a grind. They have to splurge on ads to get noticed, try free marketing tricks or hope that Google or Apple decide to feature them in the highly visible home pages of their app stores. Subscription services can easily get lost in the cacophony of Amazon, too, but the company can also suggest that customers who buy a book of New Yorker cartoons also purchase a digital subscription to the magazine. Amazon is good at selling subscriptions to its own Prime shopping club, which analysts estimate has 60 million to 70 million members, and it could bring that expertise to bear to sell outsiders' subscriptions, too.  Prime Numbers Amazon in 2016 sold more than $6 billion of subscription services including its Prime shopping club and e-books Source: Amazon Note: The "other" category includes sales from advertising services and co-branded credit card agreements The real intrigue is whether Amazon would change the rules of the distribution game if it can join Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc's Google as the gatekeepers for all sorts of digital goods. For companies that opt to sell digital subscriptions through Amazon, it is offering similar revenue sharing as Apple's recently revised business terms for companies that sell digital services. For a customer's first year as a subscriber, the owners of a digital subscription keeps 70 percent of the revenue and gives 30 percent to Amazon. After the first year, the company's cut goes up to 85 cents of every dollar from the subscription fee. Amazon's Initial Share of Digital Subscription Revenue 30% But what if Amazon decided to take an even smaller share of revenue from subscriptions, or none at all? Presumably that would put pressure on Apple and Google to follow suit. Companies have complained for years that they are giving away too much money to the owners of mobile app stores and would welcome an upstart who lets them keep a bigger slice of the pie. Spotify has gone so far as to recommend people pay for the music service away from Apple's App Store. For people who don't, the price of a Spotify subscription is 30 percent higher to offset the revenue it has to share with Apple.  For companies that rely on powerful gatekeepers like Google and Apple for their livelihood, an Amazon alternative for selling subscriptions could be a breath of fresh air.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

More than a billion dollars is spent online every day, but which retailers are cutting up the biggest piece of the pie? According to eMarketer, Amazon is leading the pack by a fair margin with over $94 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, more than the other nine members of the top 10 combined. The entire list of the 50 retailers earning the most online can be viewed here. Below is a quick look at the 10 e-commerce leaders with the greatest revenue: Amazon. The king of e-commerce posted online revenue of $94.6 billion over the past 12 months, more than five times the revenue of second place Apple. Amazon is synonymous with online shopping and is the undisputed leader in the space, in fact Gartner recently reported that 55% of product searches originated on Amazon in 2016. Apple. Apple’s $16.8 billion in e-commerce sales pales in comparison to Amazon’s gaudy sales results but it is still a massive number and over $2 billion more than third-place Walmart. The consumer-tech leader posted a 40% increase in year-over-year e-commerce sales, although just 7.7% of sales took place online. Walmart. Retail’s biggest player is making inroads in the online space as it battles Amazon for online supremacy. Walmart collected $14.4 billion in online revenue over the past 12 months and will likely see that number rise in coming years as its acquisition of Jet.com and plan to greater utilize its physical presence bear fruit. Macy’s. While the American retail icon continues to struggle amid slumping mall traffic and swirling rumors of a sale, online sales numbers continue to grow. The retailer’s $4.6 billion in online sales is a 12.5% year-over-year increase and represents 17.9% of Macy’s revenue. Costco. Costco built its empire on a unique warehouse style in-store experience, but is steadily growing its online sales ― e-commerce revenue increased by 11.4% over the past year. While Costco collects just 3.5% of its total revenue online, it still represents $4.2 billion in sales and is good for fifth overall. QVC. QVC is one of the original “omnichannel” retailers having operated a multi-channel shop-at-home organization for decades. With all of that experience in its back pocket it is no surprise that QVC is excelling online earning over $4 billion in revenue, which represents 46.6% of total sales.   Nordstrom. The upscale department store chain has adopted well to the omnichannel model, bringing in $3.2 billion in e-commerce sales, representing over 21% of total revenue. While the online sales figures are impressive they have not come without cost, the retailer’s spending on technology, supply chain, and marketing capabilities continues to grow year-over-year. Target. Target’s $3 billion in online sales is good for eighth best in the U.S. over the past year. While the lion’s share of sales for Target still occur at the store level online sales increased 22.9% and now represent 4.4% of total sales. The retailer recently announced plans to invest over $7 billion over the next three years on its digital capabilities to supercharge the in-store and online experience. Kohl’s. The department store retailer in in the midst of a multi-year transformation effort designed to infuse the enterprise with digital tech in-store and out. Its latest investment in ship from store and buy online pick up in store is helping shorten the last mile of fulfillment. The digital investments helped increase online revenue by 22.9% to $3 billion over the past 12 months. Gap. Another retailer that has felt the burn of dwindling mall traffic, The Gap is betting big on it e-commerce capabilities, especially its mobile offerings, to keep the brand profitable. Over the past year the retailer earned $2.5 billion from its e-commerce efforts, which represents 16.3% of total revenue.

Digital Trends Home > DT Daily > KGI: Apple to show iPhone 8 this fall, but no… KGI: Apple to show iPhone 8 this fall, but no phones in stores until later By Bill Roberson — April 24, 2017 11:14 AM Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: More to speculate about the iPhone 8 Typically reliable Apple secrets leaker KGI Securities is saying that the new iPhone 8, or iPhone Edition, will indeed make the stage at Apple’s big event in September, and once the dog and pony show is over, Apple fans around the world can start to fight over the 17 phones Apple will have ready for sale that week. OK, maybe there will be more than that – or, maybe there won’t be any at all, at least right away. KGI and other Apple watchers are saying that due to numerous factors, the 10th Anniversary super-iPhone, whatever it ends up being called, likely won’t go up for sale at the same time the rumored 7S and 7S Plus models hit Apple Store shelves. Stories of problems with the sub-screen touch sensor, design execution issues and other problems may delay the rollout, but probably won’t dent demand. Remember, Apple already ordered 95 million OLED screens for the phone. Pushing Bixby’s (and Samsung’s) buttons Speaking of new smartphones, it seems Samsung’s new A-I digital assistant Bixby is getting a somewhat cool reception from both reviewers and users. OK, so it isn’t Siri – or Cortana, or even HAL, but it does have its own button on the phone, which developer Dave Bennet thinks could be put to better use, even if Samsung doesn’t agree. He’s cobbled together a little app called BixRemap, which, for the moment, lets you assign some other function to the button, such as… maybe launching Google Assistant. Ouch. Hit the link for instructions on how to use it on your new Galaxy S8. Come fly with me (and bring your wetsuit) Like many of us, Google cofounder Larry Page is wondering why we aren’t all buzzing around in flying cars these days. Unlike you and I, Larry Page is a multi-billionaire, so instead of just dreaming about it, he’s backing two companies that are actually trying to make flying cars, and now there’s a peek at a prototype of one of the flying machines in action. First thing you might notice: it’s not a car. At all. No, it’s more of a boatie-quadcopter thing, with floats, and it takes off from water. So far it looks like it only flies a few yards above the surface, but hey, flyin’ is flyin,’ and it does look like it could be fun. It’s called the Flyer and while this machine is still a prototype, Pages’ Kitty Hawk says a ready-for market consumer model will be out by the end of the year. The FAA classifies it as an ultralight, and you don’t need a pilot’s license to fly it. However, we might recommend some snorkeling gear. No price has been set of course, and we’d wager it’ll be a touch more spendy than a DJI Phantom 4 Pro. Still: it’s you, flying around. Now add some wheels, Larry.

Uber Reportedly Tracked iPhones Even After The App Was Deleted, Bought Lyft Receipts Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Uber Reportedly Tracked iPhones Even After The App Was Deleted, Bought Lyft Receipts Image courtesy of Alper Çuğun April 24, 2017 1:11 pm EDT By Kate Cox@kcoxdc apple fingerprinting lyft privacy uber It’s been a busy spring for Uber, in all the ways that companies usually try to avoid. Now, among all the allegations of tracking programs from “Greyball” to “Hell, come a pair of new claims that won’t do anything to improve Uber’s dodgy reputation with regard to privacy Included in the New York Times’ new, in-depth profile of Uber CEO and lightning rod Travis Kalanick, are two items that are of particular interest to Uber users who care about privacy. First, there’s the claim that Uber was tracking iPhones even when the Uber app was not in use. Then there is the allegation that the company was using third parties to track how much its customers used competing service Lyft. ‘Fingerprinting’ iPhones One day in 2015, the NYT reports, Kalanick got called down to Cupertino to meet with none other than Apple CEO Tim Cook. As it turned out, Uber was tracking iPhones persistently in a way that was a big, big no-no for Apple. Cook told Kalanick to knock it off, or he’d have Uber kicked off the platform. The problem was something called “fingerprinting.” Much in the same way people can be identified wherever, whenever they touch something by leaving unique fingerprints, so can devices — at least, if you generate a virtual fingerprint for them first. Uber started with a good reason to leave the fingerprint code on phones, the NYT explains. The Uber app was becoming subject to widespread fraud in places like China. Users there could buy inexpensive, stolen iPhones. The original user data from those phones had been erased, and so Uber drivers there could create dozens of fake driver and passenger email accounts and use the stolen phones to accept ride requests that didn’t happen for passengers that didn’t exist. That let the drivers reap the incentive money Uber was offering anyone who accepted more rides. (Uber gave up on China and sold its business there to competitor Didi Chuxing in 2016.) So Uber came up with a way to give each iPhone a unique fingerprint that stayed even after you’d erased the Uber app — and everything else — from it. But that’s explicitly against Apple’s rules: “Mr. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no trace of the owner’s identity remained on the device,” as the NYT put it. Instead of asking Apple or coming up with another solution, though, Uber did what it now seems to have done on the regular: Tried to hide its tracks. The company used what’s known as a “geofence” to block Apple employees from seeing the fingerprints. Basically, if you were trying to get into Uber’s stuff from someplace in Cupertino, you’d be blocked from accessing it. So nobody at Apple HQ could see the code… but Uber apparently failed to consider that Apple also has many employees who don’t work out of the main office. Apple engineers working elsewhere caught it and rang it up the chain, leading to Kalanick’s meeting with Cook. Uber reportedly stopped using that kind of device fingerprinting after that meeting. But as TechCrunch reports after explaining technical details of how the fingerprint migh work, the company now says it has tweaked, but not ended, the process. “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app,” an Uber representative told TechCrunch. “As the New York Times story notes … this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users’ accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users,” the representative said. Targeting Lyft It’s no secret that for years, Uber has been painting targets on competitor Lyft’s back as much as it’s been growing its own business. In 2014, Lyft accused Uber of requesting then deleting thousands Lyft rides en masse, in order to make the service less usable and attractive to everyone else. Then, earlier this month, information surfaced about a tool, dubbed “Hell,” that Uber had been using internally from 2014 to 2016 to track Lyft usage and recruit its drivers by using fake driver accounts. But according to the NYT, it’s not just Lyft drivers Uber was targeting; it was passengers, too. Uber’s “competitive intelligence” team (which, the NYT notes, Lyft has one of as well) collects data on Lyft users to get an overall picture of the competition’s health, and they do that by buying user data from a company called Slice Intelligence. Slice owns the service Unroll.me, which aims to make out-of-control email inboxes more manageable by handling all those automated subscription blasts you get. It lets you unsubscribe from the ones you don’t want, presents you a digest of the ones you do, and sorts the ones you keep without reading. That’s not a bad set of features, if the ones your email client has aren’t enough for you. But because the tool is managing your email, it also has acecss to a whole lot of data about you. And because the service is free to use, that data is where the company makes its money. The NYT’s report that Slice sells aggregated Lyft receipt data to Uber set off a public outcry over the weekend. In response, Unroll.me CEO Jojo Hedaya wrote that he found it, “heartbreaking to see that some of our users were upset to learn about how we monetize our free service.” The company publishes both its terms of service and its privacy policy for everyone to read and makes you agree to them before you sign up, Hedaya continued, but he’s aware that basically nobody actually reviews either. “All data is completely anonymous and related to purchases only,” Hedaya ads — although if your purchase is a ride from your home to, say, your doctor’s office, that purchase history can still be more informative to outsiders than you would like.

One of the most fascinating parts of a recent profile by The New York Times on Uber’s controversial chief executive, Travis Kalanick, was an anecdote that describes an encounter between Kalanick and Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook. The meeting happened after Apple employees discovered that Uber was tracking iPhones—even after users deleted the app. The practice enabled Uber to continue tracking phones that were wiped by users who intended to create new Uber accounts to essentially defraud the company. Not only did they add code to capture the phone’s digital footprint—a huge no-no for iOS developers—the company also put a geofence around Apple’s headquarters to prevent employees from discovering the added, illicit code. [RELATED: Keep your cool in a crisis with these tips.] The Times describes the encounter in its profile: When Mr. Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared. “So, I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Mr. Cook said in his calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then demanded, or Uber’s app would be kicked out of Apple’s App Store. For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was fraught with tension. If Uber’s app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers — essentially destroying the ride-hailing company’s business. So Mr. Kalanick acceded. The Times also reported: Mr. Kalanick was shaken by Mr. Cook’s scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting. But only momentarily. After all, Mr. Kalanick had faced off against Apple, and Uber had survived. He had lived to fight another day. Kalanick and Uber are no strangers to controversy. The company has a track record of rule breaking and all-around bad corporate behavior. However, it’s valued at roughly $70 billion, is available in 70 countries and is continuing to grow, despite campaigns such as #delteUber, which attempts to thwart its success.

Now the mostarda is available for sale!     Spread the Word Listed Under Tags: • Cheese • Charcuterie • Artisan Food Industry: • Food Location: • Madison - Wisconsin - US Subject: • ProductsMADISON, Wis. - April 24, 2017 - PRLog -- Looking for a great, balanced, and flavorful mostarda that pairs perfectly with cheeses and meats? Quince and Apple is excited to release the first domestically produced, authentic mostarda, handcrafted with true mustard oil available for wide distribution. Drawing inspiration from a 15th-century Italian recipe, Quince and Apple's mostarda combines preserved fruits with mustard seeds and mustard oil. The Pear Mostarda combines sweet pears, apples, and fresh lemons, all accented with mustard's distinctive heat. This classic Italian condiment pairs perfectly with big, bold blues, dense cave-aged cheddars, and almost all cured meats. Pear Mostarda is also perfect when paired with a grilled cheese or a hearty sandwich. While the mustard pairs perfectly with cheeses and meats, the flavor of the mustard is a pairing of itself. Combining centuries old techniques with a modern, well-balanced flavor profile, Pear Mostarda is both deeply rooted in tradition and completely new. After 18 months of research and development work to perfect the ability to produce truly artisan, authentic mostarda, Quince and Apple is delighted to see the final product finally come to market. The husband and wife founders, Matt and Clare, started the company, Quince and Apple, in 2009. Along with a small, but passionate team of artisans, they create all their products truly by hand, in the heart of Madison, Wisconsin. The team is entirely capable of working with large retailers as well as small, local shops. Since starting in 2009, Quince and Apple has won two Good Food Awards, and has been featured in a variety of publications including Wall Street Journal, Food and Wine, People, Cooking Light, Tasting Table, Culture Magazine, Imbibe Magazine, Chicago Tribune, and Time Out New York. The Pear Mostarda is available for retail, in 6 oz. jars, and in foodservice sizes of both 64 oz. and 128 oz.

The solution may lie in better connections to transit. by Daniel C. Vock | April 24, 2017 A rendering of the Apple "spaceship." (FlickrCC/Forgemind ArchiMedia)         This month, employees at Apple began moving into the company's gargantuan new headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. Nicknamed the "spaceship," the ring-shaped building cost an estimated $5 billion, the most expensive office building in history. And with 2.8 million square feet of office space and 11,000 parking spaces, it's one of the biggest. But to many people, the Apple spaceship -- like similar Silicon Valley headquarters for Facebook and Google -- typifies the biggest challenges of the new tech economy in the San Francisco Bay Area: Massive, isolated corporate campuses plopped down in the 'burbs, which drive up housing costs and force many workers to endure hours-long commutes. The real problem, according to many experts, stems from suburban housing policies that prevent dense development near job centers. And it's certainly true that housing and zoning laws in Silicon Valley suburbs have made it difficult for all but the richest tech workers to live near their jobs. RELATED Why Companies Are Moving Back Downtown But a new report from SPUR, a civic planning organization in the area, makes the case that many of the region’s woes could be addressed simply by encouraging major employers to set up their corporate campuses near transit stops. At first blush, such a call might seem unnecessary. As Governing reported last year, many companies are already gravitating toward downtowns. Tech firms like Red Hat in Raleigh, N.C., and even behemoth corporations like General Electric, which last year moved its headquarters from suburban Connecticut to downtown Boston, are locating to city centers to attract talented young workers who like working and living in walkable neighborhoods. In the Bay Area, some high-profile companies have even established their headquarters in the core of cities, including Twitter and Salesforce in San Francisco and Uber in Oakland. SPUR points out, though, that those high-profile relocations make it easy to overlook the dominant trend, which is that most new office space in the Bay Area is being built more than a half-mile from a regional rail station. Only 28 percent of Bay Area offices that opened between 2011 and 2015 were close to rail stations. (By comparison, 93 percent of all office space being developed in the Washington metro area is within a half-mile of a Metro station.) That's a throwback to 1950s-style office parks, the report says. “This environment emerged in an era of wide-open spaces, cheap land and easy mobility by car -- an era that is long past. Today that same environment, built for near-term expedience, is expensive, congested and ubiquitous. Nightmarish commutes and soaring home prices are taking a toll on the Bay Area’s prized quality of life, challenging its long-term competitiveness,” the SPUR researchers write. “We have reached the limits of our 20th-century landscape, and our physical environment -- so disposable and yet so persistent -- is holding us back,” they add. SPUR offered four main reasons why tech companies have been reluctant to give up their office parks and suburban campuses for transit-friendly locations: Large, open spaces: Because of their organizational structure and culture, tech companies tend to want big, flexible spaces that make it easy to assemble teams for ever-changing projects. Putting workers on separate floors can prevent them from collaborating with each other. That’s why Facebook recently built a 430,000-square-foot workspace. It’s also why tech companies that do locate in more urban areas, like Uber and Twitter, often pick old industrial buildings that also allow for open floorplans. Security and intellectual property: Tech companies like to keep a tight lid on their trade secrets. One way to prevent intellectual property from falling into the wrong hands is to keep all your employees cloistered away from outsiders. Business-cycle considerations:The boom-and-bust nature of Silicon Valley means that companies need to be prepared to grow rapidly if their projects take off -- or shut down quickly if they fail. That makes modular buildings in office parks, each with its own parking lot, an attractive option. But that comes with a cost, the authors write: “These employment centers not only lock in auto commuting, but they can never coalesce into the kind of contiguous, walkable environments that make other travel modes possible. The expectation of rapidly repurposing buildings in the marketplace makes any deviation from the norm -- and hence any innovation in the Silicon Valley landscape -- very much the exception.” Employee preferences: Companies are always competing to get the best talent. In the past that meant offering workers all sorts of on-site services like cafes and gyms, as well as, in many cases, private shuttles to get to work. In 2014, Silicon Valley companies accomodated nearly 37,000 boardings on 765 buses on an average day. But the preferences of workers are changing, especially among younger employees. They’re increasingly looking for walkable, urban environments, which explains why some tech companies are settling in downtown San Francisco or Oakland instead of the suburbs outside of San Jose. The SPUR report offers a number of recommendations to help change the urban design of the Bay Area. It advocates for cities to change their zoning codes to allow more growth near transit stops and encourage mixed-use development in those areas. Bus rapid transit and rail service should be expanded to connect more neighborhoods. Local officials should create managed toll lanes on highways to help alleviate congestion.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Julian Assange, Bill O’Reilly, the Trump Wiretap Scandal, And Dr. Drew How The Fake News Media, Intelligence Agency Fails, And Political Corruption Are Driving The Persecution Of WikiLeaks And The New Media The announcement by a Murders’ Row of law enforcement and security chiefs led by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, DHS Secretary John Kelly, and CIA Director Mike Pompeo that Julian Assange’s arrest is a top priority of the United States government is not what it seems. The pursuit of Mr. Assange is being driven by political corruption, grand fails by the intel agencies, and the fake news media’s attempt to stop the INDUSTRY from being relegated to the junk pile of obsolescence that the horse and buggy, typewriter, and wall phone all were. Things are not what they seem folks, you are being lied to…AGAIN. 1984 VS 1776 The FBI voicemail, and the email from the Mayor of Las Vegas on our site http://www.thefakenewsdisruptor.com/, gives the cold harsh truth of just what is actually behind the pursuit of Julian Assange (full site coming next week). Assange made the mistake doing what journalists are supposed to do-HE TOLD THE TRUTH.  Rather than do what the fake news media does 24/7/365…LIE.  Assange simple gave Americans the direct censored truth.  Folks, there are two Americas crashing head on into each other, the „1984” America (failure, fake news, oppression), and the 1776 America (freedom, liberty, no terrorism, fake news, or Wall Street bank bailouts). One of these Americas, has to win, one of these America’s has to lose. The „1984,” hang Julian Assange America is the Collins horse and buggy company, Smith Corona typewriter company, the Ma Bell rotary dial phone company (the old media), while the 1776 America is the Henry Ford, Microsoft, and Apple (the new media). It is oppression vs freedom, delusion vs reality, them vs YOU.  And as people were investing money in the bankrupt Smith Corona typewriter company until 2005-long after the company was DEAD, the same is occurring with the “1984” fake news media INDUSTRY that was DEAD the second the 1st social media site came on line. They are OVER. ASSANGE BEING SCAPEGOATED  What you don’t know is that the US intel community is scapegoating Julian Assange for their grand failures (as are the corrupt politicians that have bankrupted the country and military leaders that have lost war after war for the past 35 years). The US intel and security chief’s claim that they are pursuing Assange for espionage related activities is a ruse. The case of FBI and CIA mole Nada Prouty provides ABSOLUTE proof of what I am about to say.  America’s enemies already had the information that Wikileaks released in the Edward Snowden PRISM and Vault 7 scandals. The only people that didn’t know that the NSA and CIA were tapping every phone in America, installing spyware on every electronic device, and bugging every app were the American taxpayers who funded the operations. If our enemies already knew what the CIA, FBI, and NSA were doing, how could Assange revealing that very same information be a crime? The intelligence agencies got infiltrated by honey trap moles seducing intel chiefs, politicians taking bribes, and treasonous citizens putting America second to their country of choice. They are now trying to catch up by bugging every app, every phone, and every social media account on Earth. It will not work, it is too late. Arresting Assange will have ZERO effect on the catastrophe.  Getting rid of the moles, weak minded sex slave intel leaders, and traitors will. FBI DIRECTOR COMEY’S LIES & PERJURY IN THE FBI VS APPLE SAN BERNARDINO IPHONE TERROR CASE The new media site http://www.thefakenewsdisruptor.com/ provides further evidence of this with a letter I sent to JUDGE SHERI PYM in the FBI vs APPLE terror IPHONE case and the emails I sent to the top tech companies and organizations warning that FBI Director James Comey was repeatedly PERJURING himself in open court and in interviews with the old media when he was stating the FBI could not open the San Bernardino terror shooters’ IPHONE. As I stated in February-March of 2016, a full year before Assange leaked the CIA emails, the FBI had long since broken into the IPHONE, and was simply using the court case to cover up what we now know as Vault 7. I knew right? So if I knew, then the Russians, Chinese, Iranians, and the rest of our enemies HAD to know right? Of course. It’s like saying all world NFL quarterback Tom Brady can win the Super Bowl five times, but can’t beat a group of guys in a pickup game at the park. It was all an act…just like with the allegation that Assange is a spy. Assange is a journalist, journalist are SUPPOSED to tell the truth, I know that is alien to the politicians and old media that are really behind the pursuit of Assange, but that’s how the news is supposed to work. The truth to the corrupt fake news media and politicians that have destroyed this country is like the cross and holy water to Dracula, and Americans have to get this. Trust me, I have talked to these members of Congress, and intelligence chiefs in person (as well as President Trump), and they are not to be trusted or believed about ANYTHING. Even the creator and former head of the Bin Laden desk („Alec station”) for the CIA agrees with me (Michael Scheuer). REALITY VS DELUSION It is time for Americans to look at where we went wrong in the 90’s and correct it. No matter whether or not the old media tells you the truth or not, the truth still happens. From Orlando, the Boston Marathon, the Wall Street bailouts, Paris, Brussels, to lost war after lost war, the real world will ALWAYS beat the fake news world-simple as that. So we can fall for fakeality TV, and that Dr. Drew, Bill O’Reilly, and Julian Assange are the worst people on Earth for telling some truth, and Woody Allen, Bill Cosby, and Roman Polanski are innocent angels, or we can stop lying to ourselves and be FREE. We can continue to pretend people who cannot act, sing, and have ZERO talent are stars, fiction is journalism, and continue to bet on the wrong people with the wrong plans, or we can simply accept REALITY, which is going to win in the end NO MATTER WHAT anyway.  We can continue to fall for scam of „the new normal”-there is no such thing, there is ONLY normal or it is ABNORMAL. Convincing people to accept that „the new normal” exists is like convincing people to accept that water is dry, 1+1 is something other than 2, and the sun is a snowball. Call it what it is, FAILURE. THE MONEY AND POWER SCAM This is what the whole arrest Assange thing is about, the powers that be want you to believe that telling YOU the truth is a crime in the same way that they want you to ACCEPT that YOU should live worse than your parents did in the 1980’s and your grandparents lived in the 1880’s is a good thing. They want you to accept that terrorism, war, school shooters, bailouts, and poverty are SUPPOSED to happen (“the new normal”) NO it is the new scam, a scam on the DUMB, the IGNORANT, and most of all the STUPID.  They want you to believe that spending $6 trillion on the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, $3 trillion on cleaning up 9/11, and $7 trillion on cleaning up the Wall Street bailouts is better than repairing the roads, creating jobs, and YOU keeping the money YOU earned for YOU to use as YOU see fit (the government has no money, it all comes from YOUR paycheck). This is all about money and power. The billions that the fake news media makes, the power that they are losing due to the new media, and the money and power that the politicians GET from the old fake news media. „1984” is about to be killed off by 1776 (it will be literal if not done immediately), and those after Assange KNOW it, however it is more important that you KNOW it. THEY are united against US…WE need to be united against THEM. WIKIPEDIA DESCRIPTION OF THE NOVEL „1984” For anyone that was a teenager or was a twenty something in the 1980’s, America has become the novel „1984.”  Examine Wikipedia’s description of the novel: Nineteen Eighty-Four, often published as 1984, is a dystopian novel published in 1949 by English author George Orwell. The novel is set in Airstrip One (formerly known as Great Britain), a province of the superstate Oceania in a world of perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, and public manipulation. The superstate and its residents are dictated to by a political regime euphemistically named English Socialism, shortened to „Ingsoc” in Newspeak, the government’s invented language. The superstate is under the control of the privileged elite of the Inner Party, a party and government that persecutes individualism and independent thinking as „thoughtcrime”, which is enforced by the „Thought Police”.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Uber Once Nearly Booted from Apple App Store for iPhone Tracking By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: APRIL 24 2017 Ride-hailing app Uber's China ambitions came to a halt in August, when the company ceded its operations in that country to rival Didi Chuxing. But one of Uber's aggressive tactics to win in China nearly cost it some very valuable real estate: a place in the Apple App Store. In a wide-ranging profile of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick yesterday, New York Times writer Mike Isaac reveals Uber had been "fingerprinting" iPhones, reportedly to detect Uber drivers in markets such as China using resold devices to create new rider accounts to boost their ride numbers and incentive earnings. However, by placing code on iPhones that remained even if the devices were wiped for resale, Uber was violating Apple's privacy terms. To prevent Apple engineers from detecting its use of such code, Uber then "geofenced" the region around the Apple's California headquarters, Isaac reported. But Apple engineers beyond that geofenced perimeter eventually spotted Uber's code, leading Apple CEO Tim Cook to call Kalanick in to his office for a face-to-face talk in early 2015. Cook's message: Stop fingerprinting iPhones or risk having Uber kicked out of the Apple App Store. Kalanick agreed to the request. Multiple PR Black Eyes While it's a fast-growing global company valued at close to $70 billion, Uber has yet to turn a profit. In recent months, the firm has also been hit by one scandal after another. In January, a "DeleteUber" campaign launched on Twitter after the company said it would suspend surge pricing for trips to and from New York City's JFK International Airport during widespread protests against President Donald Trump's executive order barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. New York City's taxi alliance had stopped offering airport rides to show support for travelers and protestors. In February, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler wrote a lengthy piece on her personal blog describing a work atmosphere that was hostile to female employees and reluctant to discipline "high-performing" male employees for harassment and inappropriate behavior. Not long afterward, a video recording surfaced showed Kalanick yelling at and arguing with an Uber driver. 'Pressure To Change' These and other Uber practices have caused "extensive" damage to the company, according to yesterday's article in the New York Times. "Mr. Kalanick's leadership is at a precarious point," Isaac wrote. "While Uber is financed by a who's who of investors including Goldman Sachs and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Mr. Kalanick controls the majority of the company’s voting shares with a small handful of other close friends, and has stacked Uber's board of directors with many who are invested in his success. Yet board members have concluded that he must change his management style, and are pressuring him to do so." However, TechCrunch reported yesterday that Uber was "pushing back on the allegations" in the New York Times piece by saying its use of fingerprinting is common among tech companies seeking to prevent fraud. "We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they've deleted the app," an unidentified Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch. "As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone -- over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users' accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users." The company Slice Intelligence has also been feeling heat in the wake of yesterday's Times story, which reported that Uber had purchased anonymized passenger data about its rival Lyft gathered through Slice's email service Unroll.me. "[I]t was heartbreaking to see that some of our users were upset to learn about how we monetize our free service," Unroll.me CEO and co-founder Jojo Hedaya wrote in a blog post yesterday. "We never, ever release personal data about you. All data is completely anonymous and related to purchases only." Image credit: Uber, Apple iTunes.

FBI May Ease Entry for Cyber Agents Next Article > Beware: Punycode Phishing Scam Can Snare even Savviest Users By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: APRIL 21 2017 If think you've fine-tuned your online security skills enough not to fall for a phishing scam, think again: software engineer Xudong Zheng has uncovered a vulnerability that could be especially difficult to spot. Writing on his blog last week, Zheng described a special variation of what's called an "IDN [internationalized domain name] homograph attack." This kind of attack involves using letters from one language system, for example, Cyrillic, that look just like letters from another system, say, Latin, to trick people into clicking on legitimate-looking URLs that actually takes them to different, possibly malicious Web sites. While most browsers today offer protections against IDN attacks, Zheng discovered a unique exception: when another language system can be used to replace all, and not just some, of the letters in legitimate domains, many browsers won't catch the trick. This leaves both the real URLs and the spoofed URLs looking nearly identical in the browsers' fonts. Chrome Fix Now Rolling Out The attack strategy works because of the system put in place to enable the registration of Web domains using foreign characters. A coding system called Punycode is applied to foreign characters to render them readable in standard ASCII text. Zheng said a problem can arise, though, with Web addresses that look exactly like Latin-character URLs, but are actually written in homographs, which are characters in different languages that appear almost identical to Latin text. For instance, Cyrillic features many letters that look similar to the Latin alphabet, making it possible to spoof the actual domain "apple.com" (in Latin characters) with the alternative URL, "apple.com" (in Cyrillic characters). "Visually, the two domains are indistinguishable due to the font used by Chrome and Firefox," Zheng said in his blog post. "As a result, it becomes impossible to identify the site as fraudulent without carefully inspecting the site's URL or SSL certificate." Since the vulnerability was reported to Chrome and Firefox on Jan. 20, it has been fixed in the March 24 Chrome update that's now rolling out, Zheng said. However, the bug remains an issue in the Firefox, Opera and Internet Explorer browsers. The fix in Chrome ensures that a potential lookalike URL using foreign characters will be displayed in the raw Punycode. "We have confirmed that this resolves the issue and that our 'epic.com' test domain no longer shows as 'epic.com' and displays the raw punycode instead, which is 'www.xn--e1awd7f.com', making it clear that the domain is not 'epic.com'," the software security firm Wordfence reported Tuesday. Use Password Manager, Type URLs Manually Users of different browsers can take other steps on their own to protect against the possibility of such IDN homograph attacks, Zheng said. Firefox users, for example, can force the browser to display the raw Punycode for sites by going to about:config and setting network.IDN_show_punycode to "true." IBM's Security Intelligence site reported Tuesday that the raw Punycode is now displayed correctly in Internet Explorer, as well as in Brave, Edge, Safari and Vivaldi. Another protection strategy is to use a password manager, Zheng said. "In general, users must be very careful and pay attention to the URL when entering personal information," he said. "Until this is fixed, concerned users should manually type the URL or navigate to sites via a search engine when in doubt. This is a serious vulnerability because it can even fool those who are extremely mindful of phishing." Image credit: iStock.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Rumor iPhone 8 Production Delayed Due to Supply Constraints – October/November Potential Months of Production Phase By Omar Sohail 17 hours ago 14Shares Share Tweet Submit Changing a phone’s design dramatically comes at a price and it looks like after years of following more or less the same exterior for the iPhone, Apple has run into some problems related to the mass production of the iPhone 8. According to a renowned analyst, it looks like the rollout of the flagship phone might not take place during the month of September. Mass Production of iPhone 8 Will Be Pushed Back to October/November Period Instead of August/September KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo once again states that the OLED-touting iPhone 8 will be delayed to October/November, adding that this could negatively impact the company’s sales since there are a plethora of Android smartphone rivals that would love to capitalize on this opportunity. The reason why the delay is taking place has not been stated but on Twitter, Benjamin Geskin believes that Apple has decided to incorporate its Touch ID beneath the display. Related iPhone 8 To Account For 50% Of Apple’s Total Smartphone Output This Year Claims Morgan Stanley Remember that just yesterday, leaked photos of an iPhone 8 dummy were leaked and they were showing that the device did not have a rear-mounted fingerprint reader. There have been several rumors in the past as well as leaks that have provided evidence highlighting that Apple might be testing out an iPhone 8 prototype that features a rear-positioned Touch ID sensor. From an ergonomics standpoint, it would not bode well for millions of consumers out there because they would want a seamless design that would make it difficult to unlock and grip at the same time. Keep in mind that the iPhone 8 has been rumored to come with a 5.8-inch display but the edge-to-edge glass coupled with 4mm of bezels mean that the footprint of the handset is going to be smaller than its predecessors, which is a good thing for consumers with smaller hands. Related iPhone 8 Production Delay Rumors Are Grossly Exaggerated; Samsung Will Commence OLED Assembly In May Advertisement KGI: “iPhone 8 mass production delayed to October/November.” I think that Apple decided to go with “Тouch ID under display” design. Yey! — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) April 24, 2017 However, due to supply constraints, it is more than possible that you are not able to see the smartphone land on store shelves and marketplaces soon enough. If you were patiently waiting for the arrival of the iPhone 8, then you might be disappointed by this news. Regardless, we’d love to know your thoughts down in the comments.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile iPhone 8 Production Delay Rumors Are Grossly Exaggerated; Samsung Will Commence OLED Assembly In May By Ramish Zafar 14 hours ago 14Shares Share Tweet Submit According to the rumor mill, Apple’s got big plans for the iPhone 8 this year. After a dramatic pause in design upgrades for three years, the company will finally change things up on the smartphone. That’ll be one of the reasons we’ll also see Cupertino jump a generation ahead on the iPhone and also launch a new device in addition to the standard ‘S’ variants. The iPhone 8, iPhone X or the iPhone Edition will feature a lot of changes. The rumor mill believes that Apple’s pushing its supply chain extra hard this year. Today, we’ve got some more details on the matter. Take a look below to find out more. Samsung Will Commence OLED Panel Production For iPhone 8 On Schedule Despite Contradictory Rumors For the iPhone 8, a lot of Apple fans will breathe a massive sigh of relief. The company will finally introduce OLED on the smartphone, years after the Android world has adopted the tech. To its credit, as per company culture, Apple will not go easy on its suppliers when it comes to OLED manufacturing. Sources claim that the company’s placed stringent demands over Samsung Display, the company tasked to meet the iPhone’s massive display panel requirements. Related iPhone 8 To Account For 50% Of Apple’s Total Smartphone Output This Year Claims Morgan Stanley In fact, Apple’s demanded that Samsung deliver OLED panels which are more advanced than the Korean tech giant uses on its latest Galaxy S8 and S8+. The US company hopes that the iPhone 8’s display panel will cover a higher body area than Samsung’s flagship smartphones. To contrast, the Galaxy S8 has a display area ratio of 84%. As to how Apple intends to top this, your guess is as good as ours. Advertisement Related iPhone 8 Production Delayed Due to Supply Constraints – October/November Potential Months of Production Phase “Apple is asking for a higher-end display panel than that for the S8. Depending on the adoption, the phone’s launch schedule could be adjusted.” according to Jang Hyun-jun, an analyst at UBI Research. However, industry sources believe that rumors of an iPhone delay this year are grossly over-exaggerated. The main reason behind these alleged delays is the technical difficulties faced by Samsung to manufacturer panels according to Apple’s exacting specifications. Still, it’s expected that the manufacturer will place orders for OLED components by the end of this month, resulting in production commencement by the start of May. All components for the iPhone’s OLED displays will be sourced from Korea and will include manufacturers the likes of Interflex, BH and Samsung Electro-Mechanics. These reports stand in stark contrast to earlier rumors that speculated troubles in Apple’s supply chain. KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo is at the forefront of this speculation, in a fresh note for investors released today. Kuo believes that production can be delayed to Q4 this year, but is still optimistic on features such as 3D recognition to make up for this lost demand. It’s an interesting year for the iPhone folks. Will you mind a delayed launch for a smartphone that’s rumored to cost around $1000? Let us know what you think in the comments section below and stay tuned. We’ll keep you updated on the latest.

Apple today unleashed iOS 10.3.2 beta 4 to registered iOS developers. If that’s you, then you can get the new update by going to Apple’s Developer Center or by downloading it over the air on your registered iOS device. The update doesn’t appear to be hitting Apple’s public beta testers quite yet, but those folks should see the update in the next couple of days. So far, there hasn’t been any major new features uncovered in iOS 10.3.2. That could certainly change between now and the public release, but it also wouldn’t be surprising if iOS 10.3.2 was focused on under-the-hood performance improvements and bug fixes rather than introducing any new features. Apple today also released watchOS 3.2.2 beta 4 to registered developers.

Apple is also running developer betas for iOS 10.3.2, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1. The version number and lack of release notes so far suggests this will be a minor update focused on bug fixes and security improvements ahead of macOS 10.13 later this year. We’ll update with any new features found in macOS 10.12.5 (no notes and known issues).

autoevolution cars moto news car reviews spyshots driven cars newspaper green Compare Cars BAC Calculator   Editorial Coverstory Motorsport Testdrives archive Auto Shows Tuning Car Finder Photo of the Day Glossary of automotive terms Masthead RSS Feeds Apple Reportedly Uses Logitech Gaming Gear For Its Self-Driving Cars   24 Apr 2017, 15:58 UTC · by Sebastian Toma / Home / News / Industry Apple has a permit to test self-driving cars in California, and the papers that have been filed with the Department of Motor Vehicles have been published online. These documents reveal the particular procedure that the six employees of the Cupertino giant have to undergo to be considered fully trained to be ready to step in when the system fails to operate properly. The set of papers was sent to Apple Insider, and it seems that the tech giant has decided to install a Logitech set of comprised of gaming wheel and its matching pedals to help control the automobile. While the Lexus RX450 portrayed in the images features the factory-fitted steering wheel and pedals, it is thought that at least two employees will be in the vehicle during the tests conducted on public roads. We believe that one of them will sit behind the standard wheel of the car, ready to step in if all electronic additions fail to operate as intended. Meanwhile, the other Individual will sit on the right side of the back seat, and will provide input using the gaming equipment. The speculation in the paragraph above would enable two failsafes in case the automated driving system fails, which will help Apple steer clear of any scandals involving accidents with its vehicles. The steering wheel and pedals are suitable to control a modern vehicle that comes with drive-by-wire technology, and the described solution seems to be a "bridge" between the AI of the driverless system and the humans who monitor it. Each person who will be part of the development team will have to go through seven tests before he or she is authorized to drive the Lexus SUVs with self-driving equipment. Those challenges will be done in an undisclosed private compound, and the examination is conducted after two practice runs and three trials for the entire course. Just like any other team member involved in self-driving vehicle development, the employees trusted to do this will have to be ready to step in at any moment to ensure safe operation on public roads. As Business Insider noted, Apple representatives declined to comment on the matter.

Uber Fingerprinting Users Shows the Danger of Thinking All Technology Is Magic When "always be hustling" catches up with you. The thing that surprised me about the latest scandal brewing around Uber is that anybody is surprised. Accused of "fingerprinting" phones—assigning a persistent identity to the hardware and then associating this with a user of their service—its real crime is the attempt to disguise the practice from Apple using geo-fencing. Because the only reason Apple has rules about fingerprinting phones is that, in the past, it was far more commonplace than you may have realized. For the first few years of the iPhone's life Apple even provided a method call in their Software Development Kit (SDK)—the software used to build apps for the phone—to help developers map unique hardware addresses to real names and phone numbers. Apple did this because uniquely mapping users to specific hardware simplifies a lot of backend management for app developers. This method survived in the SDK for a number of years, and when it was finally deprecated back in 2011 there was a huge rush by developers to figure out how to generate a unique hardware fingerprint via other methods. Apple even created a drop-in replacement method to create a unique identifier when an app started for the first time, but this identity wasn't unique to the hardware—if a user deleted the app, and then reinstalled, a different unique identity was generated—so developers hated it. So the fact Uber worked around Apple's rules doesn't surprise me in the slightest, considering the nature of its app doing so probably simplified the company's life enormously. Not least because it wasn't, at least on the face of things, using the hack to track its users but to combat driver fraud in markets like China. Its hubris, and the reason Travis Kalanick got a personal slap on the wrist from Tim Cook, was trying to disguise it from Apple. If Uber been more upfront about things it may well have gotten away with it. Anecdotally at least, it wouldn't have been the first time Apple had allowed "favored partners" to brake the App Store rules. But as average people become more distant from the underlying mechanisms of how the technology they use every day actually works, it has become harder to explain how technology works. Most people aren't particularly aware of the amount of data just leaks from their phones, to developers, and into the environment. I used to give a talk at big data conferences about what I call "migratory data," the hidden data you carry with you all the time, the slowly growing data sets on your movements, contacts and social interactions, generated by your phone. But as average people become more distant from the underlying mechanisms of how the technology they use every day actually works, it has become harder to explain how technology works. I've stopped giving the talk, because even for the people working in technology, staying on top of how everything works has become a huge burden only alleviated by commoditization. As an individual technology becomes a commodity the number of people who know how it works decreases. The obvious example technology to point to here, one we're all used to, is the car. Back in the 1950's pretty much every teenager worked on their own car, knew how it worked "under the hood." Today, most teenagers don't, and due to rising insurance rates—and perhaps an awareness that self-driving cars are on the horizon—a lot of teenagers aren't even learning to drive any more. Those of us approaching our middle years in Generation X are probably the last with that particular dying skill. Being able to drive will soon go the way of being able to ride a horse, something that you no longer need to know, because it's been hidden by technology. You can see the same sort of commoditization in the cloud computing. The ability to run your own servers is a dying skill set amongst technologists, it has been hidden away. If you need a server, you just spin up an EC2 instance, and with "serverless" computing becoming more popular, even the knowledge of how to build and deploy an EC2 instance will become hidden by another layer of technology. The very name "serverless" shows how the underlying technology of servers has been encapsulation away from the end user. Of course there are servers, but most of us don't need to understand how they work any more. This is how the modern world works: we build something, and then we commoditize it so that it can be used by non-experts. There really isn't any way to operate in today's society without this mechanism, but it makes systems fragile. Which is why projects like the Global Village Construction Set—a set of open source designs to build all the manufacturing and agricultural tools you'd need to kickstart an industrial civilization—exist. Because if you dig deep enough eventually we all run out of knowledge. Cars, servers, microchips, it just depends when your personal technology stack runs out. Cloud computing has spawned a whole clutch of interesting startups and tools that couldn't be built without it, however evidently they're all things that could be implemented on top of the cloud. It's therefore sort of interesting to speculate what technologies haven't arrived because it's hard, or even impossible, to implement them inside the framework of the higher level concepts that form the basis of understanding for most developers now using cloud infrastructure. If we lose sight of the underlying workings of technology we limit our vision to the use cases that were originally envisioned when the wrappers around it were created. If a developer doesn't understand how things work underneath they'll use them as a black box, and using tools in that fashion makes doing things that the original expert that built the high level too—doing things out of the ordinary—almost impossible. If we lose sight of the underlying workings of technology we limit our vision to the use cases that were originally envisioned when the wrappers around it were created. You can do a lot of interesting things by shrugging off the underlying complexity and using the black boxes other people have built. But you can do entirely different interesting things when you fundamentally understand what's inside the boxes. The next level down. Because you can make the technology do things that people working at the black box level can't. Of course these days, in this century, the level below the black box is usually another level of black boxes. It's pretty much black boxes all the way down. For instance, it has now actually become impossible to design a modern microprocessor by hand; to do that, you need a computer. Think about that for a bit in the dead of night, and about how fragile that makes us as a society. The modern world just wouldn't be possible without commoditization of knowledge. But you should at least try and be aware of what you don't know, and a lot of people aren't. Which to me, is the only thing the Uber story goes to prove.

Andrew Cunningham - Apr 24, 2017 5:39 pm UTC Enlarge / This is Tim Cook's unimpressed face. Drew Angerer/Getty Images reader comments 134 Share this story Uber's trouble continues. In a profile on CEO Travis Kalanick published yesterday, the New York Times says that the Uber CEO was called into Apple for a private meeting with CEO Tim Cook. Kalanick had directed Uber's developers to break Apple's App Store rules—he wanted the Uber app to collect unique hardware data about every iPhone it was installed on, something Apple's App Store rules don't allow. To obscure this from Apple's App Review team, Kalanick asked his engineers to make it so that the app wouldn't collect that data from anyone at Apple's headquarters. This was eventually noticed by Apple engineers working off-campus, prompting the meeting with Cook. Cook told Kalanick to stop collecting the data or face ejection from the App Store, cutting the app off from a wide swath of the company's user base. Kalanick agreed. Further ReadingUber said to use “sophisticated” software to defraud drivers, passengers The report isn't clear on what data, exactly, Uber was collecting, but sleuthing from developer and security researcher Will Strafach found that a 2014-era build of the Uber app was grabbing serial numbers from every iPhone it was installed on. The meeting between Kalanick and Cook apparently happened at some point in 2015. As of iOS 10, it's no longer possible for apps to reach outside of their sandbox to access this information (Apple also prohibited apps from grabbing devices' longer Unique Device Identifier, or UDID, back in 2012). Uber was collecting serial numbers to prevent a specific kind of account fraud—some drivers were buying cheap iPhones on the black market, using them to sign up for new Uber accounts, and then requesting fake rides for themselves to inflate their numbers and earn extra incentive-based pay. By gathering serial numbers that could then be associated with fraudulent accounts, Uber could prevent those phones from being wiped and re-used to create new accounts. We've contacted Uber to see if it's using any other methods to combat this kind of fraud since Apple told the company to stop collecting hardware data, and we'll update the article if we get a response. Uber is having what we in the tech business sometimes call "a bad year." Following a 2016 in which it lost around $3 billion, the company has settled a $20 million lawsuit with the FTC after exaggerating the amount that drivers could earn. Further, the company has attracted new class-action lawsuits that allege that Uber underpays its drivers and that it is negligent in its hiring practices. Google-owned Waymo has sued Uber over theft of trade secrets, and Kalanick's company was caught using software called "Greyball" to avoid authorities. A former Uber engineer alleged that she was sexually harassed while she was at the company, which prompted social media campaigns urging users to delete their Uber accounts. Kalanick was filmed arguing with an Uber driver, after which he said he needed "leadership help"; this is true in part because of all the high-level employees the company has lost in recent months. A more recent suit alleges that Uber used "sophisticated software" to make users pay inflated fares without passing the money along to drivers. Update: An Uber spokesperson told Ars that Uber is still using some device fingerprinting methods to combat fraud but that the methods currently being used are in compliance with Apple's policies. The full statement: I can't share all the details about the signals we use or it gives fraudsters a heads up on circumventing those controls, but Apple's policy does not prohibit device fingerprinting completely. It merely stipulates which identifiers can be collected from the device, which are used by our team in combination with non-device signals to detect fraudulent activity & suspicious logins. The meeting referenced in the NYC story happened before we hired our first Chief Security Officer in mid-2015 and centralized all security activity into a single organization. Under this leadership, we've been compliant with Apple's policy for quite some time. Andrew Cunningham Andrew has a B.A. in Classics from Kenyon College and has over five years of experience in IT.

Cash is a hard habit to break. Last November, India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, introduced a surprise ban on the country’s largest currency bills, 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, worth €7.15 and €14.30, respectively. Modi was elected on an anti-corruption platform, and this shock measure was intended to counter a range of illegal activities, including counterfeiting, corruption, terrorism, and primarily tax dodging, which is rife in India.  It’s estimated that for every €100 paid in tax, another €200 is owed.  The government hoped that by removing 86% of the cash in the economy, they could draw huge swathes of the black economy out into the light. On the stroke of midnight on November 7, those 500 and 1,000 rupee notes lost their legal tender status. To replace them, people had to go to the bank. But here’s the kicker.  If you turned up with more than 250,000 rupees (about €3,550) you had to say why you had so much, and prove you’d paid tax on it.  If you couldn’t, you would have had to stump up twice the outstanding tax liability. While it’s not yet clear whether or not the measure has worked, it has thrown the domestic economy into turmoil. India is wholly dependent on cash just to tick. Between 90% and 98% of transactions are cash-based. The equivalent figure in Ireland is 63%, in Western Europe it’s 68%. As soon as the measure was announced, huge, snaking queues formed outside banks.  People rushed to convert their cash holdings. ATMs ran out of money, and the resulting cashflow crisis brought sections of society to a halt. There have been reports of people being unable to buy food, while farmers haven’t been able to complete planting, because they cannot access the cash to buy seeds. Weddings — frequently as elaborate as they are expensive in India — had to be postponed as there was no cash to pay for them. When the figures are eventually released, growth in the last quarter of 2016 will likely have taken a big hit. While few administrations will have the stomach for the kind of shock tactics that India imposed, there’s little doubt that we’re all witnessing the slow retreat from cash in everyday life. According to the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI), the value of card payments here increased by 16.2% in the first 10 months of 2016, driven primarily by the use of debit cards. And when a little pressure and encouragement are applied, those figures soar. Last year’s ‘Cork Cashes Out’ campaign is a case in point.  This three-month pilot promoted Cork as Ireland’s first cash-free city. While the campaign didn’t achieve that, it did increase the number of contactless payments by 522%. Once, regular trips to the ATM were needed to keep the show on the road. Nowadays, fewer and fewer transactions require cash.  Ok, some shops will stipulate a minimum spend before you’re allowed to use your card, or they’ll hit you with a surcharge if it’s less than a fiver, and these surcharges can vary significantly. For transactions under €30, you can now ‘tap’ the card — holding it against the screen of the terminal, without having to plug it into the machine or put in your PIN. Contactless payments, as they’re known, mean small transactions can be undertaken without cash.  Press the card against the screen, wait for the beep, and off you go with your crisps, coffee, or paper. The big societal advantage of cashless is the one identified by India’s PM. It’s difficult to sustain a black market, or avoid tax, if every transaction leaves a trail, as all electronic transactions do. A wide range of criminal activities become considerably more challenging in a cashless society. You might have a briefcase full of unmarked bills, but if you can’t spend them anywhere, what good are they? In his book, The Curse of Cash, Harvard professor, Kenneth Rogoff, argues that all paper money needs to be phased out. He says that in the late 1990s, some 60% of US cash was held in hundred-dollar bills, a remarkably high proportion, given how rarely they surface in everyday life. By the time the book appeared last year, he estimated that percentage had risen to 80%, or in excess of $1.34 trillion, held, well, God knows where.  The only thing that can be said with certainty about this cash is that it’s not in banks. Rogoff says that the dollar still tends to be the go-to store of value, and medium of exchange, in economies where faith in the domestic currency is shaky, and argues that much of this cash is financing drug- and human-trafficking, terrorism, and other criminal activities. He also says, as an aside, that since the wages of illegal immigrants are invariably paid in cash, a cashless economy would be a more effective deterrent than any wall. Open up a map of the world, stick a pin in it, and you’ll find evidence of the march from cash. In South Korea, only 20% of transactions are cash-based.  The plan there is to remove all coins from circulation by 2020. The government is urging consumers to put their small change onto ‘T-Money’ cards — electronic travel passes that can also be used in convenience stores. All central banks would like to see the end of coins. For one thing, they’re bad value for money. The small denominations cost more to make than they’re actually worth.  Here in Ireland, the ‘rounding’ initiative introduced towards the end of 2015 hoovered up €126m in unused coins and saved the central bank a packet in minting costs. In Europe, Belgium, Denmark, and Norway have been at the forefront of the cashless society, but Sweden has made by far the most progress. Since 2009, when the Swedish Central Bank eliminated its highest denomination bill, the value of cash in circulation has dropped precipitously, such that 80% of transactions no longer require it. You can’t use cash on buses and trains. Most bars and restaurants will refuse it. About half of all banks don’t take deposits or give withdrawals.  Even street vendors and farmers’ markets take cards. Signs on shop doors, saying ‘We don’t take cash’, are increasingly common in a country where even children use debit cards. Mobile payment platforms have had a central role in Sweden’s triumph over cash. ‘Swish’ is a direct payment app, a collaboration between a collection of Swedish and Danish banks.  It allows consumers to make electronic payments in real time, without the need for cards. Elsewhere, of course, the rise of Apple Pay and Android Pay has opened up the world of mobile payments to a much wider audience. For the consumer, the argument runs that a cashless society is a safer society. In Amsterdam, a couple of summers ago, I tried to pay for a coffee with a fiver. The guy behind the counter waved it away. “Cards only,” he said, indicating the tablet on the counter. Only then I noticed the lack of a cash register. “All of the cafes around here are card-only,” he said. “We don’t get robbed anymore.” It’s hard to find evidence of any great decline in street crime as a result of cashlessness.  We may be carrying less cash, but cards are still valuable items, as are phones. And it’s not as if criminals simply give up, and decide to go straight, when one avenue is closed to them. Using your card does, however, get you automatic protection against fraud, and grants you consumer protection that you don’t get with cash. Dermott Jewell, of the Consumers’ Association, is ambivalent about the rise of cashlessness.  He says that the piecemeal introduction of cards, contactless payments, mobile payments, and even rounding has been all about changing the mindsets and habits of consumers. “Consumers have, in most cases, had a choice in how they spend their money, but this is changing and is not necessarily always in their best interests, or of particular benefit.  "Service providers require consumers to pay by direct debit, in order to avail of discounts on their energy, telecom, and other bills. “However, these require monitoring, as the discounts cease after a period of time and must be renegotiated.” Mr Jewell says that while some of the changes may benefit the consumer, there’s little question but that they all benefit traders, service providers, and finance houses. The banks are all for cashlessness. What’s not to love? It mechanises processes, has no reliance on branch banking, and ends the need to transport cash. You would think that they would be incentivising the use of debit cards. However, both AIB and Bank of Ireland charge you 20c and 10c, respectively, to use your debit card to make purchases. None of the other banks do, and all of the banks allow free contactless payments. Governments, for reasons already explored, are even more enthusiastic about electronic payments. The last budget saw the imposition of a 12c stamp duty on all ATM withdrawals, in part, no doubt, as a means of nudging us all away from cash.  So, if both banks and governments are urging cashlessness, it’s hard not to be suspicious.  Spending cash has become a deliciously anti-establishment thing to do. You buy something with cash and no-one knows anything about it. Buy it with a card or mobile payment app and an indelible record is left behind, a footprint that never fades.  In a world of spies and hackers and big data, where is the guarantee that this data will remain forever secret, forever protected? Cash is a bearer instrument. Once you have it, you can spend it wherever you like. But if we’re relying on Visa and MasterCard to mediate what we do with our money, is there a risk we will not be allowed to spend without their imprimatur? Back in 2010, both companies blocked all donations to Wikileaks. Three years ago, they reportedly blocked payments to a number of anonymisation and virtual private network (VPN) services. Not everyone is marching happily down the road to cashlessness. In Sweden, a loose coalition of interests, calling itself Kontantupproret, or ‘Cash Uprising’, is putting up a spirited resistance.  The group is made up of a number of vested interests — the ATM and cash-transportation industries, in particular — as well as some small business owners, immigrants, and pensioners. Last summer, the Swedish deputy finance minister took delivery of a petition signed by 136,000 pensioners asking the government to safeguard the use of cash. They argued not everyone has access to a bank account, and citizens have a right to decide how they pay for what they need. And you have to ask, in a world where there’s no longer any spare change, how do charity collectors or beggars or street artists get by?  Financial writer, Dominick Frisby, says that, as we shrug off cash, we risk disempowering sections of society that will find it difficult to embrace new technologies. “The danger,” he says, “is that governments force it and get their regulation wrong, which is likely. Money is tech. It needs to evolve organically.  "If governments make cash illegal, the need for cash will not disappear. They will just create a black market. Thus, like the ‘war on drugs’, for example, they will create much bigger problems than they originally had.” These concerns go to the heart of the cash versus cashless debate. Worldwide, 2.5bn people don’t have access to any kind of financial institution account. Moreover, not all of these ‘unbanked’ — as they’re known — are in developing countries. In an address to the Mobile World Congress, last year, MasterCard CEO, Ajay Banga, said that nearly 70m Americans are either ‘unbanked’ or ‘underbanked’ — this last term meaning that they have poor access to retail banking. He said that the figure in Western Europe is 100m. Enter the GSMA, the world trade association of mobile operators. It has the underbanked firmly in its sights, believing that mobile technologies can bring the joys of cashlessness to a much wider audience. GSMA’s report, ‘Mobile Financial Services for the Unbanked’, says that many of those without access to retail banking can, instead, use their mobiles to provide low-cost access to financial services. Like M-Pesa, for example.  Introduced by telcos in Kenya and Tanzania, in 2007, this platform allows users to store and send money within their mobile accounts, without the need for a bank account. It’s now one of the leading mobile money systems in the world, and allows millions of users both to store money digitally and to transfer it to each other via text message. The service has since been expanded to South Africa, Albania, Romania, and India, where, it’s hoped, it can ease the liquidity crisis brought about by the country’s recent demonetisation. Time will tell whether or not innovations like these will be sufficient to replace cold, hard cash, which has been around for some time. The earliest coins were discovered in what was once the province of Lydia, on the coast of Asia Minor (now modern-day Turkey), in 700BC. And, of course, Turkey is one of the latest countries to decommission its coins. A card-payment system — called ‘Troy’ — named for the ancient city, is being rolled out to all point-of-sale terminals, with the aim that all cash be completely removed from the economy by 2023. If it goes according to plan, a system that functioned continuously for 2,700 years will vanish in less than a decade. Tapping for money becomes commonplace for consumers The days of jingling pockets are coming to an end. The rounding initiative begun two years ago has already seen the beginning of the end of 1c and 2c coins. The rest of them are not far behind, and once they’re gone, notes are likely to follow soon after. And as the cashless society takes hold, you can bid goodbye too to your credit and debit cards.  The only thing you’ll need when you leave the house will be your keys and your phone. Just last month, Apple Pay arrived in Ireland. Its main rival, Android Pay preceded it by about three months.  These are known in the trade as Near-field communication, or NFC payment platforms. In a nutshell, they allow you to use your device like a debit or credit card. You download the wallet app to your device and enter your card details into it.  If you wish to make a payment in one of the participating stores, you hold your phone or tablet or smart watch up to the terminal. In most cases, you don’t even have to wake the device up.  The sensor picks up the proximity of the terminal and completes the transaction automatically. You walk out with your purchase and the relevant amount is automatically deducted from your card account. Ulster Bank has launched Apple Pay in Ireland as part of its customer-centric innovation, transforming mobile payments with an easy, secure and private way to pay that’s fast and convenient. Apple Pay was first rolled out in the States more than two and a half years ago. In the first three months of its life, the company reported that over one million cards were registered on the app.  Here in Ireland, two banks are currently embracing the platform. You can use Apple Pay with KBC and Ulster Bank debit and credit cards. The technology works with an iPhone 6 or later, an iPhone SE, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3 or later and an Apple Watch paired to an iPhone 5 or later.  Set up Touch ID, Apple’s fingerprint sensor, and you can use Apple Pay to shop in participating websites and apps, without the bother of having to fill out lengthy account forms or shipping and billing info. Two banks have also taken on Android Pay — KBC again, as well as AIB. Android works with Android phones and tablets with Android 4.4 or later. As with Apple Pay, you just install the app and enter your card details. As well as point of sale transactions, you can use the technology on the range of participating websites and apps — which are of course growing in number all the time. So the big question. Is it safe? Yes, says Jillian Heffernan of the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI). “With both Apple Pay and Android Pay, the card number and identity of the cardholder aren’t shared with the retailer,” she says, “and actual card numbers are not stored on your device or on Apple/Google servers. Also, in the event that the cardholder loses their device, they can temporarily suspend or completely delete the ability to use Apple or Android Pay from the device.” While the cut-off point for contactless payments is €30, it’s possible to use Apple Pay and Android Pay for higher value transactions with a number of participating merchants — and there is an extra layer of security in that event. You’ve got to unlock your device and hold the back of it to the contactless payment terminal until you see a checkmark. The phone will beep and/or vibrate to confirm that the payment has been made. Jillian Heffernan says that while cash is still king, the old methods of payment are slowly ceding ground to the new. “While figures show that cash is still the most popular form of payment at point of sale — particularly for lower-value items – consumers are increasingly using debit cards, contactless and other electronic payment options in preference to cash for the greater convenience and security they provide.  "These latest initiatives, and others likely to follow from across the banking sector, will further bolster the use of non-cash payment options.” While the banks rush to reassure you that all of these methods are secure, it’s worth pointing out that the consumer also has a role to play here. Only download mobile apps from official app stores. These include the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Blackberry App World. Always keep your mobile phone’s operating system updated with the latest upgrades.  Older software may have vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could expose you to security and fraud risks. The BPFI also recommends you do what very few people do, which is to use a reputable brand of anti-virus software on your mobile phone.  Don’t share or give your mobile banking security details, including your passcode, to anyone and never store these on your phone. Finally, remember that public wifi hotspots aren’t always secure.  Only access online/mobile banking on safe networks. It’s a Bit harder to trace online currency, but not impossible Pity Welshman James Howells. Back in 2009, when Bitcoin was in its infancy, the IT worker ‘mined’ 7,500 Bitcoins on his home computer. They were so cheap as to be almost worthless at the time, but by November 2013, their value had risen to more than $1,200 each.  By then however, Howells had done some spring cleaning and had inadvertently dumped the hard drive on which all that value had been stored. When he discovered his mistake, he embarked on a frantic search through his computer files for a backup, and when that proved fruitless, he dashed down to his local landfill only to be confronted by acres of mountainous waste.  This missing hard drive with its $9m was gone forever. Bitcoin is what’s called a cryptocurrency, and is only the most successful of a number of these that have appeared in the past eight years. It is a digital asset, designed to operate like a conventional currency as a store of wealth and a medium of exchange.  The prefix ‘crypto’ signifies that cryptography is used both to create new units of Bitcoin and to secure transactions in the currency. That’s the theory. Beyond that, it gets complicated. Bitcoin Conventional currencies are created by a national or supranational monetary authority. The big differentiator with Bitcoin is that there is no equivalent centralised system of creation or control. Bitcoins are ‘mined’ by individuals like the unfortunate Mr Howells by solving mathematical problems using special software.  Effectively, these individuals or pools of individuals offer their computing power to record Bitcoin transactions and are rewarded with transaction fees and newly minted Bitcoins. These are then stored digitally and can be used to buy and sell goods and services, or they can be converted into conventional currencies. While Bitcoin is accepted in an increasing number of online markets, you don’t find too many retailers in Ireland that are happy to take them. Marvin.ie however is one notable exception. This is an online takeaway business which allows customers to order from one of hundreds of takeaways around the country.  In addition to accepting all the usual methods of payment, you can also pay for your curry or your pizza or your chips using Bitcoin.  Co-founder and MD James Galvin says that the company decided to accept Bitcoin in order to offer customers as many payment options as possible, and to give the business a competitive edge. “We knew Bitcoin was growing hugely in popularity and we felt as it wasn’t too hard to integrate, and the fraud risks were minimal, unlike credit card systems. It was an easy decision to make.”  The company works with a payment merchant called Coinify which handles the bitcoin payments side of the business. “It acts for all intents and purposes like any other online payment system, not dissimilar to Paypal. Bitcoin is still only around 5% of our total orders. It’s slowly growing, but what I find interesting is that we’ve never had one recorded issue of fraud.” One of the key advantages of Bitcoin, its proponents argue, is the fact that transaction fees are really low.  It’s possible to move large sums of money internationally by paying only a fraction of the fee you would pay for transferring an equivalent sum denominated in a conventional currency. As a store of value, the currency is subject to the vagaries of any asset.  Recent times have seen huge swings in its fortunes. Over 2016, the price of Bitcoin rose from $400 to $1,000. By January of this year, it was trading near all-time highs at around $1,150. Then it lost 20% of its value overnight following developments in the Chinese economy (around 95% of Bitcoin transactions happen in China, which makes developments there hugely influential). Then there’s the whole anonymity thing. While all Bitcoin transactions are stored publically and permanently, the identity of the user behind an address remains unknown.  Privacy advocates naturally love this, but the secrecy element is causing headaches elsewhere. Law enforcement agencies have expressed concern over Bitcoin’s use in criminal activity.  In fact, more than one commentator has asserted that if it wasn’t for its use in the trade of illegal goods and services, Bitcoin would never have taken off. Finding definitive evidence of this however not easy. The now defunct Silk Road — which specialised in the online trade of a wide variety of illicit goods and services — dealt in Bitcoin, while there are any number of reports of the use of Bitcoin in the trade of everything from child pornography to arms. That doesn’t necessarily make the medium of exchange inherently wrong of course.  It’s also worth pointing out that while the cryptography and peer-to-peer architecture on which Bitcoin is based make it more difficult to identify who sold what to whom, these are electronic transactions.  By their nature they leave a trail. Ross Ulbricht, who ran Silk Road, is currently serving a life sentence for facilitating the sale of drugs.  There have been several successful convictions of individuals who used the currency for illegal activity, proving that while it may be difficult to trace transactions, it can be done.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile New renders finally show the iPhone 8 design we want Image Source: Benjamin Geskin Zach Epstein @zacharye April 24th, 2017 at 12:16 PM Share Tweet Last week, supposed iPhone 8 specs leaked and showed a design that would be an absolute travesty. We’ve heard rumblings that Apple is having trouble readying its new in-display fingerprint scanner for mass production, and one option the company is supposedly toying with is relocating the Touch ID sensor to the back of the phone. That, of course, would be awful. Making matters worse was the fact that the leaked schematics showed the sensor placed more than halfway down the back of the phone, which would make it even more difficult to use comfortably. The bottom line is that everyone hated this leaked iPhone 8 design, and for good reasons. Now, however, a fresh new round of leaks suggest that Apple will not go with a fingerprint scanner on the back, and new renders finally show the iPhone 8 design we’re all hoping for. Don't Miss: It’s official: Everyone hates the iPhone 8 design that just leaked That supposed leak from last week was bad news from start to finish, as everyone agreed. The rear-placed fingerprint scanner is probably the only real complaint about Samsung’s Galaxy S8 design, and it would be a shame to see Apple follow suit. According to a fresh iPhone 8 schematics leak on Monday morning, however, that thankfully won’t be the case. As was the case with last week’s leak, there is no way to confirm whether or not this is the real deal. The new schematics come from an unknown source in China, and they seemingly show the internal parts layout for Apple’s upcoming new iPhone 8. There’s plenty to be gleaned from the leak, as we already covered, but the best news is the lack of a fingerprint scanner on the back. Instead, we see Touch ID hardware at the bottom of the phone where the physical home button used to be, suggesting that Apple will be able to pull off its in-display fingerprint scanner after all. Graphic designer Benjamin Geskin combined the details laid out in these schematics with earlier design rumors (glass front and back, vertical dual camera, stainless steel sides a la Apple Watch, etc) to create a new set of renders that show a much more attractive iPhone 8 than the drawings we saw last week. He tweeted them on Monday morning, and you’ll find them embedded below.

April 24, 2017 0 With every new version of iOS that launches, Apple keeps promising us improved security features, among many other new and exciting improvements. This shows that the Cupertino tech giant has caught on to how important security is to smartphone users nowadays, especially with all the companies that came forward on the topic of data collection and farming. Naturally, with the launch of the most recent installment in Apple’s in-house operating system line, namely the iOS 10, many new promises of improved security features were made. But did Apple really hold true to them? Our answer will have to be a firm ‘yes’ on this one. Keep reading to find out why. iOS 10 Security Features Perhaps the most robust security features that iOS 10 has to offer is its reliable data encryption system. In this way, Apple’s got your back as far as protecting your data from malicious third-parties, be them hackers or actual physical thieves that stole your phone. Your iPhone protects itself and the data it carries by a series of security steps such as a password, a pin code and thumbprint. On top of that, while the myth that Apple devices aren’t safe from malware might not hold true, it’s true that they are a bit safer from outside threats than Android devices or any other operating system-powered ones. For one, any Apple device comes with sever anti-malware programs already built in, and the constant security patches and update rolled out by the company also reduce the risk of malware infestation. All in all, we’d have to say that iOS 10 is pretty safe as far as operating systems go. What about your experience? Do you own an iOS 10-powered device? If so, how would you rate its security level? Let us know.

Not so fast, ardent iFans and optimistic Morgan Stanley analysts, as the most famous (and infamous) Apple tipster lends further credence to rampant speculation of production difficulties, supply shortages and commercial delays. KGI Securities pundit Ming-Chi Kuo of course talks in uncertain terms about a game-changing next-gen iPhone with an OLED screen, 10nm-based Apple A11 SoC, redesigned 3D Touch module and 3D sensing cameras. All these “significant hardware upgrades” could cause setbacks in the road to market of a device that may be called iPhone 8, Pro, Edition or even X, as in Cupertino’s tenth anniversary major release. Kuo believes several key “cutting-edge components” have been “custom-ordered” by Apple, with suppliers unlikely to be able to ramp up mass manufacturing on a “normal” September/October schedule. Just like a growing number of other insiders, this typically reliable financial analyst predicts the iPhone 8, 7s and 7s Plus will together go official in September. But only the two “iterative” models might be ready for a wide-scale rollout later that month, with the radically enhanced OLED version extremely hard to come by “for a while.” If that’s the case, and the iPhone 8 doesn’t fix its production issues by November, December or even January 2018, Kuo is probably right to lower its initial “new iPhone” shipment forecasts for this year from 110 to 80 or 90 million units.

There are seven fun effects to give your videos so pizzazz, and there's even a green screen mode to set your scenes anywhere you please. If you're just getting started with stop motion or just want a fun way to bang out some quick shorts, then definitely check out Stop Motion Studio Pro. $4.99 - Download now V for Wikipedia Going online for Wikipedia is fine, but to have an intuitive app with all of Wikipedia at your fingertips is even better. V for Wikipedia is basically a Wikipedia reader that pretties up Wikipedia and provides an even more mobile-friendly reference experience. That's really it, and it doesn't sound all that incredible, but when you're searching up what you're interested in via a pleasant, welcoming, and rather gorgeous interface, it makes the experience all that much more enjoyable. V's best feature, though, is using your location to point out interesting landmarks nearby and providing you with the Wikipedia articles about them. If you've never really taken time to explore your city or you're abroad and would like to know more about where you are, this feature is invaluable. You don't have to just explore your immediate surroundings; you can use the GPS function to search anywhere in the world. $4.99 - Download now Scrivener If you're a serious writer on the go, then Scrivener should be on your iPad — no questions asked.

If you're not satisfied with the initial effects, you can buy other FX packs in the app. $9.99 - Download now Yousician Yes, Yousician is free to download and initial lessons are free as well, but if you want the full experience and truly want to learn an instrument, then you gotta subscribe — and it's totally worth it. Yousician uses your iPad's microphone to effectively teach you to play the piano, guitar, bass, or ukulele.

Subscriptions start off at $19.99/month, which is hella reasonable, considering you might spend that per lesson at a music school. Free to download, subscriptions - Download now Pixelmator It's anyone's guess as to why Adobe hasn't jumped on the iPad bandwagon with fully formed Creative Suite apps, but that's OK because Pixelmator has the Photoshop hole covered. It's a layer-based image editing app made exclusively for iOS that lets you do just about everything you can do in Photoshop. Control colors, brightness, and saturation, remove blemishes, blur, sharpen, add effects, and much, much more. Pixelmator isn't just for editing images, oh no. You can actually paint images right on your iPad. You can choose from over 100 brush styles and go to town painting watercolors, pixel art, acrylic-style paintings, and more, and you can still use layers to isolate spots on your image. Pixelmator is even compatible with Apple Pencil, so you can have even more control over your creative process. Editing, painting… Oh yeah, Pixelmator is also a powerful graphic design tool, letting you add images, words, and shapes to create visually appealing artwork, promotional material, and more. So if you feel like sitting and painting along with Bob Ross, but you don't want a house littered with canvases, just download Pixelmator and paint beautiful nature images (don't forget a friend for the happy little cloud). Oh yeah, all this, and Pixelmator's only $5. Hell of a deal. $4.99 - Download now Procreate No, this app won't help you cash in your v-card or aid with fertility. It's all about creating beautiful works of art right on your iPad. Procreate uses layers (like Photoshop), as well as filters and thousands of brush styles to help you create masterful images — you can even use your Apple Pencil (Procreate supports pressure sensitivity). Procreate is an Apple Design Award winner, as well as an "App Store Essential" because it's perfect for anyone who loves to draw. Lay down your pencils, add inks on another layer, and then color everything to your heart's content. There are even blending tools like a smudge and blur tool to help you blend colors and seamlessly integrate your layers. Don't like a section of your image? Use the selection tool to separate it and delete it. Procreate's a lot like Pixelmator, but it's more focused on editing and transforming your artwork. $5.99 - Download now Goat Simulator Who doesn't love goats? If it's not Gary the Goat, then it's any goat really, and wouldn't you like to live life with a goat's-eye view? Well now you can! Goat Simulator is the wonderfully whacky and completely non sequitur game from Coffee Stain Studios. Your main objective is to cause as much destruction as possible: smash into cars, run people over, blow through buildings, and enjoy the almost total absence of physics. If you like a serious game with a solid story and interesting character development, don't bother with this one. It's all about stupidity and the sheer freedom of being a goat on the rampage. The game is buggy as hell and it makes for some hilarious situations, and the developers have left them all in (aside from crash bugs) because why not? Goat Simulator is basically like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, except you're a goat, and there's really no point to anything. Sure, you'll rack up points for destruction, but does it really matter when you're a goat? Narp. If you need a laugh, spend $2 and get lost in the mind of a goat on the loose. $1.99 - Download now Editorial Are you a writer for the web? Then you'll probably find great use in Editorial, which is a dynamite plain text editor for iOS. It features inline previews for Markdown, Fountain, and TaskPaper documents, so you can see everything as it'll look in its final form. You can see the documents formatting while you're writing, in real time, and you can speed up productivity with Snippets — frequently used bits of text that you can insert with abbreviations. As a blogger, I can tell you that one of the biggest pains in my ass is bouncing back and forth between my research and my writing — even with two browser windows side by side. Editorial features an in-app browser so that you don't have to go out to your Home screen or app switcher to find your browser, search, go back to your Home screen, forget what you were doing, play Candy Crush for a few minutes, browse Instagram, and then remember "Oh, shit, I have a deadline!" Dropbox sync lets you take your documents with you wherever you go, making Editorial the ultimate text editor for web writers on the go. $4.99 - Download now Coda Coda is another amazing text editor, and is more powerful and robust than Editorial. This full-featured app highlights syntax for developers and software writers, and also features clips and find and replace (oh so important), as well as context keys and more. You can also manage files locally or remotely, and see previews of your sites on the fly. Coda is a web developer's dream, allowing you to manage multiple projects right on your iPad. It supports multiple remote protocols, like SFTP, WebDAV, FTP, DreamObjects, and more. It also adds a special section to your iOS keyboard with context keys and helpful special characters that you can access automatically. If you're a programmer and don't feel like lugging your Mac or PC with you everywhere you go, then do it all on your iPad with Coda. $24.99 - Download now Tweetbot 4 You might think that Twitter's own iOS is perfect, and if you do, that's totally fine. But if you're a diehard Twitter user, you'll probably want something a little more robust, with better features and ways to view your feed. Tweetbot 4 lets you sync your timeline across all of your devices and puts you in control of what you see. You can mute tweets by certain users, mute hashtags, and even keywords, so that you don't get so frustrated with all the crap flying around that you just up and quit Twitter altogether. You can still do everything like you would normally — DMs, tweet, view lists — as well as a statistics view, a night theme for low-light environments, and more. If you want to keep track of how popular certain tweets are or how many followers you're gaining and losing every day, Tweetbot is invaluable. $9.99 - Download now Astropad Studio Astropad is a sort of cousin to Duet Display in that it sort of acts as a second screen for your Mac, but it turns your iPad into an integrated tablet. Connect to your Mac via Wi-Fi or USB and then draw right into Photoshop, Illustrator, and other creative apps. Astropad Studio features customizable Apple Pencil shortcuts, keyboard support, customizable gesture shortcuts, and more. You can start a free 7-day trial or dive right in for $7.99 a month or $64.99 per year. If you want to turn your iPad into a full-fledged graphics tablet, then Astropad Pro should be your go-to, especially if you're wanting to use it professionally.

By Rene Ritchie Sunday, Apr 23, 2017 at 12:12 pm EDT 2 Comments Renowned cinematographer and VR and 3D plugin creator Tim Dashwood snapped up by Apple. Apple has reportedly hired Tim Dashwood, the Toronto, Canada-based founder of Dashwood Cinema Solutions, co-founder of Stereo3D Unlimited, and creator of numerous 3D and VR editing plugins for Final Cut Pro X. From FCP.co: Two bits of good news. 3D and VR plugin developer Tim Dashwood has joined Apple. Not only is that good news for FCPX users, he has also made his existing plugin products free. We would imagine FxFactory's servers have been red hot since the news crept out that long-time plugin developer Tim Dashwood has joined Apple. They theorize this could lead to 3D and VR editing capabilities being baked into Final Cut Pro X, or into macOS or iOS directly. More interesting possibilities include Apple's ongoing augmented reality and computer vision projects, where working in 3D and using VR-like technologies will certainly play a role. Whatever he ends up working on at Apple, here's wishing Dashwood the best of luck and success in his new endeavors. Now, FCPX users, go download all that great free software!

By Rene Ritchie Sunday, Apr 23, 2017 at 1:00 pm EDT 4 Comments Silver, gold, rose gold, space gray, space black, or the all new ceramic white — here's how to pick the perfect Apple Watch color for you! Updated April, 2017: Freshly updated for anyone and everyone considering an Apple Watch purchase now that spring is here and there's outdoor fitness fun to be had. Apple Watch is the first major tech product to truly blur the lines with fashion. That's because watches have never just been about telling time. They've been about making a statement. As much gadget as jewelry, we don't carry them — we wear them. And that means the color you pick is about as personal a decision as you can make. If you're on the fence about which finish to get, here's what you need to consider! Band lines Discoloration doubts Withstanding wear Coolness concerns Who should get silver? Who should get gold or rose gold? Who should get space gray or space black? [Who should get ceramic white?(#white) Band lines Most Apple Watch bands have polished stainless steel lugs. There are a few exceptions, including the Sport, Woven Nylon, and Loop lines that have lugs matching the band color, and there are third-party options for switching lug colors after you buy. But the vast majority of Apple Watch bands only truly match the stainless steel Apple Watch. There's probably some weird supply chain and store stocking match that led Apple to that decision, and as much as most of us would like a variety of lug colors to choose from on every band, that's not currently the world we live in. The lack of perfectly matching lugs bothers some people. A lot. Others, not at all. I've used and worn almost every color Apple Watch over the past few years and I fall somewhere in the middle. It irks me when the lugs don't match, but it's not a deal-breaker for bands that I love. Even so, silver stainless steel is the finish I've stuck with the most and for this very reason. If you want your Apple Watch to blend seamlessly into the widest range of bands possible, go with stainless steel. If you don't care how you pair, or you only ever buy bands with colored lugs, go for whichever finish you like. Discoloration doubts No matter which Apple Watch finish you get, one thing you don't have to worry about is discoloration. The silver Apple Watch finishes are coated aluminum and stainless steel, and those colors aren't going anywhere. The Edition is white, but it's white ceramic. While that's new for Apple, white ceramic isn't new for watches. I've been wearing one for months and it's still as pristine as fresh-fallen snow. Likewise, all the space grays, silvers, golds, and rose golds we've tested over the last couple of years have all kept their colors exactly. If you're worried about an Apple Watch with a white or light finish staining or discoloring or the dark finishes fading, don't be. They're all fine. Withstanding wear Most Apple Watches have anodized aluminum finishes. That includes the silver, space gray, gold, rose gold, and Nike+. Apple's anodization manages to be tougher than most without looking gloppy. They are metal, though and can be scratched and chipped. On the silver Apple Watches, small scratches have less contrast, which makes them harder to see, depending on the lighting. Gold and rose gold Watches are somewhere in the middle. Space Gray has a higher contrast, so scratches are a bit more noticeable. The polished stainless steel is far tougher and also makes scratches hard to see. The space black has a diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating that's about as tough as it gets. I've sometimes seen what I thought were scratches on my space black Apple Watch only to realize it was some other metal or concrete the watch scratched off. Yeah. Ceramic is likewise incredibly resistant to scratches and scrapes. Even tougher than stainless steel. If you hate the look of scratches, silver aluminum, stainless steel, or ceramics are your best bet. If you don't mind — or even love — the look of worn tech, go Millennium Falcon and get whatever color you like. Coolness concerns How much bling is your wrist thing? For some, even gadget jewelry like watches is best kept understated. That's where the silver aluminum or polished stainless steel comes in. They're elegant but not too fussy about it. Space gray is even more chill. Dark but not too dark. It's space black that's full on blackout. It's so trendy it borders on classic at this point, but, especially with the OLED display on Apple Watch, it really works. Gold and rose gold put the fashion in front of the tech. Neither are in-your-face bold gold or ruby rose. The yellow is more champagne and the rose is basically pink. Both get and deserve attention. The white ceramic is a different beast. In some light, in brief glances, it can be mistaken for silver. On closer examination, though, it's clearly white. Not 1970s belt white either. High-end horology white. If you don't want to draw attention, stick to silver aluminum or polished stainless steel. If you want to be different but not too daring, space gray or space black. If bling is your thing, so is gold or rose gold. If you want to stand out without shouting out, go ceramic white. Who should get the silver aluminum or polished stainless steel Apple Watch? If you want a color that isn't so dark but still doesn't call a lot of attention to itself and that doesn't show scuffs and scrapes as much, that matches the most lugs and lets the bands be the stars, then go with the silver aluminum or polished stainless steel Apple Watch. See at Apple Who should get the space gray or space black Apple Watch? If you want a color that makes the Apple Watch display melt away, that will never be too bright or distracting, and in the case of the space black, is full-on "blackout" and will scratch most of the universe before it gets scratched, stick with the spaces. See at Apple Who should get the gold or rose gold Apple Watch? If you like the luxury look, think watches really should be jewelry, don't mind the middle ground when it comes to how wear and tear shows, and want a little dazzle on your wrist, get the gold or rose gold Apple Watch. See at Apple Who should get the white Apple Watch? If you want a look that really stands out without looking like it's trying to stand out, that's incredibly scratch-resistant, or you're just hankering for something new and don't mind paying for the privilege, get the white ceramic Apple Watch Edition. See at Apple Still undecided? If you're still not sure about which color you should get, jump into our Apple Watch forums and the best community on the web will happily help you out. At the end of the day, the only real answer is this — get the color you like best. Nothing else matters. Just close your eyes, picture your Apple Watch on your wrist, and focus down on the color you're picturing. Then buy that. Try it out. And remember: You have two weeks to exchange it if you change your mind. Once you've decided, tell me — which one are you getting?

To look at the weather. To look at anything else you have on your watch without taking out your phone. I use mine to control the music at the Zumba classes I teach. I have my shopping list on it for at the grocery store. It shows me the temperature of my food when I use my iGrill temperature probe thingy. And it's a watch. Lots of people wear watches and carry phones at the same time. 0 16 hours ago Reply ggore I disagree with the author, the stainless steel Apple Watch scratches very easily and shows those scratches very well. Of course, those will show up with normal wear and tear over the years on any stainless steel watch case, not just the Apple Watch. I have tried to polish them out with little or no success, I just wear them as a badge of a well-used and loved watch. 0 19 hours ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Uber Once Nearly Booted from Apple App Store for iPhone Tracking By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: APRIL 24 2017 Ride-hailing app Uber's China ambitions came to a halt in August, when the company ceded its operations in that country to rival Didi Chuxing. But one of Uber's aggressive tactics to win in China nearly cost it some very valuable real estate: a place in the Apple App Store. In a wide-ranging profile of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick yesterday, New York Times writer Mike Isaac reveals Uber had been "fingerprinting" iPhones, reportedly to detect Uber drivers in markets such as China using resold devices to create new rider accounts to boost their ride numbers and incentive earnings. However, by placing code on iPhones that remained even if the devices were wiped for resale, Uber was violating Apple's privacy terms. To prevent Apple engineers from detecting its use of such code, Uber then "geofenced" the region around the Apple's California headquarters, Isaac reported. But Apple engineers beyond that geofenced perimeter eventually spotted Uber's code, leading Apple CEO Tim Cook to call Kalanick in to his office for a face-to-face talk in early 2015. Cook's message: Stop fingerprinting iPhones or risk having Uber kicked out of the Apple App Store. Kalanick agreed to the request. Multiple PR Black Eyes While it's a fast-growing global company valued at close to $70 billion, Uber has yet to turn a profit. In recent months, the firm has also been hit by one scandal after another. In January, a "DeleteUber" campaign launched on Twitter after the company said it would suspend surge pricing for trips to and from New York City's JFK International Airport during widespread protests against President Donald Trump's executive order barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. New York City's taxi alliance had stopped offering airport rides to show support for travelers and protestors. In February, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler wrote a lengthy piece on her personal blog describing a work atmosphere that was hostile to female employees and reluctant to discipline "high-performing" male employees for harassment and inappropriate behavior. Not long afterward, a video recording surfaced showed Kalanick yelling at and arguing with an Uber driver. 'Pressure To Change' These and other Uber practices have caused "extensive" damage to the company, according to yesterday's article in the New York Times. "Mr. Kalanick's leadership is at a precarious point," Isaac wrote. "While Uber is financed by a who's who of investors including Goldman Sachs and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Mr. Kalanick controls the majority of the company’s voting shares with a small handful of other close friends, and has stacked Uber's board of directors with many who are invested in his success. Yet board members have concluded that he must change his management style, and are pressuring him to do so." However, TechCrunch reported yesterday that Uber was "pushing back on the allegations" in the New York Times piece by saying its use of fingerprinting is common among tech companies seeking to prevent fraud. "We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they've deleted the app," an unidentified Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch. "As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone -- over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users' accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users." The company Slice Intelligence has also been feeling heat in the wake of yesterday's Times story, which reported that Uber had purchased anonymized passenger data about its rival Lyft gathered through Slice's email service Unroll.me. "[I]t was heartbreaking to see that some of our users were upset to learn about how we monetize our free service," Unroll.me CEO and co-founder Jojo Hedaya wrote in a blog post yesterday. "We never, ever release personal data about you. All data is completely anonymous and related to purchases only." Image credit: Uber, Apple iTunes.

McAfee Relaunches Away from Intel Next Article > Beware: Punycode Phishing Scam Can Snare even Savviest Users By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: APRIL 21 2017 If think you've fine-tuned your online security skills enough not to fall for a phishing scam, think again: software engineer Xudong Zheng has uncovered a vulnerability that could be especially difficult to spot. Writing on his blog last week, Zheng described a special variation of what's called an "IDN [internationalized domain name] homograph attack." This kind of attack involves using letters from one language system, for example, Cyrillic, that look just like letters from another system, say, Latin, to trick people into clicking on legitimate-looking URLs that actually takes them to different, possibly malicious Web sites. While most browsers today offer protections against IDN attacks, Zheng discovered a unique exception: when another language system can be used to replace all, and not just some, of the letters in legitimate domains, many browsers won't catch the trick. This leaves both the real URLs and the spoofed URLs looking nearly identical in the browsers' fonts. Chrome Fix Now Rolling Out The attack strategy works because of the system put in place to enable the registration of Web domains using foreign characters. A coding system called Punycode is applied to foreign characters to render them readable in standard ASCII text. Zheng said a problem can arise, though, with Web addresses that look exactly like Latin-character URLs, but are actually written in homographs, which are characters in different languages that appear almost identical to Latin text. For instance, Cyrillic features many letters that look similar to the Latin alphabet, making it possible to spoof the actual domain "apple.com" (in Latin characters) with the alternative URL, "apple.com" (in Cyrillic characters). "Visually, the two domains are indistinguishable due to the font used by Chrome and Firefox," Zheng said in his blog post. "As a result, it becomes impossible to identify the site as fraudulent without carefully inspecting the site's URL or SSL certificate." Since the vulnerability was reported to Chrome and Firefox on Jan. 20, it has been fixed in the March 24 Chrome update that's now rolling out, Zheng said. However, the bug remains an issue in the Firefox, Opera and Internet Explorer browsers. The fix in Chrome ensures that a potential lookalike URL using foreign characters will be displayed in the raw Punycode. "We have confirmed that this resolves the issue and that our 'epic.com' test domain no longer shows as 'epic.com' and displays the raw punycode instead, which is 'www.xn--e1awd7f.com', making it clear that the domain is not 'epic.com'," the software security firm Wordfence reported Tuesday. Use Password Manager, Type URLs Manually Users of different browsers can take other steps on their own to protect against the possibility of such IDN homograph attacks, Zheng said. Firefox users, for example, can force the browser to display the raw Punycode for sites by going to about:config and setting network.IDN_show_punycode to "true." IBM's Security Intelligence site reported Tuesday that the raw Punycode is now displayed correctly in Internet Explorer, as well as in Brave, Edge, Safari and Vivaldi. Another protection strategy is to use a password manager, Zheng said. "In general, users must be very careful and pay attention to the URL when entering personal information," he said. "Until this is fixed, concerned users should manually type the URL or navigate to sites via a search engine when in doubt. This is a serious vulnerability because it can even fool those who are extremely mindful of phishing." Image credit: iStock.

By Caitlin McGarry Staff Writer, Macworld | Apr 24, 2017 9:53 AM PT Credit: freestocks.org More like this Lessons from SXSW: Life without Uber is mostly fine Uber offers cities ‘anonymized’ ride data After legal scuffle, Uber gets permit to test self-driving cars in California Video Hands-on with Apple's new video-editing app, Clips In 2015, Uber almost got itself kicked out of the iOS App Store. Apple CEO Tim Cook brought Uber CEO Travis Kalanick into the company’s Cupertino offices and laid down the law, the New York Times reported. So what exactly did Uber do to land itself in hot water with Apple? The original NYT report initially said the company was tracking iPhones, but it has since been clarified to describe Uber’s actions as “identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app has been deleted and the devices erased.” The reason Uber did that, the company said, was to prevent phone thieves in China from creating Uber accounts and requesting rides before wiping the devices and doing so again and again. “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app,” an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch. “As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users’ accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users.” But how exactly did Uber track devices after they had been wiped? Security expert Will Strafach looked at a 2014 build of Uber’s app and found the company was using private APIs to pull iPhone serial numbers from the device registry using Apple's IOKit framework. Uber’s fingerprinting technique doesn’t work in iOS 10, so the company can’t identify your device after you delete the app, Strafach noted (as spotted in a worthwhile read on Daring Fireball). Apparently, Uber’s fingerprinting wasn’t a big enough privacy violation to get kicked out of the App Store. Apple found that Uber was not only violating the App Store developer rules, but trying to cover its tracks by geofencing its code so Cupertino app reviewers wouldn’t see the private APIs at work. That didn’t work for long, which is how Kalanick ended up in Cook’s office. According to the NYT, Kalanick was visibly shaken by the encounter. Why this matters: Uber is having a rough year entirely of its own making. It’s unclear if this latest privacy kerfuffle will inspire more Uber users to delete the app, as they did when widespread allegations of workplace harassment came to light and a video of Kalanick yelling at an Uber driver emerged. But it is clear that Uber needs to do something to fix its public relations problems. Maybe not acting so terrible all the time would be a good place to start.

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Uber Once Nearly Booted from Apple App Store for iPhone Tracking By Shirley Siluk / Enterprise Security Today PUBLISHED: APRIL 24 2017 Ride-hailing app Uber's China ambitions came to a halt in August, when the company ceded its operations in that country to rival Didi Chuxing. But one of Uber's aggressive tactics to win in China nearly cost it some very valuable real estate: a place in the Apple App Store. In a wide-ranging profile of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick yesterday, New York Times writer Mike Isaac reveals Uber had been "fingerprinting" iPhones, reportedly to detect Uber drivers in markets such as China using resold devices to create new rider accounts to boost their ride numbers and incentive earnings. However, by placing code on iPhones that remained even if the devices were wiped for resale, Uber was violating Apple's privacy terms. To prevent Apple engineers from detecting its use of such code, Uber then "geofenced" the region around the Apple's California headquarters, Isaac reported. But Apple engineers beyond that geofenced perimeter eventually spotted Uber's code, leading Apple CEO Tim Cook to call Kalanick in to his office for a face-to-face talk in early 2015. Cook's message: Stop fingerprinting iPhones or risk having Uber kicked out of the Apple App Store. Kalanick agreed to the request. Multiple PR Black Eyes While it's a fast-growing global company valued at close to $70 billion, Uber has yet to turn a profit. In recent months, the firm has also been hit by one scandal after another. In January, a "DeleteUber" campaign launched on Twitter after the company said it would suspend surge pricing for trips to and from New York City's JFK International Airport during widespread protests against President Donald Trump's executive order barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries.

Not long afterward, a video recording surfaced showed Kalanick yelling at and arguing with an Uber driver. 'Pressure To Change' These and other Uber practices have caused "extensive" damage to the company, according to yesterday's article in the New York Times. "Mr. Kalanick's leadership is at a precarious point," Isaac wrote. "While Uber is financed by a who's who of investors including Goldman Sachs and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Mr. Kalanick controls the majority of the company’s voting shares with a small handful of other close friends, and has stacked Uber's board of directors with many who are invested in his success.

Apple also released a minor iOS 10.3.1 update in early April, which focused on security improvements. Registered developers can download the fourth iOS 10.3.2 beta from the Apple Developer Center or over-the-air with the proper configuration profile installed. Apple doesn't typically provide detailed release notes for its iOS updates, so we don't yet know what features, improvements, or bug fixes might be coming in iOS 10.3.2, aside from some fixes for SiriKit car commands, outlined in the release notes for the first beta. As a minor 10.x.x update, we can expect iOS 10.3.2 to offer bug fixes and performance improvements rather than outward-facing features. No notable features were found in the first three betas, but if anything new is found in the fourth iOS 10.3.2 beta, we'll update this post. Update: Apple has also provided the fourth beta of iOS 10.3.2 to public beta testers.

It's not up to the developer to patch an app every time the mfg breaks their code API. If you are on a beta you can expect this kind of behaviour, if you don't like it you better be on the regular Updates, normally if Apps won't work on beta's they will work if it's a normal .x release. It's not Apple's code, it's the developers code, they will update when Apple release the final version. Rating: 2 Votes delonholmes 14 hours ago at 10:00 am But is this the master beta?

The fourth beta of macOS Sierra 10.12.5 can be downloaded through the Apple Developer Center or through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store. According to the release notes accompanying the beta, the update "improves the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac." Apple's release notes don't often provide a lot of insight into what's included in new beta software, so we don't know what features or bug fixes might be included in the 10.12.5 update. No notable changes or major bug fixes were discovered in the first three betas, but should anything pop up in the fourth macOS Sierra 10.12.5 beta, we'll update this post. Update: Apple has also provided the fourth beta of macOS Sierra 10.12.5 to public beta testers.

There are no 'releases' of macOS 10.12.5 yet. * HandBrake works fine for me and apparently other people in the forum * It's a Developers Preview and something tells me that you are not much of a developer if you feel you needed to throw a fit that an app is not working on your primary Mac (of which you shouldn't be installing this preview on) EDIT: BTW you probably shouldn't try the public beta either Rating: 6 Votes kissmo 13 hours ago at 11:04 am I think Mac os 10.13 will be called Mac OS Beta Rating: 4 Votes justperry 14 hours ago at 10:03 am Another suppressive release.

Rating: 1 Votes chriscrowlee 6 hours ago at 06:24 pm Another suppressive release. They killed Handbrake. What next? You obviously don't understand what Beta means. And if it angers you that third party software doesn't work, revert back to the public final release version available and NEVER install a Beta again. How do you think software developers release software? They get the Beta from Apple, then design their app to work with the OS. How would you expect a developer to develop software on an OS that they don't have access to? Get real. Anyhow, it's obviously an isolated issue, as my Handbrake works just fine, and you're the ONLY one on here that's say it doesn't work. Every other post says it works fine. If you can't live without ANY single app working on your computer, DO NOT INSTALL BETAS. Rating: 1 Votes [ Read All Comments ] Upcoming iPad Pro Early 2017?

It can be downloaded by connecting the Apple TV to a computer with a USB-C cable and installing the beta software from a registered developer account using iTunes. Because of the installation requirements, tvOS betas are limited to developers. tvOS 10.2.1 will not be available to the public until the final version of the software launches. Apple does not typically provide detailed beta release notes, so we don't yet know what's included in tvOS 10.2.1. It's likely to focus primarily on bug fixes, security enhancements, and performance improvements, so we may not know what's new until the software sees an official release. No notable changes were found in the first three tvOS 10.2.1 betas, but should anything new popup in the fourth beta, we'll update this post.

The fourth beta of watchOS 3.2.2 can be downloaded through the Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General --> Software Update. To install the update, the Apple Watch must have 50 percent battery, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the iPhone. watchOS betas require an iPhone running iOS 10 to install, and they're only available to developers because there's no way to downgrade the software on an Apple Watch. It's not yet clear if watchOS 3.2.2 introduces any new features or bug fixes because Apple doesn't typically provide release notes for betas. Given that this is a minor 3.x.x update, it's likely to focus primarily on bug fixes.

Home Macs | 20 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (9) iLife and iWork Apps Now Free for Everyone by Josh Centers Once upon a time, Apple used to charge for nearly all its software, and especially productivity apps like the iLife and iWork suites. However, back in 2013, Apple made those apps free with the purchase of any new Mac or iOS device (see “New Free iLife and iWork Apps Share across Devices and Platforms,” 22 October 2013). Now, with no announcement or fanfare, Apple has made the current iLife and iWork apps entirely free for all users. Just to be clear, the change affects the following apps: GarageBand for macOS (requires 10.10 Yosemite) and iOS (requires iOS 10.2) iMovie for macOS (requires 10.11.2 El Capitan) and iOS (requires iOS 9.3) Keynote for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Numbers for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Pages for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) This is good news for holdouts who haven’t purchased a new eligible Apple device since 2013 but are running a supported version of the operating system and would like copies of the iLife and iWork apps. And it makes explaining the pricing easier for Apple. Why didn’t Apple just make these apps free for everyone in the first place? The answer likely lies deep within Apple’s accounting department. Back in 2013, Apple made iLife, iWork, and OS X 10.9 Mavericks free and bundled them with every new Mac and iOS device sold. That move enabled the company to delay recognition of a portion of its sales receipts. That’s because the product (a Mac or iOS device) wasn’t “fully delivered” without updates to the software — it’s a “subscription accounting” approach. In its Q4 2013 financial quarter, Apple delayed recognition of $900 million in revenue, in essence hiding that money from the quarterly report (see “Apple Q4 2013 Results See Lower Profits Again,” 28 October 2013). That may answer the question of why Apple is now making these apps free for everyone. According to Daniel Eran Dilger of AppleInsider, the deferred revenue trickles back into Apple’s reported revenues over 2 years for iOS and 4 years for the Mac. It has been about 4 years since this deferral likely began, implying that Apple has finally cleaned the associated deferred revenue off its books. In the end, this change doesn’t mean much. Any effects from iLife and iWork becoming free — on competing apps, on Apple’s revenues, and on the perceived value of Apple hardware, for instance — have already taken place. Most people who want to use the iLife and iWork apps have likely either bought copies already or purchased new hardware since October 2013. We suspect that sales to owners of older Macs and iOS devices have dropped to the point where it was no longer worthwhile for Apple to bother charging for the apps anymore.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Alfonso Scenna  2017-04-20 15:51 For people with older iOS devices, unless you are able to run iOS 10 you cannot download the now free apps. Reply Jim Schmidt  2017-04-24 12:32 Yep, I found that out last night. I went to download Pages on my iPad, and found out I couldn't because I don't have iOS 10 on it. I went to upgrade the OS... and found out my iPad is too old for 10. Sad. Reply Ian Orchard  2017-04-24 20:08 I've got the same problem with my beloved MacBookPro that is now deemed to be obsolete by Apple. I can't upgrade my current copies of iWork because it can't run Sierra. Now if only I could find a way to stop Pages & Numbers from nagging me to upgrade. Reply Jeffrey Puritz  2017-04-20 17:33 You're an optimist but my lengthy experience with Apple tells me that like Aperture these apps are in for a long slow death by neglect. Sadly, I think that this is true for the mac as well. Apple is only interested in the products with the most revenue and it shows. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-04-20 18:15 Free may seem like a good thing, but nothing is really free. In this case we will be paying for these apps through hardware purchases, if we use an app or not. Then there is the question of app quality. Since Apple is not making any money off them anymore there is no stimulus to make these apps so good people will be willing to pay for them. The option to vote with our wallet has been taken from us. One sad example is the latest version of Numbers for iOS. The complaints and 1 star reviews are pouring in but Apple seems to be deaf and blind to them. Now that Numbers is free there is even less reason te expect Apple to do anything about this bad update. Reply Paul F Henegan   2017-04-21 03:55 No, they are not "free for everyone", only for those who have also upgraded to macOS X 12 or later. As Alfonso Scenna observes above, unless one is willing and able to run the very latest OS, there is no invitation to the party. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-21 09:39 You're right that these apps have specific system requirements, and we've updated the article to make this completely clear. However, that doesn't change the fact that the apps are indeed free for everyone. Your ability to run an app is separate from its price. Reply Karen Kirtland  2017-04-24 19:55 The upgraded 5.2 version of Pages I tried using was terrible when compared with the older 4.0 versions. It functions too much like the awful Word program for me to use it. I wouldn't upgrade any of my perfectly functioning iWork programs, free or not, based on the extremely negative experience with Pages alone. Reply Phil Seymour  2017-04-24 21:15 They are free because the latest versions are crap compared to 09 versions. Thankfully I have kept the older versions of Pages, Keynote, Numbers, iMovie, GarageBand and iPhoto. I have the new versions, too, but if I have creative work to do, I use the older versions that were designed with uninterrupted creative workflow in mind.

By Jordan Darville A woman uses the Uber app on an Samsung smartphone in Berlin, Germany. September 2, 2014   Photo by Adam Berry/Getty Images A New York Times profile of Uber cofounder and CEO Travis Kalanick alleges that the ridesharing app tracked users even after the app was deleted from their iPhones. The process is called "fingerprinting," and allowed Uber's engineers to identify individuals who had used an iPhone even after the device had been entirely wiped. Kalanick and Uber reportedly employed this strategy to combat fraud in China, even though fingerprinting is a violation of Apple's privacy guidelines. To prevent Apple from catching on, Uber "geofenced” Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California. This kept employees working out of Apple's base from parsing Uber's code. "The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased," Mike Isaac wrote for the Times. However, it wasn't long before Apple CEO Tim Cook learned of the deception, and ordered Kalanick to cease the spying, or Uber would be removed from the App Store. Kalanick agreed; a loss of Apple users would be devastating to Uber's business. Both Apple and Uber declined to comment on the meeting to the Times. In a statement to The Verge, Uber denied tracking "individual users" who had deleted the app, but did not dispute breaking Apple's privacy guidelines. “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app. As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users' accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users.” This incident is not the first time Uber has been accused of secretly tracking, either: In January 2016, Uber paid a $20,000 settlement with regulators over its "God Mode" tool, which allowed the company to track the location of drivers and users without permission. A former forensic investigator named Samuel Ward Spangenberg alleged that employees used the "God Mode" function to spy on "ex-partners, politicians, and Beyoncé." Spangenberg is suing Uber for age discrimination and whistleblower retaliation. ADVERTISEMENT Uber has faced a barrage of condemnation in recent months, both at a grassroots level and within the company itself. The #DeleteUber campaign was started in response to Uber's alleged "picket line crossing" of striking taxi cabs, protesting President Donald Trump's Muslim ban at John F. Kennedy airport in New York City on January 27. Almost 200,000 users took down their accounts. In subsequent weeks, Uber employees alleged that the company's workplace culture overlooked incidents of sexual harassment and violent threats, if the individual was a high-performer. A common thread in the complaints and criticisms is Kalanick himself. In March, Kalanick was caught arguing with an Uber driver over the service's low fares, and the impact on drivers. He later apologized and claimed he was seeking "leadership help." For a deep dive into Uber's problems, read "Uber Is Doomed" by Jalopnik's Ryan Felton.

Cook apparently called Kalanick for a one-on-one after the company found out that Uber had found a secret way to track individual iPhones even once the ride-sharing service’s app was removed from the phone. He was predictable unhappy about it. What Uber had figured out is commonly referred to as fingerprinting and is not allowed by Apple. To make sure that Apple didn’t find out, Uber geofenced Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, changing its code so that Apple employees were not able to find what it was doing. Despite all of Uber’s efforts to mask the fingerprinting efforts, Apple employees were able to find what it was up to and this led to a meeting between the two CEOs. Cook voiced his displeasure over the practice and told Kalanick to see that the practice of fingerprinting iPhone users ended immediately or else Apple would ban the Uber app from the App Store. Had it come to that, Uber would have lost out on tens of millions of potential users. Kalanick was obviously concerned, with the report mentioning that he was “shaken by Mr. Cook’s scolding.” It goes without saying that Uber ended the practice. Filed in Transportation.

A purported CNC shell of the iPhone 8 has surfaced online giving us a glimpse of what might possibly be Apple’s next flagship smartphone. There’s obviously no way of knowing right now if the model that we see here is actually going to be the one that Apple settles on for the iPhone 8. It’s based on purported diagrams of the iPhone 8 that leaked online recently. Since it’s not known for sure right now, the possibility exists that this shell might just be based off of blueprints for a prototype of the iPhone 8. It may be entirely false as well so it would be best to not form an assumption about the iPhone 8’s design at this point in time. Apple is not due to launch the iPhone 8 until the fall this year. Recent reports suggest that the handset may not arrive until 2018 as the mass production has been delayed. None of this has been officially confirmed as yet so take it all with a grain of salt. Apple normally announces new iPhones in the fall and it’s likely going to stick with that timeframe this year as well. iPhone 8 Dummy (This is CNC model according to Foxconn) Back is 2.5D Glass.#iPhone8 #iPhoneX #iPhoneEdition pic.twitter.com/Z8mH7b7z4r — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) April 23, 2017 Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

According to the source of the rumor, the store, which will be directly operated by Apple, will occupy a 1,322 square meter retail unit that straddles the first floor and basement level one of the building, located next to the cosmetics concessions off Xinyi Road. Meanwhile, authorized Apple retailer, Studio A, last Monday withdrew from its retail store in basement level one of Taipei 101. Precisely when the Apple Store will open for business and the exact size of the store are still both unclear at this stage. Studio A president Cheng Ying-lung has revealed that the sudden decline in Chinese visitors to Taiwan caused a significant shock to the company’s flagship store in Taipei 101 with sales this year having declined 70 percent on last year’s figures. When asked how Studio A plans to compete with the Apple Store once it arrives in Taiwan, Cheng says in recent years Studio A has been actively building up its membership business, expanding its deep presence at school campuses, and has already amassed a large membership base.

Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick is a businessman who has demonstrated a consistent willingness to bend and break rules to get his company to the top, even if it means falling foul of other companies as well as industries, regulators and politicians. To his credit, the attitude has produced stratospheric results for the firm, cementing Uber's position as a top transportation provider the world over, and pushing established taxi sectors to breaking point. @LudoTC @Charliemagne If the Uber app is taken down, they will struggle — Herb Seldon 🇬🇧🇪🇺 (@BritEuropa) April 23, 2017​ However, his cavalier approach has produced serious problems for the company on many occasions. Its issues with Apple, hitherto undisclosed, stemmed from the firm's difficulties in breaking into China. Uber devised a way to identify an individual iPhone, even after its app had been deleted from the phone, or if the phone had been reset. The practice, called fingerprinting, is prohibited by Apple and other tech providers, as it theoretically allows companies to continue to sell individuals' data and target them even when they have opted to rid themselves of a particular service. Right, time to hold to account: some of you know the developers who implemented the iOS geofence/tracking @ Uber. Who are they? aral@ind.ie — Aral Balkan (@aral) April 23, 2017​ Uber went to great lengths to prevent the company from discovering the practice.

Kalanick is said to have been shaken by Apple's admonishment, and the practice was summarily ended permanently. In January 2017, the company also terminated its quest to penetrate China, selling its infrastructure to regional competitor Didi Chuxing. In a statement, the company said it "absolutely" did not track users, if and when they deleted the app from their phone, and in fact tracking of prior users was done as a security measure. "This is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone-over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users' accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users," the company said. Uber has endured a bruising 2017, and there is little suggestion of the pain easing in future.  In April, Sherif Marakby, the firm's Vice President of Global Vehicle Programs and a key orchestrator of its self-driving vehicle program, quit the firm for undisclosed reasons. He followed in the footsteps of the firm's Vice President of Product and Growth, Head of Communications and Head of Artificial Intelligence Labs, who all quit in the first months of 2017. Not long prior, the company was banned from Italy for "unfair business practices." © AP Photo/ Eric Risberg In this file photo taken Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2014, a woman walks past the company logo of the internet car service, Uber, in San Francisco, USA. In February, Google's parent company Alphabet sued Uber, accusing the firm of stealing its technology. Mere days prior to that filing, a former Uber engineer made serious allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at the company offices, claiming management repeatedly dismissed her complaints, protected a repeat offender and threatened to sack her for raising concerns. ...

Customers can now use Apple Maps on their iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac and Apple Watch to calculate itineraries using the available public transportation options which include subway, RER and busses lines, among others. For Parisians, Apple Maps now shows subway, RER and bus lines operated by the RATP Group. It also displays Transilien lines, as well as Autolib car sharing stations and Vélib bike sharing stations. All station entrances are properly identified on a map, making them easier to find. Users will also find a new subway layer that can be used to calculate an itinerary from A to B. Simply tap a station to see all the lines leaving it and get information about the next departures, updated in real-time. Rival Google Maps has provided transit data in Paris for years, but Google’s service doesn’t show the next departures. Apple Maps transit data is available across many cities in the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Japan and elsewhere. MacRumors adds that transit directions may soon be enabled in Adelaide and Perth in Australia, Las Vegas, Madrid, Phoenix, Rome, Singapore, Taiwan and the Netherlands. Apple’s iOS Feature Availability webpage lists the cities in which Apple Maps supports transit data.

Now, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says the 10th anniversary iPhone will launch in September but will face "severe supply shortages" for some time, MacRumors reported. Kuo predicted mass production of the OLED iPhone 8 will be delayed until October-November, compared to previous August-September timeframes. Read: iPhone 8 To Have Vertical Dual-Camera, Display-Embedded Fingerprint Sensor, Leaked Dummy Hints The analyst said the delay "won't undermine actual demand," as long as the iPhone 8 meets fans’ expectations. Most customers will have to wait and will probably get the iPhone 8 during the first quarter of 2018, he added. The report comes after a research note by analyst Brian White last week said Apple will introduce the iPhone 8 and take pre-orders in September, but deliveries might not start until “several weeks later.” Kuo said the iPhone 8’s rumored features, such as the OLED panel, 3D sensing cameras, 10-nanometer A11 processor, and all-new 3D Touch module, are the reason for Apple’s delay. Meanwhile, a note by analyst Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Co. said previously Apple was having trouble embedding the Touch ID into the device’s display. Other rumors have suggested problems with the iPhone 8’s 3D-sensing front camera. The iPhone 8 was rumored to have a delayed release date because of the new feature's key components. Although Apple seems to be having trouble with the iPhone 8’s features, the announcement and launch of the 10th anniversary iPhone and the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus will still happen in September. However, Kuo predicted fans will not be so interested in the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus, which will sport LCD screens. Read: Leaked iPhone 8 Schematic Reveals Apple Placed Touch ID Sensor Below Logo The iPhone 8 production delay was labeled by Kuo as a “potential downside risk to shipments” of all three iPhone models expected to be released this year. Another risk comes from competitors Samsung, Huawei, OPPO, Vivo and Xiaomi, which are getting ready to release “high-end full-screen smartphones" this year, which could impact sales of the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus because those iPhones "do not have full-screen form factors," Kuo said.   Weighing in both risks, Kuo altered shipping estimates for iPhones. In Apple’s "worst case scenario," iPhone shipments could plummet by 15 to 20 percent. He previously estimated 100 million to 110 million iPhone units shipped, but he now predicts 80 million to 90 million units. The iPhone 8 is rumored to have a price tag higher than $1,000. Previous rumors suggested the three iPhones will come with True Tone display, and the iPhone 8 will sport a Smart Connector for wireless charging and AR and VR accessories.

Credit: European Parliament More like this Tim Cook’s chilling comments about fake news Lessons from SXSW: Life without Uber is mostly fine Has Apple become a boring company? Video How to create a mobile hotpsot with your iPhone or iPad Apple’s app store has had its share of shenanigans perpetrated by various developers and companies over the years. But one of the more egregious examples of bad behavior was recently done by Uber, and it resulted in a smackdown administered by Apple CEO Tim Cook. Mike Isaac reports for the NY Times: Uber engineers assigned a persistent identity to iPhones with a small piece of code, a practice called “fingerprinting.” Uber could then identify an iPhone and prevent itself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its contents. There was one problem: Fingerprinting iPhones broke Apple’s rules. Mr. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure customers that no trace of the owner’s identity remained on the device. So Mr. Kalanick told his engineers to “geofence” Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., a way to digitally identify people reviewing Uber’s software in a specific location. Uber would then obfuscate its code from people within that geofenced area, essentially drawing a digital lasso around those it wanted to keep in the dark. Apple employees at its headquarters were unable to see Uber’s fingerprinting. The ruse did not last. Apple engineers outside of Cupertino caught on to Uber’s methods, prompting Mr. Cook to call Mr. Kalanick to his office. Mr. Kalanick was shaken by Mr. Cook’s scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting. More at the NY Times Wow, it takes a lot of guts to intentionally deceive Apple in such a blatant and obnoxious way. But you just knew that Apple would find out about it sooner or later, and sure enough the company did. It would have been a major disaster for Uber if it’s app had been booted out of Apple’s iOS App Store, even if it was just temporarily. As it stands now Uber’s reputation has been damaged as the story of it deceiving Apple is circulating all over the web. How many people will want to use Uber's service after reading about its behavior toward Apple? I have never used Uber’s service, and after this recent mess it’s much more likely that I never will. I’m not a big fan of companies that mess with the privacy of iOS users, and I make it a point to steer clear of their products and services. So Uber is now off my list of apps to install on my iPhone, and I suspect that I'm not alone in being disgusted by the company's deceptive antics. Uber’s CEO might have thought he’d get away with such a deception, but he should have known better. Apple is the most watched company in the world, and if you do something naughty on Apple’s platforms, sooner or later somebody will notice it and report about it. Then it will come to the attention of Apple itself, and the smackdown will be administered. Uber’s recent bad behavior in the iOS App Store isn’t the only thing that has been noticed about the company and its CEO. A writer at Slate noted some other shenanigans that were in the NY Times article. Mathew Dessem reports for Slate: Isaac also reports on Uber’s competitive intelligence team, which monitored ride-hailing competitor Lyft by, among other things, purchasing anonymized data taken from Lyft users’ email inboxes. To do this, Uber worked with Unroll.me, a service which promises users that it will let them “instantly see a list of all your subscription emails” and “unsubscribe easily from whatever you don’t want.” A careful reading of the company’s terms of service and privacy policy, however, reveals that Unroll.me also offered users the opportunity to “gather up all of the Lyft receipts in your mailbox” and “send non-personal data about your usage of Lyft (or anything, really) to whoever is willing to pay for it.” Unroll.me CEO Jojo Hedaya, in a blog post Sunday headlined “We Can Do Better,” described this process as “how we monetize our free service,” which sounds better than “how we’re privatizing the cabinet noir,” but not much better. Finally, Isaac reports that when his previous startup Red Swoosh was under financial pressure, Kalanick took money withheld from employee paychecks for taxes and invested it back into the company instead of sending it to the IRS. (The money was eventually paid back, after it helped Kalanick keep Red Swoosh alive until he could sell it for $19 million.) Uber and its CEO crossing legal and ethical lines in a relentless quest to extract maximum value for investors is the very definition of a dog bites man story, but the details—tracking iPhones, pulling data from other people’s emails, “borrowing” money from employee tax withholdings, lying to Tim Cook—are particularly nasty. It’s almost enough to make you wonder if there might be something wrong with a system that routinely produces companies that behave this way. More at Slate Kudos to Tim Cook for protecting iOS users Tim Cook’s reaction to Uber’s deception is arguably the most interesting part of this story. It’s clear from the NY Times article that Cook, in his own unique and understated way, can be just as intimidating as Steve Jobs (who was known for being someone you didn’t want to screw with). The CEO of Uber should consider himself very lucky and should behave more appropriately next time. Tim Cook may come across as a laid back, mellow guy but he is clearly not someone you want to have angry at you. I suspect that if Uber crosses the line again, Cook will cut the company off at the knees and Uber will pay a very high price for tempting the wrath of Apple’s CEO. Did you miss a post?

Apple was granted a permit to test self-driving cars on April 14 by the California Department of Motor Vehicles but the company has never said anything about its plan. The state released 41 pages of Apple application documents to Reuters that give some clues about the company's highly secret self-driving effort, which it has never openly acknowledged. The state released 41 pages of Apple application documents including details of how Apple plans to test the car to teach it how to drive. The iPhone maker joins a long list of carmakers, start-ups and technology rivals, including Alphabet's Waymo, that are testing cars on state roads. Apple is looking for new hit products and autonomous car technology is expected to revolutionize the traditional auto industry. As part of the application, Apple included a 10-page training plan that appeared to be related to operators taking back manual control of the car during automated driving exercises of the system, which it calls a development platform.

Share this article Share The documents also show how apple will use controller 'joysticks' in the vehicle Apple declined comment beyond the filing. The plan includes a document called 'Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview' whose objective is 'to train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions.' 'Development platform will be controlled electronically (e.g. joystick) and safety drivers must be ready to intervene and take control,' the document reads. The document highlights different scenarios to be tested, from high speed driving and tight U-turns to lane changes. One letter sent from Apple to the state Department of Motor Vehicles noted that Apple's development platform 'will have the ability to capture and store relevant data before a collision occurs.' Apple Inc has secured a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said on Friday. Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California The document does not include detail on how Apple's self-driving platform actually works or other technical details. It also does not say what kind of sensors are found on Apple's three permitted vehicles, all 2015 Lexus model RX450h. The permit does not necessarily mean that Apple itself is building a full car. Apple could instead be designing a self-driving platform that can be integrated into other manufacturer's cars. SELF-DRIVING CARS TAKE TO THE RACE TRACK IN CALIFORNIA Nine self-driving cars took to the course in Northern California, with the goal of simply making it round the 2 mile (3.2 kilometre) track. All cars competing had a driver behind the wheel to intervene if necessary, and only four out of the nine made it around the curvy course without human help. The self-driving cars were involved in a race, called 'Self Racing Cars' that included students and entrepreneurs from startup companies. Nine self-driving cars took to the course in Northern California, with the goal of simply making it round the two mile (3.2 kilometre track). Pictured is an AutonomouStuff Automated Research Development Vehicle For the small companies and students, the race course offered a large, safe testing environment.  Deciding how to slow down for a turn, for instance, is a big question for a car that drives itself, and startups cannot necessarily afford access to a major testing facility without pedestrians. Some cars used GPS and other location tracking to follow digital maps to get around the course.   For the small companies and students, the race course offered a large, safe testing environment.

Do you use Unroll.me to unsubscribe from unwanted email subscriptions? If you've ever taken a ride with Lyft, information about your trips may now be in the hands of Uber. The New York Times, in a Sunday profile of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, reported that the app-based car service, as part of its competitive intelligence efforts, purchased data about Lyft rides to keep tabs on its rival. Uber purchased the data from an analytics company called Slice Intelligence, which owns Unroll.me. Using Unroll.me, "Slice collected its customers' emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber," the report notes. "Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyft's business." Slice confirmed to the Times that it sells anonymized ride receipts from Lyft — and Uber— but declined to tell the newspaper who buys the data. The report notes that Lyft also has a "competitive intelligence" team. Uber vs. Apple Meanwhile, the report also reveals that Uber was almost kicked out of Apple's App Store in 2015 for hiding unscrupulous behavior from Apple engineers. At issue was "widespread account fraud in places like China, where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that were erased and resold." These drivers would create "dozens" of email addresses that signed up for Uber accounts and requested rides, then pocket the incentives Uber was offering to its most productive drivers. Starting in 2014, Uber essentially tagged these phones so the devices couldn't be reused for other scams even after they were wiped. But the practice was against Apple's rules, so Uber "geofenced" Apple headquarters so engineers there wouldn't find out. Of course, Apple did find out, and Cook was not pleased. He reportedly demanded that Uber quit it, and Kalanick agreed, the Times reports. Related Uber Collects Location Data After a Ride Ends Uber Collects Location Data After a Ride Ends Uber in a statement to PCMag denied that it tracks people after they have deleted the app. "We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they've deleted the app," Uber said. "As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users' accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users." This is just the latest snafu for Uber, which has been caught driving its autonomous cars in California without a permit and hiding shady practices from regulators, as well as dealing with a sexual harrassment suit.

Production may only ramp up well into the holiday season, and heavy competition could further delay Apple’s plans. All of this is the informed opinion of noted KGI Securities analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a good track record on Apple products and rumors. According to him, though the iPhone - called the OLED iPhone, thanks to its screen tech - will likely still be announced around the regular August-September timeframe. That said, unit availability will only ramp up towards November, or even in early 2018. We’ve heard similar rumors before, and a recent report corroborates this timeline. Kuo said: Production ramp up of OLED iPhone could be delayed to October-November (previously estimated to be August-September, as in previous years). That said, if new features, such as 3D sensing, can provide good user experience, a temporary supply shortfall won’t undermine actual demand, which may be deferred to 1H18 This is blamed on severe shortages in the supply chain, partially based on the radical redesign and special hardware the handset is rumored to have. Among these are the noted OLED screen which will occupy almost the entire front of the device, a new type of dual-cameras, and even some type of 3D technology. The other two iPhones, which Apple is expected to launch alongside the higher-end, may also face delays according to the analyst. This comes as the LCD panels traditionally used by Apple are in shorter supply due to heavy competition from a large number of device manufacturers. However, all of these shortages may not affect demand, if Apple manages to fulfill users’ expectations with its new models. While that remains to be seen in the fall, its developers’ conference is taking place early this summer, so we’ll get our first look at some new software and hints at new products in the near future.

Tech News | 21 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (2) Apple Releases 10th Annual Environmental Responsibility Report by Michael E. Cohen Over a decade ago, Apple established a set of environmental health and safety policies to not only “Meet or exceed all applicable environmental, health and safety requirements,” but also, “Where laws and regulations do not provide adequate controls… adopt… standards to protect human health and the environment.” Those words, by the way, can be found in Appendix D of Apple’s 2017 Environmental Responsibility Report, issued this week. The 56-page PDF report looks very much like an Apple product: a clean, attractively spare document featuring lots of white space, beautiful photos, and a not inconsiderable amount of data inside. Unlike many Apple products, while this year’s report reveals what Apple has most recently accomplished, pundits won’t need to speculate where Apple plans to go in the future. That’s because Apple has explicitly revealed its goals, with its environmental intentions coming in the form of “bold questions” asked by Apple’s Lisa Jackson, Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, in the report’s opening statement: “Can we power a global business with the sun, wind, and water?” “Can we get 100 percent of our supply chain to move to 100 percent renewable energy?” “Can we one day stop mining the earth altogether?” “Can we use only 100 percent recycled and responsibly sourced paper in our packaging?” “Can we improve on the world’s best materials?” Of course, it’s in any company’s interest to post softball questions in such a progress report, but Apple does at least try to answer them honestly, if the three third-party assurance and review statements in Appendix C of the report can be trusted. On powering a global business with sun, wind, and water, Apple reports that 96 percent of the electricity that powers its global facilities comes from renewable resources, and that its carbon footprint was 29.5 million metric tons for fiscal 2016, down from 38.4 million metric tons the year before. Moreover, the company says that 100 percent of the power it consumes in the United States for data centers already comes from renewable sources. As for its supply chain moving completely to renewable resources, Apple reports that, between Apple-initiated energy audits and training, “efficiency improvements made by suppliers avoided more than 150,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.” The company has installed “485 megawatts of wind and solar projects across six provinces of China” and plans to deliver 2 gigawatts of clean power in China alone by 2020, and 4 gigawatts of such power worldwide. (To see what these and other numbers mean, try entering them into the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator.) How about reducing its reliance on mining? Apple hasn’t been as successful at that but reports that it is increasing the use of recyclable materials like aluminum and tin (100 percent of the solder on the iPhone 6 main logic board comes from recycled tin). Results from Liam, Apple’s research and development project on disassembly technologies, are helping to increase the yield of recyclable materials from its products. When it comes to packaging materials, Apple reports that in fiscal 2016 it “used 131,000 metric tons of fiber, of which 62 percent was recycled, 38 percent was virgin fiber from responsibly managed sources, and less than 1 percent was virgin fiber that did not comply with our sustainable fiber specification.” Apple is also stepping up partnerships with groups like the Conservation Fund and the World Wildlife Fund to increase the number of acres of sustainable forest from which it obtains such fiber. Finally, Apple has invested heavily in environmental testing to reduce the amount of toxic materials in its products. Apple’s Cupertino Environmental Testing Lab, which uses plasma mask spectroscopy and ion, liquid, and gas chromatography among other tools and techniques to identify toxic materials, has grown twenty-fold since its establishment in 2006. The company even manufactures artificial sweat so it can measure the amount of nickel leaching from Apple Watch cases to help reduce exposure to customers who are allergic to nickel (Apple has created a video explaining why it makes its artificial sweat). Other toxic materials that Apple has eliminated from its products include beryllium, mercury, PVC and phthalates, arsenic, and lead. To be sure, this report is designed to show Apple’s efforts in the best possible light. Moreover, no manufacturer that operates at Apple’s scale can avoid causing some environmental degradation. Nonetheless, at a time when national and world leaders seem to have become less concerned with global environmental issues, it is heartening to see a corporation of Apple’s size and influence make environmental protection a fundamental — and well-funded — corporate goal.   READERS LIKE YOU!

Love to see perspective like comparison to daily CO2 tonnage from total human breathing, volcano emissions, and rotting vegetation. How big a savings and impact are these big numbers actually making?

Find the Link For most current Apple HomeKit accessories, Apple includes a manufacturing link on the Accessories page. From the product developer’s website, you can often find Siri commands that work with each product. Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case. For example, Philips Hue has an entire page dedicated to Siri commands for its products. Conversely, a company like Elgato only makes a passing reference to Siri compatibility on its website. More From Apple Besides the HomeKit Accessories page, Apple also provides a page dedicated to Siri commands. Unfortunately, it doesn’t offer commands specific to individual products. Instead, you’ll see a fancy marketing page with generalized commands like “Turn the lights blue,” “Turn off the radio,” and “Set the Tahoe house to 72 degrees.” Look at the Product App Each Apple Homekit-compatible product comes with a free app. From these apps, you can sometimes find a section on Siri commands. As you may expect, this isn’t always the case.

The official Philips Hue app has a section dedicated to Apple HomeKit and Siri. From here, you can find Siri commands organized by Lights, Rooms, and Scenes. When in Doubt As you’ve probably guessed, there’s no simple way to find Siri commands for all Apple HomeKit-compatible products. After looking through the various websites and apps, your best bet to find Siri commands might be to do a Google search. Start with the topic “Siri commands” and then expand your search to include “Siri commands and (the name of your product).” With some luck, you’ll find the tools necessary. I’d also suggest checking for commands on YouTube. The video-sharing site is a great place to find instructional videos from both product manufacturers and other users. Great Examples To get you started, here are some useful Siri commands for some of the most popular Apple HomeKit-compatible products on the market, including lights, thermostats, locks, outlets, and cameras. Lights Philips Hue remains the leader in the smart lighting marketplace. Siri commands for these devices include: “Siri, turn on my [lamp name]” (e.g. “Turn on my Sofa lamp”) “Siri, turn off my [lamp name]” (e.g. “Turn off my Reading lamp”) “Siri, dim my [lamp name]” (e.g. “Dim my Bedside lamp”) “Siri, dim my [lamp name] to [xx]%” (e.g. “Dim my Bedside lamp to 90 percent”) “Siri, set my [lamp name] to [color]” (e.g. “Set my Cooking lamp to orange”) Are you looking for a smart lighting solution that’s a little bit different? You’ll love the Nanoleaf Aurora, which offers color changing and voice control abilities in a modular design.

For example, you can easily use Omna’s motion detection feature to control and turn on lights, smart plugs, thermostats, and sound alarms. With Siri, you can use your voice to bring up your camera in real time automatically. To view the camera’s live feed, just say: “Siri, show me the [name of camera].” An Exciting Time Siri commands are a useful tool to use with Apple HomeKit-enabled products Apple HomeKit's Hottest New Products for 2017 Apple HomeKit's Hottest New Products for 2017 Since Apple first announced HomeKit, the number of compatible products keeps growing!

Apple was granted a permit to test self-driving cars on April 14 by the California Department of Motor Vehicles but the company has never said anything about its plan. The state released 41 pages of Apple application documents to Reuters that give some clues about the company's highly secret self-driving effort, which it has never openly acknowledged. The iPhone maker joins a long list of carmakers, start-ups and technology rivals, including Alphabet's Waymo, that are testing cars on state roads. Apple is looking for new hit products and autonomous car technology is expected to revolutionize the traditional auto industry. As part of the application, Apple included a 10-page training plan that appeared to be related to operators taking back manual control of the car during automated driving exercises of the system, which it calls a development platform. Apple declined comment beyond the filing. The plan includes a document called "Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview" whose objective is "to train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions." "Development platform will be controlled electronically (e.g. joystick) and safety drivers must be ready to intervene and take control," the document reads. The document highlights different scenarios to be tested, from high speed driving and tight U-turns to lane changes. One letter sent from Apple to the state Department of Motor Vehicles noted that Apple's development platform "will have the ability to capture and store relevant data before a collision occurs." The document does not include detail on how Apple's self-driving platform actually works or other technical details. It also does not say what kind of sensors are found on Apple's three permitted vehicles, all 2015 Lexus model RX450h. The permit does not necessarily mean that Apple itself is building a full car. Apple could instead be designing a self-driving platform that can be integrated into other manufacturer's cars.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Print Email Spencer Kent | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Spencer Kent | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 24, 2017 at 10:22 AM, updated April 24, 2017 at 12:28 PM comments Apple CEO Tim Cook once threatened Uber CEO Travis Kalanick saying that Apple would remove the ride-sharing app from the App Store after learning that Uber had breached Apple's privacy rules, according to a recent report by The New York Times. During a 2015 meeting, Cook reportedly accused Kalanick of allowing Uber to devise a system to individually identify iPhones even after the app had been deleted or after the phone had been completely wiped. Uber, according to the report, was doing this to combat account fraud in China. Kalanick, 40, was "shaken" by the meeting with Cook, the report said, citing interviews with more than 50 current and former Uber employees. Removing Uber from Apple's App Store would have caused the ride-sharing company to lose access to millions of customers. The system Uber was using to fool Apple was a practice known as "fingerprinting" -- software that ensured Uber's system would remain hidden from anyone accessing the ride-sharing app at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino. However, fingerprinting iPhones is a violation of Apple's rules, and after Apple had discovered the scheme, Cook made sure to give Kalanick a scolding, telling him that he better knock it off or Uber would be booted from the App Store.

But in the case of Uber their mishap is quite a story to talk about. According to a report from The New York Times the car-pooling service used to track down iPhone users in order to prevent fraud back in 2015. But, Apple was not very happy about it. The report says that Uber’s CEO Travis Kalanick had a meeting with Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook. According to the report Tim Cook told Kalanick, “I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules.”. He also warned him that if he didn’t stop this tactic iPhone users the app would see the exit door of the App Store. Uber’s CEO complied. So, what Uber did wrong? The car-service app used a technique which is called fingerprinting. Uber wanted to track down fraudsters and block them from making many accounts using the same iPhone in order to collect new account bonuses. With this process was able to collect UDIDs (unique hardware serial numbers) from iPhones. For the record back in the day Apple allowed developers to track iPhones with a Unique Device Identifier or UDID. But the California-based company started to have concerns about uses privacy and in 2013 replaced UDIDs with other trackers like including vendor IDs and advertising IDs.  o we don’t know how Uber managed to fingerprint iOS devices in 2015. But, why Apple didn’t not notice the tracking. Allegedly Uber geofenced Apple’s Cupertino headquarters to hide the code they were using for the process. But Apple engineers located in other offices got a sniff of the tracking. And this incident was the reason for the Tim Cook – Kalanick meeting in 2015 according to the New York Times. On the other hand Uber spoke to TechCrunch and confirmed that they are still use some kind of device fingerprinting in order to prevent fraud. An Uber spokesperson said about the matter: “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app. As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users’ accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users” Share the joy                 Share this: Reddit Email Facebook Skype Twitter Tumblr Google LinkedIn More Pinterest Author: Martha Papadimitriou Martha is a journalist, a blog writer, a mother and a bookworm.
