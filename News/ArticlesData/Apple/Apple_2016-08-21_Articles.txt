The ride-hailing startup is refusing to comment on the report. 2. Facebook has made a surprising move that could save its one shrinking business. Revenue from payments and fees has been trending downward, but its new "all-new PC gaming platform" could help to reverse that. 3.

Panos Panay, Microsoft's corporate vice president of devices, is behind the Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book. 6.

 This is the best tech upgrade I’ve ever made, and it only cost me $27 Kelsey Mulvey, Insider Picks Aug. 22, 2016, 7:04 PM 15,138 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase. Amazon I've always had a frugal approach to headphones. I only upgraded from the Apple EarPods that came with my iPhone last year. Since joining the Insider Picks team in May, though, I've read a lot about Bluetooth headphones. The whole concept of charging your headphones had previously sounded bizarre to me, but curiosity — and Apple's decision to ditch the headphone jack for its latest iPhone — got the best of me, so I decided to give them a try. I picked out TaoTronics' sport headphones on Amazon after reading some of their more than 3,600 customer reviews, and they're easily the best tech upgrade I've ever made.  The first thing that attracted me to this pair was the design: They look sharp and feel substantial enough to last me good long while. And after using them for a few weeks now, I can report they're also comfortable. The earbuds fit snugly in my ears and stay put when I go running, plus the back cord that joins the two buds rests nicely on my upper back and doesn't flagrantly flap around. The sound is great, and the pair even has some discrete inline buttons so I can play, pause, and adjust the volume of whatever song I'm listening to without touching my phone. But, as someone who's never put much thought into headphones, great design, comfort, and sound quality aren't what turned me into a Bluetooth believer. The freedom that comes with Bluetooth headphones is the real game-changer. I like to put my phone away and enjoy my company, surroundings, and in this case, music. Sure, my phone is still in my bag when I'm walking around my neighborhood listening to Adele. But since my headphones aren't plugged into it, I can leave it stowed away in my bag and not be glued to my screen. The one place these headphones have proved the most useful is the gym. Back in my corded ones, my phone would regularly fly off the treadmill or stationary bike if I made any sudden movements, with my headphones right behind it. Now, my phone stays put, my headphones stay in my ears, and I'm a lot happier for that. There are still some things that I'm getting used to. Since they're not plugged into anything, I'm always worried that my headphones will suddenly disconnect and everyone will hear that I listen to "Hamilton" while I run. And then there's the whole mind-boggling process of actually charging your Bluetooth headphones. But, all things considered, those are two small prices to pay for clear, unrestricted sound.  TaoTronics Bluetooth 4. 1 Headphones, $26.99, available at Amazon.

Updated Hot Tags Climate Change NASA space Earth global warming Experience us with dark theme sciencewr.com Home Space Nature & Environment Health & Medicine Tech Physics Human Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Advertisement Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Could Make iPhone Users Switch, Have A Change Of Heart Johnson D First Posted: Aug 22, 2016 04:23 AM EDT Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones may just be the device that can change iPhone users hearts. (Photo : Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Samsung and Apple have been competing against each other for as long as everybody can remember. However, the release of the South Korean giant tech company's new flagship "phablet" device could be the best bribe to make iPhone users change their minds. Advertisement Cnet.com has initially has given the new device four and a half stars and said: "The Galaxy Note 7 is a beautiful, capable Android phone that showcases Samsung's best in design, battery life, speed and features. The 64GB base model leaves you plenty of space for photos, videos and games, and it's a real improvement over 2015's Note 5." Initial reviews cited some issues such as the device's price being too high ($849) and some minor problems with the S-Pen. However, after giving the device a go, users have found nothing wrong with the S-Pen. Samsung's small pen doesn't require a battery like the Apple Pencil which makes it perfect for on-the-go use, The Inquistr reported. The Note 7 may look like a monster smartphone at first with its 6.04 x 2.91 x 0.31 inches (153.5 x 73.9 x 7.9 mm) size and would even make you think it's a little heavy at first look. But, you will be surprised to know that it's lighter than what you had originally thought. The smartphone has a slick polished glass feeling only iPhone used to give. However, it's time to say bye-bye to Samsung's cheap looking plastic case, which the company used to use to keep the weight of their smartphones and tablets to a minimum.Gorilla Glass 5 was used to cover the front and back of the device. The new Gorilla Glass is said to stop scratches and, most importantly, prevent cracks in the device after falls. According to CNBC, analysts have branded Note 7 as an example of how the South Korean tech giant can remain on top at the edge of innovation. The Note 7 will "act as a premium showcase which will improve Samsung margins, define how Samsung's strategy differs from Apple and Huawei," analysts IHS said. Samsung has also fixed some screen issue they had with Galaxy S7 Edge and made sure the new Note 7's screen is perfect. S7 Edge's screen was curved a little too much making it easy to accidentally touch the curve with a finger. The new Note 7's screen has the same 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution as the Note 5 and the Galaxy S7 Edge but the screen don't extend too much. The Note 7 runs on the same Snapdragon 820 processor that runs the Galaxy S7 Edge which is a good thing. The same 4GB of RAM seen in the Galaxy Note 5 and the S7 Edge is also present in the new Note 7. There will be no problem running two or three apps at the same time, however, users will notice some lag when they run four app. Still, Note 7 is known to be the fastest phone in existence today, and yes, it's even faster than the iPhone6s or 6s Plus, nrt3.com reported. The iPhone maker has recently been struggling with its declining sales of iPhone if the leaks that have been surrounding the web are true, iPhone 7 could be a lifeless launch with nothing to make it stand out. Because there are a group of iPhone users who purchased the iPhone 6 when it was first launch, they may have already come to the end of their 2 year contract. Surely, these customers are looking for a stand-out up grade, and if Samsung gets the marketing right, this could change the hearts of a lot of Apple customers.

Apple is expected to be launching a couple new tablets soon, and we’re here to explore what that might mean to you. As far as Apple tablets go, our expectations were reduced to lost hopes for a fall release of a couple updates, hoping to see the device announced alongside the iPhone 7 event in September or the Mac event in October. We’re learning that early 2017 should be pretty exciting for iOS users. Let’s explore a specific device, join us for a rumor round-up for the iPad Air 3. Update November 2016: As new rumors trickle out, the best news we have this time is a firm expectation for a March 2017 announcement and launch shortly thereafter. Related Articles   iPad Pro vs iPad Air 2 – a big tablet just got bigger2 weeks ago   Apple iPad Air vs iPad Air 2July 15, 2016   Apple iPad Air 2 vs iPad Mini 4 – quick comparisonJuly 3, 2016   iPad Pro 9.7 vs iPad Air 2: let’s see what’s newMay 2, 2016 What’s new? The obvious first thing on all of our minds is what will be new in the iPad Air 3. With the iPad Air 2 still going strong and the iPad Pro 9.7 handily taking the 9.7-inch iPad offering to the next level, what should Apple be doing to capture our attention. The answer is, based on rumor, almost nothing. I made that sound rough, what we are expecting from the iPad Air 3 is the same processing package as is found on the iPad Pro 9.7. Considering the amount of time the A9X has had to mature, using it, or just the A9, along with the removal of the extra ports and accessories that make the Pro tablet a pro tablet, the iPad Air 3 could be the next ‘budget’ iPad. This leaves room for a newer Pro tablet with a newer A10 chipset and force-touch display. Update November 2016: With the extra time to develop the next tablet, perhaps we’ll be wrong, perhaps the iPad Air 3 will share the same A10 chipset as the iPhone 7 and we can expect an A10X, or similar slight update, for the next Pro tablets. Related: Why the Apple A10 Fusion chip is so good It’s not all boring, Apple is rumored to be trying out new, harder aluminum, which could lead to an even thinner design. Should the iPad Air 3 take advantage of the new True Tone equipped display panel of the iPad Pro 9.7, we would be very excited, and we think you should be too, but we sort of imagine that will be saved for the Air 4. While we can only hope that Apple will include the stereo speaker setup found on both Pro tablets, we can be certain that iOS 10 will be the software behind it all. Let’s round that up quick: Apple A9 or A9X chipset A10 Fusion or A10X Harder aluminum for a slimmer design Better speakers iOS 10 When can we buy the iPad Air 3? I want to premise this with a harsh reality, Apple just launched a new 10-inch tablet. With the iPad Pro 9.7 only a few months old, it is somewhat unlikely that Apple will push the iPad Air 3 this fall. This logic is in agreement with the rumors out there suggesting that we might see the iPad Air 3 in March of 2017. Apple is certainly due for an update to the larger iPad Pro, as to the mini iPad line this year, and they have a rumored 10.5-inch iPad in the works for next year, all of which seem more likely to launch before we see the iPad Air 3. Keep in mind this is all speculative, it could very well be that Apple launch the iPad Air 3 in September with a November shipping date, just in time for the holidays. Update: Following Apple’s predictable Spring / Fall event scheduling, we have every reason to believe we will see the iPad Air 3 announced in March of 2017. Stay tuned for updates, but keep in mind we won’t know a firm shipping date until after the announcement. For those that are concerned with storage space, which I hope is all of you, the rumor mill says 32GB will be the starting place. We can only continue to speculate, but 64GB, 128GB and 256GB models are all logical to us. It will be interesting to see what sizes Apple includes, however, as they have a recent track record of skipping sizes that other iPad models cover. For example, you can get the iPad Air 2 in 16GB and 64GB sizes, but the iPad Pro 9.7 comes in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB. Pricing Now we’re truly getting into speculative territory. Truth is, we have only the history of launch prices to pull from here, Apple is very good at keeping this sort of information a secret until the last moment. While we have seen others guess that Apple will stick to a $599 starting price, as they pretty much have with all full size iPad models for years, we think they’ll offer a reduced price this time. This, however, truly depends on how much tech they borrow from the iPad Pro 9.7. If the True Tone display panel is used for the iPad Air 3, we will concede the above familiar price point, without this panel, though, we think it possible a $549 or even $499 starting price. Wrap up As you might imagine, particularly if the iPad Air 3 is slated for a Spring 2017 launch, rumors are pretty slim as yet. This simply means that we’ll be revisiting this article as often as we must in the coming weeks or months as new info leaks, watch for the updates. What do you say, if the iPad Air 3 is the new ‘budget’ iPad offering, will you consider it, or stick with the Pro line?

He previously covered technology for Bloomberg News. Follow @tculpan Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Aug 22, 2016 8:00 AM EDT ZTE CORP-H -0.32 At Closing, Nov 23rd 12.00 HKD APPLE INC -0.93 As of 1:09 PM EST 110.87 USD In the next five years, a majority of U.S. consumers will have bought a Chinese-brand smartphone. Such a prospect may raise the hackles of purported American patriots and presidential candidates, but it's reality. Outside of Apple and Samsung, Chinese brands rule the global smartphone market. LG gets a hand in from time to time, Blackberry isn't dead yet, and Nokia keeps bouncing from one identity crisis to another -- but the trend is irreversible. Yet ask any consumer in the U.S. to name a smartphone that isn't Apple, or at the very least one that isn't Apple or Korean. There's only one way for Chinese brands to go from here. That's why their pending dominance is a fact, not just speculation or fear mongering. Global Showdown Samsung and Apple's share of the worldwide smartphone market has fallen from 42 percent to 33 percent amid the rise of Huawei and other Chinese brands Source: Counterpoint Research Just as television makers Zenith, Motorola and RCA were eventually replaced by Japanese names like Sony, Sharp and Panasonic, so too will Chinese brands overtake the U.S. market. The latest entrant looks set to be Xiaomi. The richly valued upstart appears ready to dip its toes in one of the world's most important electronics markets. While China is larger by volume, the U.S. is lucrative because average device prices are much higher. In an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday, Xiaomi's vice president and international front man Hugo Barra said a U.S. move is inevitable: We will lead with social media, with the channels that allow us to get in touch with the young generation that are enthusiastic about new technology. We are definitely going there. Xiaomi's entry into the U.S. has been in doubt on concern that the Chinese company, which has been widely criticized as a wholesale copycat of Apple and others, would immediately face intellectual property lawsuits. However, Xiaomi's purchase this summer of around 1,500 patents from Microsoft seems to have quelled those worries and given the Beijing startup the courage to move directly onto Apple's home turf. The Chinese company won't be short of compatriots. ZTE, the world's number six smartphone brand, is fourth in the U.S., while TCL-Alcatel holds fifth spot. And then there's Huawei, now the world's number three, which will start selling its latest device under the Honor brand later this week. With solid technology, financial muscle and global aspirations, expect to see more of Huawei in the U.S. in years to come. U.S. Turf Samsung and Apple have maintained their dominance of the U.S. market, largely in the absence of aggressive moves by Chinese brands. Expect that to change Source: Counterpoint Research What's significant about a Xiaomi move is that along with the brand, the company is likely to bring the same business model that emaciated profits in the Chinese smartphone market: namely, direct online sales, social media-focused marketing and razor-thin margins. That model has proven so compelling that Lenovo (which now owns Motorola's smartphone business) and Huawei have both incorporated it into their own strategies, while Oppo and Vivo are key beneficiaries. With ever fewer differences between Android models, this price fight portends declining share for Apple and Samsung. Samsung and Apple combined U.S. market share 59% This means that Chinese expansion will result in the U.S. starting to look a lot like every other market in the world. Whereas Apple and Samsung hold a combined 59 percent of the U.S. market, according to Counterpoint Research, they have just a 33 percent share worldwide.

Nic Walker Share on twitter by John Davidson Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has warned Apple is going to frustrate a lot of customers if it removes the headphone jack from the upcoming iPhone 7.  When the next iPhone comes out, rumoured to be in early September, one thing that's expected to be missing is a place to plug in earphones. Though Apple is yet to confirm the rumour – indeed, it's yet to confirm it will even launch a new iPhone in September, or that it will be called the "iPhone 7" – the company is widely thought to be moving to a new type of Bluetooth "EarPod", that will connect wirelessly to the iPhone. Customers wanting to use their existing, wired earbuds and headphones might have to buy an adaptor that attaches to the iPhone's Lightning port, or to whatever port does remain on the phone. (The Lightning port, which is used for recharging and for attaching accessories, is rumoured to be changing, too, possibly to a magnetic one.) Steve Wozniak together with RocKwiz host Julia Zemiro at the Talent Unleashed awards night in Sydney. "If it's missing the 3.5mm earphone jack, that's going to tick off a lot of people," Mr Wozniak told The Australian Financial Review. Related Quotes 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

I have cars where you can plug in the music, or go through Bluetooth, and Bluetooth just sounds so flat for the same music." Mr Wozniak co-founded Apple together with Steve Jobs in the mid-1970s, and left Apple in 1985. But he continues to provide Apple with advice, if not directly then at least through the media. He has previously spoken about his pride at still being officially on the company's payroll.  Mr Wozniak said he would probably use the adaptor to connect his existing earphones to his next iPhone, and said that, like many other users he is attached to the accessories that he uses alongside the phone. "Mine have custom ear implants, they fit in so comfortably, I can sleep on them and everything. And they only come out with one kind of jack, so I'll have to go through the adaptor," he said. "If there's a Bluetooth 2 that has higher bandwidth and better quality, that sounds like real music, I would use it. But we'll see. Apple is good at moving towards the future, and I like to follow that." Though he stopped short of advising Apple not to go with the rumoured magnetic port for the iPhone 7, and to instead follow the lead of Google and Samsung and adopt a USB Type-C port, Mr Wozniak did say he thinks more highly of phones that use USB-C. "One of my favourite Android phones, the Nexus 5X, uses that connector. It gives it a higher level in my own thinking. "I think USB-C is going to be the future," he said. Mr Wozniak also provided Australian technology companies with some free advice. He was in Australia to judge the annual Talent Unleashed technology innovation awards, where many of the winners had products that were based on mobile phones rather than PCs or web apps. One winner, the Australian company ResApp, developed a phone app that could diagnose respiratory disorders with a high degree of accuracy, when a patient simply coughed into the phone's microphone. Another winner, ODOCS Eye Care, came up with a lens that can be attached to a mobile phone, to help diagnose eye disease. "Mobile [is] a good strategy for a country like Australia. When I'm here, it's been a long time coming to get decent broadband even on the wired spectrum. Hotels here, they don't really match up to the rest of the world, especially the United States," he said.

Such a prospect may raise the hackles of purported American patriots and presidential candidates, but it’s reality. Outside of Apple and Samsung, Chinese brands rule the global smartphone market. LG gets a hand in from time to time, Blackberry isn’t dead yet, and Nokia keeps bouncing from one identity crisis to another – but the trend is irreversible. Yet ask any consumer in the U.S. to name a smartphone that isn’t Apple, or at the very least one that isn’t Apple or Korean. There’s only one way for Chinese brands to go from here. That’s why their pending dominance is a fact, not just speculation or fear mongering. Just as television makers Zenith, Motorola and RCA were eventually replaced by Japanese names like Sony, Sharp and Panasonic, so too will Chinese brands overtake the U.S. market. The latest entrant looks set to be Xiaomi. The richly valued upstart appears ready to dip its toes in one of the world’s most important electronics markets. While China is larger by volume, the U.S. is lucrative because average device prices are much higher. In an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday, Xiaomi’s vice president and international front man Hugo Barra said a U.S. move is inevitable: We will lead with social media, with the channels that allow us to get in touch with the young generation that are enthusiastic about new technology. We are definitely going there. Xiaomi’s entry into the U.S. has been in doubt on concern that the Chinese company, which has been widely criticized as a wholesale copycat of Apple and others, would immediately face intellectual property lawsuits. However, Xiaomi’s purchase this summer of around 1,500 patents from Microsoft seems to have quelled those worries and given the Beijing startup the courage to move directly onto Apple’s home turf. The Chinese company won’t be short of compatriots. ZTE, the world’s number six smartphone brand, is fourth in the U.S., while TCL-Alcatel holds fifth spot. And then there’s Huawei, now the world’s number three, which will start selling its latest device under the Honor brand later this week. With solid technology, financial muscle and global aspirations, expect to see more of Huawei in the U.S. in years to come. What’s significant about a Xiaomi move is that along with the brand, the company is likely to bring the same business model that emaciated profits in the Chinese smartphone market: namely, direct online sales, social media-focused marketing and razor-thin margins. That model has proven so compelling that Lenovo (which now owns Motorola’s smartphone business) and Huawei have both incorporated it into their own strategies, while Oppo and Vivo are key beneficiaries. With ever fewer differences between Android models, this price fight portends declining share for Apple and Samsung. This means that Chinese expansion will result in the U.S. starting to look a lot like every other market in the world. Whereas Apple and Samsung hold a combined 59 percent of the U.S. market, according to Counterpoint Research, they have just a 33 percent share worldwide. Global slots three through seven are all Chinese. So while the nostalgic may decry the rise of China, they still need to face the fact that the U.S. smartphone industry has passed its zenith.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple has reportedly purchased medical data startup Gliimpse to improve its health services. The Cupertino company closed the deal earlier this year, according to Fast Company. Gliimpse offers a platform for organizing your medical and health data. Users can add pictures and documents to fill out their profiles. They can also share a snapshot of their personal information with other people using the service. The company was launched in 2013 by Anil Sethi, a successful entrepreneur who previously worked at Apple as an engineer in the 1980s. He founded Gliimpse following his sister’s battle with cancer, during which he became frustrated with her care. Specifically, he wanted people suffering from chronic diseases to have easy access to all their various medical data in one place. It’s unclear how Apple might integrate Gliimpse into its software, though Cupertino could use the startup’s technology to offer more detailed information in its Health app. Apple is also allegedly working on a powerful new health device set to launch next year, which could potentially tie into the service. Apple hasn’t officially confirmed the news, and it’s unclear whether Gliimpse will continue to exist in its current form. Cupertino is expected to hold a big event next month to unveil its new iPhones, so it’s possible we’ll learn more about its health efforts soon.

Depends on Which Taxman Asks (AP Images/Leon Neal) Tuesday, 23 Aug 2016 07:25 AM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Jeff Bezos’s relentless focus on user experience has helped him make Amazon the most valuable e-commerce company in the world. But regulators in Europe and the U.S. say that the value Amazon places on the technology behind that experience varies radically depending on which side of the Atlantic it’s on -- and which appraisal will lower its tax bill. In Europe, the e-commerce giant tells authorities that the intellectual property behind its web shopping platform is immensely valuable, justifying the billions in tax-free revenue it has collected there since moving its technology assets to tax-friendly Luxembourg a decade ago. In the U.S., however, it plays down the value of those same assets to explain why it pays so little in taxes for licensing them. Authorities on both continents are asking questions. European competition regulators are investigating whether the company received illegal state aid from Luxembourg that would require repayment of back taxes. And the U.S. Internal Revenue Service sent Amazon a notice of adjustment in May stating that the company owes $1.5 billion in back taxes. Amazon.com Inc. says it’s following the law. “Amazon pays all the taxes we are required to pay in every country where we operate,” it said in a written statement. The company has sued in U.S. Tax Court to block the IRS’s move. A ruling is expected this fall. Critics, however, are asking why Amazon and other companies are allowed to assign a market value to their own assets for tax purposes. “We insist on this fiction that we can ask firms to report where they had their income and expenses, and that a global firm is going to distinguish these in a way that is true to economic reality,” said Kimberly Clausing, a Reed College economics professor who studies international tax avoidance. Lots of U.S. companies -- including health care firms like Merck & Co. and tech firms like Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. -- move their intellectual property assets to tax havens overseas. From there, they effectively rent out their core innovations to operating units of the same company. The biggest of these companies shift billions of dollars to the tax havens through royalty payments, thus lowering the parent company’s tax bill. Tax watchdogs complain that the companies are improperly diverting revenue from the tax jurisdictions where it’s generated. Executives whose companies are most aggressive in their tax planning, like Apple CEO Tim Cook, say they are just trying to serve their shareholders and remain competitive while also complying with the law. What’s notable about Amazon, though, is that the separate investigations of its tax treatment provide a basis to compare the company’s dual rationales -- and their contradictions. IP Transfer When Amazon transferred its IP rights to a Luxembourg subsidiary in 2005, for example, it told U.S. tax officials they were worth $217 million. Although Amazon didn’t report a comparable figure in Europe, the following year it reported revenue of more than $100 million from licensing those assets in the region. That figure rose to about $400 million the year after, according to the company’s filings to Luxembourg authorities. In all, the Luxembourg unit -- called Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS, or AEHT -- recorded royalty revenue of about 5.2 billion euros ($5.9 billion at the current rate) before adjustments for inflation and exchange rates over the past decade. The figures reported by Amazon are “absurd for anyone with a basic command of mathematics,” said Fabio de Masi, a German member of the European Parliament. Amazon defends its tax payments in Europe, asserting that regulators there are mistaking high revenue for high taxable profits. It says its profits there have been crimped by heavy investments in the IP and strong competition. Project Goldcrest Through 2014, the company’s strategy -- dubbed Project Goldcrest, after Luxembourg’s national bird -- involved an elaborate 28-step process to exploit tax loopholes by forming offshore subsidiaries, moving assets and shifting profits to tax havens, according to court documents filed by the company in its lawsuit over the IRS’s claims. Those documents show that at the center of the plan was the Luxembourg subsidiary, AEHT, which was established as a limited liability partnership, a structure that exempts it from taxation in the tiny European Union state. To move revenue from Amazon’s e-commerce businesses in France, Germany and Britain, those units first made royalty payments to the company’s European operating subsidiary in Luxembourg, called Amazon EU Sarl, according to European Commission regulators. That unit is subject to taxes, but it slashed its taxable income by making deductible royalty payments to the tax-free AEHT unit for the regional sites’ use of Amazon’s web shopping platform and trademarks, the commission has said. Licensing Payments The difference between how Amazon measured the value of its assets in two major markets became clear when AEHT made licensing payments to its parent company in Seattle for rights to the shopping technology. Officials at the IRS say the reduced licensing payments to the Amazon parent company in the U.S. has resulted in the underpayment of hundreds of millions of dollars a year in taxes. In legal papers and testimony from expert witnesses, IRS officials argued that the IP, including the company’s brand, was a lucrative component of Amazon’s rapid growth beginning in 2005, a period in which the company established itself as the world’s dominant online retailer. Daniel Frisch, an economist called by IRS lawyers, calculated the value of the IP at $3.6 billion -- more than 15 times the amount Amazon’s accountant calculated -- and concluded that most of the trademarks, patents and technology would hold their value for decades. Amazon’s Defense Amazon countered with its own experts who said that the IP was perishable given the high failure rate of tech companies. It also argued that the IRS calculation had drastically underestimated the amount of research and development costs that should be attributed to AEHT, which would reduce the value of its IP. Although Amazon lawyers blocked an IRS attempt to compel Bezos to testify, they sought to submit his published comments in a Playboy article in 2000 expressing doubt about the value of brand loyalty, a central element of the IRS expert’s valuation estimate. “Our customers are loyal to us right up until the second that somebody else offers them better service,” Bezos told the magazine. The U.S. Tax Court judge in the case, Albert G. Lauber, ultimately decided not to admit that article as evidence. Back Taxes In preliminary findings, European regulators said the arrangement approved by Luxembourg has allowed Amazon to conduct a significant amount of business in Europe while paying minimal tax. Amazon’s director of public policy, Andrew Cecil, told U.K. lawmakers four years ago that the internet retailer had Europe-wide sales of 9.1 billion euros in 2011 and had a tax outlay of about 8 million euros. That’s less than 0.1 percent. The EU is expected to issue a decision in its case in the next few months. Analysts say the investigations of Amazon and other multinationals have had a deterrent effect. Last year, Amazon stopped booking transactions from Britain, France, Spain and Germany through Luxembourg and instead attributed the revenue to the countries where the sales occurred -- and are subject to tax. Amazon officials declined to say what motivated its change in policy.   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

Tekserve Auctioning Historic Mac Collection -- Legendary New York City Apple shop Tekserve has closed its doors for retail business and will be auctioning off items from the store on 23 August 2016. The jewel of the auction will be Tekserve’s Macintosh collection, which is valued at between $12,000 and $14,000. The collection of 35 computers includes a first-generation Macintosh signed by Steve Wozniak, a NeXTcube, a 20th Anniversary Macintosh, an original iMac, a G4 Cube, and more. The collection also includes miscellaneous other bits of technology, like cameras, radios, and typewriters. Read/post comments Developer Survey Dings Mac App Store -- DevMate, a development and distribution platform for Mac developers, conducted a survey of 679 Mac developers to get their thoughts on the Mac App Store. Interestingly, 42 percent of respondents sell both in the Mac App Store and outside of it; however, those who sell both ways see roughly equivalent revenue from both channels. Overall, developers were overwhelmingly negative in their appraisal of the Mac App Store, leading to astonishingly low Net Promoter Score ratings. What ticks developers off the most? The Mac App Store’s unclear and unwieldy review process, the 30 percent transaction fees, the lack of upgrades and trials, and no two-way communication with customers. DevMate isn’t exactly unbiased in this area since it competes with the Mac App Store, but the results do map to what we’ve heard from developers as well.

Amazon wants to charge half of that. by Peter Kafka Aug 22, 2016, 6:19pm EDT tweet share Linkedin Amazon Amazon wants to launch a music subscription service that would work the same way services from Apple, Spotify and many others work: $10 a month, for all the music you can stream, anywhere you want to stream it. But Amazon is also working on a second service that would differ in two significant ways from industry rivals: It would cost half the price, and it would only work on Amazon’s Echo hardware. Industry sources say Amazon would like to launch both services in September, but has yet to finalize deals with major music labels and publishers. One sticking point, sources say, is whether Amazon will sell the cheaper service for $4 or $5 a month. An Amazon rep declined to comment. The $10-a-month service would replicate features that used to be hard to find but are now common: Unlimited, ad-free music you can play on any device you want and also download for offline playback. The lower-priced service would represent a novel approach. Other services have tried, without success, to offer subscriptions in the $5 range. But those have usually been variants of web radio services, which don’t let users play any song they want, whenever they want. That’s also the approach Pandora is taking with a new $5 service it has in the works, which it wants to launch alongside a standard $10-a-month service. Amazon’s discount service would be different, industry sources say, because it would work like Spotify or Apple Music — unlimited, ad-free music on demand — but it would be constrained to Amazon’s Echo player, and wouldn’t work on phones. That runs counter to conventional wisdom in the music business, which believes that most people value the ability to take their music with them and play it whenever they want. The overwhelming majority of Spotify subscribers sign up on phones. And when Apple Music launched last year it focused all of its attention on iPhone users, and eventually on Android phone owners as well. Amazon launched the Echo — an internet-connected speaker powered by Alexa, the company’s AI software — last year, and reportedly sold a million units. It hopes to sell three million this year and 10 million in 2017, The Information reports. Amazon already offers an Amazon Music service free for Amazon Prime subscribers, but that service only has a limited catalog of music. If Amazon launches the music services, it will be the second time it has offered digital media subscriptions as à-la-carte offerings, instead of tying them to its Amazon Prime delivery service. Earlier this year Amazon started selling its video subscription service, which it offers for free to Amazon Prime subs, as a standalone service for $9 a month. recode_divider More From Recode Donald Trump told Tim Cook that Apple is going to ‘build a big plant’ in the U.S. Post-election ‘terror and hysteria’ over Trump is not justified, says Observer editor Ken Kurson Recode Daily: Facebook built a censorship tool that could help it get back into China Can the journalists who work for Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner still cover the White House fairly?

Joyce Smith jsmith@kcstar.com i By Joyce Smith jsmith@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The new Apple Country Club Plaza store is designed to be a gathering place that will draw foot traffic throughout the day. And don’t call them Apple Stores anymore; Apple has dropped the word “store” and instead added a location to its store names. New features introduced in the Plaza location at 227 Nichols Road include: ▪ The Avenue, inspired by retail window displays that change throughout the season. It runs along the back wall and showcases such items as headphones, apps, iPhone cases and photography accessories. ▪ The Forum, a gathering space centered around a 6K video wall on the east side of the store. Apple Country Club Plaza also will continue to offer services, including daily workshops and youth programs. Apple first opened on the Plaza in 2004. It closed its store at 4712 Broadway on Friday and reopened Saturday in a glass-fronted space in the new Plaza 211, formerly Halls Plaza. The Plaza hasn’t commented on plans for the Broadway location. Apple has 270 stores in the U.S. and 485 around the world. The new features have been rolled out in about 30 of its stores worldwide.

When he released his sophomore album Blonde to stream exclusively via Apple Music on Saturday, the singer-songwriter published a note to fans and followers on his Tumblr page that explained his lengthy hiatus. He recalled "cruising the suburbs of Tokyo in RWB Porches," "throwing parties around England," "going to Mississippi and playing in the mud with amphibious quads," and casting models at a Senegal kung fu dojo. Not to mention gnarly times spent in Tulum, Paris, Miami and Berlin "to witness [nightclub] Berghain for myself." To be fair to thirsty fans, Ocean’s Blonde rollout was full of pump fakes and teases. In April 2015, a presumably eager Ocean (along with his Def Jam record label) hinted that the follow-up to his critically acclaimed major-label debut Channel Orange would arrive in July 2015 under the title Boys Don’t Cry. That month, and eventually year, would come and go with no new material (not counting his rare appearance on "Wolves" from Kanye West's The Life of Pablo) or any explanations. This summer, there were more missteps, like the looped Apple Music-tagged video footage on the boysdontcry.co site at the top of August with the singer seen in an empty warehouse constructing something. Puzzled viewers took their wildest guesses as ambient sounds played around him. Still -- no music. It was the next best thing to watching paint dry. Thankfully, in an unexpected turn of events last Thursday, the Frank Ocean show finally began. What was once a stagnant loop became a 45-minute film called Endless, where Ocean's wood shop exercise materialized into the building of a staircase to the sounds of new tunes. Two days later, Ocean finally dropped the album called Blonde (or Blond, if you go by the cover copy). The long-assumed title, Boys Don’t Cry, is now an art magazine Ocean published and released Saturday at pop-up shops in New York, Los Angeles, London and Chicago. Frank Ocean Drops New Album 'Blonde,' Gives Out 'Boys Don't Cry' Magazine at Pop-Up Shops Within his four-year disappearance, a challenge lay in front of Ocean: Not only did he have to follow up a debut that earned him a Grammy Award and much praise from peers and fans alike, he now seemingly had to put together a project that merited the amount of time he spent crafting it. If the last few days of watching ravenous consumers unwrap and unpack both Endless and Blonde on social media is any indication, his latest 17-track set is that and more. For Ocean, words are his greatest weapon. He’s not a vocal powerhouse like Miguel. He’s not a dancing machine like Chris Brown. He’s not a funky, one-man-band like Anderson .Paak. But his ability to turn a phrase bests each of his contemporaries. “If you could fly then you'd feel south/ Up north's getting cold soon,” Frank sings on Blonde’s “Pink + White," where he thoughtfully compares a lover’s need for warmth in a relationship to a bird fleeing winter’s chill and heading to the tropics. This is what makes Ocean special. The LP opens with “Nikes,” a mellow number that has less to do with the sportswear brand and more with its iconic check symbol. Frank realizes that many women have been after him to take advantage of his wealth. They want checks (a term of cash here) and a lot of them. "Said she need a ring like Carmelo," he adds, likening her need for a wedding ring to the New York Knicks superstar’s burning desire to win NBA championship bling. He continues to weave in mentions of Shakespeare’s Othello, gunned-down black teen Trayvon Martin and mermaids. These are not the thoughts of a hurried man. Several listens of Blonde reveal just how crucial Frank’s time away from the spotlight was to his new music. He’s a gifted songwriter, but it’s his life experiences that power his pen. On "Solo," Frank jogs over organ chords, both romanticizing and lamenting his experience with drugs. He begins talking about a joyous acid trip that made him dance alone with the vigor of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, but then he drifts into memories of getting high and enjoying some intimacy with a smoking buddy in Chicago. The second verse, though, ends with Frank unfortunately lonely in Colorado. "I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you," he raps melodically. "Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo." Frank Ocean Actually Debuted the 'Blonde' Tracks 'Ivy' & "Seigfried' Back in 2013: Watch The imagery on Blonde is vivid. "Self Control" finds him begging an ex to keep the fond memories they have of their past life nuzzled closely, even when with a new lover. "Keep a place for me," he asks. "I’ll sleep between y’all." There are gracious love stories and darker ones about losing it ("It’s quite all right to hate me now," he surrenders on "Ivy"), references to bouts with stress (on "Nights," he escapes the dreaded 27 club and happily enters age 28), and even a quickie interlude about a crummy first date at a gay bar with "Good Guy." In 2012, days prior to Orange’s release, Ocean revealed that he’s loved both men and women. That context is key on this album because that fluidity is apparent throughout. If he’s pensive on the track, each line is delivered with the fragility of a man nearing his wit's end. If he’s reflective and indifferent, it’s easy to imagine him shrugging his shoulders or rolling his eyes. The feels on Blonde are precise. Musically, this is a quiet album. The tracks are sparse, typically led by keys or guitar licks. Like the latter part of Channel Orange, Blonde feels like it’s best served during the evening when thoughts tend to roam free and memories seem to regress from healed scars to raw wounds. Ocean is a master at reliving his yesterdays over music. Also, at wondering aloud. None of this album sounds like anything that could have been done on the fly. There are no basic beats that were simply whipped up on a Macbook and emailed from an of-the-moment producer. There are well-considered uses of Auto-Tune, screeches and warbles. Even the guest appearances couldn’t have been easy to score. Kendrick Lamar sprinkles in parenthetical exclamations on “Skyline To.” Frank hang-glides on Beyoncé’s coos toward the end of "Pink + White." He even procured spastic raps from the elusive Andre 3000 on "Solo (Reprise)," the only verse the Outkast rhymer has released in 2016 (though he did sing a line or two worth of background vocals on West’s "30 Hours" from TLOP). These things take time. And now that it’s out (finally!), it’s clear that Ocean’s was well-spent. In those exaggerated, agonizing years that fans complained about what he was doing while not feeding their voracious appetites for his particular brand of mood music, it’s clear that his travels, explorations, extensive introspection and, yes, even the moments that he seemed to just be goofing off, equated to him making another masterpiece. Watch Frank Ocean's Visually Stunning 'Nikes' Video "I had the time of my life making all of this," Ocean wrote of Blonde on his Tumblr in a separate post. "Thank you all. Especially those of you who never let me forget I had to finish. Which is basically every one of ya’ll. Haha. Love you." He laughs off the peanut gallery's clamor, but the pressure to put out new work must have weighed heavily on him. It’s astonishing that Frank didn’t fold. A lesser man would have done himself a favor and given the people what they wanted perhaps before the project was ripe. What would Blonde have sounded like if Ocean had tinkered with it less, given in to everyone’s need, and released it earlier? Different. Fortunately, he didn’t. The result is a testament to the space he required and the break he took. It’d be wise of fans to consider that the next time around.  FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

Perhaps as a consolation for making his fans wait so long, the singer not only released his much-anticipated new album, Blond, but also unveiled a series of creative projects, which includes a visual album with an additional 18 new songs and a limited-edition magazine. The multi-platform release of Ocean’s new album (if you can even call it that) is the first of its kind and even a shallow dive into Blond reveals there’s much more than meets the eye. Blond’s mixture of music, dreamy videos, fashion photography, personal essays, and poetry feels more like a well-curated Tumblr—a medium that Ocean has long favored. Below, we unravel everything we know about Frank Ocean’s Blond. How many albums did Ocean end up releasing? Depends on how you look at it. On Friday, Ocean dropped a visual album on Apple Music called Endless. The 45-minute clip featured Ocean building a staircase while 18 new songs by the artist played in the background. But that was just a prelude of what was to come. On Saturday, Ocean released a 17-track album exclusively on Apple Music titled Blond. On the first song, “Nikes,” Ocean brags: “I’ve got two versions, I’ve got twooo versions”—a reference to a Tumblr post he wrote back in 2015. And true to his word, it seems there’s another physical version of his new album inside his magazine, Boys Don’t Cry, that’s slightly different to the one available online. The physical album includes two exclusive tracks, “Mitsubishi Sony” and “Easy,” while “Nikes,” “Good Guy,” “Facebook Story,” and others are only available on the digital version. Is it Blonde or Blond? It’s Blond. While Apple Music still has Ocean’s new album listed as Blonde, the album art has the title stylized as Blond. Wolfgang Tillmans, the photographer who shot the portrait of Ocean for the cover, also revealed in a recent interview with Fader that a few weeks ago the album was still being called Blonde and the decision to drop the “e” in the title was a last-minute change, which might explain Apple’s confusion. So what’s Boys Don’t Cry? On Saturday, Ocean posted the locations of four pop-up stores in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and London, where fans could get a free copy of Boys Don’t Cry, the companion magazine to his new album. In New York, the line to enter the small magazine shop reportedly spanned over three blocks—many waited hours and walked away empty-handed. https://www.instagram.com/p/BJWfC5iDjgI/   Will there be more issues of Boys Don’t Cry available soon? Maybe. Copies of Boys Don’t Cry are already going for as much as $1,000 on eBay, but Ocean’s mom has given fans hope after she sent out a tweet that vaguely implied there may be some more zines coming. Don't Pay those ridiculous prices for the mags on eBay. Just hang tight a sec..— katonya breaux (@katonya) August 22, 2016   What’s inside the magazine? There’s plenty to enjoy about Ocean’s first foray as a magazine editor. The intro to the issue includes an essay by Ocean, in which he alludes to the album’s title and talks about his noted car obsession. “Raf Simons once told me it was cliché, my whole car obsession. Maybe it links to a deep subconscious straight boy fantasy.” (You can read the intro online here.) There’s also a poem by Kanye West about McDonald’s French fries, photographs by Wolfgang Tillmans, another poem by Ocean called “Boyfriend,” lots and lots of cars, and a CD version of Blond. A voicemail message from Ocean’s mom appears on the album. The track “Be Yourself” is actually a voicemail message from Ocean’s mother, Katonya Breaux Riley, which may have been recorded when he was in college. In the one-and-a-half minute clip, his mom gives him a little pep talk and warns him of the dangers of drugs. “Don’t try to be someone else. Be yourself and know that that’s good enough,” she says. “You’ve understood the things that I’ve taught you. Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs, don’t use that cocaine, or marijuana, because that stuff is highly addictive.” This might be a little awkward since his opening essay on Boys Don’t Cry references the first time he did ’shrooms and that “Mine,” a song off of Endless, features the lyrics “how come the ecstasy always depresses me so?” Maybe you should listen to your mother, Frank? “Facebook Story” is a dating anecdote from producer SebastiAn. French producer SebastiAn, who has worked with Daft Punk, Beastie Boys, and Charlotte Gainsbourg, collaborated with Ocean on a few songs for Endless and Blond. On the new album, there’s a track in which SebastiAn tells a story about a girl who once dumped him after he refused to accept her friend request on Facebook. “Facebook arrived and she wanted me to accept her on Facebook. And I don’t want it because I was like, in front of her. And she told me like, ‘Accept me on Facebook.’ It was virtual, made no sense,” he says on the track. “She thought I was cheating. She told me like, uh, it’s over and I can’t believe it. It is crazy because . . . I’m in front of you. I’m every day here in your house. That’s like jealousy. Pure jealousy for nothing. You know, a virtual thing.” The music video for “Nikes” is kind of a trip. Directed by Tyrone Lebon, the photographer behind the latest Calvin Klein campaign ad, the video for “Nikes” features Ocean in full-on eyeliner and wearing Balmain, a number of nude women, A$AP Rocky holding a photo of A$AP Yams, a tribute to Trayvon Martin, a rapping Chihuahua (yes, you read that right), and plenty of glitter. The whole thing plays like a peek into Ocean’s subconscious—and, boy, is it a strange and alluring place. What are celebrities saying about it? Celebrities, they’re just like us! Over the weekend, several artists and famous fans tweeted out words of praise for Blond, including Kanye West, who let the world know he was listening to the album on repeat, and Calvin Harris, who called it a masterpiece. https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/767489767005093888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Masterpiece: Listen to Nights by Frank Ocean on @AppleMusic https://t.co/Y60UvjHEUz— Calvin Harris (@CalvinHarris) August 21, 2016 Blonde is so good it makes me wonder if we even deserve it. ✨— United Hairline (@atrak) August 21, 2016 https://twitter.com/ZacEfron/status/767415797647941632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw https://t.co/tz22pqYCVg Rain, glitter shivers..— James Blake (@jamesblake) August 20, 2016 Frank Ocean makes me feel like my senses have been dulled all my life and only now I'm experiencing things for the first time. #Blonde— Trevor Noah (@Trevornoah) August 21, 2016 Listening to #blonde congrats to Frank Ocean doing something exciting.

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Every so often, a new idea or piece of tech arrives and catches on in a big way. Samsung began the curved-edge display trend with the Galaxy S6 edge, which naturally garnered some skepticism at first. Backed by a strong consensus among tech commentators and consumers alike, the curvaceous finish has made its way to the new Note 7, and several other companies seem to have been watching. With Xiaomi's forthcoming Mi Note 2 set to be furnished with a similar panel, Sammy's fiercest rival may soon join the party.  A new report from Nikkei infers that a 'premium' OLED iPhone may be in the works for next year featuring a dual-curved display. The report suggests that said iPhone's display could be larger than 5.5 inches in diameter, while the standard editions may continue with the flat LCD configurations as seen with the current iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. According to Nikkei's source: There will be a 4.7-inch model, another that will be 5.5-inches and a premium handset that will be either 5.5-inches or larger equipped with a screen bent on the two sides. This is not the first we've heard of an OLED-packing iPhone. Earlier this year, analyst and all-round Apple informant Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the fruit company will deploy AMOLED in 2017. In that report, he also alluded to an iPhone that could favor a mostly glass design and wireless charging.  Kuo seemed to suggest that the entire iPhone line may go OLED. But taking this new report into consideration, perhaps the lesser models will stay behind, at least initially. Since Apple is famed for slow roll-outs where major changes are concerned, it's possible that the regular iPhone models will wait until 2019 or later, as Kuo suggested last year.  The rather interesting subtext here is that Samsung and Apple have long battled patent disputes with one another. More often than not, Apple has been the instigator, having accused its Korean rival of lifting ideas from the iOS device range. A potential move towards a curved OLED would instead see Cupertino take a leaf from the book of its old adversary. Nevertheless, given how the Galaxy Note 7 is poised to ship considerably more units than its predecessor, a similarly-designed effort from Apple could inject some much-needed life into the iPhone brand.  The report also mentions that Samsung will be a provider of the curved OLED display for the 2017 top-end iPhone.  Concept: here's what an iPhone with a curved-edge display might look like Popular galleries Careful: this video link will crash your iPhone!

Tech Insider BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. I used CarPlay for a week and now all I want from my next car is Apple software Kif Leswing Aug. 22, 2016, 5:11 PM 135,466 facebook linkedin twitter email print Kif Leswing/Business Insider Apple might be secretly building a self-driving car or the software to power it, but it already makes software for cars.  If you haven't driven a new car in the past two years, you might not be familiar with Apple CarPlay. It’s dead simple to use, and provides easy access to music, phone calls, and Apple Maps. I was able to try CarPlay out because it was included with a 2016 Chevrolet Tahoe I rented for a recent vacation in California. I’m a New Yorker and I don’t own a car — but the next one I buy will certainly have CarPlay. To me, it's now a must-have for iPhone users.  Here’s why it impressed me so much: View As: One Page Slides CarPlay doesn’t connect through Bluetooth. You have to plug your phone in through a Lightning cable. Kif Leswing/Business Insider But once you plug it in, it boots into CarPlay automatically. (Most of the time. I found if I was doing Google Maps turn-by-turn directions, the pairing could be wonky.) Kif Leswing/Business Insider The display looks a lot like an iPhone screen! The best way to think about CarPlay is as a 2nd monitor for your iPhone built into your car’s dashboard. If you change apps on your iPhone, it will change the app on the CarPlay screen, and vice versa. Kif Leswing/Business Insider CarPlay really can’t do a whole lot — by default, it can only make calls, send and read texts, navigate through Apple Maps, and play music and other audio. But that simplicity is good — there isn’t a whole lot else you might want to do while behind the wheel. Apple There are a few other apps that work with CarPlay, including At Bat, Spotify, and a few podcast apps. Apple Source.  Apple Maps works great! It handled turn-by-turn directions and the display previewing the next turn was as good as any dedicated GPS. Kif Leswing/Business Insider But if you like Google Maps or Waze, you’re out of luck. That's the biggest difference between CarPlay and Android Auto, Google's own dashboard software. CarPlay can play the spoken Google Maps turn-by-turn directions over the car speakers, but the actual maps won’t appear on the car’s in-dash screen. Wikipedia There's a workaround, but it's clunky.  But where CarPlay really shines is with music or other audio. It's pretty handy that the dials and next song buttons can control your phone. Kif Leswing/Business Insider The Now Playing screen on CarPlay has big, tappable buttons for navigating your library or pausing your music, in case you would rather use the touchscreen. Kif Leswing/Business Insider When you get a text message, you’ll get a notification drop down from the top of of the CarPlay screen — just like on your iPhone. Kif Leswing/Business Insider However, that notification won’t have any details about the content of that text or iMessage. You can have Siri read it, but in my experience, it had a few seconds of lag. If there’s a picture or other content in the iMessage, Siri won’t be able to describe it. Overall, Siri's much better at making voice calls than dealing with texts. Kif Leswing/Business Insider It could also be awkward if you’re riding with someone else in the car and they see who sent you a text and asks you about it. Imagine if that message was from a secret girlfriend or HR director at a rival firm. Kif Leswing/Business Insider Apple is reportedly working on some other car software, like for a self-driving car. Business Insider CarPlay is nowhere close to that, and the car makers still have a lot of control. I’m sure it annoys Apple that it doesn’t control the in-car hardware. For example, the touchscreen was far below Apple's usual standards for responsiveness and display quality. Kif Leswing/Business Insider But remember: In 2005, Apple entered into a partnership with Motorola to handle some of the iTunes music features on a cellphone, the Motorola Rokr. Then, in 2007, the iPhone came out. Matt Ray/Wikimedia Commons CarPlay feels kind of like that Rokr experiment — basic, simple, but effective, and an interesting preview of what Apple might be able to do when it fully commits itself to car software. AP For now, I would put CarPlay way at the top of the features I’d want in a new car. So where do you get it? Well, the 2016 Chevy Tahoe I rented had it. Kif Leswing/Business Insider But lots of cars come with CarPlay preinstalled now. Here's some of them.

Fox Business1:49 UP NEXT Five years ago this week, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook was handed an unenviable task — taking the helm of the company from terminally ill founder Steve Jobs, one of the iconic personalities of the age. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 110.88 -0.92 -0.82% SAP SE SAP ▼ 84.16 -1.25 -1.46% International Business Machines Corp IBM ▼ 161.89 -0.78 -0.48% Cisco Systems Inc CSCO ▼ 29.64 -0.25 -0.85% Even though the company has had significant successes in those five years — nearly a billion iPhones sold and both revenue and profits more than doubling — Cook's legacy is likely to be defined more by what he does in the next five years, analysts say. Though Cook has yet to prove he can be as innovative as the charismatic Jobs, he has successfully steered the franchise and maintained its position as the world's most valuable company. "Historically, founder-led companies go through existential crises after the founder is gone," said Asymco analyst Horace Dediu. "The fact that Apple didn't implode, but has grown, means mission accomplished." Apple's stock is up 105 percent since Cook stepped into the CEO role, but has slid 3 percent over the past year. The S&P 500 is up 88 percent and 11 percent in those respective periods. In Apple's most recent quarterly results, revenue declined 14.6 percent — a second quarterly decline following 13 years of growth. With this shift, Cook's legacy hangs in the balance. "Investors may have hoped for new product categories to sustain growth because — as you know — the company is not growing at the moment," said BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk. Though some investors will want more, Cook has far exceeded what he was asked to do by keeping the iPhone franchise intact and growing, said Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster. Cook's operational ability, which has enabled Apple to seamlessly roll out new products globally, is second to none, Munster said. "We haven't seen as much on the innovation side, and that's really what we're going to learn about Tim Cook over the next five years," said Munster. "It's the things under his guidance, including augmented reality and, potentially, automotives." (Munster has an overweight rating on the stock and a $151 price target. It was trading below $109 on Monday.) Under Cook, Apple has released one entirely new product: Apple Watch. The device has delivered billions of dollars in revenue, opened up an entirely new product category, and laid the groundwork for the company to deliver wellness and health services. "They took a risk with Apple Watch, which I think is a phenomenal product," said Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White. (White has a buy rating on the stock, the firm's top pick for the second half of the year, and a $185 price target.) Cook must walk a fine line between shipping new products without rushing to market, something he has been judged harshly for by some industry insiders. "I don't think Jobs would have approved such an early launch, though I do think it will grow nicely and be a great product," said Dediu. "But it didn't have the app system ready for launch." Apple sold 1.6 million watches in the second quarter of 2016 and had 47 percent of the wearables market, according to IDC, but the product has not taken off as well as some investors had hoped. Users, analysts and carriers would like to see Apple decouple the watch from the phone, something that is not expected to happen this product cycle. So far, the real standout for Munster has been Cook's success in expanding Apple's services business — things like iCloud, iTunes and Apple Pay — which grew 19 percent last quarter. Services will be the size of a Fortune 100 company by next year, Cook has said. "Where I think it's been underwhelming on the hardware side, which of course is where they make their money. The technology is just not there to really get the Watch away from the iPhone yet," Steve Milunovich, managing director at UBS, told CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Monday. He added that Jobs was once against the App Store that has done so well for Apple. "Where I think they've done a good job is on the services side, as you call it, or as we put it, the platform side," Milunovich said. Some attempts to grow Apple's services business have been less successful. For example, the company bought Beats Music for $3 billion in 2014. The deal was a rare high-profile acquisition for the company that delivered executive talent, and was accompanied by talk of new music experiences. Apple Music — a new streaming service — was launched in 2015 but has so far failed to gain much traction, said Piecyk. Cook has the opportunity to further leverage Apple's devices to grow revenue from services, said White. For example, Apple TV could be used to sell services — like Mandarin lessons or cooking classes — to consumers at home, he said. Cook is also credited with opening up new markets for Apple's products. He has forged partnerships with enterprise giants IBM (IBM), Cisco (CSCO) and SAP (SAP-DE) in order to better serve enterprise customers, and grown Apple's footprint in emerging markets. The number of stores in the Chinese marketplace increased from four to 41 during his tenure. Cook recently visited India, which represents a giant opportunity for the company, said White. "Apple's a very different company today, obviously, than four or five years ago," Milunovich said. "[Cook's] had to deal with the FBI situation, moving into China and India, shareholders demanding dividends and buybacks — which Jobs didn't have to deal with at the time." © Provided by CNBC One thing investors are watching closely is how much Apple is spending on research and development. R&D investment is expected to increase this year to $10.5 billion — 4 percent of revenue — according to Munster. That level of investment should be coupled with greater innovation than Cook has so far delivered, said Piecyk. "You have to launch new products — it's fine to spend the money — but until you see them there's really no clarity on what he has been doing," Piecyk said. (Piecyk has a buy rating on Apple and a $124 price target.) Under Cook, Apple has continually updated the iPhone line but has not delivered great leaps in innovation, he said. (iPhone sales were down 23 percent in the company's most recent earnings report.) The iPhone 6, launched in 2014, delivered the larger screen consumers had been clamoring for, but Apple lost out to competitors by waiting too long, analysts agree. "He's built a great company — but he's not a visionary," Andy Cunningham, whose PR firm worked with Jobs, told CNBC's "Squawk Alley" on Monday. An example of the sort of innovation that analysts would like to see would be a phone that doubles as a tablet by flipping open to double in size, said Munster. He is bullish about the innovative steps Cook may take over the next five years to drive iPhone growth. © Provided by CNBC Though Apple is notoriously secretive about what its engineers are working on, Cook has said he sees the development of augmented and virtual reality — powered by smartphones — as a prime opportunity. On the company's most recent earnings call Cook said Apple is investing in artificial intelligence and virtual reality. Apple now has 218 employees working on augmented reality, up 18 percent in the past year, according to Munster. "Augmented reality and virtual reality could be something that would allow the platform to be even richer and sustain the iPhone going forward," said Dediu. Cook's biggest opportunity to make his mark on Apple's business could be in developing an autonomous car, said Dediu. Cook has not spoken publicly about this, but it is widely believed that Apple is working on a car, which has the potential to revolutionize the auto industry. "There are obstacles, such as getting the supply networks put together and ramped up," said Dediu. "But I think there is already a prototype. However, they will not launch until they can quickly build significant volume." Apple's hardware, software and design chops make it uniquely well-positioned to build a car that consumers would want to buy, said White. Apple has the advantage of being unencumbered by legacy thinking and union workers — unlike traditional automakers — and could hook the car into its existing ecosystem, he said. "They are going to pick and choose what markets they want to pursue," said White. "In 10 years we are not going to say Apple is solely reliant on the iPhone." Apple did not respond to a request for comment. © Provided by CNBC Go to MSN Home More in Money 7 successful icons who had a brush with bankruptcy InvestorPlace 20 best money tips of all time from Tony Robbins GOBankingRates 7 CEOs heading to the chopping block InvestorPlace The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money Up Next What the richest 1 percent earns in every state Money Talks News AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from CNBC CNBC View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Stocks close mostly lower as oil price slumps CNBC 8/22/2016 Fred Imbert Stocks closed mostly lower on Monday, with energy falling nearly 0.9 percent, as investors looked ahead to a key speech from the top Federal Reserve official. Quotes in the article Zoe's Kitchen Inc ZOES ▲ 25.48 +0.05 +0.20% Nordson Corp NDSN ▲ 109.82 +0.96 +0.88% "We've been trading ff in volume and it's seasonably slow," said Mariann Montagne, senior investment analyst at Gradient Investments. "There's no direction here." "I think people are getting in these last-minute trips," she said. The Dow lost 23 points, with Apple and Johnson & Johnson contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 slipped 0.06 percent lower, with energy leading decliners. The Nasdaq held held just above the flat line, with Apple falling approximately 0.8 percent, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) rose more than 1.5 percent. Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS, said in a note that trading volume is "very light." "High risk the NYSE volume comes in under 700 million, possibly one of the year's slowest days."  "Earlier spike/bounce may have been a creature of the thin markets. Early nibbling bio-techs and techs began to lift the Russell [2000]. When the S&P tried to follow, a 'normal sized' order had the effect of a fat finger type trade," Cashin said. "The move back south came when WTI threatened to break below $47." Dow component Pfizer agreed to buy U.S. drug company Medivation for $81.50 a share, or about $14 billion. Shares of Medivation rose nearly 20 percent, while Pfizer's stock traded 0.4 percent lower. "It seems like it's a pretty slow news cycle other than some deals in biotech," said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. "You hate to bring a little bit of bad luck, but it does feel like last year when you had the calm before the storm." Stocks posted new record highs last week, despite the S&P notching its 30th straight session without a 1 percent move on a closing basis, its longest streak since 2014. "It's good to see the market sit tight here," said Adam Sarhan, CEO at Sarhan Capital. "It shows the market is taking a pause to set up for the next move higher." Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to deliver a speech Friday on the U.S. economy and monetary policy at the Economic Policy Symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Yellen's remarks will be delivered following hawkish rhetoric from Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer and New York Fed President William Dudley. "Now we don't know for sure if Mr. Dudley and Mr. Fischer alerted Mrs. Yellen to the content of their thoughts before they expressed them or if she even agrees with them but if Yellen concurs on Friday, the short term rate markets will have to adjust, along with many other markets, especially the brain washed equity markets," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. Market expectations for a September rate hike were just 18 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. However, expectations for a December hike were near 50 percent. "This has been the Fed's MO: The [talk up a rate hike] and then they back off. I expect the same from Janet Yellen," said Sarhan. Yellen's speech "may come off as a bit hawkish because she'll talk positively about the economy," said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. He added, however, she would probably reiterate that the Fed remains dependent on economic data when assessing its next monetary policy move. "I think we're in a wait-and-see mode until 11 a.m. Friday," aid Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. "This is the third week in a row we've been in wait-and-see mode," he said, noting last week investors were waiting for the Fed minutes and for retail sales data the week before amid a lack of catalysts. Meanwhile, in oil markets, U.S. crude dropped 3.03 percent to settle at $47.05 a barrel, as analysts cast doubt the upcoming producer talks would lead to a curtailing oversupply.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Apple Acquires Personal Health Data Recording Platform 'Gliimpse' Apple Acquires Personal Health Data Recording Platform 'Gliimpse' Monday, 22 August 2016 Apple has acquired personal health and wellness startup Gliimpse, continuing its push into the health and fitness landscape that it began focusing on with the launch of the Apple Watch. The company made the acquisition earlier in the year, according to Fast Company, but Apple has now confirmed the purchase with its usual response: "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans." Gliimpse is a personal health platform that collects various fitness-related pieces of data for its users "to collect, personalize, and share a picture of their health data" at different stages of their personal journey. The company was funded by entrepreneur Anil Sethi and was founded in 2013, following Sethi's inspiration to create an easy way to track health data as he watched his sister battle breast cancer.Gliimpse™ began with a simple idea – everyone should be able to manage their health records, and share them securely with those they trust. Currently in stealth, Gliimpse is healthcare’s platform for building patient-centric apps. By unlocking hospital silos, we aggregate fragmented data into Medicare mandated patient summaries. Gliimpse is your personal health history, in the palm of your hands. As seen on the company's website, Gliimpse also lets users make daily journal entries to chronicle their emotional state of mind, track lab results, record levels of pain to inform a physician, and other privacy features that ensure each user's data stays secure. These features mark Gliimpse as a more healthcare-focused experience for users with serious ailments like diabetes and cancer, in contrast to more casual health upkeep apps, like Apple Health. The new acquisition is a continuation of Apple's efforts to bolster its presence in the digital health field. Earlier in the month, the company re-hired Flipboard co-founder Evan Doll for a secretive position in its health initiative, and it's even been rumored that Apple is working on a new piece of hardware with a health-tracking focus -- which might also be another Apple Watch -- for release in 2017. Apple's focus on health and wellness (which will also expand to mindfulness with its Breathe Apple Watch app this fall) was summarized by CEO Tim Cook when he appeared on "Mad Money" earlier in the year. Specifically, when host Jim Cramer asked whether it was "within the realm of our lifetime" that a device paired with Apple's HealthKit framework might be able to monitor diabetes, blood pressure, and detect cancer, Tim Cook said "Oh, I absolutely do."Tags: HealthKit, fastcompany.com, health and fitness Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Tech - on August 18, 2016< > Embed Apple Users Made Themselves Vulnerable While Trying To Boost Security 01:01 Apple users who prioritize their data security desperately need to download last month's update for the iPhone.

Compared with LTPS screens, OLEDs offer sharper color contrast. And while LTPS panels are rigid, OLED displays are flexible and allow manufacturers to create curved and even foldable screens.” “Hsieh said that Samsung Electronics will be Apple’s sole OLED supplier next year but that the Suwon-based company will not be able to fully meet demand for both itself and its U.S. customer next year,” Wu and Ting-Fang report. “Meanwhile, Jeff Pu, an analyst at Taipei-based Yuanta Investment Consulting, said Apple is likely to give up metal casings for iPhones and shift to a new look — a front glass cover and chassis, joined by a metal bezel for all its handsets next year. The Nikkei Asian Review reported earlier in August that Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn Technology Group, has been developing glass casing technology since last year in the hope of winning orders from Apple orders for the new chassis in 2017.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: More corroboration on those flexible OLEDs for Apple’s 2017 flagship iPhone. The big question: Will 2017 also be Liquidmetal time? I estimate that Apple will likely spend on the order of $300 million to $500 million — and three to five years — to mature the technology before it can used in large scale. — Dr. Atakan Peker, one of the Caltech researchers who invented Liquidmetal, May 2012 SEE ALSO: Foxconn working on ‘glass chassis’ yields for 2017 iPhone, sources say – August 9, 2016 Apple supplier LG Display invests $1.75 billion into flexible OLED displays – July 28, 2016 LG Display jacks up spending on OLED display production for Apple ‘iPhone 8’ – July 13, 2016 Samsung Display expected to benefit from AMOLED ‘iPhone 8’ shipments in 2017 – June 30, 2016 Samsung to invest $6.8 billion OLED display investment focused on Apple iPhone – June 20, 2016 Applied Materials’ OLED push capable of sourcing 100 million Apple iPhone displays – June 2, 2016 [Thanks to MacDailyNews Readers “Fred Mertz” and “Dan K.” for the heads up.] Categories: News Tags: Apple, flexible OLED displays, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone 8 Pro, Liquidmetal Thank You for supporting MacDailyNews!

Mulji Monday, August 22, 2016 - 4:42 pm · Reply So Apple’s 2017 line-up will look exactly like Samsung’s Galaxy S / Note line-up? magoo Monday, August 22, 2016 - 5:16 pm · Reply So does this mean we will have a Clear Curved Case as well otherwise how will a case work? Curved screens on phones, just like curved screen on TV’s….a Gimmick! Gollum Monday, August 22, 2016 - 5:42 pm · Reply I don’t see the advantage to a curved screen. It seems when Apple designes something, there is some advantage to Apple or the consumer. A curved screen rises above the surrounding plane, making protection more difficult to implement. Also it seems that it doesn’t solve a particular problem, such as signal strength or rigidity. A curved OLED screen, I only see disadvantage, not to mention the “me too” issue. Higo Monday, August 22, 2016 - 10:57 pm · Reply Might work well in a VR goggle though. Gollum Monday, August 22, 2016 - 11:08 pm · Reply I was at a discount store yesterday. They had surplus VR goggles for phones, specifically iPhone. Seems like a gimmick to me. fred747 Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 2:13 am · Reply I agree. Please don’t give us curved screens. It’s a solution looking for a problem that doesn’t exist. spyintheskyuk Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 10:01 am · Reply Yes one thing I am sure of is that it won’t look/work just like the Samsung phones for there simply seems no point in those whatsoever as things stand. If Apple is delving into the area of gimmicks then I would be concerned but they simply would not do that considering cost and the ‘me to’ factor would preclude such a move by previous evidence. Without some substantial additional purpose/appearance it simply would not be worth the change for its own sake. Cochise Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 2:34 pm · Reply Convex instead of concave?

If they follow samsung edge screen which does not have a use case then that will be the end of Steve’s Apple. jambro Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 1:22 pm · Reply This is good news. I’m happy Samsung was the first. At least now, Apple can copy what Sammy did. If it weren’t for Sammy, Cook would have no direction and nobody to copy. pdmarsh Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 1:37 pm · Reply I find it hard to get interested in another fragile glass front/back iPhone, even with a metal ring around the perimeter. It would certainly have to be protected with a case, just as the iPhone 4 was. Also, this article appears to suggest only the largest new iPhone would get the brighter OLED screen. If that’s true, 4.7″ iPhone users would have little reason to skip the current upgrade cycle. So, pretty much a ho-hum issue for me, since I’ll likely never go to the 5.5″ model.

An order from the European Commission states Ireland charge Apple $14.5 billion in back taxes.More >>    By Rick Stella Provided by After sparring with Apple in recent weeks over the creation of a backdoor into one of the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhones, the United States government has decided to cancel its hearing with the Cupertino-based company. According to a new court filing presented Monday, lawyers for the Justice Department claim to have found an outside entity capable of unlocking gunman Syed Rizwan Farook’s now infamous iPhone. Because of the newly presented avenue, the government says it no longer needs Apple’s help in the matter. Despite constant urging from the FBI, Apple staunchly refused to bypass any of the security measures built-in to its flagship smartphone. As the U.S. government continued to pressure Apple into writing software it claimed would only be used on one phone, Tim Cook continued to stand firm in the company’s denial of help. Cook even went so far as to say Apple would “not shrink from this responsibility” during a March 21 product event, mere hours before the Justice Department decided to pull the plug on the hearing. Related: Apple’s Tim Cook on FBI battle: “We will not shrink from this responsibility” “On Sunday, March 20, 2016, an outside party demonstrated to the FBI a possible method for unlocking Farook’s iPhone,” reads the Justice Department’s official filing. “Testing is required to determine whether it is a viable method that will not compromise data on Farook’s iPhone. If the method is viable, it should eliminate the need for the assistance from Apple Inc. (‘Apple’) set forth in the All Writs Act Order in this case.” The filing further details a call placed by the United States Attorney to Apple’s counsel, asking for the company’s position on its desire to cancel the hearing. Just a few hours after the call was placed, a judge reportedly granted the motion and officially cancelled the hearing. Originally, the FBI and Apple were due in court at 1 p.m. PST on March 22, where both parties were scheduled to give arguments regarding the case. U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym, who originally ordered Apple to create the backdoor, was set to preside over the arguments.   This article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Apple acquires Gliimpse, a health data startup Brittany A. Roston - Aug 22, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple has acquired Gliimpse, a startup that concerns itself with health data and making it easier for patients to access their medical records. Apple has, according to sources, acquired the startup, adding it to its own growing repertoire of health products. Though Apple has confirmed the acquisition, it hasn’t provided any details; sources claim the acquisition took place earlier this year. Gliimpse has not commented on the business deal. The information comes from FastCompany, which says it recently learned about the acquisition but only received a canned, generic statement from Apple: “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.” It’s not difficult to imagine how Gliimpse may mesh with Apple’s other products, however. According to Glimpse’s website, the service allows users to aggregate their personal health data from various web portals and keep it all in one organized location. The user has total control over their medical data and can, as they so choose to, share it with doctors, family members, caregivers, and anyone else who may have reason to see the info. Apple has increasingly targeted the health sector with its own products and services, including things like HealthKit, ResearchKit and CareKit. ResearchKit, for example, helps facilitate “medical insights and discoveries,” per Apple’s website, not unlike the potential for Gliimpse’s mass of health data. The big question is how Apple is using Gliimpse — at this point, there’s no indications of what the company’s up to.

The Apple Car may be a mass-production consumer vehicle, it might be a fully autonomous fleet model, it might purely be software for other semi-autonomous cars. Who knows. But perhaps more interesting — at least in the near term — is a crop of rumors that Apple isn’t just planning one automotive endeavor, it’s considering another large-scale investment. Business Insider made note of Formula 1 blogger Joe Saward’s report outlining an F1 bid by Apple. “The whisper is that the latest bidder is Apple Inc., which is a company with $161 billion (£122 billion) in net cash at the moment,” he wrote. This might seem like something out of left field, but the pieces in play on Apple’s side could validate the rumors. In addition to whatever resources are being applied to Project Titan, Apple’s TV platform and its inconceivably large pile of money could lead to something in the global sports or entertainment space. Though F1 has struggled to gain traction in the U.S., it is one of the most watched events elsewhere. Read More: Apple Car Pictures, Specs, and News And should the tech giant enter into the realm of F1, Apple’s vehicle project would surely benefit from the motor sport’s engineering resources and talent. In tandem, Apple TV may gain exclusive rights to F1 coverage, attracting Formula 1 fans who may have held off from abandoning cable simply because there has yet to be a viable source for non-network F1 viewing. Substantiating the Apple F1 rumors slightly more is the fact that the company must invest its capital in foreign nations to avoid tax penalties related to U.S. investments. Oh, and F1 is very much in need of new ownership. The unloved F1 boss, Bernie Ecclestone, has stated that a majority stake in the series would cost about 6 billion pouns. For anyone else, that would be a daunting figure, but for Apple, that’s little more than a rounding error. Apple, up to this point, hasn’t made regular investments on this scale, especially within the sporting arena, but there’s a first time for everything – and it must be running out of ideas for how to spend all that cash.

Now it seems that it may indeed have a future, albeit not the one it may have planned on. Apple, no stranger to buying the companies behind streaming music services, is in talks to acquire Tidal, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. No specific details have been mentioned, and it’s important to note that no deal may actually come out of it, but given the time and energy Apple has put into its Apple Music service, this move wouldn’t be entirely surprising. Related: Spotify and Senator Elizabeth Warren call out Apple as a streaming music bully Exclusives are becoming a more important feature when it comes to music streaming services, and while Apple has managed to snag a few from artists such as Taylor Swift, this is one area where Tidal has lead the competition. This year alone, Kanye West’s The Life of Pablo and Beyonce’s Lemonade launched exclusively on the service, and while the former eventually came to other services, it still lead to a major jump in Tidal’s subscription numbers, at least for a while. Much of this has to do with the ownership behind the service. Jay Z owns the service, while Beyonce, West, and other artists like Rihanna — whose Anti was a timed Tidal exclusive this year — are shareholders. If Apple were to acquire Tidal, it also might suddenly have much more pull with artists when it comes to exclusives. Spotify remains the current leader in the streaming music scene, with more than 100 million active users, 30 million of which are paid subscribers. Music discovery has much to do with this — over 40 million users worldwide use the service’s Discover Weekly playlist — but exclusives and a migrating Tidal user base could help Apple Music’s 15 million subscriber base grow quickly. Related: Apple patent could force you to put down your iPhone at “sensitive events” Terms of the prospective deal aren’t currently known, and a Tidal spokesperson has said that company executives haven’t talked with Apple. That said, Apple is used to being in the lead when it comes to digital music (see iTunes and the iPod), so even if it might take a while, this certainly could happen.   This article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

Related: Apple debuts international versions of the iPad Pro’s Smart Keyboard For example, according to the report, British Airways has built as many as 40 iPad apps for its workforce to use, and switching to tablets has totally eliminated the need for paper records and paper flight plans for the company. One app allows employees to use an iPad to rebook passengers quickly and easily when a flight has been canceled. Of course, the shift does make some sense. Apple has been making a much larger push into business over the last few years than it did when the iPad was first launched in 2010. For example, the company buddied up with IBM in 2014 to launch a number of business-targeted iOS apps. It even paired with Microsoft to show off Office for iOS when the iPad Pro was first launched. Not only that, but Apple’s products do have an edge over Android and Microsoft slates — Apple products are often seen as more secure — whether they actually are or not — and Microsoft still doesn’t have a real mobile-focused operating system. The news certainly does represent somewhat of a shift, especially for Apple. Microsoft has traditionally enjoyed much more success in the business sector, and while Apple obviously isn’t finding more success than Microsoft in business just yet, it is interesting that such a large chunk of Apple’s income comes from business.

An order from the European Commission states Ireland charge Apple $14.5 billion in back taxes.More >>    By Malarie Gokey  Provided by In spite of the best efforts of dozens of tech companies, physical wallets aren’t dead yet. Cash and plastic debit cards still rule our transactions — not NFC-based mobile payments with Apple Pay, Android Pay, or even Samsung Pay — but if MasterCard has its way, that may not be true for too long. In 2016, MasterCard will unleash a torrent of connected things that can all make secure mobile payments without the help of your phone or debit card. Cruising through the drive thru at McDonald’s? Your car will one day pay the bill for you — you can just grab your burger and go. Going for a run and want to grab a coffee on your way home? Forget the wallet — your hoodie will pay. The world MasterCard imagines for us has no cards, cash, wallet, or fuss. And the best part is, it’s not dependent on a specific operating system, device, or phone — MasterCard wants to put its payment tech in everything — literally everything. They believe the Internet of Things can also enable regular, everyday items to make payments, and it’s coming in 2016. To get people excited about the possibilities, it has rounded up a bunch of partners from multiple industries to illustrate how it can be done, and is showcasing them at the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas. Well-known designer Adam Selman made an experimental collection of accessories and clothing, General Motors made a special key fob, Nymi offered up its band that authenticates users’ pulse for security, TrackR updated its Bluetooth key finder gadget, and Ringly pimped out its smart ring to work with MasterCard’s cool payment tech. Related: Here are all the places that support Apple Pay, including 600+ banks and credit unions “Every device will become a commerce device and today, it’s possible,” Sherri Haymond, MasterCard’s SVP & Group Head of Digital Channel Engagement told Digital Trends. “We want to show the world what we’re talking about with these different prototypes.” Make secure transactions with anything To turn a key fob, smart ring, handbag, and wristband into payment devices, MasterCard’s partners worked with Qualcomm and NXP — the company behind the push for Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, which powers Apple Pay, Android Pay, and other mobile payment systems. Once the connected devices have NFC chips inside, you can use them to pay for anything at retail locations that support NFC payments. Related: MasterCard thinks you want to pay with your face Of course, as with Apple Pay and other NFC-based payment systems, the main obstacle to making mobile payments available to everyone is the lack of retailer support. However, the tide is turning for NFC, and more retailers are now accepting the technology than ever before, thanks in part to the recent rise of EMV-secured credit cards (the “chip card” standard invented by Europay, MasterCard, and Visa) in the United States. A February 2015 report from Berg Insights stated that 75 percent of new payment terminals in the U.S. shipped with NFC technology onboard. Although the exact number of stores that support NFC mobile payments is unknown, Apple boasted in March that 700,000 U.S. stores support Apple Pay, which is powered by NFC, and that number has grown since. The security behind the payment-enabled devices comes from the MasterCard Digital Enablement Service (MDES) and the Digital Enablement Express (Express) program. Using the framework laid out in these two programs, any connected object can be turned into a secure payment device. “The goal is for the transition to digital to be more secure than plastic cards,” Haymond said. MDES uses tokenization to ensure that every payment meets the industry standard of EMV-level security. The token replaces your account number with a random number each time you pay, so that the merchant never sees your actual number. Tokens offer an extra layer of security to help prevent hackers from getting access to your bank account. Only MasterCard can unlock the cryptographic keys, so the any stolen data is useless. Tokenization is the same tech used by Apple Pay, Android Pay, and other popular forms of mobile payments. However, while those mobile payment services are limited to a few devices that run specific operating systems, MasterCard’s new prototypes are OS agnostic. If you have a payment-enabled Ringly, Nymi band, Adam Selman purse, Trackr button, or GM key fob, it won’t matter whether you own an iPhone, Android phone, or Windows Phone — you’ll be able to pay on the go without a wallet, plastic credit card, or cash. MasterCard is quick to point out that these prototypes are just the beginning. Now that the word is out, it expects to hear from more companies that are interested in getting into the early testing program. Related: Stratos’ futuristic credit card could simplify your wallet, but not yet “Who knows what will come from creative minds in the future?” Haymond said. Indeed, the sky seems to be the limit, assuming the gospel of mobile payments — and the NFC technology that powers it — spreads around the world.

Apple Seeds macOS 10.12 Sierra Beta 7 to Devs, Public Beta 6 to Everyone Else GO iOS 10 Beta 7 and Public Beta 6 were released last week Aug 22, 2016 21:02 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Just a few moments ago, Apple started seeding the seventh and probably the last Beta of the forthcoming macOS 10.12 Sierra computer operating system to developers enrolled in the Apple Developer program. Marked as build 16A304a, the macOS Sierra Beta 7 appeared today, August 22, 2016, on our Apple Developer account and it looks like it's installable, as usual, through the Mac App Store. maOS 10.12 Sierra Beta 7 requires a late 2009 or newer MacBook or iMac, as well as a 2010 or newer MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, or Mac Pro computer. According to the internal release notes, this final Beta builds adds usability enhancements to AirDrop, the ability to create an Apple File System (APFS) container on an external disk drive using the "diskutil" command, a workaround for an Apple Pay issue, various networking improvements, and better Logitech Control Center support. Support for portable home directories has been removed, SMB (Samba) is now the default file sharing protocol, FaceTime calls between Beta 7 and older iOS and macOS Beta are no longer supported, and it looks like there are also some core improvements that should speed up the entire operating system. Final macOS 10.12 Sierra release arrives in September The macOS 10.12 Sierra Beta 7 build was released today only to application developers that have a registered, paid Apple Developer account, but there's also a Public Beta 6 release available to public beta testers as well, because Apple seeded the both the Public Beta 6 and Beta 7 development builds of iOS 10 at the end of last week. The final release of the macOS 10.12 Sierra operating system will arrive in September, along with the final versions of iOS 10, tvOS 10, watchOS 3, and Xcode 8. We expect that Apple will hold a press announcement in the first week of September, when the Cupertino company should unveil a new iPhone device to the world, the iPhone 7. #macOS Sierra Beta 7#macOS Sierra 10.12#macOS Sierra Public Beta 6#macOS Sierra Beta#Apple subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Releases Surprise iOS 10 Public Beta 6 Update, Beta 7 Build for Developers Apple Releases iOS 10 Beta 6 for Devs, Public Beta 5 for Everyone Apple Releases Fourth iOS 10 and macOS 10.12 Sierra Public Betas, Update Now Apple Seeds Fifth Betas of iOS 10, macOS Sierra, tvOS 10, and watchOS 3 to Devs iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    macOS 10.12 Sierra Beta 7 released New Mac Apps TOWeb: A straightforward application that enables you to quickly and effortlessly create your own webpage by customizing one of the built-in website templates Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate: A straightforward multimedia converter, editor and downloader that helps you grab clips from the web, encode and burn them with just a few clicks of a mouse button War Thunder: An engaging and enthralling online game where you must destroy the enemy tanks, aircraft and human forces in order to win and gain a new rank.

Please oh please MORE >> Barbra Streisand noticed that Siri, the woman trapped inside of your iPhone, pronounces her last name wrong so she called Apple’s CEO Tim Cook and told him to fix it because she is the master of our collective fate. Streisand told NPR that she reached out to Cook when it came to her attention that Siri was pronouncing “Streisand” as “Streizand,” with a hard S that sounds like a Z as opposed to with a soft S. “Streisand with a soft S, like sand on the beach,” she tells NPR. “I’ve been saying this for my whole career. And so what did I do? I called the head of Apple, Tim Cook, and he delightfully agreed to have Siri change the pronunciation of my name, finally, with the next update on September 30th.” “So let’s see if that happens because I will be thrilled,” adds Streisand, who is currently on tour promoting her new album of duets, Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway.

The study, which is based on 500 online interviews with users of Spotify or Apple Music who participate in listening to or creating playlists. The study found that 90 percent of music streamers have listened to or created a playlist. Paid or “premium” subscribers were the most active, with eight in 10 listening to their service every day and half listening to a playlist every time that they use the service to stream music. Among those who listened to service’s playlist, nine out of ten had also created a personal playlist in the past three months. “Playlisting has become the fabric of the music streaming experience,” said Russ Crupnick, managing partner of MusicWatch, in a statement. “The ability to listen to and create playlists has become as important a feature as the catalog of music itself.” Genre-based playlists were the most popular among MusicWatch survey respondents, with 68 percent having listened to this format. Top-40 and other chart-based playlists (e.g., “Top 50,” “Best of The Year”) tied with mood-based playlists for second place, each close to 50 percent. More than a quarter (24 percent) listened to a genre-based playlist each time they used a music-streaming service. Genre and familiarity with songs and artists were ranked highest in importance, when deciding which playlist to listen to. Comparing paid Apple Music subs and Spotify Premium, consumer usage of the services is similar. Two-thirds of users of each service listen to their current-hits offerings – “Today’s Hits” on Spotify and “Today’s Top Hits” on Apple Music — and 44 percent listen to either “Discovery Weekly” on Spotify or “Discovery Mix” on Apple Music. Apple users were somewhat more active than Spotify Premium users, with 29 percent claiming to listen to “Today’s Hits” each time they used the service (compared to 22 percent for Spotify Premium’s “Today’s Top Hits”) and 21 percent listening to “Discovery Mix” (compared to 15 percent for Spotify’s “Discovery Weekly”). While the use of streaming services and playlists is very popular, nearly 80 percent of music streamers also listen to music on AM/FM radio. “Ease and convenience” and “discovery”, both hallmarks of traditional broadcast radio, were cited by many as reasons to use playlists when they stream music. “We set out to understand what’s really important to listeners, and it’s the essence of the song and the artist that wins, in the end,” Crupnick said. “There’s debate about human versus machine curation, about celebrity personalization, and about music sharing on social platforms, but ultimately listeners are really most concerned about whether a playlist provides song that they like and offers a touch of music discovery, too.” Source: MusicWatch, Inc. MacDailyNews Take: When exercising or for parties, we use playlists that we’ve assembled expressly for the activity at hand pretty much exclusively. On rare occasions, we might sample Apple Music Editors’ playlists which are useful for music discovery or if we just want to set it and forget it. How about you?

Registered Mac developers running the latest betas can update via the Mac App Store, or access the standalone download in the developer center. Today’s release comes a week after Apple issued beta 6 of macOS Sierra to developers and 3 days after beta 7 of iOS 10 was released. Apple has entered the fine-tuning stage as it prepares to release the updates to the public. Though Apple chose this year to rebrand OS X to macOS, the update isn’t a significant one. There are just a few notable user-facing changes including Siri for Mac, Universal Clipboard support, and Picture-in-Picture support. We are currently installing beta 7, and will report back with any changes that we feel are worth mentioning.

The XAV-AX100 will arrive in November at a cost of $500 and might well be the best option for those looking to smarten up their motoring experience without having to buy a new car. The unit boasts a 4.8-inch touchscreen with an 800 x 480 resolution and will connect to the smartphone via NFC or Bluetooth. Related: Android Auto vs Apple CarPlay: What's the difference? There are also hardware buttons that’ll enable users to skip tracks, increase volume, cycle through options, enable voice transmission and return to the home screen. The XAV-AX-100 is Sony’s first after-market receiver that supports both competing in-car systems for Apple and Google. Sony appears to be positioned to do well in this area, given its competitors, like Pioneer’s AppRadio 4, cost $100 more. CarPlay and Android Auto are designed to make it easier to leverage their smartphones while on the move. The touchscreen receiver offers convenience when making calls, accessing media apps and using the phone’s built-in mapping systems for navigation. While there are a few after-market receivers available, many auto manufacturers are now building the functionality directly into their cars. There’s no news yet on whether Sony’s receiver will be available in the UK, but we’ll bring you any announcements as soon as they happen.

MacOS 10.12 Sierra packs some relatively major features such as Auto Unlock via Apple Watch, Apple Pay via iPhone, and Siri finally makes it debut on the Mac. The update is currently available for both developers and public beta testers.  It’s not recommended to install this beta unless you’re an actual developer as there’s no reverting back without data loss. Those with access to the macOS developer or public beta can download the update now in the Mac App Store.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Curved 2017 IPhone To Compete With Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Posted: Aug 22 2016, 11:18am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Aug 22 2016, 9:06pm CDT, in News | Apple   Photo Credit: Getty Images   A new report out of Japan says that Apple plans to release three iPhones in 2017 including one with a curved screen like the Note 7. Is Apple again copying Samsung in 2017? Apple long hesitated to follow Samsung with large screen smartphones. According to a new report on Nikkei, Apple is adopting the curved screen introduced by Samsung in the Galaxy smartphones last year. Don't Miss: The Best Black Friday 4K HDR TV Deals The Nikkei report says that Apple will release three new iPhones in 2017. The premium 5.5-inch model will have curved edge OLED screen sourced from Samsung. The report goes even further citing an analyst David Hsieh from IHS DisplaySearch saying that only the premium iPhone 8, or whatever the 10th anniversary iPhone will be called, adopts OLED. The other two 2017 iPhone models with flat screen stick with LCD technology. I am not a big fan of the curved screen. It would be kind of sad to see an iPhone that just looks like an Galaxy Note 7. Apple should come up with their own concept what a flexible display could be used for in smartphones. If there is no great idea, don't do it. Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 7 on September 7. This is already in two weeks. The iPhone 7 is not a big surprise anymore, because of all the leaks. There is though still a lot of context missing. IT is also still unclear if Apple is already introducing three iPhone models this year with the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 Pro.

In addition to 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch flat-screen versions, next year's Apple product line could include a 5.5-inch — or larger — phone with a "screen bent on the two sides" like Samsung's top-end phones, Nikkei reported. That could mean that only two new models will debut in September of this year, one with a dual-lens camera, the unnamed source told Nikkei reporters Debby Wu and Cheng Ting-Fang. Apple did not immediately respond to a request to confirm the report. The "bent" flexible screens are a feature of organic light-emitting diode panels (OLED), which are known for better color gamut and have recently become both more popular and more cost-effective. Apple rival Samsung, maker of the much-buzzed about Note7, is the main supplier of OLED displays. It's been widely reported by outlets like The Wall Street Journal that Apple has bigger design changes in store for the 10-year anniversary of the original iPhone, such as eliminating the "home button," some of which weren't ready for this year's anticipated launch.

We look for faster chips, more RAM, more storage, and bigger batteries. Smartphone makers often deliver, making each new smartphone generation quicker and better than the previous one. As consumers, we often focus on processor types, and the amount of memory and storage to determine whether a certain smartphone is going to be good enough. One thing we don’t always acknowledge is the quality of certain components, and we consistently fail to talk about the speed of one critical part of an iPhone or Android device: the speed of its “hard drive.” Having massive amounts of built-in flash memory and expandable storage isn’t enough if it’s not fast. Thankfully, some of the companies developing these storage solutions for iPhone and flagship Android devices are working on faster and more energy efficient storage solutions. Samsung is one of the company to keep an eye on when it comes to mobile storage, as it just announced plans to make its insanely fast smartphone storage solutions even quicker in the coming years, and that might benefit the iPhone as well. DON’T MISS: Best Buy has 50 hot deals that will be good for just 50 hours One of the reasons the iPhone 6s is so fast when compared to the iPhone 6 is because of Apple’s way of handling memory. According to AnandTech’s detailed explanation of the matter, Apple adapted its MacBook SSD controller — which makes MacBook data transfers incredibly fast — and modified it to use inside a smartphone. Furthermore, the report revealed that the iPhone 6s uses NVMe protocol with custom NAND memory which ruled out UFS or traditional eMMC. The iPad Pro and iPhone SE uses the same type of storage as the 2015 iPhones. In tests, Apple’s storage solution beat the Galaxy S6 series, which came loaded with UFS 2.0 built-in storage, itself being an incredibly fast memory. Credit: AnandTech Credit: AnandTech Samsung this February announced that its UFS 2.0 technology is getting even faster. Furthermore capacity increased up to 256GB as speeds went up to 850MB/s (sequential reading) and up to 260MB/s (sequential writing). But Samsung’s freshly released Galaxy S7 can’t beat Apple’s iPhone 6s storage speeds, according to the same tests from AnandTech. Neither does the Galaxy Note 7 (see charts above). This, however, doesn’t mean that Samsung isn’t looking to come up with even faster storage solutions for mobile devices. Speaking at the Mobile & IOT 2016 Forum in Seoul earlier this week, Samsung said that UFS storage would be significantly upgraded in coming years, Business Korea reports. “4K or 8K cameras on drones make high-capacity storage devices essential parts.” Samsung’s Cho Hee-chang said. “The use of UFS will rise in production of VR contents or semiconductors for automobiles where camera sensors are very important.” Cho expects some 50 billion of connected devices by 2020, with UFS popularity set to expand in following years. Internal UFS 2.0 and UFS 2.1 memory, the one that goes into phones like the Galaxy S and Galaxy Note, and has theoretical speeds of 1.2GB/s should move to 2.4GB/s in the first half of 2018. Samsung also wants to double the speed of its UFS card v.1.0 standard (for its incredibly fast new microSD cards) that supports speeds of up to 600MB/s to UFS card v2.0, which would transfer data at 1.2GB/s speeds. And since Samsung is a major memory provider for a variety of companies, even Apple, we have plenty of reasons to be excited about the smartphones of the future, iPhone included. Sure, some will point out that Apple uses its proprietary controller technology with PCI-E NVMe protocols for its iPhone memory, while Samsung uses the AHCI protocol for its UFS V-NAND memory. It’s all sounds too complicated with all the acronyms, but so far Apple’s solution is the faster one according to benchmarks, with SanDisk claiming that PCI-E NVMe is the future for mobile (see this presentation). Samsung, meanwhile, is sticking with UFS for the foreseeable future, and that’s not a bad thing. UFS memory will only get faster in future Galaxy S and Galaxy Note smartphones, at least according to Samsung’s projections for the following years. Furthermore, Samsung has plenty of competition in the storage market that will not want to fall behind when it comes to overall storage speeds and energy efficiency. Not to mention that Samsung has been known to combine V-NAND technology and NVMe standards into a single storage package: it’s called Samsung 950 PRO, an M.2 SSD that features sequential read speeds of up to 2.5GB/s and write speeds of up to 1.5GB/s. It might be only a matter of time before this type of technology is miniaturized for smartphones that will have increasingly higher storage needs and speed requirements.

Monday, August 22, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] Vesper Shutting Down Jason Snell (tweet): The app, developed by John Gruber, Brent Simmons, and Dave Wiskus, featured a tasteful interface design. (I used it a lot, especially for recipes.) But it’s hard to compete with Apple’s own Notes app, especially after Apple upgraded it dramatically with iOS 8. The last post to the development blog was in February 2015 when the app was updated to support iPad screen resolutions. Brent Simmons (tweet): We at Q Branch just released the final version of Vesper. It does one crucial thing: it allows you to export your notes and pictures. See the new Export section in the sidebar. Sync will be turned off Aug. 30 at 8pm Pacific. We’ll destroy all the data, and neither we nor anyone else will be able to recover it. Brent Simmons (tweet): The iOS document provider feature — which was introduced after Vesper shipped (it was originally an iOS 6 app) — was just what we needed. It meant we could write the notes and pictures as files in a folder, and then a document provider could upload those files to iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or wherever. Perfect. It works whether you’re syncing or not — it has nothing to do with syncing. And it will continue to work even after sync shuts down. It will continue to work as long as you have the app on your device. […] Belief inside Q Branch: if we had started with a Mac app rather than an iOS app, Vesper would have been much more successful. That wasn’t clear at the time we started, though (Dec. 2012). Nick Heer: All things must come to an end, and all, but it’s heartbreaking to see it happen to a great app like Vesper, especially since this serves as a de facto acknowledgement that a Mac version is never coming as well. Evadne Wu: I still firmly hold the belief that iOS applications are either loss leaders or loss generators, that iOS devices themselves are thick terminals, and that a proper iOS execution strategy must be backed with a useful service either involving real world consequences (i.e. get a ride or get groceries delivered), or a wider cross-platform strategy (i.e. build your document on one platform, revise on another). Stephen Hackett: Props to Q Branch for putting time into a dying app to make it possible to export user data. Too many apps and services don’t get that part right. However, I would argue that apps should have an export feature from the first version. Update (2016-08-24): John Gruber (tweet, Hacker News): iOS 7’s appearance was so different that even an app like Vesper that was designed with many of the same ideals needed a thorough redesign. So we spent the summer of 2013 not building a sync system, but rather building an iOS 7 version of Vesper. […] We suffered an enormous chicken-and-the-egg problem with our decision to keep to a small team and self-fund our efforts through revenue from the app itself. A notes app is only of interest to many people if it’s available both on their desktop and mobile device. The number one reason, by a long shot, that people didn’t buy Vesper is because it wasn’t available for the Mac. I get that. It makes total sense. Hell, I even cheat, personally, and run Vesper on my Mac in the iOS Simulator. The bottom line is we needed revenue from the first version we built to fund development of the next version, and I think we would have made money from the Mac version. […] Ultimately, what we should have done once we had versions of the app for both Mac and iOS is switch to a subscription model. Make the apps free downloads on all platforms, and charge somewhere around $15/year for sync accounts. That’s where the industry is going. […] With “Vesper” we were thinking things like beautiful, smart, clever, strong. In the end, the name was more apt than we knew, because it also carries heartbreak. John Gruber: From first comp to 1.0. But the one on the right is what we shipped before we ever saw iOS 7. We pay more for the server in some months than we do for Ideal Sans for the year. Colin Cornaby: It’s kind of bizarre the only healthy developer market in the Apple ecosystem right now is the outside-the-Mac-app-store Mac market. David Sparks: For years now I’ve been talking to app developer friends and they are nearly universally wondering how long they will be able to survive in a business where consumers expect to pay less than $5 for an app and expect that app to be maintained for years at a time with no further revenue to the developer. This problem is holding back productivity software on the iPhone and–even more dramatically–on iPad. The iPad Pro hardware is, performance-wise, competitive with a laptop. The difference, however, is that people are simply not willing to pay the same for iPad productivity software as they are willing to pay for Mac productivity software. Ruffin Bailey: I think the most important take home here is that The Marco Effect is greatly overestimated. wiredfractal: At the time I was using Evernote and for me it gets the job done. I was getting tired of seeing good note apps for iOS but not a lot on the Mac. I only got into the app when version 2 came out but I never really used it that much because it doesn’t offer a Mac app. Archagon: Several bloggers have expressed curiosity as to why public interest in the App Store has waned so much. I can’t answer for everyone, but at least within myself, I’ve noticed an increasing and persistant reluctance to try new apps. It’s just that I’ve seen same pattern crop up over and over again. Somebody releases an interesting new app, touting fantastic design and improved productivity. The app gains some (but not overwhelming) traction. The app gets a few updates. The app lingers for a few years. And finally, the app untriumphantly rides off into the sunset, taking entire years of not just developer time, but thousands of users’ ingrained habits with it. The case is clear: most apps — and especially indie apps — cannot be reliably expected to continue operating. Cesare Rocchi: That said, hats off to the dream team for building a well done and well engineered application. The diary that Brent wrote about synching is still a great read, after three years. This is an adventure that every indie should learn from. Sometimes a great design, a great production and a great engineering is not enough. There’s many more factors to take into account[…] John Gruber: Vesper has had more downloads since Sunday (when it went free, and was announced EOL) than it did in 3+ years as a paid app. I think it’s a little more subtle than that. They will pay, but not if there are free options. And most of the time there are. John Gruber: We didn’t omit export from 1.0 because we didn’t think it was important, we omitted it because we found no good solution. Update (2016-08-25): Brent Simmons: Way back in 2002 I wrote Why I Develop for Mac OS X — it’s because of what Joel Spolsky called an “emotional appeal.” […] It’s still true, 14 years later. And it’s why Vesper didn’t start as a web app, and why we’re not converting it now. See also: Under the Radar, Kirk McElhearn, Eddie Smith, Importing to Ulysses, Jonathan Poritsky. Update (2016-08-26): Trello Importer. Update (2016-08-30): Brent Simmons: We will make Vesper for iOS, Vesper for Mac, and Vesper’s JavaScript sync service open source on my personal GitHub account. This code will also be provided as historical artifacts: they’re not intended as active projects. They’re also not intended as examples of how to write apps these days. Update (2016-09-06): Allen Pike: Software is deeply impermanent. While it is often built painstakingly and methodically, it is experienced ephemerally, in the moment. Apps are hard to preserve for study or posterity. Network-backed apps, doubly so. Update (2016-10-07): Adam Rush: Some people are finding success on the iOS App Store — and I congratulate those folks. This includes Omni, where I work. But I do think it’s far more difficult to make a living as an indie iOS developer in 2016 than it was as a Mac developer in 2005. My suspicion is that in the Mac market, 2016 is not very different from 2005, and you can still make money there. But iOS is like a giant curtain laid across the map, so people don’t see the opportunity. Business iOS iOS 6 iOS 7 iOS App Mac Syncing Vesper 1 Comment 1 Comment pxQuim August 24, 2016 6:15 AM In fact, I reject ANY database-line application that does not allow me to get my own data back, in a format that can be processed further (which means that a PDF printout does not qualify). Therefore, I would NEVER have considered Vesper for any serious note-taking. This is why I refused to upgrade into Day One 2.0 when it launched: - With version 1.0 I could dive into the Dropbox sync folder and retrieve nicely-formatted XML files which included all the metadata. For example, I considered adapting the static site generator Pelican to publish Day One entries. - With version 2.0 I was forced to use an opaque sync service, and all export options were crippled. HTML and TXT export options did not include all the metadata collected by Day One. Day One has since added a JSON export option that probably solves my issues. However, FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) remains: I expect that the proprietary sync option will eventually become a paid subscription. And these subscriptions seem to come at prohibitive price points: these €5/month subscriptions add up really fast. Stay up-to-date by subscribing to the Comments RSS Feed for this post.

Written by: Kat McKerrow 08/22/16 - 3:28 PM EDT Tickers in this article: AAPL FIT UA GRMN Apple just made a move that could point to the long-term future of the largest company in the world. Although Apple is one of the world's best-known brands, a lot of what happens at the company occurs under the radar. This helps make Apple's tradition of "grand announcements" all that much grander and its new products and innovations that much more exciting.

Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. See how Cramer rates the stock here. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells AAPL? Learn more now. Of course, there's also a downside to this: Apple has a highly cyclical business, and its stock price is dependent on new gizmos and gadgets for quick, yet sky-high gains. Remember that Steve Jobs' introduction of the iPhone sent the stock rocketing upward by an astronomical 21,000% in just a few short years? This is the stuff that makes millionaires, for sure. But in between these crazy-high bursts, the stock can languish on scant news. Today, tech-focused magazine Fast Company received confirmation from Apple that the company has quietly made a purchase that may point to the direction of some of Apple's future products. Earlier this year, Apple purchased a health technology company named Gliimpse. Based in Silicon Valley, Gliimpse is a startup whose goal is to create an online database of "personalized and shareable medical records" for every American. That means a digital archive of medical information -- from glucose numbers to immunization records. The information would be available to both patients and their doctors. 1 2 next  last »

With the Apple Watch being the only device that users physically wear on their body, it seemed only logical that it include a quick and easy component that would notify the necessary parties should a user find him- or herself in dangerous circumstances. When the Apple Watch undergoes a major software upgrade (otherwise known as WatchOS 3) this fall, it will incorporate this new safety feature: SOS. How it works is simple: If a user is in a critical situation—say, they encounter a threatening individual while walking down the street late at night or get hurt at home and cannot reach their phone—they can contact help by pressing a button on the side of their watch. That will trigger emergency measures: 1. It will contact local emergency services based on their current location. Thanks to its GPS-tracking device, the watch will determine which services will best assist you: If you're in the U.S., it will call 911; if you're international, it will determine the contact information accordingly. 2. It will notify your emergency contacts as soon as the call is complete. Because Apple developers wanted this information to be as up-to-date and accurate as possible, you'll need to indicate who among your contacts should be notified in case of emergency after downloading the update. 3. It will display all your medical information on the watch screen. Your age, allergies, existing medical conditions, and more will all appear directly on the screen—immediately answering any questions emergency medical technicians might have. Pinterest Facebook Once a call is complete, your emergency contacts will receive an iMessage notification. The functionality is similar to Life Alert (you know, the "I've fallen and I can't get up" product) but with a more modern presentation. But there is still going to be one thing that could make the update less useful: For SOS to work, your watch must either be connected to a Wi-Fi network or paired with Bluetooth on your iPhone. Though Apple does not have an exact WatchOS 3 release date yet (and, subsequently, no release date for SOS), users can expect it to debut sometime this fall.

The Rosetta Stone meets machine learning.' Earlier this year Apple revealed it wants to encourage millions of iPhone owners to register as organ donors through a software update that will add an easy sign-up button to the health information app that comes installed on every smartphone the company makes. CEO Tim Cook says he hopes the new software, set for limited release this month, will help ease a critical and longstanding donor shortage.  He said the problem hit home when his friend and former boss, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, endured an 'excruciating' wait for a liver transplant in 2009. Apple's Tim Cook, left, and Steve Jobs, right, during a meeting at Apple in Cupertino, Calif. Apple wants to encourage millions of iPhone owners to register as organ donors through a software update. 'Watching and seeing him every day, waiting and not knowing — it stuck with me and left an impression that I'll never forget,' Cook told The Associated Press. Cook was so concerned that he offered to donate part of his own liver, although Jobs refused. Jobs died of complications from pancreatic cancer in 2011, two years after receiving a liver transplant in Tennessee that was credited with extending his life. He enrolled in that state's registry after doctors advised him the lengthy waiting list in California meant he wouldn't live long enough to get one in his home state.  WHAT IS APPLE'S RESEARCHKIT? Apple’s ResearchKit an open-source software tool designed to give scientists a new way to gather information on patients by using their iPhones, was unveiled last year. Several top research institutions have developed applications to work on the ResearchKit platform, including those pursuing clinical studies on asthma, breast cancer, heart disease, diabetes and Parkinson's disease. They include Stanford University School of Medicine and Weill Cornell Medical College. The format will allow users to decide if they want to participate in a study and decide how their data is to be shared with researchers. The ResearchKit platform is designed to work hand in hand with Apple's HealthKit software, which allows iPhones to work with health and fitness apps that gather information on weight, blood pressure, glucose levels and asthma inhaler use. The ResearchKit also allows researchers access to accelerometer, microphone, gyroscope and GPS sensors in the iPhone to gain insight into a patient's gait, motor impairment, fitness, speech and memory. The software is also designed to help researchers build more diverse study populations, which traditionally have been limited by physical proximity to large academic medical centers. Researchers use Apple's ResearchKit tools to create an app. An iPhone user who wants to participate downloads that app and fills out a questionnaire to determine eligibility and establish a base line for further comparisons.  Users will also learn more about the study so they can give consent. The app will tell accepted participants what to do. In the Parkinson's study, subjects will be asked to tap on the screen, speak into the microphone and walk several steps to gauge progression of the disease. Some research apps will be able to tap data from other apps, such as those for fitness trackers. Apple says participants will be able to decide whether to allow that. The company doesn't see any of that data.       Share or comment on this article e-mail 10 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Tidal surge filmed on Sunaoshi River in Tagajo, Japan The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File) VIEW PHOTO GALLERY6 photos AA (WENN) —  Sept. 30 is a day Barbra Streisand has marked in her calendar -- because that's when Apple know-it-all Siri will finally pronounce her name right. The singer reveals she recently approached Apple boss Tim Cook and asked him to make sure the company's all-knowing voice helper got her name right. "She pronounces my name wrong -- it's Streisand with a soft 's,' like sand on the beach," the singer and actress tells NPR. "I've been saying this for my whole career. "So what did I do? I called the head of Apple, Tim Cook, and he delightfully agreed to have Siri change the pronunciation of my name, finally, with the next update on Sept. 30. So, let's see if that happens, because I would be thrilled." In the new interview, the diva also promotes her new album, "ENCORE: Movie Partners Sing Broadway," which features duets with Hugh Jackman, Jamie Foxx, Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin, and Antonio Banderas, among others. Streisand admits she really enjoyed singing "Climb Every Mountain" with Foxx, explaining, "A great song for me is one I can act, that I can go into character for ... (With 'Climb Every Mountain') I was trying to find a way into something that was very well known and trying to find a new way into the lyric." And she faced a challenge performing "Anything You Can Do" from the musical "Annie, Get Your Gun" with "Ghostbusters" star Melissa McCarthy, revealing, "She said, 'Barbra, I can't sing!' I said, 'We'll make you sing.' We kind of adapted the song to her and me and we got it the way I think is right." The odd couple got along famously in the studio and the song ends with McCarthy asking, "Can I call you Babs now?" to which her new pal jokes, "No, too soon!" The new album is released on Aug. 26. close News In Pictures Photos: Ski resorts show off their snow ahead of big winter storms this weekend 100-pound sturgeon rescued at Ballard Locks Beloved Seattle cafe closing its doors after more than a century of business Crash shuts down several lanes of I-5 in North Seattle Trending 1   Gig Harbor community mourns the death of 20-year-old 2   Police: Seattle mom caught man raping her daughter on camera 3   Winter Storm Warnings in effect for Cascades as twin Thanksgiving storms approach 4   Schlitterbahn closing Verrückt after young boy killed on Kansas waterslide 5   Crash shuts down several lanes of I-5 in North Seattle DON'T MISS OUT Stay Connected with KOMO Like Follow © 2016 Sinclair Broadcast Group TermsPrivacyFCC InfoEEO LOADING ShareTweet × Trending 1 Gig Harbor community mourns the death of 20-year-old 2 Police: Seattle mom caught man raping her daughter on camera 3 Winter Storm Warnings in effect for Cascades as twin Thanksgiving storms approach 4 Schlitterbahn closing Verrückt after young boy killed on Kansas waterslide 5 Crash shuts down several lanes of I-5 in North Seattle 6 Local medic quits job to help injured protesters on front lines of Dakota Access pipeline 7 Rare thunderstorm asthma kills 4 people in Australian city 8 Winter Storm Watches, High Wind Watches hoisted as stormy pattern commences 9 Bellevue's Snowflake Lane to get extra police, barricades 10 Man flashes laser at King Co.

Skip to main content Toggle navigation Provider Payer Pharma Consumer Investor Search form Search Apple has acquired Gliimpse, a patient-facing health data aggregator By Jonah Comstock August 22, 2016 Share Apple acquired a health data-focused startup called Gliimpse earlier this year, according to a new report from Fast Company confirmed by the company. The amount of the acquisition was undisclosed. Inspired by founder Anil Sethi's experiences with his sister's cancer, Gliimpse has a mission to collect the "bread crumbs of health data" consumers create and bring them all together in one platform. By moving that process into the hands of patients, the company argues on its website, it can tackle problems that exist in promoting interoperability on the back-end. "Thankfully, patients and individuals—like you and me—will help solve these two problems US healthcare faces: data-access and data-sharing," the company writes on its site. "How? There are no HIPAA violations when data flows from our health portals to patients. When patients control the data, the problems disappear." The main innovation of the product is an AI engine that reads medical records (with patients' permission, accessing them via the patient portal) and breaks down and codes them into a standardized and readable language. Ever since Apple launched its HealthKit framework in mid-2014, the company has seen enabling health data sharing as its entry point into healthcare, and Gliimpse fits right into those plans. Apple also has a history of working with EHRs, most notably Epic, to integrate HealthKit data. Gliimpse's code could help Apple products to more easily interact with hospital systems, or it could bolster safety and security for the company, as those are also major selling points of Gliimpse. The company didn't offer details into the reasons for the acquisition.  "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans," Apple said in a statement to Fast Company.  As Fast Company pointed out when it broke the news, Gliimpse is also focused on the chronic condition patient as its customer, so this could signal a move in that direction for Apple, especially considering Apple's recent hire of pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Rajiv B. Kumar, who worked with HealthKit for diabetes patients. The acquisition could also be related to rumors of a new health device from Apple. Gliimpse was largely self-funded, with only a $1 million seed round since the company launched in 2013.  Tags: Apple, Glimpse, mobile health mergers and acquisitions, PHR, data sharing, data aggregation Share View all comments 0 Top Story AMA approves list of guiding principles for digital health tools Editor's Pick NIH awards $120M to Scripps, others, to enroll 350K participants in Precision Medicine Initiative via mobile apps Pokémon Go might be the fastest-growing unintentional health app Pfizer, Brigham and Women's test remote monitoring app for arthritis in clinical trial Google DeepMind announces research project with NHS to detect eye diseases Insulin pump maker Insulet launches educational tablet app for kids, plans connected app Florida Blue parent Guidewell, Sharecare to launch JV to build apps for payers More Stories Cogito raises $15M for AI software to improve customer service phone interactions CMS releases API to help providers understand, choose MACRA measures Google DeepMind, NHS announce new agreement to address data sharing concerns Zebra Medical Vision launches Profound for quick, remote medical imaging analysis Rapid Healthcare secures growth capital to expand NICU infant feeding app Ascensia gets FDA clearance for Contour Next One connected glucometer ContextMedia: Health acquires AccentHealth to expand patient education platform Novartis, Google backtrack plans to test smart contact lens in 2016 MobiHealthNews The latest news in digital health delivered daily to your inbox.

This bolsters claims of a new health-focused wearable product category from Apple, but it remains to be seen what will come of it.  ( Gliimpse ) Advertisement Apple is diving deeper into health technology, as it just came to light that it acquired health and wellness startup Gliimpse, which collects medical information and turns it into comprehensible, easy-to-read patient profiles. It's not unusual that this acquisition went under the radar until now, as Apple has a habit of gobbling up smaller companies all the time without making a big fuss or a public announcement about it. That is also the case with the Gliimpse acquisition, as Apple has made no mention of it in the past. Nevertheless, Fast Company discovered that Apple had acquired Gliimpse and got confirmation from Apple that the deal occurred earlier this year. For those unfamiliar with Gliimpse, the startup set out to transform that hard-to-interpret medical data into easy-to-read profiles, acting as a personal health platform that collects fitness and health-related bits of data to allow users to keep track of their health data in a format that they understand. "We've built a magical machine. It takes incomprehensible electronic medical records and turns them into understandable, standardized, coded elements (Loinc, RxNorm, CPT, ICD and Snomed), and terminology that both humans and machines can easily understand and use," reads the description on Gliimpse's website. Gliimpse basically aims to allow anyone to manage their health records in a simple manner and share the data securely with people they trust. Users can make journal entries on a daily basis, noting their state of mind, levels of pain, lab results and other such information that helps them keep track of various stages. Compiling a journal may help users more easily provide their physician with more details about their health. These aspects set Gliimpse apart from other health upkeep apps such as Apple Health because Gliimpse is also suited for users with more serious ailments like cancer, diabetes and more. Acquiring Gliimpse reiterates Apple's efforts and commitment to make progress in the digital health field, and may also bolster claims that the company is gearing up to launch a new piece of hardware focused on health tracking. The gadget may be a new Apple Watch set to hit the scene next year, or it could be some other wearable device in its own product category, as was rumored earlier this month.

Tech News | 04 Aug 2016 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (47) Kagi Shuts Down After Falling Prey to Fraud by Adam C. Engst The news was as sad as it was unexpected. Kagi, one of the earliest digital commerce companies and long a favorite of many Mac shareware developers, has shut down as of 31 July 2016, just shy of 22 years in business. Kagi’s home page gives a brief explanation of the situation but to find out more, I spoke with Kagi CEO Kee Nethery, whom I’ve known since he was a product manager at Apple in charge of the Mac-based Apple Internet Server line. Here’s the story. Over ten years ago, Kagi was looking to expand its business. In the process, they started handling subscriptions for a company selling a legal consulting service — the idea was that you’d pay a $29 monthly fee and be able to get answers to legal questions. The company was both legit and seemingly successful, and the service was real, but what Kagi missed in their due diligence was that the firm’s sales team used high-pressure sales tactics. As a result, many customers were unhappy, and to avoid further pressure when trying to cancel their subscriptions, they instead disputed the credit card charges, generating what Kee described as “an amazingly large number of chargebacks.” (A brief aside here. When you dispute a credit card charge, the credit card company will usually reverse the charge for you without asking any questions, forcing the merchant to refund your money and charging the merchant an additional fee in the process, $25 in this case. Plus, such chargebacks reflect poorly on the retailer’s reputation with credit card companies. If you’ve been treated badly, disputing a charge may be appropriate, but it’s overkill if you just want a refund from a legitimate merchant who would be more than happy to give you your money back.) All those chargebacks had two adverse effects on Kagi. First, both Visa and MasterCard put Kagi on a “watchlist,” which is usually followed by dropping the company as a customer. That would have been the end of Kagi. Kee was proud of the fact that Kagi was able to work its way back from the brink and be reinstated as a customer in good standing. He told me that a person who worked at Visa mentioned to him that he’d never seen anyone get off the watchlist before. The second problem was more serious. The legal consulting company had quickly become Kagi’s largest client, to the point where it was averaging about 20,000 transactions per month. The percentage of chargebacks was high, but not initially beyond the pale. Plus, at that point in its history, Kagi was still processing chargebacks manually because there had been so few up to that point, and that manual processing obscured the severity of the problem. After four months of refining the legal consulting company’s process to set customer expectations appropriately and improving the chargeback process, however, Kagi realized that the problems weren’t going to go away and dropped the company as a client. The legal consulting company then reneged on its responsibility to repay Kagi for both the $25 chargebacks and the $29 subscriptions, leaving Kagi with a massive debt. That’s an unacceptable way to run a business, to say the least, but when Kagi eventually took the matter to arbitration and won, the settlement didn’t even pay for Kagi’s legal fees. Kagi could have shut down then and there but instead tried to work off the debt. For the last decade, they’ve been doing just that, working off $600,000 of the overall amount. Unfortunately, that required borrowing against the money they had to pay out every month to suppliers — the developers who sold their products through Kagi. The technique worked well as long as the monthly payout was larger than the debt, but in the last few months, the monthly payout has slowly dipped below the necessary threshold. Rather than string developers along, Kagi decided to cease operations entirely. (As another aside, we’ve seen Take Control book sales dropping over the last six months as well. I don’t know if the unsettling tumult in national and global politics is responsible, or if there’s some other explanation, but it is concerning. Perhaps things will recover after the U.S. presidential election and once there’s a path forward for Brexit.) You’ve undoubtedly heard of companies filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, part of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which allows companies to avoid paying creditors all that they’re owed while continuing to operate. There’s also Chapter 7 bankruptcy, under which the company goes out of business and its assets are liquidated to pay creditors. Chapter 11 wouldn’t work for Kagi, because what developer would continue to work with a company that couldn’t guarantee to pay on time? Even Chapter 7, while simpler, still involves courts and high legal fees. Kagi is instead using a state-based option, called ABC, or Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors. It’s most common in California, where Kagi is located, but many other U.S. states have similar statutes. The advantage of ABC is that the costs are significantly lower, which means more money for creditors. Under ABC, an independent company takes over, liquidates all assets, and manages the payout of all the leftover money. Right now, Kagi owes money for June and July to about 2000 clients, of whom fewer than 1000 were active sellers. Unfortunately for those companies, between the time necessary to work through the ABC and the fact that credit card companies are holding onto a lot of Kagi’s money to cover refunds and chargebacks, it will probably be six months before it’s known how many cents on the dollar each client will receive after taxes are paid. In the meantime, Kagi is busy tearing down its racks of servers and shredding the hard drives that contain customer and credit card data. Kee has set up an entirely separate Web site and email system to handle support email, which mostly involves sending developers dumps of their license codes and customer data. It’s a bad time to be a company that relied on Kagi. Payments for June and July will be both delayed and reduced by an unknown amount. Worse, these companies are scrambling to find a new digital commerce solution, such as Avangate, Comecero, FastSpring, and Paddle. You might wonder why I didn’t include payment processors like PayPal or Stripe in that list. Both are fine choices for certain situations, and they charge lower transaction fees. But there are two big differences between a simple payment processor and a full digital commerce solution such as Kagi and the others provide. First, digital commerce companies offer full-fledged shopping carts with options for bundles, coupons, subscriptions, order management, refunds, and more. That used to be worth a great deal, but there are now numerous independent Web apps that provide similar features for systems like WordPress, not to mention standalone platforms like Squarespace that offer their own e-commerce capabilities. These apps and platforms all work with systems like PayPal and Stripe. Second and more important, anyone who sells to customers in other countries has to be aware of the tax implications of doing so. When a company sells to any country in the European Union, along with Canada, Japan, Norway, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, and the United States, it may need to pay taxes in that country. The details vary widely, and in some cases (like Canada, Japan, and South Africa), thresholds apply, so a handful of sales won’t matter, but most companies selling to the EU will have to collect and remit value-added tax (VAT). The full-service digital commerce companies act as the “merchant of record,” which means that end users are actually buying from them, not the company selling the product, and because of that, they handle all tax collection and remittance. That’s hugely helpful for any business in the United States, where sales tax rates vary by state, county, and sometimes even city (but are required only in states where you have a “nexus”). It’s even more important when dealing with international tax authorities — Kee told me that paying Kagi’s VAT taxes to the EU was complex and required personal attention every financial quarter. Simple payment processors like PayPal and Stripe don’t automatically do anything related to taxes because the company selling the product is the merchant of record. With extra configuration and integration with external services like Taxamo and Avalara, carts that work with PayPal and Stripe can be enhanced to identify the location of each customer in real time, and to calculate and collect the appropriate tax. It’s then up to the company to register for, file, and remit taxes to U.S. states, the EU, and other countries. (Avalara has a service that claims to handle VAT entirely, but I haven’t evaluated whether or not it’s a complete solution or if the pricing is reasonable.) Put bluntly, I cannot imagine most software developers having the time or expertise to tackle the task of managing taxes. It’s the primary reason we’ve long sold Take Control books and TidBITS memberships through eSellerate (parent company Digital River has eSellerate in maintenance mode, which is why I didn’t include it in the list above). It’s worth giving up a few percent of every sale to have Digital River’s tax team handle everything for us. My strong suspicion is that the vast majority of small companies relying on PayPal and Stripe are just ignoring their international tax responsibilities and hoping they’re small enough to fly under the radar. I have no idea what the liabilities of doing that might be. Regardless of what companies who previously relied on Kagi end up doing, it’s sad to see the end of such an important player in the history of the Mac, and especially depressing to learn that the reason was an unsuccessful attempt to recover from a situation involving fraud.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Laine   2016-08-04 14:50 I've trusted Kagi for a long time, and would be willing to help. How many donations of, say, 10 bucks would be significant? Flash Sheridan  2016-08-05 12:57 +1. Kagi and Kee were good friends in the bygone days of its Newton client, which mainly worked via AOL, written by the late Hardy Macia. artMonster  2016-08-04 14:56 I'd rather take my chances with a jury of my peers than forced "arbitration". They'd have most likely come out ahead if that had been an option. Adam Engst   2016-08-04 15:14 I have no sense of whether a jury trial would be more or less expensive than a trial before a judge, but my understanding is that binding arbitration is believed to be a lot cheaper in terms of legal fees. Lamont Dakota  2016-08-04 16:53 Artmonster, _forced_ arbitration means exactly what it says. *Nobody* with a choice would "choose" _forced_ arbitration. In order to do business, Kagi, for some legal reason, had to sign a contract that stated that, if any legal problem arose, it would go *not* to trial, but to arbitration. That's pretty much the death-knell for any organization with a legal division smaller than, say, Apple's. Mandatory arbitration is Big Business's ordinary union-killer. VaughnSC  2016-08-23 15:24 They received less than the legal fees incurred which "arbitration supposedly reduces" in the first place. If Kagi didn't get near the amount they claimed at arbitration, how can Kee sensibly say Kagi prevailed? Adam Engst   2016-08-23 15:32 The other side was forced to pay money to Kagi, so Kagi "won" in arbitration. But that doesn't mean that Kagi recouped what it wanted, or even as much as was still required for legal fees surrounding the arbitration, cheaper though it may have been than a full lawsuit. Nicholas Ptacek  2016-08-04 15:27 For any developers looking for an alternate e-commerce platform as as result of the Kagi shut down, we've had a great experience with FastSpring and DevMate. FastSpring handles the actual sales, while DevMate provides licensing and activation options along with analytics, crash reports, and user feedback. The two systems already work seamlessly together providing a great end-user experience, and can handle software sold as a one-time purchase as well as subscription-based sales models. Integrating DevMate's framework into our existing project was really easy, and they have great documentation and example projects available for reference. You can get everything up and running in less than an hour, and I honestly feel that they are the best solution for developers distributing software outside of the Mac App Store. After trying out different e-commerce options we couldn't be more satisfied with the service and support provided by FastSpring and DevMate. Highly recommended! Adam Engst   2016-08-04 15:35 Thanks for sharing your experiences, and I'd encourage others to do the same! Kevin La Rue  2016-08-11 00:29 Macphun uses FastSpring and has for nearly 18 months. Really easy to set up SKUs, promotions, in-cart suggested add-ons, etc. Great account management and support too! +1 on the recommendation. JohnB (SciFiOne)   2016-08-04 16:12 Well done article. I especially like the two asides. Jon Gotow  2016-08-04 18:31 Thanks for the great summary Adam - I'd been wondering what happened behind the scenes. As you may or may not know, I started with Kagi back in 1996, when getting shareware payments still often involved people mailing in checks. I'm really sad to see this happen. Many of us owe a huge thanks to Kee for starting the service - if it weren't for him, I don't think I would have been able to quit my day job and turn St. Clair Software into a full-time business. I like the idea of a GoFundMe campaign (or something similar) to help them cleanly shut down - I'd definitely donate as a thank-you for Kagi's many years of trustworthy service. Paul  2016-08-04 18:47 This is very sad. I just looked through my registrations and found some 50 Kagi items there. Always good service. Peter N Lewis   2016-08-04 21:10 It’s a tragedy for all concerned. As Kagi’s first customer, I whole heartedly agree with Jon, I doubt very much whether I would have been able to spend the last twenty odd years in this business. Before Kagi, I collected piles of US checks and cash and periodically sent to a US bank account. It was tedious and problematic to say the least, didn’t deal with tax issues, and couldn’t process credit cards. I switched to FastSpring six years ago, primarily to get better support for coupons, and they have been very good over the years since then. I feel for the developers caught in this mess, but I'm sure Kee would have done everything possible to avoid this end. A very sad ending to a great company. CS  2016-08-04 22:43 I dunno, I don't feel that Kee did everything possible. I've dealt with businesses before that ended up going under, and they gave a warning a few weeks ahead of time so that I'd be able to get set up with a new company and have a smooth transition. Kagi did not do that. In addition to probably losing two whole months of sales, Kagi's users are stuck with no store, and consequently no income, until a new store can be set up. As an additional insult to injury, we were not even given the opportunity to download our customer databases before they shredded the servers. It's sad that Kagi wasn't able to stay in business anymore, but does that really justify treating their longtime loyal customers this way? The cynical part of me feels that they just wanted to take an extra week of sales—money their vendors will never see—to pay their creditors. Like others here, I placed a lot of trust in Kagi over the years. I'm now wondering whether that trust was misplaced. Lou Forlini  2016-08-08 15:06 I have to agree, at least in part. I got the shutdown message at 2AM basically telling me that we were immediately out of business for everything we aren't selling through the Apple Store, which includes all of our Windows software. None of what is in the article was ever communicated to me as a vendor. Had I known here was a problem this significant with the service I would have switched long ago. Of course, I'm sure like many others we now have to support customers who have paid and, through no fault of their own, we have not and probably never will receive payment for. Further, I have not been advised of this super-secret "entirely separate Web site and email system to handle support email" in order to pull whatever data we have left on their server. Admittedly, we probably have all of it in our own records already since we keep it all as the orders come in. However, it just seems to be another slap in the face to a long-time vendor (since Newton) to read about it here. Adam Engst   2016-08-08 15:58 I don't believe there's anything secret - or even outwardly different - about the new server. It's just that Kagi pulled all the old servers that might contain confidential data. http://www.kagi.com/ remains the URL, and I imagine that whatever support address you've used in the past is still active. Lou Forlini  2016-08-10 19:15 I was able to get in touch with Kagi and they very nicely not only provided a couple of data files that I had missed, but all of them going back to the beginning of time. Of course, we are still going to miss having the service and are working on getting a new payment processor, but I withdraw the complaint I made in the last paragraph of my previous post. Michael Blake  2016-08-05 04:39 Re Take Control Books: I normally have an uncontrolled reaction to buy new books but haven't done that much recently due to, in my view, not many pertinent books coming along. Also, the base price might be viewed slightly high by some, I'm lucky as I get 30% off. Finally, I've heard some say that moving from a version one to version two book should come at a lower price... Mike Adam Engst   2016-08-05 10:40 A few responses: * Obviously, we hope to publish books you'll find pertinent, but it's a tricky thing, given that we basically have to guess at what people will find interesting. We'd love to do a Kickstarter-like approach, but that runs smack into the problem with taxes, since none of the full-service digital commerce companies integrate with IgnitionDeck, which is the main independent crowdfunding solution (and Kickstarter itself doesn't manage tax issues for those who use it). As a result, if we were to try to do a Kickstarter-like campaign, we'd have to run it through an entirely different payment processing system and then handle all the taxes ourselves, which just isn't feasible. * Our base prices haven't changed in over 10 years. We charge $10 for books that are around 100 pages, $15 for books around 150 pages, and $20 for books that are well over 200 pages. There are occasional exceptions (usually to make the book cheaper). What has changed is that Apple, through the App Store, drove prices for software through the floor, and that infected book prices via the iBooks Store. We've played a little with pricing in the iBooks Store, but dropping the price to $0.99 or the like doesn't result in 15 times more sales; it might just double sales. I can also say that our pricing matches pretty well with the amount we need to make on a successful book for it to be worthwhile. If we charged less, we'd likely just make less, which would make even successful books not worth the effort. * When we release a new edition of a book, we always offer a discount to owners of the previous edition. The amount of the discount varies depending on how much work the new edition was and how valuable we believe readers will find it after reading the previous book, but it's usually at least 25%, often 50%, and frequently even more. With some edition changes, like the jump from PDFpen 7 to PDFpen 8, we give the new edition away to every previous purchaser for free. All that said, TidBITS members and MUG members can always save 30%, as can anyone who buys three or more books in an order, so I sincerely hope that price is not an issue. Dennis B. Swaney  2016-08-09 12:44 Re: the iBookStore. I found that the books prices there are higher than elsewhere. I get my books elsewhere now. Also, since Apple has made it impossible to sync non-Apple sourced ePubs to iBooks on my iDevices via iTunes (fortunately they still allow non-Apple PDFs like Take Control), I'm phasing out iBooks and will move to another ePub & PDF reader. Michael Blake  2016-08-06 04:17 Thanks for that Adam, I can appreciate the issues. I love to read your books and hope others do too. The app store pricing has done much damage to our overall industry and that is becoming a huge challenge to some of us. I hope to see many more offerings in the future and will be one of the first in line to read them - full price or whatever. Mike B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2016-08-09 07:18 I agree. Developers have paid a high price for their dependence on the App Store, particularly in terms of customer satisfaction. Supposedly they get added visibility, but what is that visibility worth competing with hundreds of thousands of titles? The App Store limitations are killing shareware and complicating the whole business of selling software. For those developers who patiently maintain both an App Store and an independent version of their apps, it means supporting dueling versions and dealing with customer confusion over the same. In the meantime, a common refrain among customers on MacUpdate is, "no try, no buy." Which is a good policy given the proliferation of crapware out there. Just because an app is available in the App Store, doesn't mean it's any good. The same goes for non-App Store software as well, of course. Given Apple's current popularity, perhaps the number of old timers like me who remember the "good old days" of shareware are aging out. No doubt many younger users have never even heard of shareware. Just like the passing of Kagi, that too is sad. Dan Daranciang  2016-08-06 11:53 Articles like this make me extraordinarily pleased to be able to support TidBITS, one of the last OG Mac news sites. Michael Paine  2016-08-08 03:53 Has the Mac App Store influenced these developments? Adam Engst   2016-08-08 09:49 I suspect that the Mac App Store didn't help Kagi, but from what I can tell, it wasn't really a factor. Raluca Marmureanu  2016-08-08 11:48 Adam, many thanks for mentioning Avangate as one of the full digital commerce solutions that is a fit alternative to all those that need some help while looking for a replacement. As a full disclosure, I am part of the Avangate team. We’re sorry to see Kagi close its doors especially knowing that they were a true pillar of growth for many vendors in the times of shareware / lifetime licenses. While those were the days, some of their competitors transitioned to newer models just like their clients and are thriving with their capabilities as more than payment providers with APIs for SaaS, online services and software on premise with renewals. Just as you mentioned, Avangate is also the merchant of record, eliminating all issues related to local sales taxation, regulations, currency exchange and other account services. Raluca Marmureanu  2016-08-08 11:49 Therefore, if you sell software, SaaS or any other digital goods, Avangate is a full service provider, solving the complexity of online commerce, subscription billing, distribution channels and global payments, while offering you complete control over the shopping experience along with support to optimize the cart to boost conversion rates. As the merchant of record, we take full responsibility for managing processors relationships and regulations, work closely with them as partners, hence Risk department and processes are an important function in assessing type of vendors we work with and managing anti-fraud, customer support and chargebacks reduction. For anyone interested in learning more, I advise you to check out the customer testimonials http://www.avangate.com/customers/ and also the reviews on G2Crowd https://www.g2crowd.com/products/avangate/reviews Good luck! Thomas Tempelmann  2016-08-08 14:35 Nice to see some other oldsters here, hi Flash! Kagi was my first online payment processor, around the turn of the century. I earned a nice amount of money back then, and it would have been difficult without Kagi. Sadly, for me, Kagi did not manage to keep their software competitive for a long time in this new millenium, and eventually I had a peek at FastSpring (which, supposedly, was created by people leaving eSellerate after that went down the hill), where things worked much more smoothly. Soon after that, Kagi came out with a new design (looked like a rewrite), but then it was too late to go back - I was now happy with FS. I always felt a little bad for that. It appears to me Kagi had a long and slow decline, losing customers constantly. When asking for a payment processor, people recommended FS often and hardly ever Kagi - it got pretty much forgotten. Regardless, Kee kept giving advice on the macsb mailing list, while never trying to push his own service. Oops, out of space Adam Engst   2016-08-08 17:22 FastSpring wasn't primarily refugees from eSellerate, I don't believe, since one of the founders was Jason Foodman, who wasn't from eSellerate. He's now head of Global Delight. What I've observed is that digital commerce companies fall into generations. Kagi was a first-generation company, as was eSellerate. There were a few others. Digital River bought a number of those early companies, including eSellerate. FastSpring and Avangate seem to me to be second-generation companies, or at least to have evolved more successfully. Paddle and now Comecero strike me as third-generation companies. I'm not implying any quality differences here - it's just that a digital commerce company builds systems at a particular point in time, and it can be very hard to update those as times change. Often the same people who started one company come back into the field to start another, once the conditions are different. Trevor Black  2016-08-09 13:34 Thanks for the shout out, Adam, and a great article offering more details of how Kagi ended up where it did. Full disclosure: I am a Co-Founder of Comecero, a next gen API based commerce and payments solution. New kids on the block related to our platform but built by a team who has been involved in online commerce for over 20 years. (We are among those who sold companies to Digital River.) We are now helping online sellers, including those who were using Kagi, get set up to sell around the world. Using modern architecture and design methodologies we encourage anyone interested to kick our tires. Join others by doing an A/B test to increase your sales while maintaining control. Turnkey or build to suit options sitting on a restful API give you the flexibility others don't. Sign up or live chat with us - https://comecero.com Trevor Black  2016-08-10 18:19 Incidentally, we are holding meet and greet events in California in the next two weeks (San Diego Aug 16th, LA Aug 18th, San Francisco Aug 22nd) if anyone is interested, if so contact us for details. Matt Butch  2016-08-08 17:52 Sad to see Kagi go down. I know I've bought a lot of software that used them. I use eSellerate for my software, but as you said, development has longed since ceased. On one page in their control panel, they have wording like "On April 26, 2011, we've temporarily enabled blah blah". That's still up, and nothing's changed in 5 years. I think its time I switched, so thanks for the list to investigate. Ken  2016-08-08 21:51 It is a shame, I used Kagi both as a customer and a supplier and they worked very well. I don't think there is a problem in supplying to countries with strict VAT policies it is more a problem for the customer. In scanadnavian countries, my understanding is they are generally required to declare that they have imported goods and pay the tax unless it has already been paid. Therefore the advantage of using Kagi was that it provides an easy way for the customers to pay the tax. Lynn Fredricks  2016-08-09 11:56 The charge-back is one of those credit card issues that should be addressed by way of a massive lawsuit such as the credit card companies have experienced before. There is nothing stopping any purchaser from initiating a charge back, instead of requesting a return. When that happens, processors will hit the merchant with a $25-$30 fee per transaction - no matter how it is resolved. Even if the customer changes their mind later, the merchant is still on the hook for that cost. Consider the impact of that if you are selling a product under, say, $50, like so many smaller software vendors do. Marc Heusser  2016-08-09 12:04 It is very sad to see Kagi go down - they deserved better than that. I would certainly help Kee if necessary. I trust he has done everything he could. I have bought my first license 1994 from their first customer Peter Lewis (https://www.stairways.com/main/history) and my last a few weeks ago. I wish them all the best - and hope they will recover personally. And that all the shareware developers may find a good way out as well. In my experience FastSpring and Apple are the preferred replacements. Michael Finney  2016-08-09 13:16 I'm especially sad because I had just bought a license to Graphic Converter 10 through Kagi, and it looks like Lemkesoft will not get the full payment. Thorsten Lemke makes great software, and on top of that is incredibly competent and responsive as a developer. I hate to see him get hurt! Michael Bernstein  2016-08-09 17:24 We had used Kagi for many years, and I strongly feel this could have been handled far better. It took a week of setting aside everything else to get our software moved over to FastSpring and fix all of the links to our Kagi store that are under our control. Plenty of links are not under our control. Kagi could have given us some advance notice, could have left our Kagi store page up instead of a sudden 404, could have provided a 404 page that didn't leave us looking bad to our customers (since we were telling our customers to go there), and could have let us put a redirect (or explanatory text with a new link) on our Kagi store page once we had somewhere new to steer people. Hank Roberts  2016-08-09 19:15 > a legal consulting service Who? Might I guess it's the predatory legal services company that's been calling my elderly neighbor trying to sell their services? A name couldn't hurt. Michael Bernstein  2016-08-11 23:57 As a Kagi supplier, our contract with Kagi gave them the right to sell our software as long as they then sent us the appropriate amount of money. Once Kagi knew they weren't going to do that, they no longer had the right to sell our software. I don't see how sales in those final weeks were legal. Mike McGee  2016-08-10 15:43 I've been a developer who used Kagi since the 90's. (Yes, I'm old.) I have a shareware application that is actually still active and was still getting monthly checks from Kagi. I was more saddened than anything to hear about Kagi's demise, especially due to fraud that they couldn't recover from. Has there ever been a more fitting scenario to where developers could have rallied around to save Kagi a la George Bailey in It's a Wonderful Life? I would have been more than happy to chip in financially if it could have saved Kagi. I wish I was given the opportunity, and Kagi will be missed. B Hunter  2016-08-14 21:28 Do not be fooled into thinking you have to collect and then pay to the EU the EU/VAT tax for EU/GB customers if you have no business locations in the EU itself. We contacted the Australian Tax Office and told them the situation (a Kagi-like payment operator was insisting they collect the payments), and they said there is no tax treaty that allows this and that no Australian business has to collect foreign taxes for those countries. In the US maybe it would be like California wanting you to collect taxes for them when you are an IL based only company. Anyway I would definitely contact you local tax office to clarify for your situation. Kristofer Szymanski  2016-08-15 15:47 Kee Nethery wrote to me that "Kagi ran out of money" and that "he is sorry". What do you mean "ran out of money”, Kee Nethery? What about all the money you received during June and July? Where's MY money? What have you spent MY money on? Can you please answer this question? The simple fact is that Kee Nethery owns me money, and if he will not pay me, he is a criminal that was selling other people's software for two months just to steal the money. ibor  2016-08-18 20:33 I would like to know why did Kagi continue collecting others money for two months_after_ they figured they are bankrupt (i.e. in early June)? They are owing us now more than 200K USD. VaughnSC  2016-08-23 16:00 Im still confused with this 'fraud story': Kagi always, to my knowledge, pays sales roughly a month after the fact and deducts returns and chargebacks first. Returns can only happen in a 30 day window, chargebacks 60-to-90. Kagi fumbled badly if they paid the client and dropped them with a tsunami of chargebacks in the queue. The sheer amounts suggest the 'supplier' achieved nearly 100% chargebacks, certainly 'beyond the pale', and could suggest bad faith by asking customers to chargeback out of spite. Average 20,000 transactions, $29+$25 makes for almost $1MM the worst case first month and another $500K for the next two. Frankly Kee had years to reincorporate company and reorganize the debt. Which reminds me, do I remember Kagi hiking the chargeback fee? That may have been the deal they cut with V/MC over the blacklist. Thatand, and/or agreeing (under duress) to pay them 100 cents on the dollar for the 'debt'. I'm now thinking Kee was too nice and bent over too far! Patrick  2016-09-01 14:24 I've been using Kagi for years and was shocked to get the email saying they suddenly went out of business, owing me 2 months worth of sales. I'm glad I'm just a one-man show and didn't have to pay employees or I'd be out of business as well. I'm guessing I'll be lucky to get anything at all from the ABC handling Kagi's creditors and I guess it will be 6 months before I do. Not going to hold my breath. I'm just glad I never closed my account with Share-It. I just had to update my products and change my sales links, which I was able to do almost overnight. I can't imagine what a nightmare this must have been for larger companies with lots of employees and that may not be as nimble. So does the state of California oversee the ABC and ensure that we get a fair payout? Or are we at the mercy of that company's idea of who gets what? I've not heard a peep from them so far. Patrick  2016-09-01 20:03 Right after I posted this comment I heard from the ABC. Have to send them a claim form. That's encouraging at least!  Search   Unless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2016 Adam C. Engst TidBITS is copyright © 2016 TidBITS Publishing Inc.

Apple's next Apple Watch will still have to be used alongside an Apple iPhone because a desired feature—built-in LTE cellular service—is not delivering adequate battery life in the smartwatch in testing. As a result, users desiring LTE service will have to wait for a later version of the Apple Watch. Mobile carriers have been urging Apple to update the Apple Watch so it can work with LTE on its own, without an iPhone, for some time. LTE service would allow the device to access sports score alerts, email and mapping information for users without having to connect with an iPhone. Intel officials are ready to bring silicon photonics—in development for 16 years—to market. At the Intel Developer Forum last week, Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the company's Data Center Group, announced that the chip maker has begun shipping silicon photonics modules, the first products in an expected portfolio that officials have said will help meet the growing demand from cloud service providers for more network bandwidth, better scalability and faster connectivity. Silicon photonics refers to the use of pulses of light rather than electrical signals over copper wires to move large amounts of data at high speeds and over long distances. The first silicon photonics-based components will enable the transfer of data at 100 gigabits per second over distances of 2km or more, and will come in a pluggable model and an embedded form factor. Twitter, which continues to struggle to find a balance between supporting free speech and empowering bullies and harassment, is planning to introduce new features that will give users control over what they see and whom they interact with, the company announced Aug. 18. In "the coming days," Twitter plans to extend Notifications and a Quality Filter to all users—features that currently are only available to "verified" account holders, which are designated with a blue checkmark icon. As of Aug. 18, users have the ability to limit notifications to only people they follow on mobile and Twitter.com. Users can tap the Settings icon and then select Notifications. CNN will now use unmanned aerial drones to help it gather news in a wide range of situations as part of the company's newly created CNN Aerial Imagery and Reporting unit. The news broadcasting company unveiled the CNN AIR efforts in an Aug. 18 announcement that also revealed that CNN has hired two full-time drone operators to fly the devices. "For the first time in the company's history, CNN will have a designated unmanned aircraft systems unit … to fully integrate aerial imagery and reporting across all CNN networks and platforms, along with Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner entities," the company said in a statement. CNN has been working with the Federal Aviation Administration since 2015 on research to safely use drones for newsgathering, according to the company.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Add a Middle Click to Your Mac’s Trackpad On basically every mouse, the scroll wheel can be clicked to perform what’s called a “middle click”, and it’s incredibly useful while browsing the web. You can middle-click any link to open it in the background, or middle-click any tab to close it. It’s one of those things that are hard to live without once you discover them. Apple, however, doesn’t offer this feature on their trackpad. The only alternative offered is holding the Command key while clicking. If you’re used to browsing with middle clicks, that makes Apple’s otherwise amazing trackpad kind of a bummer to use. Well, no more! Here’s how to get middle click working on your Mac trackpad, thanks to a little third-party app called MiddleClick. Step One: Download And Install MiddleClick First, download MiddleClick from rougue41.com. This free application comes inside a ZIP file, which you can unzip on a Mac just by double-clicking it. The application will appear in your downloads folder. Drag the application to your Applications folder, as you would to install any other application. Once you do that, feel free to fire it up. You’ll see a simple icon in your menu bar. There isn’t much in the way of options, but there doesn’t need to be. Tapping the trackpad with three fingers is now universally recognized as a middle click on your Mac. Unless, of course, something else is monopolizing the three finger tap. Step Two: Disable Your Mac’s “Look Up” Gesture If you know how to use your Macbook’s gestures, you might recall that the three finger tap gesture triggers your Mac’s “Look up” feature. MiddleClick can’t work while this gesture is enabled, so we’re going to have to turn that off. Head to System Preferences, then “Trackpad.” Disable the “Look up and data detectors” functionality. There used to be an option to re-map this to a four-finger tap, but that seems to be gone. It’s unfortunate that we can’t use MiddleClick alongside this feature, but being able to open tabs in the background is worth it. Once you uncheck this, you’re ready to start middle-clicking! Tap any link with three fingers and it will open the background. Magical and revolutionary. Step Three: Set MiddeClick to Run at Login If you want MiddleClick to start everytime you boot up your Mac, you can do that. But there’s no option to do so in MiddleClick itself: you need to do it manually from macOS’ settings. Head to System Preferences again, then head to “Users and Groups”. Click the “Login Items” tab, and you’ll see a list of applications that start up when you log in. Click the “+” below this list and you can add MiddleClick to the list. More Advanced Alternatives Maybe MiddleClick isn’t enough for you. Maybe you want to use four-finger taps for middle-click instead, so you can keep using the dictionary function. There are a few alternative applications with more options. First, there’s MagicPrefs, a free application that adds a new panel to your Mac system preferences. From here you can set finger taps and clicks to do just about anything you want, including launching programs or triggering Mac features like Mission Control or Dashboard. Or, if that’s not enough power, there’s also BetterTouchTool ($6.50 and up), an application that lets you customize the powerful gesture controls on OS X. With that tool, you can invent whatever crazy gesture you want for middle clicking, and basically everything else. For most users, these options are overkill, and MiddleClick should work just fine. But if you really want fine-grained control, these apps will give it to you. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (1 REPLY) Got Feedback?

In fact, one piece of trivia that hardcore Seinfeld fans likely already know is that a Mac can be seen in nearly every episode of the show, more often than not in Jerry’s apartment on his desk. With that in mind, some gentle genius decided to put together a virtual tour of Jerry’s Mac, which was typically a Mac SE/30 model. In later years, Jerry was prone to using a PowerBook Duo and Apple’s ill-fated 20th Anniversary Mac. All that said, if you hop on over to Extremelygoodshit and click on the “View Issue Two” link in the middle of the page, you’ll be magically transported to the screen of Jerry’s Mac, running System 7 and all. DON’T MISS: T-Mobile kills data plans and goes all in on unlimited data Pictured below is what the homescreen looks like. Clearly, whoever put this together did their homework as they expertly captured every last detail of what System 7 on the Mac looked like back in the early to mid 90s. Even better, every icon on the screen is clickable and has its own sequence of jokes lurking beneath the surface. For instance, if you double click on the trash icon, you’re presented with this view. And if you yourself have had enough of Trump et. al, you can go ahead and empty the trash. Curious about what type of files are lurking within Seinfeld’s ‘Documents’ folder? Well, there you can take a look at some of his jokes in progress, his grocery list, and even a comical concept draft for Bee Movie. Again, everything is clickable so make sure to explore every document fully. You shan’t be disappointed. We don’t want to spoil it all, but we have to mention that every single folder and file is worth opening up and exploring fully, even Seinfeld’s presumably boring Tax Forms folder. There are quite a few Easter Eggs that are hilariously done and well worth checking out. Without question, this virtual tour of Seinfeld’s ancient Mac is the best thing you’ll see on the web today.

Slate Sign In Sign Up Barbra Streisand to Apple CEO Tim Cook: Siri “Pronounces My Name Wrong” Barbra Streisand to Apple CEO Tim Cook: Siri “Pronounces My Name Wrong” Slate Sign In Sign Up ASU | NEW AMERICA | SLATE Learn more about Future Tense » Slate Future Tense The Citizen's Guide to the Future Aug. 22 2016 2:47 PM Barbra Streisand to Apple CEO Tim Cook: Siri “Pronounces My Name Wrong” By Laura Wagner   Barbra Streisand speaks onstage during the Women in the World Summit on April 23, 2015, in New York City. Andrew Toth/Getty Images Barbra Streisand, owner of two Oscars, 10 Grammys, five Emmys, and a Tony Award, is—incredibly—still having to deal with mispronunciations of her last name. She’s on a crusade to end it once and for all—and not being human is no excuse. On Saturday, Streisand told NPR’s Scott Simon about the latest offender: Apple’s voice-controlled assistant, Siri. Advertisement “She pronounces my name wrong. Streisand with a soft ‘s’ like sand on the beach,” she said. “I've been saying this for my whole career.” While Apple users can teach Siri how to pronounce names correctly, Streisand took her complaint straight to the top. In the NPR interview she said: I called the head of Apple, Tim Cook, and he delightfully agreed to have Siri change the pronunciation of my name finally, with the next update on September 30th. So let’s see if that happens, because I will be thrilled. Streisand might be “thrilled” before then, as according to Macrumors.com, the release date of iOS 10 could be even earlier than Sept. 30. During the June 28 episode of Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live, guest John Mayer and host Andy Cohen both erred, calling the 74-year-old star Strize-and, turning the soft second “s” of her surname in to a “z” sound. And in a recent profile of the singer-actor-comedian, the New York Times wrote that the mispronunciation “has plagued her at least since she first appeared on ‘The Ed Sullivan Show’ in the early 1960s.” Future Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University.

Clay Whittaker posted Aug 22nd, 2016 at 2:12pm Shinya Suzuki CC by ND 2.0 Apple Watch Wearables like the Apple Watch, Fitbits, and other devices are common today. Apple's latest acquisition may shed light on the future of its health software. The company just acquired Gliimpse [sic], as Fast Company reports, which lets users securely collect and share their own medical records digitally, however they wish. It was only a few months ago that Apple made its CareKit, its software for allowing people to develop medical apps, open source to the public. The move was meant to allow other companies to have access to the personal health data collected by Apple's devices. Apple's Gliimpse acquisition suggests it also wants to get into the world of medical records management, and possibly analysis. By combining device-based findings with medical records, Apple could be able to offer doctors a more complete medical profile for users than any other company. Of course, we'll see how secure collection of that data proceeds, and whether other companies like employers and insurers want a piece of the action. And it's worth recalling Google tried a similar approach years ago with its Google Health service, only to shut it down after it failed to gain much of a userbase. However, that service was not primarily mobile, and didn't have the huge number of iOS users (iPhones and iPads) to build upon.

TECHNOLOGY Barbra Streisand Just Convinced Apple to Make Siri a Whole Lot Smarter The singer approached Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, requesting that Siri learn to say her name correctly. His acquiescence is yet another sign of the company's plan to race ahead in the AI competition. By Zoë Henry Zoë Henry is a staff reporter at Inc. and a graduate of Brown University. She lives in Brooklyn, New York. @ZoeLaHenry Reporter, Inc.@ZoeLaHenry WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Barbra Streisand has won numerous awards over the course of her decades-long career in entertainment--including two Oscars, five Emmys, and 10 Grammys. The singer's latest win? Convincing Apple CEO Tim Cook to adapt his machine learning technology so that Siri would pronounce her last name correctly. In a recent NPR interview, Streisand said she was frustrated that the iPhone virtual assistant had been pronouncing her name as "Streizand"--with a hard "z" sound, as opposed to a soft "s," which is the correct pronunciation. "I called the head of Apple, Tim Cook, and he delightfully agreed to have Siri change the pronunciation of my name, finally," she said. By September 30, Streisand says the glitch should be fixed. This is around the time that Apple will release its latest version of iOS for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. (The launch of iOS is also likely linked to the release of the company's new iPhone.) "So let's see if that happens, because I will be thrilled," the entertainer continued. Of course, not everyone has the clout to persuade major tech executives to fix their operating systems. Still, Cook's acquiescence does suggest that Apple is pulling ahead in Silicon Valley's artificial intelligent race, developing tools alongside competitors such as Google, Facebook, Salesforce, and Twitter. Apple has certainly been making a more visible push to develop machine learning tools in recent months. In early August, the company announced that it had acquired Turi, a Seattle machine learning startup, for about $200 million. Turi, which grew out of a Carnegie Mellon lab experiment back in 2009, develops algorithms and helps third-party developers embed machine learning capabilities into their apps. (At the time of the acquisition, Turi was working with more than 100 paying customers, according to a person familiar with the matter.) Since 2015, Apple has bought up some 15 businesses, including several others in the AI space. VocalIQ, for instance, is a speech-processing venture, while Perceptio develops advanced AI for smartphones. Still, analysts suggest that Apple lags behind other companies--largely due to the fact that its privacy policies have prevented it from making the same kinds of technological advances (i.e., chatbots). Alphabet Inc.'s Google has been the dominant player in the AI space, according to data from CB Insights: The search giant has acquired nine companies in the machine learning category alone, including DNNresearch and DeepMind. Twitter follows closely, having acquired four major AI companies, including London-based Magic Pony, which uses neural networks to improve images. In Apple's latest earnings call, Cook said he was bullish on the future of AI at the company, and promised that Siri would become even more adept in the months and years to come. "We have focused our AI efforts on the features that best enhance the customer experience," he said. "For example, machine learning enables Siri to understands words as well as the intent behind them. That means Siri does a better job of understanding and even predicting what you want, then delivering the right responses." Take that to mean that Streisand might soon be met with a "Sorry, Barbra," the next time she commands Siri to speak her name in public. Published on: Aug 22, 2016 Advertisement

Easily, if you’re Frank Ocean.  Instead of releasing just one album, you put out two. This past weekend, rather than coming with the set that was expected to be called Boys Don’t Cry - the previously announced title of the highly anticipated follow-up to 2012’s acclaimed Channel Orange -  the digital soul singer outdid himself and released two new collections, neither of which bear that name. (Though a curated oversized art magazine which includes a Kanye West poem about McDonald’s was given out for free in four cities over the weekend does.) First, on Friday morning, the Louisiana-reared songwriter born Christopher Breaux came with Endless (Apple Music ** 1/2), a “visual album” accompanied by a black-and-white film in which he methodically builds a spiral staircase to the stars. That one, let loose as a streaming Apple Music exclusive, featured collaborations with Strawberry Mansion hip-hop R&B singer Jazmine Sullivan and, more surprisingly, Havertown indie rock songwriting savant Alex G. It can only be experienced as one often meandering 45 minute long track, although it was issued with individual credits for each of its 19 songs, and is apparently an edited version of a longer 140 hour piece made in collaboration with artist Tom Sachs. Then on Saturday, Ocean put out Blonde (Apple Music *** 1/2) , an 17 track album that - while it still bears the Ocean trademark of existing as a mood piece in which the way the pieces of a composition come together are left visible - is a more coherent work, and can only be purchased as an entire album. It also features bigger name guest stars Beyonce, Kendrick Lamar and Andre 3000 of OutKast.  (And yes, there’s also song credit handed out to The Beatles.) Though in a measure of his confidence, Ocean - who takes the opportunity on the closing “Futura Free” to remind the world “I ain’t on your schedule” - does not feel compelled to showcase the luminaries in ways that makes their star qualities stand out. Instead, Beyonce’s contributes to the gorgeous Pharrell Williams-produced remembrance of a past love “Pink & White,” with a wordless vocal that you would have no way of knowing is her. Similarly, Lamar doesn’t even rap on the minimalist musing “Skyline To,” instead just blurting out odd words here and there. Still, the song succeeds, well timed as it is to capture the wistfulness of fleeting late August days: “Summer’s not as long as it used to be / Every day counts like crazy - smoky, hazy.” Which is not to say that guest stars do not shine brightly on Blonde, which was issued in an alternative version called Blond on the CD that accompanied the Boys Don’t Cry magazine. (Blond on Blonde, get it?) “Solo (Reprise)” consists entirely of an Andre 3000 verse that find the rapid-fire rhythmically-exacting rapper in top form, throwing shade on rappers who don’t write their own verses. And the real breakout star of the album is the woman who the listener presumes to be Ocean’s mother, heard on “Be Yourself.” She leaves a voice mail urging her son to trust his instincts and to refrain from alcohol, cocaine and marijuana. “When people become weed-heads they become sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned,” she says, repeating herself for emphasis. Naturally, he’s not heeding the advice on the following “Solo,” in which his expressive tenor is on vivid display as he escapes into a haze of smoke:  “There’s hell on earth and the city’s on fire / Inhale, in hell there’s heaven.”) As for the Beatles, the melody of “Here, There & Everywhere” briefly turns up in the spare “White Ferrari,” perhaps the most hauntingly pretty song on an album full of them. Ocean is so good at making music that is contemplative, it can be easy to miss the sly sense of humor.  In “Solo” he sings, “Hand me a towel, I’m dirty dancing by myself.” Although not a rapper, Ocean came to prominence as part of the often profane hip-hop collective Odd Future, and he made headlines in 2012, when he wrote about falling in love with a man when he was 19. On Blonde’s “Good Guy,”  Ocean cheekily raises a glass to a club where he had a welcome revelation about a subsequent, ill fated relationship: “Here’s to the gay bar you took me to / It’s when I realized you talk too much, more than I do.” This weekend Ocean also put out “Nikes,” a flashy NSFW video for a song from Blonde that features an Auto-Tuned Ocean. He pokes  fun at a woman who’s “looking for a ring like Carmelo” in reference to New York Knicks’ championship-less NBA star  Carmelo Anthony and gets serious paying tribute to slain Florida teenager Trayvon Martin: “RIP, Trayvon, that n----- look just like me.” The digital age has freed artists to be creative in how they interact with audiences, sometimes unleashing varied media immediately upon creation.  Ocean takes the opposite approach, believing in letting the artistic process play out even if it results in a product that doesn’t seem properly “finished.” Waiting for him to follow-up Channel Orange has been a patience trying time for his fans, but finally, rewards worthy of spending extensive time with are at hand.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Samsung-Samsung+ iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Android-Android+ The rivalry between Samsung and Apple is already legendary, so it's no surprise that both companies' fans are trying to prove their favorite products are better than the competition's. The following is just another chapter of the Apple vs Samsung saga, which, sometimes, reveals unimaginable hostility. Since Apple has yet to launch its flagship iPhone product, while Samsung has already released the Galaxy Note 7, someone thought that it would be fun to put the iPhone 6s and Samsung's latest phablet head to head in a performance test. The last year's Apple iPhone 6s featuring a dual-core A9 processor and 2GB RAM was put up against the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 powered by a quad-core Snapdragon 820 CPU and 4GB RAM. It's also worth noting that the Galaxy Note 7's display supports Quad HD (2560 x 1440 pixels) resolution, while Apple's iPhone 6s features a 1334 x 750 pixels display. Naturally, a huge factor in the performance test is the operating system that these smartphones are running: Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and iOS 9.3.4. The speed test consists in opening several mobile games including Gameloft's Asphalt Airborne 8 and Rovio's Angry Birds. Then both smartphones must create a lapse from the same video file. Some other applications like Netflix and ESPN have been added to the test as well, but the Galaxy Note 7 remained stuck behind when opening the first game and it did not manage to regain any seconds during the rest of the test. The results of the speed test show an indisputable winner, the iPhone 6s. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 finished the first speed run after 2 minutes and 5 seconds, and the second lap in 2 minutes and 50 seconds. Apple's iPhone 6s was much faster having finished the performance test in just 1 minute and 21 seconds, and the second lap after 1 minute and 51 seconds.

Samsung needs better optimization and they need to stop using the snapdragon 20. This is what happens when they focus in power saving techniques instead of offering more performance for the note. I knew it was going to be a joke of a phone lol The price tag is insulting, and have you seen the scratch test? The note gets scratched way easier than the S7Edge posted on 22 Aug 2016, 14:43 1 Reply 68. marorun (Posts: 3897; Member since: 30 Mar 2015) Scratch can be protected against by using simple protector.

It won this contest, cause it's good at what it does, and keeps it simple. As much as I get frustrated with my iPhone, for what it doesn't do, I love it for how good it does what it does do. That said, it's also buggy and laggy at times, just like the Note 7, and any other smart phone will be. Stop hating, and give credit where it's due. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 21:17 2 Reply 149. bigsimpd (Posts: 109; Member since: 13 Jan 2012) Bro I'm trying to make myself like this note7 it is laggy indeed talk to me I need some convincing because i'm bout to return this thing and go back to Iphone lol i'm really trying tho this phone is far from flawless trust me on that.If I do go back I will just get the 6s plus tho not worried about iphone 7 talk to me pimp down aisle 8 with big laggy phone in hand lol posted on 23 Aug 2016, 05:03 1 in response to #149 in response to #149 Hide Reply 175. darkkjedii (Posts: 21962; Member since: 05 Feb 2011) I received mine yesterday, and I'm still signing into accounts and setting it up, but mine isn't laggy.

Between my iPhone 6S Plus and my S7 Edge, both of which have transition animations removed (Developer menu in S7E and jailbrojken iPhone), my iPhone always performs better. Can even double-click the home button to launch the camera, and it's faster than S7 Edge. It's a shame that it takes jailbreaking to customize the device this way but it's worth it. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 19:05 0 Reply 138. Darkkracker (Posts: 154; Member since: 11 Jun 2016) Fake as test.

First, this comparison shows not just loading speed, but it also shows how the RAM management in the Samsung devices are far too aggressive still, and yet it has 2x the amount of RAM as iPhone. No reason for apps to reload like that. Second, the transition animations in iPhone isn't sped up by enabling 'Reduce Motion". It's still doing animations while opening and closing apps. This can be removed with a Cydia tweak, though. Third, grow up. You're acting like a 4 year old. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 13:04 19 Reply 3. Unordinary (Posts: 1945; Member since: 04 Nov 2015) Lmfao.

MrElectrifyer (Posts: 3265; Member since: 21 Oct 2014) Not necessarily. If they properly optimize it for the chipset, and fix their RAM management, they'll match in the performance while keeping more features. That's how the Exynos Note 7 does it against the OnePlus 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppdIqf-c4nw They just really need to optimize the Snapdragon variant. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 19:42 8 in response to #122 in response to #122 Hide Reply 140. nctx77 (Posts: 2092; Member since: 03 Sep 2013) Sheep talk. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 20:23 7 in response to #140 in response to #140 Hide Reply 146.

NVMe is playing a part but the Note 7 should never be that far behind. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 14:05 4 in response to #27 in response to #27 Hide Reply 40. Finalflash (Posts: 3169; Member since: 23 Jul 2013) The reason is optimizations as well as storage. The OnePlus 3 has half the resolution of the Note 7 and the iPhone 6s has a 1/4. When loading a game that loads 1GB of textures on the iPhone, that same game will load 2GB on the OP 3 and 4GB on the GN 7. The difference is literally exponential between the devices and it shows here. The fact that the iPhone 6s only beat the OP 3 by 3 seconds only is a pretty significant win by the OP 3 since it is doing double the loading work. With a faster SSD, you can load up 1GB very quickly, but for the Android phones to load up double or quadruple the data in about the same time is pretty damn good. Optimizations also help make this better by organizing RAM and making room accordingly. Every time an app goes to the background, RAM gets cleaned up a bit and that takes optimizations to do efficiently. So they need to get that sorted out to be amazing rather than just good. In Apple's case, there is a lot less work to do because of the low resolution, so not much optimization is needed. In the case of the qHD phones, it requires a much better memory management system to function equivalently. posted on 23 Aug 2016, 02:52 0 in response to #40 in response to #40 Hide Reply 170. ebilcake (Posts: 578; Member since: 16 Jul 2016) Hopefully the guy will do a speedtest between the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6S Plus to shut people up about resolution. Too many assumptions about resolution affecting results here will no evidence to back it up. * Some comments have been hidden, because they don't meet the discussions rules. 1 2 3 4 5 Next » view all comments Want to comment?

Giovanni Bruno Aug 22, 2016 9:51 AM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) --On Wednesday of this week Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook will celebrate his fifth year as the leader of the tech titan. However, despite Cook's successful five-year run to this point, clamoring over when Apple will announce the next societal revolutionary product has increased. Recode's Managing Editor Ed Lee joined CNBC's "Squawk Box" Monday morning to comment on Cook's legacy and to project the future of Apple. "Apple needed a Tim Cook with operational excellence because Steve Jobs was all over the place, making last-minute changes to all kinds of things," Lee said. Lee cited the infamous situation in which Steve Jobs wanted to change the iPhone screen to glass from plastic just six-weeks before the product's launch. The original prototype of the phone had been plastic. However, Jobs, frustrated with the amount of scratches the screen had, wanted an overhaul. Cook stepped in and ensured the problem was sorted out in a timely and efficient manner. Despite his calm, cool and collected demeanor in handling crisis situations brought about by the company's founder, Lee says Cook lacks something Steve Jobs embodied that propelled Apple into becoming an icon. "Now what they're lacking is they don't have a vision guy. Cook is a great operator, a great executive, but we haven't seen evidence of the next game-changing product," Lee explained. Lee concluded on what could be next for Apple regarding a substantial societal impact. "I think the recurring business Apple needs to focus on is the service revenue and media revenue. The problem, however, is the media business is run by Eddy Cue, a smart guy, but at the same time, he does not buy into the TV business model, regarding how content is paid for," Lee noted.

Toggle navigation Financials Consumer Discretionary Technology Energy Gaming Healthcare Industrials Sports Video Toggle navigation Home About us Contact Us Authors US Edition November 23, 2016 Financials Consumer Discretionary Technology Energy Gaming Healthcare Industrials Sports Video FINANCIALS Apple Inc. (AAPL): How Tim Cook's Five Years Have Been In Terms Of Stock Performance The Country Caller sheds light upon Apple Inc’s (AAPL) contribution to the stock performance during his five year tenure Published By: Myrna Salomon on August 22, 2016 12:51 pm EST Facebook Google+ Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon AAPL Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who replaced the iconic Steve Jobs, will be celebrating his five years at the tech giant on Wednesday. Keeping that in view, TheCountryCaller examines how Mr. Cook’s five years at the company have been in terms of financial performance and impacts on stock price. Over past half-decade period, Apple has grown leaps and bounds, became the largest company by market value and firmed its footprints while remaining influential. The tech giant’s $53 billion Net Income during 2015 was alone higher than the accumulated earnings of other tech titans in the market like Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) – Google’s parent company, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) along with e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). It should be noted that Apple has recently sold its billionth flagship product, the iPhone. Apple stock currently has a total market capitalization of around $590 billion, and is the highest in United States. This is why, several industry experts regard the company as the King of The Market. During the past five year period, since Mr. Cook took over the helm, the stock has surged about 114.08%, substantially outperforming the broader S&P 500 Index’s hike of 85%. Although the company has managed to grow significantly, several analysts are of the opinion that Apple is growing at a decreasing rate while the stock is also stagnating. Apart from this, the company is also facing an increasing number of risks leading to concerns about the future. Meanwhile Apple’s product lineup has expanded under the reign of Mr. Cook, each product category faces certain risks associated to it. While the iPhone contributes around two-thirds of the company’s total revenue, the product has grown bigger in dollar terms now. This has been a problem for Apple because iPhone sales have dropped, thus the company reported a decline in revenue for the past two quarters on a trot. Moreover, the iPad sales have also slumped over the past few years, due to the increasing competition and much cheaper tabs available in the market. In addition to this, the Apple Watch did not turn out to be a success as was anticipated. Apple stock traded at $108.52, down about a meager 0.77% during the opening hour of trade. The stock has climbed about 3.9% since the start of this year through August 19.

You call up the chief executive of Apple of course  Share  Comments BySophie Curtis 18:32, 22 AUG 2016 Updated12:55, 29 AUG 2016 Technology Barbra Streisand has demanded that Apple fix how Siri pronounces her name (Photo: Getty)  Share  Comments Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Barbra Streisand is known for being a diva both on and off the stage, but picking a fight with a computer program is a stretch even for her. The US singer has complained to Apple's chief executive Tim Cook , after it came to her attention that the company's virtual assistant, Siri , was pronouncing her surname wrong. Streisand said the second syllable of her name should be pronounced with "a soft S, like sand on the beach", rather than the Z sound Siri uses. "I called the head of Apple, Tim Cook, and he delightfully agreed to have Siri change the pronunciation of my name, finally, with the next update on 30 September," she told NPR . "So let's see if that happens, because I will be thrilled." (Photo: Getty Images) Read More Apple boss Tim Cook says he's got the 'best job in the world' - but admits he's no Steve Jobs Apple has not yet announced when its iOS 10 software update for the iPhone and iPad will be released, but Streisand's comments suggest it could be September 30. That would be a few weeks after the expected launch of Apple's next iPhone - thought to be called the iPhone 7 - as well as the iPad Pro 2 , iPad Mini 5 and Apple Watch 2 . Along with the all-important change to the pronunciation of Barbra Streisand's name, iOS 10 will include several major updates to Messages, Siri, Apple Music, Maps and Photos.

 There may be a 3rd iPhone model next year with a better screen Antonio Villas-Boas Aug. 22, 2016, 1:29 PM 6,736 facebook linkedin twitter email print A report from Japanese news site Nikkei claims that Apple will unveil a third iPhone model with a 5.5-inch organic light-emitting diode display with curved side edges. It was first reported by Reuters in January that Apple could adopt OLED displays for iPhones in 2018, but if this latest rumor is true, then we could see this new OLED iPhone as soon as next year. kedarkulkarni95/YouTube The third iPhone model will apparently be released alongside the regular 4.7- and 5.5-inch iPhones with LCD displays. OLED displays are superior to the LCD technology found in iPhones. For one, they have much better contrast where darks are darker and brights are brighter, which helps make anything on the screen "pop." OLED displays also reproduce deeper colors than an LCD could. They can even be more power-efficient than LCD displays, as they can turn off specific parts of the screen for anything that's colored black. An LCD display, on the other hand, is always on, even when displaying the color black. Below is a comparison between the iPhone 6S Plus' LCD display against the OLED display on the Galaxy Note 5. Both have the same picture of the color black, but it's clear that the iPhone's LCD screen looks more gray than it does black. The same image on the Note 5's OLED display is clearly showing a more accurate black color. In fact, the majority of the Note 5's screen is off because OLED displays actually turn off to display the color black.

It may also unveil an updated Apple Watch among other products. Here’s a look at what we may see from this year’s iPhone — likely to be called the iPhone 7 — based on the latest rumors and reports. September launch Apple typically releases its new iPhones in September, and it seems like this year will be no different. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company is holding an invitation-only event on Sept. 7 at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, which is where it debuted the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus last year. Bloomberg previously reported that Apple will unveil its new iPhones on that day, while VentureBeat’s Evan Blass reports that the phones will be available for purchase on Sept. 16. It’s possible that this date may be pushed back to Sept. 23, as suggested by a supposedly leaked AT&T retail schedule published by 9to5Mac. No headphone jack Apple is expected to take the controversial step of removing the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, as reports from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg have indicated. This alteration is said to make the next iPhone slimmer and more water resistant, though critics have colored the move as consumer-unfriendly. Since Apple typically includes a pair of earbuds with each new iPhone, it’s possible we’ll see a pair of headphones that plug into the phone’s Lightning port, or a wireless pair of earbuds, ship with the iPhone 7. One report suggests Apple may introduce a set of wireless earbuds called “AirPods” sold as a separate accessory. Read more: Waiting for Apple’s next big announcements Dual camera The iPhone 7 is rumored to be getting a big boost in the photography department thanks to a new camera system. The new iPhone will feature two sensors that snap photographs simultaneously, according to Bloomberg. Each sensor is said to capture color differently, and the iPhone 7’s software will combine the results to produce a single brighter and more detailed image. While the iPhone’s camera is already among the best you can get on a smartphone, Samsung’s newer smartphones are generally better at taking photos in low-light conditions. A dual-sensor system could give Apple the upper hand. One caveat: This upgrade is only expected to appear on Apple’s larger iPhone, likely to be called the iPhone 7 Plus. That’s according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has made fairly accurate Apple predictions in the past. iPhone photographers who prefer the smaller model might find solace in the rumor that Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), a technology that helps reduce blur in photos, is coming to the iPhone 7. If true, it will be the first time OIS makes its way to a non-Plus model. Slightly different design Save the absence of the headphone jack, Apple’s next iPhones aren’t expected to look very different than their predecessors. However, Apple is said to have figured out a way to get rid of the antenna bands that stretch across the back of the device. Still, iPhone owners who house their devices in protective cases might not notice the difference. Next year’s flagship iPhones may see a more significant design change. Apple is rumored to be developing three new iPhones, one of which is said to have a curved screen similar to that of Samsung’s newer smartphones, according to Nikkei Asian Review. Apple is also reportedly planning to get rid of the home button as part of this redesign, Bloomberg reports. No 16GB option Apple may finally bump up the entry level iPhone’s storage capacity from 16GB to 32GB, according to The Wall Street Journal. Most Android phones come with 32GB of space by default, but Apple has maintained that 16GB is sufficient for those who use the cloud for most computing tasks. However, critics say that even with cloud storage, 16GB is hardly enough storage for many users, particularly because the iPhone’s operating system tends to take up some of that space right off the bat. “The belief is more and more as we use iCloud services for documents and our photos and videos and music, that perhaps the most price-conscious customers are able to live in an environment where they don’t need gobs of local storage because these services are lightening the load,” Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of global marketing, recently told tech blogger John Gruber. Tap-to-pay for mass transit in Japan Apple is planning to incorporate a tap-to-pay technology called FeliCa into its next iPhone, according to Bloomberg. This tech will allow those in Japan to store public transportation passes on their phones rather than having to carry around physical cards. Near Field Communication, which is the technology that powers Apple Pay and other contactless payments, is popular in North America, but the FeliCa standard is very prevalent in Japan. There are 1.9 million payment terminals in Japan that support it, says Bloomberg. While the report says Apple is planning this feature for its next iPhone, Bloomberg also mentions this functionality may debut in next year’s model depending on how talks with Japan-based payment networks play out. iOS 10 Apple’s newest smartphones always come with the latest software already installed. That pattern is likely to continue. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are likely to come with iOS 10 out of the box, which brings an improved version of iMessage that supports app integration, a new Siri that can interact with third-party services, and a revamped Photos app that uses machine learning to determine the contents of an image, among other new features. Older iPhones and iPads will be able to update to iOS 10 in the fall. Read Next Your browser is out of date.

No, that’s not a 4, 4.7-inch, and 5.5-inch model. Rather, two models of the 5.5-inch iPhone. Specifically, the premium 5.5-inch model may be larger and resemble the Galaxy S7 edge with a curved OLED display. Ironically, the report says Samsung will be the main supplier for Apple’s OLED displays, but may be unable to keep up with iPhone demand in addition to its own Galaxy smartphones. Multiple sources say that Apple will be moving to OLED on its iPhone in 2017, whether it be curved or not. Going OLED will also provide improved power efficiency, improved contrast ratios, better viewing angles, among others over LCD. Today’s report falls in line with a previous report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who said Apple is working on a 5.8-inch iPhone with an AMOLED display and glass casing in 2017. Kuo’s report also says Apple will be going to three models of iPhone. Tags: 2017 iPhone, OLED About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

This week marks Cook's fifth anniversary as CEO of the iconic technology giant. He took the helm following the departure of founder Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. Since Cook became Apple's chief, the company's stock is up 105 percent, but has dropped 3 percent over the past year. "The fact is the [Apple] stock had a spike, its come down, he gets very little credit for what he's accomplished, I believe." Cramer said on "Squawk on the Street." Cook has "a service stream revenue that could be north of $28 billion next year that no one thought ... people say [Cook] backed into." Cramer also commented on the expectations for Apple's presumed iPhone 7, which tentatively has a product release date scheduled for Sept. 7. Analysts have expressed disappointment with the Apple management team's handling in the smartphone market. It's been widely reported the next iPhone may have a very similar design to last years model, but could be even thinner, more water resistant and lose its headphone port. "I love the low expectations of the phone," he said. "And I keep remembering Lowell McAdams, CEO of Verizon, saying 'I'm gonna like it, I'm gonna want to upgrade,' Cramer said. "Now, I don't think he speaks idly." Apple's stock was trading at $108.50 per share Monday afternoon. It's stock is up 3 percent, year-to-date.

(Photo: Gabrielle Lurie, AFP/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO — One of Silicon Valley’s tech behemoths is taking a step further into digital medicine. Apple quietly acquired the personal health data start-up Gliimpse, according to a report from Fast Company. Gliimpse takes a patient’s medical records and uses coding to produce a personalized, shareable electronic health record. Anil Sethi, a former systems engineer at Apple with a master’s of science from Johns Hopkins, founded the start-up in 2013, according to his LinkedIn profile. Apple did not immediately respond for comment. The Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant has been expanding into digital health since releasing its HealthKit app — which helps users monitor personal health and fitness data — with the iPhone 6 in 2014. It also worked with hospitals and doctors to create a research-tracking app for common diseases like Parkinson’s and breast cancer, and allowed anyone to become an organ donor using an iPhone. The company may have also acquired the machine learning platform Turi for $200 million earlier this month. Apple isn’t alone in pursuing AI for medicine. Google announced plans to use artificial intelligence to recognize the signs of common eye diseases using medical records of 1.6 million patients in London hospitals. Despite Google, Facebook and other companies’ early ventures into artificial intelligence, Apple CEO Tim Cook said Apple led the industry in artificial intelligence with voice-controlled personal assistance Siri, released in 2011, and isn’t stopping anytime soon. "(The) level of performance (in smartphones) is going to skyrocket" with coming leaps in artificial intelligence, Cook said in an interview with The Washington Post. "And there is nothing that’s going to replace it in the short term or in the intermediate term, either." 35 CONNECTTWEET 61 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2bgbpYk

The next generation of its flagship handset is expected to have a host of new features, including a better camera, faster processor and no headphone jack. As the Silicon Valley giant prepares to unveil the devices in the week beginning September 5, we take a look at some of the top features the iPhone 7 could have and the likelihood that they will be introduced.  1. Better camera  Rumours surrounding the iPhone 7 have consistently shown the handset with an upgraded, bigger camera. Some images have hinted that the iPhone 7 Plus will have a dual-lens camera, and the smaller 4.7-inch handset a much larger, protruding camera lens. The upgraded camera is likely to be one of the biggest draws of the new phone.  Likelihood: 10/10 2. Removing the home button Leaked images of a phone, which could be an iPhone 7, that does not have a home button Credit: Apple Insider It has been suggested that Apple will completely remove the home button on the iPhone 7, replacing it with a fingerprint scanner under the screen. The company recently filed a patent for technology that would facilitate this change, indicating that it is in the works. But is not likely to be ready in time for the iPhone 7's release.  Instead, the iPhone 7 will probably have a pressure sensitive home button that works like the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus' "3D Touch" display. Bloomberg confirmed that the change, which would see the physical switch home button replaced with haptic feedback technology, is on its way. The suggestion is also supported by a raft of changes to the iPhone's home screen coming in iOS 10, the latest version of Apple's mobile software that is due to ship with the phone.  Likelihood: 2/10 3. Ditching the headphone jack  Another very consistent rumour surrounding the iPhone 7 is that Apple will ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack. The potentially controversial decision will render millions of users' headphones obsolete as the company forces a shift towards wireless headphones or those that connect to the phone's Lightning port. Bidding adieu to the 50-year-old jack would allow Apple to make the iPhone 7 1mm slimmer than the iPhone 6s.  Given its history of dropping outdated technologies from its devices, including the laptop DVD drive, removable phone batteries and Adobe Flash, we can expect that the Silicon Valley giant will take the plunge on this one.  Likelihood: 9/10 controversial decisions that made the iPhone better 4. Waterproof iPhone Apple has left clues in the iOS 10 beta that suggest the iPhone 7 could be waterproof. A new feature in the software tells users not to plug the iPhone’s Lightning charging cable in when liquid has been detected. It has been pointed out that the feature bears a resemblance to those that manufacturers who have launched waterproof phones have included.

Fast charging  Technology that lets smartphones gain hours of use in just minutes of charging could be added to the iPhone 7, according to Twitter user the Malignant. The boosted charging would introduce "five volt two amp charging", essentially doubling the electrical currents in the iPhone 6s. While some manufacturers, including Samsung and Huawei, are already using fast charging, there has only been the one rumour suggesting the iPhone 7 will come with the technology - so it should be taken with a pinch of salt.  #Apple according to the source (导航i世界) seems #iphone7 will support #fastcharge at least 5V2A pic.twitter.com/Lu0AqnVHud— The Malignant (@the_malignant) August 14, 2016 Likelihood: 4/10 6. Bigger battery Leaked images have suggested that the iPhone 7 will have a 1735 mAH capacity battery and the iPhone 7 Plus a 2810 mAH one - up from 1715 mAH and 2750 mAH respectively. Battery life remains one of the biggest complaints that users have against the iPhone. To address this, Apple introduced a "Low Power Mode" in iOS 9. Now a hardware upgrade could be on the cards as the company inches towards a longer battery life in its devices.  Likelihood: 6/10 iPhone 7 - the rumour round-up Play! 02:26 7. Faster processor The next installment of the iPhone series, which could be even more powerful than the high-speed iPad Pro, is expected to run on a new A10 chip that could be 50 per cent faster than the current A9X, with 3GB of RAM and a 2.37GHZ processor. Numerous sources have suggested that the phone will have 3GB of RAM, where the current model has 2GB.  Likelihood: 8/10 8. Third "Pro" model Leaked images show Apple could release three versions of the iPhone 7 in September Credit: BShop Kuwa/YouTube Apple first released two versions of its iPhone at the same time in 2013 when it unveiled the iPhone 5s alongside the more affordable iPhone 5c. Since then it has released two new handsets a year - in 2014 launching the 4.7-inch iPhone 6s with the 5.5-inch 6s Plus. This year the company could go one step further and release three versions of the handset.  Rumours suggest the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus could be launched along with a high-end "iPhone 7 Pro" that will have a dual-lens camera. It is not clear if Apple will release three versions, or if the 7 Plus model will be the device that has a dual camera. The company could have been testing both the dual- and single-lens cameras for the 5.5-inch device, hence the multiple leaked images.  Likelihood: 3/10 iphone 7: what will it look like 9. Different colours The release of a "Rose Gold" version of the iPhone last year proved extremely popular, as the gold did when it was first introduced with the 5s back in 2013. Given that the upcoming roster of handsets could look fairly similar to the last two generations, Apple may release a new set of colours to entice its customers to upgrade.  Leaks and artist renditions have suggested that the iPhone 7 could come in "Space Black" and "Deep Blue" as well as gold, silver, rose gold and space grey.   #Apple #iPhone7Pro first look to a BLUE WORKING prototype (source PCOnline.cn) pic.twitter.com/Z7oQzr6l4s— The Malignant (@the_malignant) August 16, 2016 Likelihood: 7/10 10. Retina scanner  Apple could up the biometric security features on the iPhone 7 by introducing a retina scanner or face recognition software. The company hasn't made any significant changes to its biometric technology since it launched "Touch ID" in 2013 with the iPhone 5s. Apple competitors have started experimenting with more biometric features, such as the retina scanner on Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 and the selfie login in Microsoft's Windows 10 anniversary update. There haven't however been any rumours that suggest either feature is coming to the iPhone 7.  Likelihood: 3/10  11. Return to the all-glass iPhone Moving away from the aluminium case back to an all-glass one would be a drastic redesign for Apple. The chances of it happening one day are fairly high, and one of the manufacturing companies Apple works closely with has been developing an all-glass case for smartphones. But it is very unlikely that the iPhone 7 will be the handset Apple chooses to revert with. Instead it will probably save such a change for the 10 year anniversary edition of the iPhone, due to be released in 2017.  Likelihood: 1/10  About | iPhone 7   Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: iPhone Apple Show more Technology latest 23 Nov 2016, 4:30pm Parking chaos as payment app RingGo offline across the country  23 Nov 2016, 11:24am Facebook 'prepares to suppress posts in bid to enter China' 23 Nov 2016, 11:02am How much of the UK has mobile phone coverage?

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon When you’re Barbra Streisand, you get what you want. This was perhaps best illustrated last week when the singer went directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook to rectify the fact that Siri has been saying Babs’ name wrong all this time. In an interview with NPR, the singer, actor and director revealed that after living with five long years of Apple’s voice assistant pronouncing her name incorrectly —apparently, the second “s” is soft, and not pronounced with a “z” — she couldn’t take it any longer. And fair enough, no triple threat should have to suffer like this, come on now. “She pronounces my name wrong,” Streisand said. “(It’s) Streisand with a soft ‘s,’ like sand on the beach. I’ve been saying this for my whole career. Related Apple’s Siri does not like Scarlett Johansson’s Samantha in ‘Her’: ‘She gives artificial intelligence a bad name’ “And so what did I do? I called the head of Apple, Tim Cook, and he delightfully agreed to have Siri change the pronunciation of my name, finally, with the next update on September 30. So let’s see if that happens because I will be thrilled.” Which also means that Streisand may have given away Apple’s release date for the iPhone 7, which should accompany the release of the next version of iOS. But perhaps it’s easier just to blame Siri for this one as well. Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Apple: If we're forced to build a tool to hack iPhones, someone will steal it. FBI: Nonsense. Russia: We just published NSA's hacking tools- Christopher Soghoian (@csoghoian) August 17, 2016 "The component of the government that is supposed to be absolutely best at keeping secrets didn't manage to keep this secret effectively," Nate Cardozo, a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Business Insider. In February, a judge ordered Apple to help the FBI unlock an iPhone that was used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of two attackers who killed 14 people in a December terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California. That order set off a vigorous debate between law enforcement officials seeking evidence and technologists worried over broader implications for personal privacy. While the company's legal team fought the order, Apple CEO Tim Cook published a letter arguing against being forced to build a so-called "backdoor" that would subvert the encryption that not only kept the shooter's phone secure, but millions of other users of Apple's smart phones. Most in the technology community rallied around Apple at the time, arguing that weakened encryption might help government investigators, but it would also make customers vulnerable to hackers. Now, with a massive top-secret archive of some of the NSA's own exploits having been leaked online, it appears they were right. First Look/Trevor Paglen "The NSA's stance on vulnerabilities seems to be based on the premise that secrets will never get out. That no one will ever discover the same bug, that no one will ever use the same bug, that there will never be a leak," Cardozo said. "We know for a fact, that at least in this case, that's not true." The government eventually backed down from its fight with Apple in late March, after investigators said they were able to unlock the shooter's phone with the "a assistance of a third party." It never disclosed who that was or how it broke into the phone. Exactly how the FBI got into the phone is yet another case where the government is holding on to "zero days," or software exploits that are completely unknown to companies and users. These exploits, when found, are typically disclosed to vendors so they can fix the problem, used by hackers to break into systems more easily, or sold on the black market. But Cardozo believes the FBI's exploit of the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone 5C, its still-unknown exploit of the Tor web browser in another case, and NSA's apparent hoarding of exploits that have now been made public, raises a larger issue around the legalities of government hacking. "When the government finds, creates, or discovers a vulnerability in a system, there are essentially two things they can do: They can disclose it, or they can use it," he said. "But the rules around that are completely broken." There are some guidelines around how the government is supposed to deal with vulnerabilities in what is called the Vulnerabilities Equities Process, a framework that is supposed to outline how and when it would make sense to disclose a vulnerability to an affected company if the larger security risk is greater than the reward it could yield.  But the VEP is just non-binding guidance created by the Obama administration - not an executive order or law - which has no legal standing.   "We need rules, and right now there aren't any," Cardozo said. "Or at least none that work."

Mitchell Share Tweet Like Submit Plus If you get into the weeds of tax policy and had a contest for parts of the internal revenue code that are “boring but important,” depreciation would be at the top of the list. After all, how many people want to learn about America’s Byzantine system that imposes a discriminatory tax penalty on new investment? Yes, it’s a self-destructive policy that imposes a lot of economic damage, but even I’ll admit it’s not a riveting topic (though I tried to link it to popular culture by using ABBA as an example). In second place would be a policy called “deferral,” which deals with a part of the law that allows companies to delay an extra layer of tax that the IRS imposes on income that is earned - and already subject to tax - in other countries. It is “boring but important” because it has major implications on the ability of American-domiciled firms to compete for market share overseas. Here’s a video that explains the issue, though feel free to skip it and continue reading if you already are familiar with how the law works. The simple way to think of this eye-glazing topic is that “deferral” is a good policy that partially mitigates the impact of a bad policy known as “worldwide taxation.” Unfortunately, good policy tends to be unpopular in Washington. This is why deferral (and related issues such as inversions, which occur for the simple reason that worldwide taxation creates a huge competitive disadvantage for U.S.-domiciled companies) is playing an unusually large role in the 2016 election and concomitant tax debates. Consider the tax controversy involving Apple. The CEO does not want to surrender money that belongs to shareholders to the government. Apple CEO Tim Cook struck back at critics of the iPhone maker’s strategy to avoid paying U.S. taxes, telling The Washington Post in a wide ranging interview that the company would not bring that money back from abroad unless there was a “fair rate.” Since the discussion is about income that Apple has earned in other nations (and therefore about income that already has been subject to all applicable taxes in other nations), the only “fair rate” from the United States is zero. That’s because good tax systems are based on “territorial taxation” rather than “worldwide taxation.” Though a worldwide tax system might not impose that much damage if a nation had a low corporate tax rate. Unfortunately, that’s not a good description of the U.S. system, which has a very high rate, thus creating a big incentive to hold money overseas to avoid having to pay a very hefty second layer of tax to the IRS on income that already has been subject to tax by foreign governments. Along with other multinational companies, the tech giant has been subject to criticism over a tax strategy that allows them to shelter profits made abroad from the U.S. corporate tax rate, which at 35 percent is among the highest in the developed world. “Among”? I don’t know if this is a sign of bias or ignorance on the part of CNBC, but the U.S. unquestionably has the highest corporate tax rate among developed nations. Indeed, it might even be the highest in the entire world. Anyhow, Mr. Cook points out that there’s nothing patriotic about needlessly paying extra tax to the IRS, especially when it would mean a very punitive tax rate. …a few particularly strident critics have lambasted Apple as a tax dodger. …While some proponents of the higher U.S. tax rate say it’s unpatriotic for companies to practice inversions or shelter income, Cook hit back at the suggestion. “It is the current tax law. It’s not a matter of being patriotic or not patriotic,” Cook told The Post in a lengthy sit-down. “It doesn’t go that the more you pay, the more patriotic you are.” …Cook added that “when we bring it back, we will pay 35 percent federal tax and then a weighted average across the states that we’re in, which is about 5 percent, so think of it as 40 percent. We’ve said at 40 percent, we’re not going to bring it back until there’s a fair rate. There’s no debate about it.” Cook may be right that there’s “no debate” about whether it’s sensible for a company to keep money overseas to guard against bad tax policy. But there is a debate about whether politicians will make the law worse in a grab for more revenue. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), for instance, doesn’t understand the issue. He wrote an editorial asserting that Apple is engaging in a “rip-off.” …the heart of this mess is the big dog of tax rip-offs – tax deferral. This is the rule that encourages American multinational corporations to keep their profits overseas instead of investing them here at home, and it does so by granting them $80 billion a year in tax breaks. This policy…defies common sense. …some of the most profitable companies in the world can put off paying taxes indefinitely while hardworking Americans must pay their taxes every year. …that system creates a perverse incentive to keep corporate profits overseas instead of investing here at home. I agree with the senator that the current system creates a perverse incentive to keep money abroad. But you don’t solve that problem by imposing unconstrained worldwide taxation, which would create a perverse incentive structure that discourages American-domiciled firms from competing for market share in other nations. Amazingly, Senator Wyden actually claims that making the system more punitive would help make America a better place to do business. …ending deferral is a necessary step in making sure…the U.S. maintains its position as the best place to do business. Wow, this rivals some of the crazy things that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have said. Though I guess we need to give Wyden credit for honesty. He admits that what he really wants is for Washington to have more money to spend. Ending deferral will also generate money from existing deferred taxes to pay for rebuilding our country’s crumbling infrastructure. …This is a priority that almost all tax reform proposals have called for. By the way, can you guess which presidential candidate agrees with Senator Wyden and wants to impose full and immediate worldwide taxation? If you answered Hillary Clinton, you’re right. But if you answered Donald Trump, that also would be a correct answer. This is a grim example of why I refer to them as the Tweedledee and Tweedledum of statism. Though to be fair, Trump’s plan at least contains a big reduction in the corporate tax rate, which would substantially reduce the negative impact of a worldwide tax system. The Wall Street Journal opines on the issue and is especially unimpressed by Hillary Clinton’s irresponsible approach on the issue. Mrs. Clinton is targeting so-called inversions, where U.S.-based companies move their headquarters by buying an overseas competitor, as well as foreign takeovers of U.S. firms for tax considerations. These migrations are the result of a U.S. corporate-tax code that supplies incentives to migrate… The Democrat would impose what she calls an “exit tax” on businesses that relocate outside the U.S., which is the sort of thing banana republics impose when their economies sour. …Mrs. Clinton wants to build a tax wall to stop Americans from escaping. “If they want to go,” she threatened in Michigan, “they’re going to have to pay to go.” Ugh, making companies “pay to go” is an unseemly sentiment. Sort of what you might expect from a place like Venezuela where politicians treat private firms as a source of loot for their cronies. The WSJ correctly points out that the problem is America’s anti-competitive worldwide tax regime, combined with a punitive corporate tax rate. …the U.S. taxes residents—businesses and individuals—on their world-wide income, not merely the income that they earned in the U.S. …the U.S. taxes companies headquartered in the U.S. far more than companies based in other countries. Thirty-one of the 34 OECD countries have cut corporate taxes since 2000, leaving the U.S. with the highest rate in the industrialized world. The U.S. system of world-wide taxation means that a company that moves from Dublin, Ohio, to Dublin, Ireland, will pay a rate that is less than a third of America’s. A dollar of profit earned on the Emerald Isle by an Irish-based company becomes 87.5 cents after taxes, which it can then invest in Ireland or the U.S. or somewhere else. But if the company stays in Ohio and makes the same buck in Ireland, the after-tax return drops to 65 cents or less if the money is invested in America. In other words, the problem is obvious and the solution is obvious. But there are too many Barack Obamas and Elizabeth Warrens in Washington, so it’s more likely that policy will move in the wrong direction.

By Dave Snelling / Published 22nd August 2016 GETTY ANNOUNCEMENT: Music legend Barbra Streisand may have given away an Apple secret We know that Apple will be releasing its next major iPhone software update in the autumn but we may now know an actual date. In a rather bizarre leak it appears that music legend Barbra Streisand might have let slip when Apple fans will be able to get their hands on iOS 10. Streisand hasn't been too impressed with the way that Siri pronounces her name so she decided to give Apple boss Tim Cook a call. "I’ve been saying this for my whole career," said Streisand in a recent interview. "And so what did I do? I called the head of Apple, Tim Cook, and he delightfully agreed to have Siri change the pronunciation of my name, finally, with the next update on September 30th…So let’s see if that happens because I will be thrilled.” GETTY BOSS: Tim Cook shows off the Apple Watch GETTY LEAK: Streisand hasn't been too impressed with the way that Siri pronounces her name So, by the end of September is looks like Siri will be able to say Barbra Streisand but iOS 10 has plenty of other tasty features that will improve your iPhone and iPad. iOS 10 includes new ways to message, improved photography and a complete redesign of Apple Music. Maps in iOS 10 also gets a redesign that should make it easier to get from A to B and Notifications, Today view and Control Center will be accessible with just a swipe or a press on the screen.

Microsoft stock is becoming a hardware player By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Aug 22, 2016, 11:51 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is a Post-Election Casualty Buffett Bails on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

(AAPL) Still Has Plenty of Tricks up Its Sleeve Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Needs This to Happen This Is Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is Worth Its Valuation View All Posts Five years after the tragic death of Steve Jobs, everyone wants to talk about Tim Cook, and whether his reign at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has done credit to Jobs’ legacy. But that legacy is a history lesson others can learn, and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella has been a willing student. Now he aims to out-do the teachers. Source: Mike Mozart Via Flickr Since Nadella became Microsoft CEO, MSFT stock is up 58%, a performance that matches that of AAPL during that time. Even after taking out the huge write-offs from Nokia in mid-2015, Nadella’s company still gets a price-to-earnings multiple that is higher than Apple stock’s multiple. Someone knows something. What is it? Is it just that Microsoft’s margins have been increasing the last few quarters, while AAPL’s margins have been going down for the last year? Or is there a more strategic argument to be made? 9 Stocks to Buy That Will Sprint Past Everything Else Here is the strategic argument. MSFT: Copying What Works Nadella was promoted as “the cloud guy” — he headed the “cloud and enterprise group” at MSFT before being named CEO, after an extensive internal and external search. And his first move, indeed, was to double down on cloud, doubling cloud computing usage in the last year, and increasing search revenue by 16%. Customers are now accustomed to buying Office as a service (Office365) and the $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp (NYSE:LNKD) is designed to make Microsoft a default cloud for business users. The move by MSFT to the cloud, with its $1 billion/quarter capital spending as an ante into the game, seems obvious in retrospect. The success of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and the fall of PC sales, would seem to have mandated it. But not every CEO makes the right move. The history of technology is littered with the names of great companies that failed to do that. International Business Machines Inc. (NYSE:IBM) failed to do that, in time to remain a market leader. Nadella did that. Why Microsoft’s Surface Has to Rise Nadella felt moved to write-off all of MSFT’s Nokia business in July 2015,  less than two years after it was bought for $7.2 billion, and that move continues to cost Microsoft stock big-time in terms of revenue and reputation. Still, Nadella has kept one device many thought he would quickly abandon — the Surface line of PCs. Their sales were up 29% year-over-year in last year’s Christmas quarter. The Surface is now a big enough factor in the market to have its own rumor mill, much like the iPhone. The Surface Pro 4 is a bona fide hit and rumors of what may be next go all the way across the device line-up — from desktops competing with the Mac to devices like the iPhone. Thanks to Palos Panay, who was promoted to manage the device business when Nokia head Stephen Elop was let go, MSFT now has “permission to be in hardware” after years of missteps. Becoming a hardware company, copying the Apple model of designing product and paying for its mass production, is a huge risk, but also a huge opportunity. AAPL has more than double MSFT’s sales because of its huge lead in hardware. Hardware costs more than software, and controlling hardware is the key to leading in the software business. The Surface has to rise.

It also appears that they’ve also been talking to Lyft, regarding an acquisition (via the New York Times). The report says that Apple, along with a handful of other companies have been looking at a possible acquisition of Lyft. Just to name a few: General Motors, Google, Amazon, Uber, and Didi Chuxing. In some cases, the other company approached Lyft for the acquisition, however, it’s unclear which companies did what. Lyft’s discussions were most serious with G.M., which is one of the ride-hailing company’s largest investors. Still, G.M. never made a written offer to buy Lyft, said the people, and in the end, Lyft did not find a buyer. Lyft is not in danger of closing down and has a cash cushion of $1.4 billion, some of these people added, so the company will continue as an independent entity. It’d be likely that Lyft is looking to be acquired in order to better compete with Uber. Lyft has partnered with Didi Chuxing in the past to try to overtake Uber, but they’re simply the top dog in the ride-hailing app market. Tags: acquisition, Lyft About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology. He conceits himself by religiously rocking the Apple brand. You can find him on Twitter @iPeterCao.

The other two models are said to be 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models with flat LCD displays like the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, corroborating previous reports. The report reiterates that Samsung is expected to be Apple's primary supplier of OLED displays, but it may be unable to fully keep up with demand for both iPhones and its own Galaxy smartphones. Recognizing the opportunity, Apple manufacturer Foxconn has been developing glass casings and OLED displays over the past year, in hopes of securing orders from its biggest customer next year. Apple's widely rumored transition towards OLED in 2017 is requisite for curved displays, while the technology also provides improved contrast, faster response times, better viewing angles, better power efficiency for typical mixed image content, and other benefits compared to LCD technology. Samsung's Galaxy S7 makes a compelling case for Apple's rumored switch to OLED technology. Today's report corroborates KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who earlier said Apple may launch an all-new iPhone with a curved 5.8-inch AMOLED display and glass casing in 2017. Kuo's research note outlined three new iPhone models, including LCD-based 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models and a high-end OLED-based 5.8-inch model, as one possibility providing supply of AMOLED displays is sufficient. When applied to the height of an existing 5.5-inch iPhone, a 5.8-inch display like the one Apple is rumored to be working on would leave an extra 7.25mm of display on each side that could be used to wrap around the edges of the device. This would extend the display across the front and sides of the iPhone, perhaps enabling side-based gestures and buttons like on Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge. Apple was similarly rumored to be developing three iPhone models internally this year, but it reportedly scrapped plans to release a 5.5-inch model with a single-lens camera around six months ago. Apple's tenth-anniversary iPhone is shaping up to be a more significant upgrade, compared to the relatively incremental refresh expected from this year's tentatively named iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

They'll do as they usually do: It'll be "magical" when Apple does it, whereas it's a "gimmick" when Samsung does the same thing.

Rating: 22 Votes Cuban Missles 13 weeks ago They don't need to curve. they just need to get rid of the bezel. Put the touchid sensor under the screen and get rid of the home button. Use up all the available real estate before going to the edge gimmick. At least in my book that would be way better. Rating: 20 Votes 840quadra 13 weeks ago Thankfully just a rumor. Even still, Like in the case of the Edge, I don't see any real use for a curved to the edge screen. It's innovation without a purpose (Just my opinion). The only thing I am really excited to potentially see, is the OLED screens. I really like that technology, and despite my having no issues with the current Apple displays.

Whether the four years represented a time of prolonged procrastination or space for Frank Ocean to find solace in some reclusivity, what matters now is that the wait is over. His new stuff is finally here – and fans, new and old, are going nuts. Blond, released on August 20 on Apple Music, is an embodiment of what was foreshadowed by his prototypical dreamlike and sometimes psychedelic sounds from his now-classic mixtapes. The artist took to Tumblr with a short but sweet post acknowledging the long wait, leaving all the tension surrounding his treatment of his fans quietly dissipating.    Only a few hours after the release of Ocean’s video album, Endless, an anonymous Apple Music representative confirmed to Rolling Stone that the new material would drop over the weekend, also hinting that the album Boys Don’t Cry would be unleashed unto wanton fans under a new name. After years of waiting, Ocean first released the first single of his sophomore album, Nikes, and announced a few pop-up store locations for his Boys Don’t Cry zine that accompanies the new audio material on his website. Then, the last surprise of the night was an unexpected announcement from Beats1, an Apple Music Broadcast Radio program.  The show streamed Ocean’s Blond for free from 8 p.m. while Apple was getting ready to post it on iTunes for downloading.  The spelling of the new album, however, is very disputed.  On Apple Music and in the Boys Don’t Cry zine, the album is referred to as ‘Blonde’, but the actual album cover says Blond. In true Frank fashion, we’re left questioning whether its an honest mistake, a purposeful jab at gendered language, or just another unexplainable creative statement by the enigmatic artist.

The Gliimpse team describes themselves as "a well-heeled team of self-funded entrepreneurs with deep roots in the business of healthcare, technology and building successful ventures. From Apple to SAP, Salesforce to Microsoft plus eight startups, three exits and an IPO, we're seasoned veterans. Our CEO's Kaiser project helped improve millions of patient's lives by radically automating their access to data. This time, we're aiming higher than affecting a few million people – we want all 317 million people in America to liberate their health by liberating their data."     Fast Company is reporting today that they've learned that Apple's ambitions in the health sector continues to expand, with its digital health team making its first known acquisition of personal health data startup Gliimpse.   Silicon Valley-based Gliimpse has built a personal health data platform that enables any American to collect, personalize, and share a picture of their health data. The company was started in 2013, and funded by serial entrepreneur Anil Sethi, who has spent the past decade working with health startups, after taking his company Sequoia Software public in 2000. He got his start as a systems engineer at Apple in the late 1980s.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.     Posted by Jack Purcher on August 22, 2016 at 08:39 AM in 5.

Even though the company has had significant successes in those five years — nearly a billion iPhones sold and both revenue and profits more than doubling — Cook's legacy is likely to be defined more by what he does in the next five years, analysts say. Though Cook has yet to prove he can be as innovative as the charismatic Jobs, he has successfully steered the franchise and maintained its position as the world's most valuable company. "Historically, founder-led companies go through existential crises after the founder is gone," said Asymco analyst Horace Dediu. "The fact that Apple didn't implode, but has grown, means mission accomplished." Apple's stock is up 105 percent since Cook stepped into the CEO role, but has slid 3 percent over the past year. The S&P 500 is up 88 percent and 11 percent in those respective periods. In Apple's most recent quarterly results, revenue declined 14.6 percent — a second quarterly decline following 13 years of growth. With this shift, Cook's legacy hangs in the balance. "Investors may have hoped for new product categories to sustain growth because — as you know — the company is not growing at the moment," said BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk. Though some investors will want more, Cook has far exceeded what he was asked to do by keeping the iPhone franchise intact and growing, said Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster. Cook's operational ability, which has enabled Apple to seamlessly roll out new products globally, is second to none, Munster said. "We haven't seen as much on the innovation side, and that's really what we're going to learn about Tim Cook over the next five years," said Munster. "It's the things under his guidance, including augmented reality and, potentially, automotives." (Munster has an overweight rating on the stock and a $151 price target. It was trading below $109 on Monday.) Under Cook, Apple has released one entirely new product: Apple Watch. The device has delivered billions of dollars in revenue, opened up an entirely new product category, and laid the groundwork for the company to deliver wellness and health services. "They took a risk with Apple Watch, which I think is a phenomenal product," said Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White. (White has a buy rating on the stock, the firm's top pick for the second half of the year, and a $185 price target.) Cook must walk a fine line between shipping new products without rushing to market, something he has been judged harshly for by some industry insiders. "I don't think Jobs would have approved such an early launch, though I do think it will grow nicely and be a great product," said Dediu. "But it didn't have the app system ready for launch." Apple sold 1.6 million watches in the second quarter of 2016 and had 47 percent of the wearables market, according to IDC, but the product has not taken off as well as some investors had hoped. Users, analysts and carriers would like to see Apple decouple the watch from the phone, something that is not expected to happen this product cycle. Getty Images Apple Watch So far, the real standout for Munster has been Cook's success in expanding Apple's services business — things like iCloud, iTunes and Apple Pay — which grew 19 percent last quarter. Services will be the size of a Fortune 100 company by next year, Cook has said. "Where I think it's been underwhelming on the hardware side, which of course is where they make their money. The technology is just not there to really get the Watch away from the iPhone yet," Steve Milunovich, managing director at UBS, told CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Monday. He added that Jobs was once against the App Store that has done so well for Apple. "Where I think they've done a good job is on the services side, as you call it, or as we put it, the platform side," Milunovich said. Some attempts to grow Apple's services business have been less successful. For example, the company bought Beats Music for $3 billion in 2014. The deal was a rare high-profile acquisition for the company that delivered executive talent, and was accompanied by talk of new music experiences. Apple Music — a new streaming service — was launched in 2015 but has so far failed to gain much traction, said Piecyk. Cook has the opportunity to further leverage Apple's devices to grow revenue from services, said White. For example, Apple TV could be used to sell services — like Mandarin lessons or cooking classes — to consumers at home, he said. Cook is also credited with opening up new markets for Apple's products. He has forged partnerships with enterprise giants IBM, Cisco and SAP in order to better serve enterprise customers, and grown Apple's footprint in emerging markets. The number of stores in the Chinese marketplace increased from four to 41 during his tenure. Cook recently visited India, which represents a giant opportunity for the company, said White. "Apple's a very different company today, obviously, than four or five years ago," Milunovich said. "[Cook's] had to deal with the FBI situation, moving into China and India, shareholders demanding dividends and buybacks — which Jobs didn't have to deal with at the time." Mike Blake | Reuters Apple Pay app on an iPhone One thing investors are watching closely is how much Apple is spending on research and development. R&D investment is expected to increase this year to $10.5 billion — 4 percent of revenue — according to Munster. That level of investment should be coupled with greater innovation than Cook has so far delivered, said Piecyk. "You have to launch new products — it's fine to spend the money — but until you see them there's really no clarity on what he has been doing," Piecyk said. (Piecyk has a buy rating on Apple and a $124 price target.) Under Cook, Apple has continually updated the iPhone line but has not delivered great leaps in innovation, he said. (iPhone sales were down 23 percent in the company's most recent earnings report.) The iPhone 6, launched in 2014, delivered the larger screen consumers had been clamoring for, but Apple lost out to competitors by waiting too long, analysts agree. "He's built a great company — but he's not a visionary," Andy Cunningham, whose PR firm worked with Jobs, told CNBC's "Squawk Alley" on Monday. An example of the sort of innovation that analysts would like to see would be a phone that doubles as a tablet by flipping open to double in size, said Munster. He is bullish about the innovative steps Cook may take over the next five years to drive iPhone growth. Though Apple is notoriously secretive about what its engineers are working on, Cook has said he sees the development of augmented and virtual reality — powered by smartphones — as a prime opportunity. On the company's most recent earnings call Cook said Apple is investing in artificial intelligence and virtual reality. Apple now has 218 employees working on augmented reality, up 18 percent in the past year, according to Munster. "Augmented reality and virtual reality could be something that would allow the platform to be even richer and sustain the iPhone going forward," said Dediu. Toru Hanai | Reuters Pokemon Go app on an iPhone, Tokyo, Japan, July 22, 2016. Cook's biggest opportunity to make his mark on Apple's business could be in developing an autonomous car, said Dediu. Cook has not spoken publicly about this, but it is widely believed that Apple is working on a car, which has the potential to revolutionize the auto industry. "There are obstacles, such as getting the supply networks put together and ramped up," said Dediu. "But I think there is already a prototype. However, they will not launch until they can quickly build significant volume." Apple's hardware, software and design chops make it uniquely well-positioned to build a car that consumers would want to buy, said White. Apple has the advantage of being unencumbered by legacy thinking and union workers — unlike traditional automakers — and could hook the car into its existing ecosystem, he said. "They are going to pick and choose what markets they want to pursue," said White. "In 10 years we are not going to say Apple is solely reliant on the iPhone." Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

Steve Dent , @stevetdent 08.22.16 in Medicine Comments 798 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Apple has purchased Gliimpse, a startup that helps users collect and personalize their health records, according to Fast Company. Apple confirmed the deal, which reportedly happened earlier this year, but was coy as usual. "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans," a spokesperson told Fast Co. However, it will likely be integrated into its HealthKit research app to help doctors improve treatment for chronic diseases. The founder of Gliimpse, Anil Sethi, said on LinkedIn that he created the app because "there's no single electronic health record that all physicians use ... Worse, there isn't even a common file format across 1,000+ systems." As such, the app is primarily targeted at patients with complex health records, particularly those who suffer from chronic illnesses like diabetes, cancer and heart problems. Apple's HealthKit is used by half the hospitals in the US to monitor patients with serious health issues. The aim is to help researchers conduct trials to gauge the effectiveness of treatments for serious and chronic diseases. Since Gliimpse collects confidential patient data with "rigorous technical security," the acquisition makes sense. However, it could be awhile before we see exactly how Apple brings it into the fold.

Home Top 50 How To Magazine Franchise Events Subscribe 4 min read Business Education Coding in the Classroom: Learning the Future Language of Business Vassil Terziev Contributor Chief Innovation Officer, Progress August 22, 2016 Learning a foreign language is emphasized in the U.S. education system and for a good reason. Mastering another language promotes global awareness, exposes students to different cultures and can be beneficial in the international business world. Being multilingual is certainly a notable attribute, but in addition to spoken vernaculars, there are other languages arguably more integral in shaping the future of business -- namely, the coding languages that make up enterprises’ robust backend structures. These languages are fast becoming more important for students to learn an early age.  Related: Apple Has a New App to Teach Your Kids to Code. These Sites Can Help You Learn as Well. The reality is, with fewer students choosing to study foreign languages, programming languages are shaping business in this century and well into the future. Tides of change -- renewed investment in student business literacy. Today’s pre-collegiate students are the super tech-savvy Generation Z, the pioneers of the future’s digital workforce. In a world where business innovation will be formatted in code, the languages influencing business in coming years will include Objective-C, JavaScript and Python. Some of President Obama’s remarks in his final State of the Union Address expressed his interest in investing in computer science education, as he outlined his plans to help students learn to write computer code in hands-on classroom lessons “to make them job-ready on day one.” Many of the country’s largest public school systems have announced their intentions to expose students to computer science. As it stands in the U.S., approximately one-tenth of high schools offer a computer science course, as estimated by the Computer Science Teachers Association. This estimate does not factor in middle and elementary schools. To spur the tides of change, President Obama asked the U.S. Congress to fund a $4 billion program for states and an additional $100 million for districts to train teachers and get the necessary tools for elementary, middle and high schools to provide computer science classes. These funding programs will appear in President Obama’s 2017 budget proposal, the latest of the White House’s efforts to bring more science and technology education to students. To combat skills gaps, computer science education is key. Whether or not Congress accepts the proposal, it’s going to be a nationwide imperative for schools to teach modern students how to handle data, integrate that data into applications and understand strategies to solve problems related specifically to software. There are already areas in which computer science education is noticeably hamstringed, such as a serious skills gaps and a slim talent pool for IT departments. Related: That Killer Coding Guy - Get Him on Board Schools bear the responsibility to grow the talent pool by making sure students possess the computer science background many will be expected to have when they join the workforce. The importance of this cannot be underscored as the global economy evolves, spurred by technology and the increasing progression to digital business models. Take the recent Oxford Economics global survey of senior business and technology executives as an example. The survey found 78 percent of enterprises believe the shift to becoming a software-driven business will be a critical driver of competitive advantage. In an era of digital transformation, businesses know the relationship between producers and consumers is also evolving, and they’ll have to engage customers through new channels using apps and multimedia content. This is driven by trends in mobile, multichannel and transforming social digital landscapes. Being able to read, understand and use code is fundamental to creating and integrating those content formats, and today’s students will be responsible for doing so. In the future, innovation will be scripted in code. Integrating computer science into standard curricula must become central to any discussion around 21st century education, but particularly in the U.S., where there is every resource to improve course criteria. Students should be consistently exposed to computer science programs at a young age, instilling coding proficiency that grows as they do. Related: 5 Growing Ed Tech Companies That Make the Grade Generation Z must be equipped with the knowledge and abilities to compete in the job market, especially as more companies are digitally transforming their businesses. Parents should demand their students are educated with relevant skills for their future endeavors, because a student who knows how to write code will become an employee who is fluent in business and a valuable company asset. English may be the world’s spoken business language, but code is where business innovations are truly born.

Harrison believes Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is undervalued, especially given the backdrop of “stabilizing iPhone demand, a growing subscriber base that aids in AAPL’s ability to monetize its ecosystem, optionality from the notable jump in R&D spend, and sizeable free cash generation.” Harrison maintains a Buy rating on the company, with a price target of $130. iPhone 7 Production Checks with contacts and Longbow’s connector checks suggest continuing flat iPhone 7 production year-over-year, with upside to the iPhone SE production. The production of the iPhone 7 is in full swing, the analyst mentioned, while adding that contacts expect a flat initial build year-over-year versus the iPhone 6s. “iPhone 6s production cuts are continuing into the September quarter, albeit with a steeper drop of 40 percent than previously anticipated,” Harrison stated.

Excluding Apple’s extra week, Harrison estimates a 4 percent decline in iPhone shipments for CYH2, with a 9.5 percent decline for CY16. According to the Longbow report, “While a glossed over topic during earnings season by AAPL’s suppliers, greater than typical price downs is the talk of AAPL’s supply chain.

Apple unleashes a major Apple Store shakeup InvestorPlace 8/22/2016 Brad Moon Apple reportedly held meetings with all its retail store employees over the weekend. The company introduced a series of sweeping changes to its Apple Store operations, including new positions, new store layouts and a new corporate credo employees are expected to follow. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 110.88 -0.92 -0.83% Tesla Motors Inc TSLA ▲ 194.32 +3.15 +1.65% All of this is on top of news from The Verge late last week that the name of Apple’s retail locations is also changing, from “Apple Store” to simply “Apple.” Mac rumor sites Apple Insider and MacRumors both published posts on the Apple Store shakeup on Sunday, citing “multiple retail sources.” What’s Happening with the Apple Store? According to MacRumors, the changes fall under three broad categories: new and renamed positions, a new credo and new store layouts. In terms of staff positions, AAPL appears to be introducing a hierarchy. The new positions created are “Pro,” “Creative Pro” and “Technical Expert.” The first two designate Apple Store sales employees who have proven to be the most knowledgeable about the company’s products and services, earning a title that reflects this expertise. 7 Best Dividend Stocks You Haven’t Heard Of “Technical Expert” is a new customer support position below the current “Genius,” able to provide low level technical support such as troubleshooting and mobile repairs. Many other existing Apple Store positions have been re-named. For example “Business Specialist” is now “Business Expert.” The company also re-named areas of the Apple Store layout. What was once the “Red Zone” (the sales floor) is now the “Product Zone.” What has been referred to as “Back-of-House” (or where the Inventory and Operations teams work) is now called “Backstage.” Finally, the company has updated the credo it expects its Apple Store employees to follow. The full credo is six paragraphs long, but the opening sets the tone for what follows: “We are here to enrich lives. To help dreamers become doers, to help passion expand human potential, to do the best work of our lives.” Why Shake Up the Apple Store? In the U.S., Apple Stores have consistently led other retailers in sales per square foot, so why mess with a good thing? Well, a number of factors are at play. In the past, AAPL has had problems retaining Apple Store employees. The new roles with recognition of seniority may help to retain valuable experienced staff. There also is a clear effort to streamline the troubleshooting and repair process, especially in mobile. That will be a competitive advantage that Apple undoubtedly will leverage in an effort to boost weak iPhone sales. And in terms of any changes to layout of Apple Stores — and the change to re-naming them as “Apple” — even the retail leader needs to stay fresh. Consumers are fickle, and with rivals like Microsoft emulating the current Apple Store setup, tweaking the design helps keep consumers interested and keep AAPL a step ahead of the competition. Tesla Stock Is About to Spring Like a Tiger The Apple Store represents more than just mere ‘retail” presence for Apple. The company’s products are sold by virtually every big-box retailer, and its iPhones are front and center in every wireless carrier’s stores. The importance of Apple Stores — and something that’s more critical than ever — is the opportunity to introduce consumers to Apple’s other products in the most favorable setting possible. It’s a showroom for the Apple TV, iPad, Apple Watch and Mac computers. This is Apple’s best chance to convince consumers to buy into the Apple ecosphere in general. That pushes revenue into other lines of business … not just the iPhone. So don’t be surprised when Apple shakes up the Apple Store, even while it’s doing blockbuster business. It’s more important now than ever to get the customer experience to the point of perfection.

Steve Dent , @stevetdent 08.22.16 in Medicine Comments 798 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Apple has purchased Gliimpse, a startup that helps users collect and personalize their health records, according to Fast Company. Apple confirmed the deal, which reportedly happened earlier this year, but was coy as usual. "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans," a spokesperson told Fast Co. However, it will likely be integrated into its HealthKit research app to help doctors improve treatment for chronic diseases. The founder of Gliimpse, Anil Sethi, said on LinkedIn that he created the app because "there's no single electronic health record that all physicians use ... Worse, there isn't even a common file format across 1,000+ systems." As such, the app is primarily targeted at patients with complex health records, particularly those who suffer from chronic illnesses like diabetes, cancer and heart problems. Apple's HealthKit is used by half the hospitals in the US to monitor patients with serious health issues. The aim is to help researchers conduct trials to gauge the effectiveness of treatments for serious and chronic diseases. Since Gliimpse collects confidential patient data with "rigorous technical security," the acquisition makes sense. However, it could be awhile before we see exactly how Apple brings it into the fold.

Pick up an iPhone 6 on the cheap with this deal Still on an iPhone 5? Pick up an iPhone 6 on the cheap with this deal by Joe Roberts 22 August 2016 0 shares Read Comments Although the iPhone 7 is just around the corner, we know there are some die-hard Apple fans that are yet to upgrade from the iPhone 5, and, dare we say, even older handsets. If you're among the slackers yet to make the move to a more modern smartphone, we've got a great deal for you on the iPhone 6. It was one of the best phones back in 2014 and still holds good today. GET DEAL: iPhone 6 for £10 upfront at mobiles.co.uk The generous souls at mobiles.co.uk and O2 are offering the 16GB model of the phone, in either grey or silver, along with unlimited calls and texts, plus 3GB of monthly data for £26.50 a month. And with our offer code, you can get £40 off the upfront cost of the handset, bringing it down from £50 to £10. Just enter the code IPHONE6OFF40 at the checkout to get the discounted price. Related: Best smartphone That's a pretty good overall deal, considering the phone itself still goes for around £300 refurbished on ebay, and can be bought new for around £450 outright from Carphone Warehouse. Whether you like Apple or not, iPhone retain their value very well. And despite being almost two years old, the iPhone 6 packs some respectable hardware, including a great 4.7-inch 750 x 1,334 screen, Apple's A8 processor, and a decent all-round camera. The 16GB storage is certainly more than a tad outdated, however, with rumours suggesting Apple will finally do away with the storage tier on the upcoming iPhone 7. If storage is a concern you can opt for the same deal with the newer 64GB iPhone 6S, however you will need to stump up £150 upfront for the phone. We think that's the deal to go for. GET DEAL: iPhone 6S 64GB for £150 upfront at mobiles.co.uk But, it should be noted, the next iPhone iteration is expected to arrive early next month, with some reports touting a September 7 launch date. As soon as the new handset launches, we're expecting a drop in the price of previous models, so you might want to hold off on finally upgrading to the iPhone 6 until then. Related: iPhone 7 That said, this is a worthwhile deal for those looking for a quick upgrade, or for a classy new phone for mum or dad. WATCH: What's the no.1 smartphone in the world? Will you be taking advantage of this offer? Let us know in the comments.

Stay Connected With Hypebot.com « Disgraced Boy Band Hit Maker Lou Pearlman Dies In Prison | Main | Universal, Sony, Warner Music To Sign 9 Acts From "The Stream" Spotify Competition » Spotify, Netflix Tip-Toeing Into One Another's Territory Here we look at Spotify's toe dip into the world of original video content, just as Netflix simultaneously releases music-centric material, while both companies face obstacles to steady growth and profitability.   _____________________________ Guest post by Cherie Hu If you didn’t notice Spotify trying to be Netflix NFLX -0.28% last week, you probably were not alone. After years of growing its curational prowess through playlists like the handpicked Rap Caviar and the algorithmic Discover Weekly, Spotify quietly revealed its first foray into original video content on Thursday. There is nothing to “binge-watch”—just a two-minute animated short called “How EDM Changed the World,” the first in a series titled Deconstructing that will explore music’s social and political underpinnings. Created in collaboration with new media company ATTN:, which received $4.1 million in funding from the likes of Ryan Seacrest and Troy Carter in 2014, the premiere provides a sneak peek into Spotify’s ambitious plans to roll out as many as 12 original video series over the coming months. Yet, “How EDM Changed the World” actually makes Spotify’s video strategy more ambiguous. Only mobile Spotify users, not desktop ones, can stream the video—but viewers can also watch Deconstructing on YouTube, free of charge. This wider availability contrasts with how rivals like Tidal and Apple Music aggressively push forward exclusive content to drive member acquisition. Spotify has historically focused on fine-tuning its data-driven music recommendation features, rather than on acquiring licensed or original exclusives, but the company may have to switch gears if it wants to assert its video competencies in an ever more competitive, fast-paced streaming world. Within 24 hours of Spotify’s launch, Netflix premiered its own original, music-themed video series, with much more fanfare. Directed by Australian film veteran Baz Luhrmann (The Great Gatsby, Moulin Rouge) and set in the South Bronx in the 1970s, The Get Down paints a fictional yet raw picture of the birth of hip-hop, and the youthful drama and optimism that accompanied it. The pilot episode is a whopping 93 minutes long—a feature film in itself—and the remaining five episodes average out to nearly 58 minutes each. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of The Get Down is its roster of influential music players behind the scenes. Hip-hop legends Nas, Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow serve as producers and consultants for the show. The original soundtrack—released jointly by Baz Luhrmann’s label, House of Iona, and RCA Records, a flagship of Sony Music Entertainment—is available exclusively on Apple AAPL +0.25%Music. Luhrmann has even stepped into the competitive curation sphere, compiling several exclusive Apple Musicplaylists around the hip-hop sounds of the late 70s, in collaboration with the show’s Supervising Producer Nelson George.  The Get Down is one cog in the growing wheel of original content that is projected to account for over 50% of offerings on Netflix, according to the company’s Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos. While unspoken, an even more compelling message lies underneath the series that Spotify and other music-industry powerhouses should heed as a warning:video seems to be a stronger entry point into music curation and thought leadership, not the other way around. Looking at numbers alone, though, this imbalance should not exist. In terms of user base and engagement, both Netflix and Spotify boast impressive numbers that justify their influential status in film and music. Netflix has more than 83 million members watching 125 million hours of content daily—averaging out to around 1.54 hours per user per day. While Spotify has only around 30 million paying subscribers (out of over 100 million users total), the average amount of daily listening for its cross-platform (mobile and desktop) users eclipses that of Netflix, reaching nearly 2.5 hours. Both platforms are also facing heightened scrutiny from Wall Street. Netflix failed to meet growth expectations last quarter as its recent price increase from $7.99 to $9.99 caused some customers to cancel their subscriptions, while investors are skeptical about Spotify’s ability to grow into its $8 billion valuation ahead of its highly-anticipated IPO next year. More significantly, Netflix and Spotify have fundamentally different approaches to cultural transformation that will likely impact how successful their music video content will be. Netflix popularized the all-in “binge” culture among digitally-native TV fans, while many of Spotify’s features are intentionally background or passive experiences (Spotify Running, or playlists like ”Your Favorite Coffeehouse” and “Afternoon Acoustic”), in line with the mission to provide “the soundtrack to your life.” Netflix uses in-depth data analysis to craft shows that its wider audience will love (House of Cards), while one of Spotify’s strongest selling points is applying data science to strictly scheduled hyper-personalization (Release Radar). Some may argue that in order for Spotify to make a genuine splash at the intersection of music and film, it would have to release much longer, higher-profile videos along the lines Netflix’s 2015 documentary What Happened, Nina Simone?. As of right now, this is a financially and ideologically bad idea. For one, Spotify doesn’t have the cash—the service has yet to be profitable, and it had to pay 83.6% of its revenue to rights holders last year. Secondly, this move would not align with Spotify’s unique value proposition to the music industry, and would only make all of its stakeholders more confused. A similar dilemma exists for Netflix, which already has a thriving Music division but works primarily with sync licensing for its films. To disrupt the music streaming space, one could argue, it may have to start developing talent in-house, or even provide music streaming as a separate service within its platform. This would only lead to additional upfront licensing costs and likely a higher subscription price, which may cause more attrition. Even if the streaming service of the future will be a hybrid of today’s dominant competitors, these companies cannot adopt a blanket strategy on the path to convergence, and they have to approach this differentiation intelligently. Netflix proved its unique ability to rally some of the music industry’s most influential players behind its latest show. Practically speaking, Spotify can’t release its own Get Down, but it will have to use its own strengths to do even better.

By James Billington August 22, 2016 15:09 BST Consumer electronics manufacturer Foxconn is in the headlines again with two more employee deaths occurring in two days.Reuters Foxconn, manufacturer to the likes of Apple and Samsung, has confirmed that two of its employees at its China factory have died in unrelated incidents – one of which occurred close by one of its factories. The Taiwanese consumer electronics producer, which has been in the spotlight in the past over employee suicides, is under investigation over these latest deaths, and has said it is cooperating with authorities. Foxconn announced that a male employee was found dead outside one of its production line buildings in Zhengzhou on Thursday (18 August 2016), while a female employee died in a train accident on her way to work the following day. The company did not give further details over the circumstances of the deaths except that they occurred on different dates and in unrelated conditions. However, The Wall Street Journal produced a report on the fatalities claiming the man, a 31-year-old, "leapt to his death" from the building's top floor after finishing his night shift assembling iPhones. The report goes on to claim the female who died the next day was struck by a train after heavy rain had flooded underpasses, forcing the worker to cross rail lines in a desperate effort to make it to work on time for fear of being docked wages if employees cannot turn up, even if bad weather plays a part. In response to the news, Apple released a statement over the conditions of the factory workers: "Facilities in Zhengzhou and throughout our supply chain offer employee assistance programmes, designed in conjunction with Apple and available to every worker, to provide access to social services and counsellors whenever needed." "We constantly monitor working conditions to ensure that they meet our strict standards, and we will investigate the incidents in Zhengzhou," it said. With the iPhone 7 expected to be launched next month, production efforts are likely to have been ramped up, which will mean a busy period for Foxconn's 1.3 million workers. In 2010, the manufacturer received heavy criticism after it was alleged that intensely pressurised working conditions led to more than a dozen suicides.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Glimpse has built a secure software platform that allows users to manage and share their own medical records. As per the report, Apple had acquired Glimpse earlier this year and the company has confirmed the same with Fast Company with the standard response, “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.” Glimpse was founded by former Apple systems engineer Anil Sethi in 2013. The service works by letting users pull their own medical info into a single virtual space, with the ability to add documents and pictures to fill out the profile. It is not known how Apple plans to use Glimpe technology.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple buys personal health data startup Gliimpse By Christian Zibreg, Aug 22, 2016 Tweet Leave a Comment Apple has acquired another small startup, called Gliimpse, that has built a secure software platform for users to manage and share their own medical records, Fast Company learned Monday. The acquisition reportedly happened earlier this year, but Apple’s been quiet about it and has now issued its usual non-denial, saying: “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.” According to the official Gliimpse website, the firm wants to help all 317 million people in America to “liberate their health by liberating their data.” Silicon Valley-based Gliimpse was started in 2013 by entrepreneur Anil Sethi, who worked as as a systems engineer at Apple in the late 1980s. Sethi explains he founded Gliimpse after witnessing his sister’s battle with breast cancer and realizing how challenging it is to acquire and manage one’s personal health data. As a consumer of healthcare, I leave behind a bread-crumb-trail of medical info wherever I’ve been seen. But, I’m unable to easily access or share my own data. Obamacare is one of several forcing functions federally mandating physicians and hospitals give us our data: meds, labs, allergies… you get the idea. However, there’s no single Electronic Health Record that all physicians use, sigh. Worse, there isn’t even a common file format across a 1000+ systems. Gliimpse technology is particularly aimed at patients with diseases like cancer and diabetes. It’s unclear how the acquisition might fit into Apple’s existing HealthKit, ResearchKit and CareKit software platforms. If you ask Tim Cook, Apple for now remains focused on the non-regulated side of health care, which in his personal opinion has tremendous revenue potential. “So if you don’t care about reimbursement, which we have the privilege of doing, that may even make the smartphone market look small,” he told Fast Company in an earlier interview.

Restart work at Emu Apple, which forms part of the Company’s recently acquired Kincora assets in the Roma shelf in Queensland, was completed safely and well below budget.  Emu Apple-1 well is currently producing at a rate of approximately 50 bpd.   The Emu Apple Field covers an area of 1.3 km2.  As first reported by the Company in its 7 October 2015 Target’s Statement, based on an independent report received by Risc Operations Pty Ltd on 30 September 2015, the Emu Apple-1 well is estimated to contain approximately 100,000 bbl of remaining recoverable oil in a 4 way dip closed structure in the Jurassic aged Boxvale Sandstone at a depth of 1400 metres. Armour’s Kincora Project covers 6 historic oil fields that have historically produced 2.9 mmbbls oil.  Armour has identified 5 wells with untested logged oil pay behind casing which was never tested, and further untested appraisal areas in the existing fields. Armour aims to re-enter and test the best of these opportunities as part of its campaign to bring the Kincora project up to full development status. Armour recently announced an increase in resources for the Kincora Project which offer the Company the potential to transform into a significant gas and oil producer.   Robbert de Weijer, Armour’s CEO, commented: “starting oil production from the Emu Apple field marks a key milestone for Armour.  We are now generating our first cash flow and, due to our low cost structure, we should generate a very healthy margin from each barrel that we produce.  Our operations team did a great job as the re-start of oil production was achieved without a glitch. This bodes well for the re-start of gas production which we are aiming to achieve by the end of this year.’ Nick Mather, Executive Chairman, said: “the Roma Shelf has historically spawned numerous oil and gas companies such has Hartogen, Crusader, Beach, AOG and Bridge and it goes on giving.  Armour will be the next.  Armour's advantage is a new generation of 3D seismic techniques to find oil and gas here and very efficient field development and oil and gas recovery techniques. Clearly there are many more oil and gas pools here. Historically 37% of wildcats on the Roma Shelf have been discoveries. That’s an enviable record.” Source: Company Press Release Share: Latest News Statoil reports fire break out on drilling rig in Norwegian Sea Oil & Gas > Drilling & Production > News Revelation: Nominees of the INTERGAS Awards 2016 Oil & Gas > Drilling & Production > News Rowan, Saudi Aramco partner to set up new offshore drilling company Oil & Gas > Drilling & Production > News Castleton acquires Anadarko's East Texas assets for $1bn Oil & Gas > Drilling & Production > News Total, SOCAR sign deal to develop Absheron discovery in Caspian sea Oil & Gas > Drilling & Production > News Related News Related Sectors Oil & Gas> Drilling & Production Related Dates 2016> August Related Industries Energy and Utilities> Commodity> Oil Energy and Utilities> Upstream Energy> Production Select a Energy sector ------------------------ Drilling & Production Exploration & Development Refining & Petrochemicals Transportation & Storage ------------------------ Biofuels & Biomass Fossil Fuel Geothermal Hydro Nuclear Solar Wind ------------------------ Utilities Network Utilities Retail ------------------------ Carbon Coal Minerals & Materials Nuclear Fuels Drilling & Production News Related Insight Suppliers Directory Spotlight Suppliers By Sector A-Z PM Piping - Tailor Made Packages of Piping Materials The companies of the Project Materials Group supply steel products to engineering contractors and operators in the energy market.

The singer reveals she recently approached Apple boss Tim Cook and asked him to make sure the company's all-knowing voice helper got her name right. "She pronounces my name wrong - it's Streisand with a soft 's', like sand on the beach," the singer and actress tells U.S. radio network NPR. "I've been saying this for my whole career. "So what did I do? I called the head of Apple, Tim Cook, and he delightfully agreed to have Siri change the pronunciation of my name, finally, with the next update on September 30th. So let's see if that happens, because I would be thrilled." In the new interview, the diva also promotes her new album, ENCORE: Movie Partners Sing Broadway, which features duets with Hugh Jackman, Jamie Foxx, Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin, and Antonio Banderas, among others. Barbra admits she really enjoyed singing Climb Every Mountain with Foxx, explaining, "A great song for me is one I can act, that I can go into character for... (With Climb Every Mountain) I was trying to find a way into something that was very well known and trying to find a new way into the lyric." And she faced a challenge performing Anything You Can Do from the musical Annie, Get Your Gun with Ghostbusters star Melissa McCarthy, revealing, "She said, 'Barbra, I can't sing!' I said, 'We'll make you sing'. We kind of adapted the song to her and me and we got it the way I think is right." The odd couple got along famously in the studio and the song ends with McCarthy asking, "Can I call you Babs now?" to which her new pal jokes, "No, too soon!" The new album is released on 26 August (16). © WENN Newsdesk 2016 Previous: Beetlejuice musical in the works Next: Guitarist Tom Searle loses cancer battle at 28 MORE FROM ENTERTAINMENT NEWS WATCH: Heinz baked beans advert BANNED for being too dangerous 23rd Nov 16 | Entertainment News Heinz have had a baked bean advert banned from TV screens after health and safety concerns.

Streisand was having some trouble with how her name was pronounced by Siri, so, being the star that she is, she directly called Apple CEO Tim Cook with her grievances and asked to get it fixed. Cook obliged and told her that the fix would roll out with the next update on September 30. Streisand said this in an interview with NPR, "She pronounces my name wrong! [It's] Streisand with a soft 's' like sand on the beach, I've been saying this for my whole career. So what did I do? I called the head of Apple, Tim Cook. And he delightfully agreed to have Siri change the pronunciation of my name finally with the next update on September 30th." Now, if Cook is talking about the big iOS 10 update, then the September 30 date is a major delay from Apple's traditional launch of mid-September - or almost immediately after the launch of the new iPhone. Like previous releases, iOS 10 is expected to be launched alongside the next iPhone, and if what Streisand says is true, then Apple's earlier deadline of a September 16 market launch appears to be untrue.Past leaks suggest that Apple is expected to host an event on September 7 for the unveil of the iPhone 7 and also release iOS 10. It is said to make the smartphone available in the market by September 16. Carriers are tipped to make it available by September 23. Of course, Cook could just be talking about an update to iOS 10 (and Siri) that may be scheduled to roll out soon after its commercial release. There seems to be very little clarity on this September 30 date, but we hope to know more as time progresses. In any case, iOS 10 is bringing along a host of new features like the iMessage, Apple Music, Maps, and Photos app overhaul; and the third-party Siri integration. It is also introducing as many as 100 new emojis with the software update. These emojis look to represent professional women better and promote LGBT rights.

Advertisement In the next five years, a majority of U.S. consumers will have bought a Chinese-brand smartphone. Such a prospect may raise the hackles of purported American patriots and presidential candidates, but it's reality. Outside of Apple and Samsung, Chinese brands rule the global smartphone market. LG gets a hand in from time to time, Blackberry isn't dead yet, and Nokia keeps bouncing from one identity crisis to another -- but the trend is irreversible. Yet ask any consumer in the U.S. to name a smartphone that isn't Apple, or at the very least one that isn't Apple or Korean. There's only one way for Chinese brands to go from here. That's why their pending dominance is a fact, not just speculation or fear mongering. Popular Now What the 2016 Elections Mean for Manufacturers Millennial Recruiting Magic: Solutions from Manufacturers Large and Small The Great Manufacturing Employment Challenge Just as television makers Zenith, Motorola and RCA were eventually replaced by Japanese names like Sony, Sharp and Panasonic, so too will Chinese brands overtake the U.S. market. The latest entrant looks set to be Xiaomi. The richly valued upstart appears ready to dip its toes in one of the world's most important electronics markets. While China is larger by volume, the U.S. is lucrative because average device prices are much higher. In an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday, Xiaomi's vice president and international front man Hugo Barra said a U.S. move is inevitable: "We will lead with social media, with the channels that allow us to get in touch with the young generation that are enthusiastic about new technology. We are definitely going there." Xiaomi's entry into the U.S. has been in doubt on concern that the Chinese company, which has been widely criticized as a wholesale copycat of Apple and others, would immediately face intellectual property lawsuits. However, Xiaomi's purchase this summer of around 1,500 patents from Microsoft seems to have quelled those worries and given the Beijing startup the courage to move directly onto Apple's home turf. The Chinese company won't be short of compatriots. ZTE, the world's number six smartphone brand, is fourth in the U.S., while TCL-Alcatel holds fifth spot. And then there's Huawei, now the world's number three, which will start selling its latest device under the Honor brand later this week. With solid technology, financial muscle and global aspirations, expect to see more of Huawei in the U.S. in years to come. What's significant about a Xiaomi move is that along with the brand, the company is likely to bring the same business model that emaciated profits in the Chinese smartphone market: namely, direct online sales, social media-focused marketing and razor-thin margins. That model has proven so compelling that Lenovo (which now owns Motorola's smartphone business) and Huawei have both incorporated it into their own strategies, while Oppo and Vivo are key beneficiaries. With ever fewer differences between Android models, this price fight portends declining share for Apple and Samsung. Samsung and Apple combined U.S. market share is 59%. This means that Chinese expansion will result in the U.S. starting to look a lot like every other market in the world. Whereas Apple and Samsung hold a combined 59% of the U.S. market, according to Counterpoint Research, they have just a 33% share worldwide. Global slots three through seven are all Chinese. So while the nostalgic may decry the rise of China, they still need to face the fact that the U.S. smartphone industry has passed its zenith. By Tim Culpan.

One of its older product lines is the Airport Extreme wireless router — first introduced in 2003 and now in its sixth generation. Source: Brad Moon Last year was (and this year will be) a year in which many home Wi-Fi routers were replaced. The new 802.11ac (Gigabit) Wi-Fi standard has gone mainstream and that means the potential for big Wi-Fi speed gains for those who replace their older routers. Apple’s Gigabit Wi-Fi router solution is the Airport Extreme. 5 Things that Should Worry McDonald’s Stock Owners It’s coming up on two years old, so it’s missing some of the latest wireless tech like tri-band radios. Given its age, is the Apple Airport worth considering? I tested the Airport Extreme against the previous generation version and also compared it to one of the current “it” routers (the Linksys WRT 1900AC) to find out.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) has a long list of innovative products under its belt, and AAPL stock has made many investors rich as a result. From the first mass-market digital music player in the iPod to the first tablet in the iPad to its iconic iPhone smartphone, Apple is at the core of consumer electronics in the 21st century. Source: Yanki01 via Flickr (Modified) However, it’s undeniable that the days of bold new products are mostly behind Apple Inc., and that the high growth of AAPL stock in the mid-2000s is now a thing of the past. This is evidenced not just by the first-ever decline in iPhone sales this year, as well as the fact that AAPL stock is down 7% in the past 12 months versus a 4% gain for the S&P 500 in the same period. Of course, the bulls will point to a recent surge in Apple stock since the spring lows and news such as a (reportedly) waterproof iPhone 7 or hopes of a new iPad Pro as a sign that the king of consumer tech isn’t done improving its hardware. How Much Is Twitter Stock Worth? (TWTR) But while Apple isn’t going bankrupt anytime soon, it’s worth noting serious pressures on AAPL stock as it looks to defend its market share — and its bottom line. iPhone Sales Are Key to AAPL Stock Defenders of AAPL stock contend that reaching a plateau in iPhone sales in 2016 isn’t the end of the company. However, it’s crucial to understand the importance of the smartphone in regards to the whole of Apple. In short, iPhone sales are the lion’s share of Apple Inc.’s business. Consider that in the three months ending in June, Apple earnings showed iPhones made up 56% of the company’s top line. With numbers like like that, you can’t afford to have a backslide on iPhone sales. There are high hopes for the iPhone 7, but research firm Gartner recently published a rather disturbing report that shows competitor Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) is taking advantage of Apple’s slowing momentum to gobble up share. Specifically, even as global smartphone sales rose 4.3% in Q2, Apple saw a 7.7% decline in volume. Worse, it has seen its total market share slip significantly form 14.6% to just 12.9% year-over-year according to Gartner, even as Samsung has gone from 21.8% to 22.3% share. We can chalk this up to the upgrade cycle and anticipation of the iPhone 7 if you want. However, the fact remains that there isn’t much room for error at AAPL given the importance of its flagship smartphone to total sales and profits. Apple Is Far From a Buy No, Apple Inc. isn’t going bankrupt. And yes, with a 2.1% dividend and forward price-to-earnings ratio of less than 13, there are far worse investments out there than Apple. Walmart Stock Might Finally Be Out of the Woods But that doesn’t make AAPL stock a buy. If anything, I would consider taking your profits off the table and waiting out this tech giant right now. Because if recent iPhone numbers are any indicator, the iPhone 7 launch may not be enough to satisfy Wall Street later this year.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Continues to Dominate the Premium Smartphone Market | Main | One Mysterious Death outside of Foxconn's iPhone Plant Reported » August 22, 2016 Samsung to Copy Apple's Premium Brand Refurbishing Smartphone Program in 2017   In June Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple's Refurbished iPhone Program Rolled into Korea this week …" The report noted that South Korea's "CJ HelloVision had gone with this trend and made a good performance in April by selling refurbished iPhone 5s. It also had sold refurbished iPhone 6S Plus at the end of last month and its supplies were sold out within just 2 weeks. This was meaningful that it sold all of its supplies through online without any advertisements even though there weren't much supplies to begin with. So does it come as any surprise that Samsung is now planning to copy Apple's new recycling trend?   For many, the iPhone is still the most coveted premium smartphone for it's perfect blend of style and advanced software. Many would prefer to own a slightly older iPhone than a mid level Samsung smartphone – just like some would prefer to own an older Mercedes than a new Ford. Hot brands hold value.   And though Samsung is number two in high-end smartphone sales, the Korean copycat or "fast follower" as they prefer to be referred as, Reuter reports today that Samsung could have a similar smartphone recycling offering by sometime next year   The Reuters report states that "The South Korean technology firm is looking for ways to sustain earnings momentum after reviving its mobile profits by restructuring its product line-up. As growth in the global smartphone market hits a plateau, Samsung wants to maximize its cost efficiency and keep operating margins above 10 percent.   The world's top smartphone maker will refurbish high-end phones returned to the company by users who signed up for one-year upgrade programs in markets such as South Korea and the United States.   Rival Apple Inc's iPhone has a re-sale value of around 69 percent of its original price after about one year from launch, while Samsung's flagship Galaxy sells for 51 percent of the original price in the U.S. market, according to BNP Paribas.   Because Apple has a limited numbers of iPhone models, their refurbished line-up acts as a valid mid-tier offering. On the flip-side, Reuters notes that the risk for Samsung in "offering refurbished devices is that they could potentially cannibalize sales of other mid-tier devices." In other words, it's kind of lamebrain idea for Samsung to think that what works for Apple will always work for Samsung, especially when Samsung has multiple new mid-tier phones on the market already.   While there's a definite market for a slightly older Mercedes just as there is for a refurbished iPhone, the jury is out as to whether Samsung will be able to successfully pull off a similar refurbished smartphone program in the future.

Cabral/Dubai Filed on August 22, 2016 Share More > Vote Samsung maintained its market share lead over Apple in the second quarter of 2016 - 22.3 per cent versus 12.9 per cent. (Reuters file) Samsung maintains overall lead in sales and market share, Gartner report says In the second quarter of 2016, global smartphone sales edged up 4.3 per cent. Apple, however, saw its sales skid for the third straight period. A new report from Gartner revealed that global smartphone sales hit 344.36 million in the three-month period, a 4.3 per cent increase from the corresponding quarter in 2015. Overall sales for mobile phones, however, retreated a modest 0.5 per cent with only five manufacturers from the top 10 - Samsung and China's Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi and BBK - showing growth. The report added that all mature markets aside from Japan witness slowing demand for smartphones, leading to a 4.9 per cent decline in sales. Emerging regions, however, provided the much-needed lift. Save for Latin America, these areas posted a 9.9 per cent growth in sales. Here's how the top five stacked up during the quarter: Check out that 129% rocket Oppo is riding on. Now here's how it looks like when market share is discussed: As you may have noticed, Apple's in the red in both metrics, and that's already for the third consecutive quarter. The company already slid from 51.63 million units and a 14.8 per cent market share from the first quarter, and 71.526 million and 17.7 per cent during the fourth quarter of 2015. Apple sales dropped in North America - its biggest market, no less - as well as in Western Europe. The decline was worst in Greater China and mature Asia-Pacific regions, where sales dived 26 per cent. Eurasia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe were Apple's strong suit, as sales soared 95 per cent year-on-year. There could be a little explanation to this. "Demand for premium smartphones slowed in the second quarter of 2016 as consumers wait for new hardware launches in the second half of the year, Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner, said in the report. Additionally, the decline in sales of feature phones - down 14 per cent - boosted the decline in overall sales. What propped up Samsung is the fact that its Galaxy A and J series went well against its Chinese rivals. Its new smartphone portfolio also helped it win back market share it lost in emerging markets. Oppo's remarkable figure was helped by strong sales of its R9 device both in China and overseas. Oh, and don't forget about its offerings. "Features such as an anti-shake camera optimised for selfies and rapid-charge technology helped Oppo carve a niche market for itself and boost sales in a highly-competitive and commoditised smartphone market," Gupta said. As far as operating systems are concerned, Android retained its dominance in the second quarter, lording it over with an 86.2 per cent market share, up from 82.2 per cent a year ago. Way behind are Apple's iOS (12.9 per cent), Windows (0.6 per cent), BlackBerry (0.1 per cent) and others (0.2 per cent). A number of key Android players, such as Samsung with its Galaxy S7, unveiled their new high-end devices. However, Chinese brands such as Huawei and Oppo are also pushing their premium lines with more affordable offerings. "Google is evolving the Android platform fast, which allows Android players to remain at the cutting-edge of smartphone technology," Gartner research director Roberta Cozza said. "Facing a highly-commoditised market, Google's focus is to further expand and diversify the Android platform with additional functionalities, like virtual reality, enabling more intelligent experiences and reach into wearables, connected home devices, in-car entertainment and TV." - alvin@khaleejtimes.com Share More > Vote MORE FROM Technology Technology How to use technology to help kids ease back into ...

The audio system is called the XAV-AX100 and brings lots of smartphone connectivity to your car. The AX100 has high-powered sound and ExtraBass technology and has a knob to adjust volume. Knobs are better for controls like volume than touch sensors because you can adjust the volume without taking your eyes off the road. Apple CarPlay functionality allows the driver to use their smartphone to access apps like Maps and Apple Music. Users can also make phone calls and send messages via the touchscreen on the audio system or using Siri. Android Auto functionality lets drivers control music, maps, and other features via the touchscreen on the AX100. Sony uses 55W x 4 Dynamic Reality Amp 2 and Extra Bass technology to overcome engine noise and produce clear sound at any volume level while delivering punchy bass. Sony integrates 3-pre out connectivity to expand the system to work with external amps and supports a wide range of speaker connections. Sony also integrates Dynamic Stage Organizer tech to help overcome the acoustic disadvantage of front-door mounted, full range speakers that can sound muddy or unclear. DSO tech adjusts the signal to create the illusion of dash-mounted virtual speakers. The audio system appears to be a double DIN size and will launch in late November in North America. The XAV-AX100 audio system will retail for $499.99.

The South Korean technology firm is looking for ways to sustain earnings momentum after reviving its mobile profits by restructuring its product line-up. As growth in the global smartphone market hits a plateau, Samsung wants to maximize its cost efficiency and keep operating margins above 10 percent. The world’s top smartphone maker will refurbish high-end phones returned to the company by users who signed up for one-year upgrade programs in markets such as South Korea and the United States. Samsung would then re-sell these phones at a lower price, the person said, declining to be identified as the plan was not yet public. The person declined to say how big a discount the refurbished phones would be sold at, which markets the phones would be sold in or how many refurbished devices Samsung could sell. A Samsung spokeswoman said the company does not comment on speculation. It was not clear to what extent the phones would be altered, but refurbished phones typically are fitted with parts such as a new casing or battery. Rival Apple Inc’s iPhone has a re-sale value of around 69 percent of its original price after about one year from launch, while Samsung’s flagship Galaxy sells for 51 percent of the original price in the U.S. market, according to BNP Paribas. Refurbished phones could help vendors such as Samsung boost their presence in emerging markets such as India, where high-end devices costing $800 or so are beyond most buyers. Apple sells refurbished iPhones in a number of markets including the United States, but does not disclose sales figures. It is trying to sell such iPhones in India, where the average smartphone sells for less than $90. Selling used phones could help Samsung fend off lower-cost Chinese rivals that have been eating into its market share, and free up some capital to invest elsewhere or boost marketing expenditure. Deloitte says the used smartphone market will be worth more than $17 billion this year, with 120 million devices sold or traded in to manufacturers or carriers – around 8 percent of total smartphone sales. Some market experts expect the used market to grow fast as there are fewer technology breakthroughs. “Some consumers may prefer to buy refurbished, used premium models in lieu of new budget brands, possibly cannibalizing sales of new devices from those budget manufacturers,” Deloitte said in a report. CANNIBALIZATION RISK Samsung’s refurbishment program, details of which the person said could be finalised as early as 2017, could help the firm generate revenue from dated high-end smartphones returned by users upgrading to newer versions. The company’s latest premium phones, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy Note 7, have received favorable reviews, suggesting cheaper, refurbished versions could be popular. At U.S. carrier Verizon Communications, the Galaxy S7 edge with 32-gigabyte storage retails for $792 without subsidies, while the Note 7 costs $864. The program could help Samsung defend market share in emerging countries by bolstering mid-tier sales. Refurbished phones could also appeal to enterprise clients who want certain security or software products pre-installed on phones to give to their employees, the source said. The risk of offering refurbished devices is that they could potentially cannibalize sales of Samsung’s other mid-tier devices. Expectations for solid smartphone sales helped Samsung shares to a record 1.675 million won each on Friday, taking two-day gains to 7 percent and adding $15 billion in market value. The shares traded down 0.36 percent in Seoul on Monday. – Reuters Related Posts WhatsApp rolls out new features The popular instant messenger app has released a bunch of new features for the Android version.

Thanks to J for the additional info. Apple is complementing its redesigned and renamed Apple Stores with changes to the staffing roles, according to sources. We first heard last week that the changes would be announced on Sunday, along with a new credo. Hearing that there is a big deal Apple Retail Store meeting Sunday. Details coming soon to @9to5mac #credo — Seth Weintraub (@llsethj) August 17, 2016 Three new positions are being introduced as of February 2017, while other roles are being renamed … The three new positions are: Pro, a new top-level sales position Creative Pro, a mid-level position providing training & support to customers Technical Expert, a new support position between Technical Specialist and Genius It’s believed Creative Pros will have a deeper knowledge of some products than Creatives, as well as greater familiarity with apps used by photographers, videographers and musicians.   The Technical Expert position appears to be designed to free up Geniuses for more complex troubleshooting and repairs. Technical Experts will carry out problem-solving across a range of products, and repairs on iPhones only. More complex issues, and repairs on other products, will continue to be referred to Geniuses. A MacRumors report echoes what our own sources tell us, and adds that some existing roles are also being renamed. If accurate, the new store hierarchies within the three areas affected will be these, from most senior down: Sales Pro / Expert / Specialist (currently Red Zone Specialist) Creative Creative Lead / Creative Pro / Creative Technical Lead Genius / Genius / Technical Expert / Technical Specialist (currently Family Room Specialist) In addition, Business Specialists will be known as Business Experts, Back-of-House Specialist will be known as Operations Specialists and Inventory Specialists will become Operations Experts. The sales area – currently known as the Red Zone – will be renamed as the Product Zone, and the behind-the-scenes area will be changed from Back-of-House to Backstage. Finally, the revised credo is written rather more poetically than the previous version: Enriching lives We are here to enrich lives. To help dreamers become doers, to help passion expand human potential, to do the best work of our lives. At our best We give more than we take. From the planet, to the person beside us. We become a place to belong where everyone is welcome. Everyone. We draw strength from our differences. From background and perspective to collaboration and debate. We are open. We redefine expectations. First for ourselves, then for the world. Because we’re a little crazy. Because “good enough” isn’t. Because what we do says who we are. We find courage. To try and to fail, to learn and to grow, to figure out what’s next, to imagine the unimaginable, to do it all over again tomorrow. At our core We believe our soul is our people. People who recognize themselves in each other. People who shine a spotlight only to stand outside it. People who work to leave this world better than they found it. People who live to enrich lives. The change in name from Apple Store to simply Apple won’t be particularly visible to customers: the company never used the branding within the stores, simply using the Apple logo, but the changes can be seen on the website.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Health Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones This actor was spotted using unreleased iPhone 7; what to expect from Apple's next flagship? Apple iPhone 7 with dual camera snapped in the wild. Sami Khan   August 22, 2016 17:05 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares Top 4 changes expected in Apple's upcoming flagshipsReuters If you are eagerly waiting for the year's biggest smartphone release by Apple, the days are not too far. The all-new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are expected to be launched at an event on Sept. 7, revealing all the details about the upcoming flagships, including the much-rumoured specs, price and availability. Before that happens, there is an exciting leak about the new iPhone that is worth checking out. A popular Taiwanese actor, Jimmy Lin, who happens to be one of the most prominent Apple iPhone tipster, posted a photo of himself posing with the unreleased iPhone 7, which appears to be the bigger variant as the dual camera setup can easily be seen at the back, BGR reported. Why advertise with us? Related IPhone 7 release date, specs: Leaked camera details of new iPhones look promising Apple iPhone 7 series gets spied ahead of release; leaked images reveal key design elements There isn't much to share about the device in the leaked photo, as Lin's palm covers most of the handset. But a partial Apple logo just below the camera pretty much confirms that it is indeed the upcoming iPhone 7 Plus. Lin also has a good track record of leaking unreleased iPhones, as he had posted a selfie posing with iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 back in 2012. Based on earlier rumours about the iPhone 7 Plus, besides the dual camera setup, the 2016 flagship is also said to feature Smart Connector pins at the bottom rear panel, which cannot be seen in the latest photo. The new iPhone pair is also expected to come without a 3.5mm headphone jack, relocated antenna bands and new Space Black and Deep Blue colour options. There have been reports that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus won't undergo major design changes, but bring much-needed hardware upgrades. A new 256GB variant is said to be offered in the new iPhones and the base model storage is expected to be bumped up to 32GB. The RAM size will also see an increase to 3GB and the highly-expected A10 chipset will power the handsets. While the launch of the new iPhones is expected to take place in Cupertino, California, on Sept. 7, both the phones will go on sale starting Sept. 23.

This is all the stuff we’re getting anyway, but what do we really want from Apple? The number of rumours that are circulating this time around hide as much as they reveal. We’ve heard of an iPhone 6SE, an iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, a dropped Pro model, a MacBook with an OLED strip, dual-cameras and much more. I’d like to ignore all of that for a moment and focus on what I want to see from Apple’s upcoming event. A sensible iPhone Plus for once Before anything else, I’d like to see Apple announce that they WILL NOT eliminate the 3.5mm jack. Ever. Phones like the OnePlus 3 have comfortably bundled a 3.5mm jack alongside USB audio and there’s no reason for Apple to not do so. What’s the point of harbouring the world’s best designers if all they can do is eliminate stuff that’s aesthetically inconvenient? How is a lightning jack more convenient than a 3.5mm headphone jack? Once that’s out of the way, I really want to see Apple show some more love to the Plus model iPhones. In fact, the 5.5-inch iPhone 6S Plus is about the same size as the 5.7-inch Nexus 6P. The iPhone Plus models are unwieldy and their design can easily be improved upon. I wish Apple would realise that the Plus model isn’t just a larger iPhone, it’s a different iPhone. It needs more powerful hardware, a hardware redesign and some UI tweaks. Reachability is nowhere near as useful as a back button. My biggest gripe with the Plus models is the inability to disable just the homescreen rotation. It can’t be that hard to implement a toggle for that. An iPad that you can actually work on Apple seems to be trying to reposition the iPad as a device for professionals. It’s an idea I like, but one that is badly implemented. As we’ve written in the past, the iPad Pro models should have been designed to run MacOS by default. iOS is nice, but it’s not as powerful as MacOS and iOS still lacks the flexibility that a professional would need. Couldn’t Apple have come up with a better way of charging the Pencil? In keeping with the “Pro” theme, I’d love to see Apple actually think about their Pencil and Keyboard. The Pencil uses a truly retarded charging mechanism and worse, it’s smooth and perfectly cylindrical. You can’t place the Pencil on a flat surface for it rolling off somewhere and you can’t put it in your pocket because it’ll just pop out. The Keyboard cover is worse. It’s slim enough, but the design means you can’t use the iPad on your lap and worse still, it’s not backlit. Both accessories focus more on aesthetics than ergonomics, which is very bad if you’re targeting professionals. Microsoft’s Surface Pro lineup is the more sensible option by far, and at least as elegant. I’d also love to see an iPad Mini Pro with a Pencil that can actually clamp onto the device. The Mini is almost perfect for note-taking and doodling, and more portable than the other iPad options. Retina MacBook Air, an upgradeable Mac Pro and more The Apple MacBook Air This one’s kind of obvious, but why is it that the only device without a Retina display in Apple’s entire line-up is the MacBook Air? It’s a gorgeous device, sturdily built and priced like any other Apple device. However, it’s also the only modern Apple device with a measly TN panel and without a retina display. It’s the perfect compromise between the MacBook Pro and the MacBook. It deserves better. Gorgeous, elegant, neglected and stubbornly inflexible; the Apple Mac Pro It also speaks volumes for Apple’s priorities that their most neglected device is the Mac Pro. This device was last updated in 2013 and PCs that are half the price are now more powerful. I’d like to see an updated Mac Pro this year, but, more importantly, I’d love to see Apple allow for more flexibility with the Mac Pro. If Apple won’t update the device, they should at least let users upgrade the hardware themselves. Apple doesn’t need to floor the world with a mind-blowing revelation this September. A little bit of housekeeping will also do. Tags: Apple, Apple iPad, Apple iPhone, apple macbook, Apple Macbook Pro, Apple Wishlist, Apple. Mac, Apple.

Fast forward 24 months, and major shifts have taken place. Xiaomi, the world's second-most valuable private tech start-up which made its name by selling online through flash sales and creating social media buzz, is getting attacked by upstarts using traditional bricks and mortar stores to sell smartphones. Meanwhile, Apple, which had been doing steady business in China, is facing intense competition from nimbler players. Oppo and Vivo – two Chinese handset makers owned by BBK Electronics Corporation – are making a big impact, attracting young buyers wanting low-cost but high-spec smartphones, the audience that Xiaomi once had a hold on. Xiaomi had a 13.3 percent market share in China in the second quarter of 2014. That now stands at 11.2 percent, according to data from Counterpoint Research. Meanwhile, Oppo's market share grew from 2.7 percent to 18 percent in the same period, while Vivo's increased from 2.2 percent to 14.9 percent. "We tried the online thing, but it wasn't getting the traction we wanted, so we had to look back at strategy and we took a chance and we invested into point of sales presence. We localized everything and from there it really helped us build a stronger brand presence," Michael Tran, director of global strategy at Oppo, told CNBC in a phone interview last week. "Consumers want to touch and play with the device, they want to know there will be someone there if there are issues." Both Oppo and Vivo focus their products around high-performance cameras and audio. Oppo's flagship R9 smartphone is marketed as the "selfie expert" with a 16 megapixel front facing camera, fingerprint sensor, and a design very similar to Apple's iPhone 6. But the handset retails at 2,799 yuan ($420), much more cheaper than the $800-plus price tag for Apple's flagship device. Tran explains that Oppo has over 320,000 physical points of sale in the markets it operates in which includes China, Australia, India and a number of other South-East Asian countries. Oppo and Vivo have both stepped up their marketing efforts. The brands have partnered with major fashion companies, celebrities and sporting tournaments to help boost their name among millennials. 'Muddled' strategy Oppo and Vivo's growth has come at the expense of Xiaomi and even Apple, with the U.S. technology giant suffering declining revenues in China in recent quarters. Analysts said that Apple has suffered from the fact that operators have been reducing their subsidies, making the iPhone less attractive from a price perspective, as well as the likes of Oppo and Vivo producing affordable premium handsets. Xiaomi meanwhile suffered an attack in the online sales space from a brand called Honor, which is owned by Huawei, the world's third-largest smartphone player by shipments. Over the past two years, the Chinese company has been expanding its product portfolio, releasing products from rice cookers to segways. These products are produced with partners but with Xiaomi branding. Oppo Oppo's R9 flagship smartphone with fingerprint scanning technology It has also tried to expand to new areas like India and Brazil but suffered setbacks in both markets. Ericsson hit Xiaomi with a patent infringement lawsuit in India, while the handset maker said this year it was reducing its operations in Brazil. The release of new products, rather than a focus on their core smartphone business, has hurt the company, analysts said. "Xiaomi's strategy is completely muddled. They had three years to invest in R&D in smartphones but they chose to become more of an Internet of Things company and flood the market with new products which are less meaningful from an operational perspective," Neil Shah, research director for devices and ecosystems at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC by phone. Xiaomi comeback? But Xiaomi is fighting back and hoping to reverse its decline in fortunes by opening physical stores, a change in strategy from what made it so popular in the first place. "We already have built about 30 flagship offline stores, these are experience-based stores that you'll find in large urban environments…but we are even already experimenting with opening these experiential flagship stores in third and fourth tier Chinese cities," Hugo Barra, vice president of international at Xiaomi, told CNBC in a TV interview on Friday. "Our approach to even entering the more traditional retail market which is offline is very very different, it's very unique. We think that we have a pretty good shot at reinventing offline retail, just like we reinvented online retail for cellphones here in China." But the risk is that more stores will lead to higher operational costs and Xiaomi losing the one advantage it once had – price. "Once you are relegated in mindshare to a low-cost cheap device maker, if you open offline stores that add to operating costs, that means your price of devices increase. The only advantage you had which was cost leadership will go," Shah said. This article was updated after an Oppo spokesman corrected the number of points of sale that Oppo has.

I noted in that report that Gartner's numbers were based on general worldwide "volume shipments" while Kantar's earlier report focused on the high-end of the smartphone market where Apple remains king. Android fans got their nose out of joint stating that I was "moving the goal posts to apple's favor by comparing individual sales of the phones." Duh, Apple doesn't participate in every niche within the smartphone market because they're a premium brand OEM. So comparing Apple's high-end to Samsung's high-end directly is a legitimate statistic.   Apple isn't only the leader in the high-end of the market, they're the profit leader by the widest of margins. Fortune noted in February of this year that "With 17.2% of the smartphone market in 2015, Apple captured 91% of the profit. Samsung, with 23.9% of the market, took 14% of the profit. Fortune further noted in their report that "Apple, however, just keeps clearing the table. It took 91% of what [Canaccord Genuity analyst] Walkley calls the mobile market's "value share" in four of the past five quarters. In the fifth, it took 93%.   Another report has surfaced today from Business Korea confirming that Apple is still the number one high-end smartphone leader, despite Samsung making positive strides in challenging Apple.   The report specifically noted that "According to Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) which provides research service on August 21, IDC, a market survey company estimated that in the second quarter of this year, Samsung recorded a market share of 35.9%, up 4.4%p from a year before in the global high-end smartphone (US$ 500 or higher) market. By contrast, Apple's market share dropped by 9.2%p to 50.9%." This in a year where Samsung put out their best smartphone in more than two years against Apple's mild upgrade in the form of the iPhone 6s line-up.   Even at the top end, Samsung has one more model than Apple with their Note 7 that supports handwriting with their S Pen. While Apple has reportedly dropped going with an iPhone Pro for this year, it may be something that surfaces in the future which could level the playing field in terms of the number of high-end models each company sells. With a unit that supports handwriting and the Apple Pencil, Apple would only increase their lead at the high-end with Samsung.   But for now, even with Samsung having an extra model at the high end, Apple is still king of the premium smartphone, the most profitable smartphone on the planet.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.     Posted by Jack Purcher on August 22, 2016 at 05:18 AM in 5.
