This is a global number and shows sales have continuously gone downhill over the last eight quarters. It is also the longest duration of a decline in the history of the PC, according to Gartner. On a global scale, Lenovo takes the sales lead in the third quarter of 2016 with a 20.9-percent market share, down 2.4 percent from the same quarter in 2015. HP fell into second place with a 20.4-percent market share followed by Dell (14.7 percent), Asus (7.8 percent), Apple (7.2 percent), and Acer (6.7 percent). Out of this group, Apple and Acer took nasty hits to the wallet with a 13.4-percent and 16.2-percent drop, respectively, while the HP/Dell/Asus trio gained over 2.3 percent. Related: Gartner: The era of double-digit smartphone growth is over Additionally, when the batch of PC manufacturers that fall under the ‘others’ umbrella are thrown into the mix, the total growth in the third quarter of 2016 is a negative 5.7 percent. In the United States, the decline is not quite so drastic but still present, as the local PC-market growth only dropped a mere 0.3 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015. On a more detailed level, HP actually took the lead in the third quarter of 2016 here in the U.S. The company commanded 29.7 percent of the market, up 3.1 percent from the same quarter in 2015. Dell fell into second place with a 24-percent share followed by Lenovo (14.1 percent), Apple (12.9 percent), and Asus (5.1 percent). Of this group, Lenovo saw the biggest gains with a 15.3-percent rise in units sold while Apple was hit the hardest with a 10.7-percent plunge. According to the report, the Asia/Pacific region saw 24.7 million units sold in the third quarter of 2016, down 7.6 percent from the same quarter in 2015. While the number of units sold in China is unknown, that market reportedly took a 4.8-percent plunge. The Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) market saw 19.2 million units sold with a 3.3- percent decline, and the United States saw 16.2 million units sold for a 0.3-percent decline. “The stabilization of the PC business market was a key factor for HP Inc.’s shipment growth, as a majority of its revenue was generated from the business segment,” Gartner said on Tuesday. “Dell’s shipment growth exceeded the regional average in most regions.” The numbers were a bit surprising given the back-to-school season. However, the firm said that campaigns targeting students have become less effective. Even more, the consumer market is saturated with PCs, thus customers are not really out to purchase new units. Even more, parents are handing older devices down to their children. Parents may even be purchasing Chromebooks, which were not included in Gartner’s market study. Right now, Gartner’s current report is based on preliminary findings. The full set of numbers will be provided within the firm’s PC Quarterly Statistics Worldwide by Region program. Regardless, the report is just one more negative mark slapped on the PC industry. Also watch: V-Moda Purchased By Roland In Global Partnership Please enable Javascript to watch this video

That was also the day when we here at India Today Tech got the review unit. Incidentally, it was Friday and the day when I was travelling to Banaras, a city that is bustling with so many hues of life, in all their glories and grim realities, that it often offers travellers a chance to capture some unique snaps. My original plan was to travel to the city with a DSLR camera. But it changed. I decided to experiment. Also Read: iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus quick review: Everything is better about new iPhones Apple has pitched the iPhone 7 Plus as a phone that can capture great images with its unique camera - or rather cameras, because there are two rear cameras in the phone. So in went the iPhone 7 Plus and out was the DSLR camera. I still carried the DSLR - just didn't feel like travelling without it - but decided not to take it out of the backpack (and I didn't). Instead, all the shooting was done with the iPhone 7 Plus, including during the challenging scenes at the Ganga Aaarti in the late evening. So how did the iPhone 7 Plus held up? Did I miss my DSLR camera? Now before I answer these questions, just one quick disclaimer: this is not exactly the camera review of the iPhone 7 Plus. The images that you see here have been edited to taste in Lightroom (although editing is fairly minor). With that out, let's answer those two questions. I feel that the iPhone 7 Plus did an admirable job. And although I did miss the DSLR camera, it was more during the low-light shooting. In good light, the iPhone 7 Plus, as far as the image quality is concerned, did pretty well. Other than this fairly general observation, a few more points from my iPhone 7 Plus experience in Banaras. -- The iPhone 7 Plus (and iPhone 7) captures great colours. This it does because it almost always gets the white balance right. -- Even in low light, there is very little noise (grain) in the images. -- In good light, the amount of detail that is captured is fantastic. In low light, the phones like the Huawei Nexus 6P do better (but not the Galaxy S7). This is because the Nexus 6P has a bigger image sensor that greatly helps it in low light. -- Auto focus is fast. It is one of the fastest I have seen in a phone. And so is the shot-to-shot delay, which is virtually nonexistent. -- The 2X optical zoom is great (more on this later) -- Some of the software functionality is great. Example: switching between the normal angle and zoom lens is seamless. Also, the AE-AF lock with the long press is fantastic feature because it allows you to lock exposure, as well as track focus in non-extreme cases. It is very handy. -- The iPhone 7 Plus holds up very well even when you are pushing it to limits. For example, during the 15 to 20 minutes Ganga Aarti I must have clicked over 400 photos. The phone did heat up a little but it didn't switch off the camera or crashed. There are very few phones that will hold up so well. -- The image sensor in the iPhone 7 Plus could have been better. In low or dim light, the phone lacks the kind of detail that devices like the Nexus 6P can capture. It's not bad, but this is a weak spot for the iPhone 7 Plus camera. -- The strength of the iPhone 7 Plus camera is good light photography. Also, it loves the subjects/objects when they are close to it, because that helps it capture great details. In challenging conditions, for example in a dimly lit shop, it does its best but that best is not enough. -- The lens is another part that Apple can improve. Although it has six elements, the design has room for improvement. During the Aarti when I was clicking images in harsh and strong light coming from several directions, the lens almost always had ghosts. I did manage to hide these ghosts in the crowd or the bright light sources, but it was one big hassle dealing with this issue. Here is an example of the ghosts. -- Yes, if I had used a DSLR camera, I would have clicked better images, especially with a prime lens. But the convenience of a camera that fits in your pocket is unmatched. Now a few images. (If you want to see the bigger sizes, click on the thumbnails at the end of this piece). Barber shop: great colours, shot in daylight, although I wish the detail could have been better. All doors are shut. Waiting for the Ganga Aarti: great sky in this image, also almost no noise despite low light. Not an easy shot, given the strong light sources. But iPhone 7 Plus did well. Lassi with papaya at Bana Lassi. Shot in dim light, detail could have been better. Varanasi is full of cheap joints that specialise in Israeli and Korean cuisine.   Boy and his boat: Tough scene given the backlight and dynamic light. But iPhone 7 Plus gets it right.      Two clicked in low light and one in good light.   Click on the images for the bigger size.

Apple shipments continued to decline as the company prepares to refresh its PCs later this month. Apple's decline of 13% for worldwide shipments was by far the sharpest of any major PC vendor. For U.S. shipments, we turn to Gartner who shows us that Apple was the only PC company to have suffered a major loss in shipments in Q3, down 10.7%. Lenovo and HP continue to slug it for top spot Worldwide with HP showing gains while Lenovo shows loses for the quarter as noted in the chart below.   According to IDC, mature regions continued to perform best, with the United States taking the lead with a second consecutive quarter of positive growth. In other developed markets growth was stable or improved slightly with near flat growth in Japan and Canada, followed by a small decline in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Shipments in Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) continued to decline in mid-single digits while Latin America struggled with double-digit declines. For more color on these numbers, see the full IDC report here.   To get the bigger picture, Gartner's report is a little gloomier with PC sales down 5.7% for Q3, 2016. The one consistant is that Apple is down over 13%.   The excuses or reasons, depending on your take of the market, are that emerging markets use phablets or tablets for their computing needs and in North America you have parents passing down their PC's to the children which slows down the PC cycle of upgrading.   In Gartner's U.S.-only PC shipment chart, Apple was the only major company to see a decline which clocked in at -10.7%.

Washington, United States:  The epic patent clash between Apple and Samsung went before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, as the smartphone giants debated the value of design in a case that could set an important legal precedent. The highest US court began hearing arguments over damages the South Korean smartphone giant owes Apple for copying key design features of the iPhone. The case, coming with Samsung facing a fresh but unrelated crisis as it halted production of a flagship handset for safety reasons, revolves around a $400 million award Samsung was ordered to pay. But more critical to industry observers is whether the justices uphold a legal standard which requires the forfeiture of all profits for violating a patent on a single component or feature. "A smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work," Samsung attorney Kathleen Sullivan argued before the eight justices. "A single design patent on the portion of the appearance of a phone should not entitle the design-patent holder to all the profit on the entire phone." Apple lawyer Seth Waxman fired back that Samsung made a conscious decision to revive its fortunes by copying the iPhone. "A design is not a component, a design is applied to a thing," Waxman said. Waxman contended that Samsung's own documents showed that the South Korean giant acted to deal with "a crisis of design." "And the crisis of design was reflected, the documents show, in the telephone company saying, you have to create something like the iPhone, and a directive came out to create something like the iPhone so we can stop ... losing sales," he argued. Beetle Example The court debate moved from smartphones to automobiles, and the importance of design to the Volkswagen Beetle, for example. Justice Sonia Sotomayor commented: "It may be that the (Beetle) body accounts for only 10 percent of the cost of the car, but 90 percent of the profits are attributable to the shape of the car." The case is among several in courts around the world between the two smartphone giants, but this case is likely to set an important precedent on design patents. Observers are watching to see how the court -- which has not taken up a design patent case in more than a century -- tips the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. A ruling is expected in several months. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a $400 million verdict -- part of a nearly billion-dollar award in Apple's favor later reduced to $548 million -- that found Samsung had copied the iPhone, including its distinctive front screen and graphical touchscreen interface. The award -- in accordance with a statute first adopted in 1887 and later affirmed by Congress in 1952 -- requires patent violators to hand over their total profits even if the violation covers only one element of a product. Matt Levy of the Computer & Communications Industry Association said the debate suggested the justices were open to lowering the jury award. "The damages statute for design patents was written to protect products like rugs, where the design was essentially the entire thing being sold," Levy said in a blog post. "Congress certainly didn't intend to treat complex products as if only the outer appearance is what matters.... Based on what I heard, I think it's very likely that the (justices)  will modify the lower court's decision." Silicon Valley v Designers Samsung has won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, as well as a group of law professors. Apple, for its part, got backing from big names in fashion and manufacturing, such as Calvin Klein and Adidas, and the American Intellectual Property Law Association, whose members -- largely lawyers -- represent owners and users of intellectual property. An amicus brief filed on behalf of design professionals, researchers and academics said they have no financial interest in the case but argue on the basis of "fundamental principles of visual design." They cite precedents like the Coca-Cola bottle, which is an integral part of the value of the product, according to the brief. Tuesday's hearing was held before a short-handed panel of eight justices, with a ninth still missing since Antonin Scalia's death in February. The hearing takes place at a difficult time for Samsung, as it is struggling to contain a snowballing safety crisis that threatens to derail the powerhouse global brand. It told customers worldwide on Monday to stop using Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, calling a halt to global sales and exchanges following complaints that its lithium-ion battery explodes while charging.

The annual ritual is, after all, one of the touchstones of the tech industry. But they turned out to be wrong. It wasn’t about Google’s new Pixel phones. Nor was it about the Home smart speaker. It was about the connective tissue binding them—Google Assistant, the company’s artificial intelligence (AI), a beefed up version of a prior attempt, Google Now. And that raises a number of questions that are proliferating increasingly at the intersection of technology and ethics. AI routines running under the hood of various digital services and products, and on personal computing devices—think Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana—have been commonplace for a few years now. But Google Assistant, along with its predecessor and rival Amazon’s Alexa, is taking aim at something larger. It’s a seductive vision—ubiquitous environmental AI able to respond to voice input anywhere in the house, sophisticated enough to understand natural language and context and carry on a conversation with the user in the process of offering information and performing tasks such as scheduling appointments or locking the door. The hubs currently take the form of small speakers—Google Home and Amazon Echo, powered by Assistant and Alexa, respectively—but this is the embryonic stage. Google’s ambition is to have multiple hubs or portals in the house. As the Internet of Things inches towards realization, every networked component in the environment—from televisions to refrigerators—could be part of this ecosystem. And others will follow suit; rumour has it Apple is working on its own offering. This is a future pop culture has been preparing us for since Gene Roddenberry first had Captain Kirk talk to the Enterprise’s computer back in the 1960s. That might explain the ease with which consumers are taking to the concept of voice input. Earlier this year, Mary Meeker’s annual “Internet Trends” report showed that Google voice queries have grown 35-fold since 2008 and that Amazon’s Echo was the fastest-selling speaker in 2015. But consumers’ comfort with this vision of AI-enabled lives masks issues of privacy that warrant careful consideration. For consumer AI to offer the ease of use that will make it attractive, it must offer as close a facsimile of having a conversation with another person as possible. This is immensely difficult; the ability to understand natural language conversation in context rather than predetermined commands is the holy grail. Two components are necessary: sophisticated algorithms and vast amounts of data. And that includes every scrap of personal data possible. Data privacy concerns used to largely be the preserve of policy wonks and the tinfoil hat crowd until a few years ago. Multiple leaks and revelations, from WikiLeaks to Edward Snowden, changed all that. But the public focus remains for the most part on government snooping. When it comes to private actors, consumers are voting with their wallets; lack of privacy and surrendering personal data is a fair price to pay for more convenient lifestyles. Is this necessarily a negative? That depends on the best practices tech companies develop—Apple, for instance, is focusing on protecting users’ data in order to differentiate its products—and on the outcome of their ongoing tussles with governments around the world that demand access to user data for legal purposes. It does, however, point to those ethical questions that the rise of AI is throwing up. The industry is well aware of these questions, and of the need to show that it is taking concerns on board. Thus, Amazon, Facebook, Google’s DeepMind division, IBM and Microsoft founding a new organization called the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society that aims to initiate a wide dialogue about the nature, purpose and consequences of AI. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also been harping on the issue for a while now; last year, he was among the founders of OpenAI, another organization aimed at addressing such issues. They have their work cut out. AI ethics have much more to address than just user privacy. Imagine, for instance, a bank using AI to recommend or screen loan applicants, and the algorithm using causal relationships to discriminate on the basis of gender or caste or race. Or, for that matter, the multiple implications of AI deployed in a military context or controlling driverless vehicles—or the issue du jour, employment. These are also eminently plausible scenarios. It’s an inevitable future; technological genies can never really be put back in the bottle. But the rise of AI cannot be left to the industry; it demands the involvement of everyone from social scientists to ethicists and philosophers. Social and technological paradigm shifts are rarely painless, after all. Is giving up privacy in exchange for the convenience of AI a fair deal?

November 18, 2014 Apple ordered to pay $23.6 million after losing lawsuit over wireless messaging 9to5 Staff - 2 years ago @rsgnl AAPL Company Apple Tech Industry Lawsuit iMessage Comments (20) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Bloomberg reports that a federal jury has found Apple guilty of infringing on six patents related to outdated pager technology from the 1990s. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas has ordered Apple to pay a $23.6 million settlement for violating six patents owned by plaintiff Mobile Telecommunications Technologies LLC in the case. Mobile Telecommunications Technologies claimed that several Apple products with wireless messaging were violating the pager technology, including the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Airport lineup of Wi-Fi products. Apple won a similar case over pager technology, involving a different company, last month in a California court. “Apple is refusing to acknowledge the contributions of others,” MTel lawyer Deron Dacus of the Dacus Firm in Tyler, Texas, told the jury in closing arguments. “This case is about fairness.” The report claims that the patents involved in this case were issued to MTel in the mid-to-late 1990s and either newly expired or are nearing the end of their terms. The telecommunications company was considered a pioneer in wireless messaging with its SkyTel two-way paging system in the 1990s, and the company now serves as the licensing arm of United Wireless. The Lewisville, Texas-based company was originally seeking $237.2 million in damages, or about $1 per device. Given that the patents in this case are related to the transmission and storing of messages, it is possible that MTel could now go after other tech companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook that have similar messaging services. Apple denied infringing the patents because they did not cover any innovations when they were first issued. Apple lawyer Brian Ferguson reportedly told the jury that MTel was entitled to $1 million at the most. In related news, we learned last week that Apple will have to face a federal lawsuit over text messages getting lost when switching from Apple’s iMessage to a standard text messaging service.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 was supposed to be the top of its smartphone line, but the devices have been plagued by battery fires. (Shawn L. Minter/AP) By Hayley Tsukayama October 11 Follow @htsuka Samsung said Tuesday that it would discontinue production of its highest-end smartphone, an unprecedented move for the company and one that could reorder the global market for mobile devices. The Galaxy Note 7 was supposed to be the crown jewel of the smartphone lineup for Samsung, which once garnered little respect in the clubby world of Silicon Valley but is now the primary rival to Apple. Samsung’s ascendancy has been celebrated by those who wanted a high-quality alternative to the iPhone and held up in Korea as evidence of the country’s arrival as tech power. But Samsung’s failure to manufacture phones that do not explode in purses or catch on fire on flights may be catastrophic for the company’s brand, many technology analysts said. Samsung’s shares fell 7.5 percent in Tuesday trading in Seoul, wiping out $17 billion of the company’s value. Some analysts said the company, in its race to release a new phone ahead of Apple, simply rushed. The Note 7’s battery was one of its best selling points — more powerful than that of the iPhone 7 Plus and capable of charging the phone nearly to full power in 30 minutes. Apple had endured criticism for not bringing such innovations to the iPhone. But its caution now looks wise, said John Cui, an assistant professor at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business. Samsung has stopped production of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after a series of explosions in the original and replacement models surfaced. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) “Had this just stopped at replacement units, Samsung would have walked out of this,” added Ramon Llamas, an analyst at the tech market research firm IDC. “The fact that it didn’t work out again? Now we’ll be suspicious.” The damage isn’t likely to be contained to the Galaxy Note model, which had a large 5.7-inch screen and cost $800. The government has also issued a warning about exploding Samsung washing machines, though the problems with those appliances are not related to a battery. [First it was phones. Now it’s exploding Samsung washing machines.] A recent survey from the brand-analysis firm Branding Brand found that 34 percent of current Samsung customers said they wouldn’t buy another smartphone from the company — in a poll taken before news surfaced of the replacement phones also catching on fire. The Note 7 fires also call to mind other incidents involving lithium-ion batteries, which increasingly power most personal devices and cutting-edge technologies, such as electric cars, mobile gadgets and children’s toys. Unexpected explosions forced U.S. retailers to pull popular children’s scooters called hoverboards this year. Boeing had to ground its super-advanced 787 Dreamliner jets because of lithium-ion battery fires in 2013. The supply chains that build the batteries in smartphones and other electronics are notoriously complex and opaque. Companies such as Samsung and Apple buy batteries from several makers, which source the battery parts from different firms across the globe. [Tracing the path from deadly mines in Congo to batteries for phones and laptops] Samsung, the largest battery-maker in the world, last year bought smartphone batteries from its own Samsung SDI division as well as from Maxwell, Amperex Technology Limited, Panasonic and Lishen, according to Avicenne Energy, a consulting firm. But Samsung was unusually dependent on Samsung SDI for about 75 percent of its batteries. By contrast, Apple has bought iPhone batteries from five companies, none of which supply more than a third of its batteries. That enables Apple to nimbly switch manufacturers if a problem surfaces. Samsung’s missteps are likely to help Apple, which offers the only other premium large-screen smartphone that is well-recognized by consumers. The new iPhone 7 Plus sold out within a day, just as reports of exploding Note 7s emerged. In general, large-screen phones generate more profits for manufacturers than smaller ones. [I played around with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus; here’s what it was like] Other analysts said Samsung’s problems might be an even more important development for Android makers, many of which have struggled to make a dent against Apple and Samsung. Google, in particular, stands to gain, analysts said. The tech giant recently introduced its own line of high-end phones, called the Pixel, which could appeal to the anti-iPhone crowd. “The Pixel phone could be a beneficiary here” since it shares many traits with the Note 7, said Brian Blau, vice president of technology research firm Gartner. [Google’s ‘hardware’ push is still really about its software] Samsung’s crisis may be cushioned because carriers already have agreed to promote its other phones for the crucial holiday season. But over the long term, the debacle may set back its relationship with its customers, who had to wade through shifting warnings from the company. At first Samsung was slow to offer replacements. Only after U.S. officials, as well as airlines and subway systems, began to warn passengers to turn off their Galaxy Note 7s did the company offer an official recall. And as of Tuesday, Samsung had not extended that recall to include the replacement Note 7 phones sold after Sept. 15, even though several of those devices have reportedly caught fire. The company has only asked owners of the replacements to stop using those models. The mixed messages have frustrated U.S. officials. In a speech last month, Consumer Product Safety Commission Chairman Elliot Kaye criticized Samsung for trying to handle the problem without coordinating with his agency and for putting customers at risk. “I would say that’s uncommon,” said Kaitlin Wowak, an assistant professor of business at Notre Dame. “It’s important for companies dealing with recalls to have whatever relevant organization — the FDA, NHTSA, the CPSC — get behind them.” Todd Frankel contributed to this report. business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

Supreme Court justices question big verdict against Samsung for copying Apple’s iPhone By David G. Savage Tribune News Service Twitter Facebook Email Reddit WASHINGTON – Supreme Court justices on Tuesday appeared to lean in favor of knocking down a $400 million verdict against Samsung for designing smartphones to look like Apple’s iPhone. Some justices questioned whether the award was properly calculated. The design reflects the “exterior case of the phone,” Chief Justice John Roberts told an attorney for Apple, so the award should not reflect profits “based on the entire price of the phone.” His comment, midway through the argument, summed up Samsung’s contention that lower courts were wrong to say Apple was entitled to the “total profits” of Samsung’s smartphones because it held patents on their look and shape. “That makes no sense,” Kathleen M. Sullivan, Samsung’s lawyer and a former Stanford Law School dean, told the justices. People buy smartphones because they contain thousands of technological advances, not because of the look of the screen, she said. A federal judge in San Jose and a federal appeals court in Washington last year sided with Apple and said the owner of a design patent is entitled to all of the profits from the sale of the product. “In other words, even if the patented features contributed 1 percent of the value of Samsung’s phones, Apple gets 100 percent of Samsung’s profits,” Sullivan said in her legal brief. The case of Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc. has drawn wide attention because it poses a far-reaching, big-money question involving patents, innovation and technology. Typically, patent disputes turn on whether an invention has proved useful and improved the functioning of a product. Design patents, by contrast, involve the distinctive look of a product. The Supreme Court has not dealt with disputes over design patents since the 1890s. Patent law dating from 1887 says that infringing the design of “any article of manufacture . shall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit.” Most of the justices seemed troubled by the “total profits” rule, but several said they were not certain of what to do. Sullivan advised the justices to decide that the “article of manufacture” in this case was the black rectangular shape of the phone with its rounded edges, not its working parts. She said the case should be sent back to California, where a judge and jury can decide how much Samsung should pay for copying the design features of Apple’s iPhone. The Justice Department largely agreed, saying in its legal brief that “grossly excessive and essentially arbitrary awards” would result if a company holding a design patent can sue and win all the profits of a rival. The argument was filled with examples drawn from automobiles. Samsung’s attorneys said the “total profits” rule would mean that an automaker could sue a rival and take all the profits from a line of new cars by showing the rival’s car infringed on the design of a patented cup holder. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy cited the example of a Volkswagen Beetle, whose unique look made it a worldwide success. But he said it was not clear how a jury could decide what percentage of profits should be taken from a rival firm whose cars looked liked the Beetle. “If I were a juror, I wouldn’t know what to do,” Kennedy said. Sullivan conceded that in this example, VW might be entitled to most of the profits from a rival who copies the look of a Beetle or a Corvette. “It may be nobody wants to really pay much for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle,” she said. But Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said he didn’t think much of the Beetle example. “Nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because if its look,” he said. “What if it got two miles to a gallon and broke down every 50 miles?” For its part, Apple’s lawyers argued that the justices should stick with the old law and award the total profits to a company whose patented designs were copied by a rival. Samsung’s own documents in this case show that officials of the South Korean firm sought to create something like the iPhone, said Apple attorney Seth Waxman. Having done that and been caught, they should be forced to turn over their profits, he said. The justices are expected to issue a decision in the case in several months. Last week, a federal appeals court in Washington upheld a separate $120 million verdict against Samsung for infringing other parts of Apple’s iPhone patents.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Pegatron to Make Microsoft's new Desktop Computers with Touch Displays | Main | Apple the only Major PC Company to have Negative Shipments in the U.S. and Worldwide for Q3 » October 11, 2016 U.S. Supreme Court Hears Arguments from Apple and Samsung, Hints that Design can drive a Sale of a Phone   Samsung and Apple argued in America's highest court today over design patents and in particular, Apple's iPhone design patents. Samsung argued that the damages awarded in the case (some $400 million) should be greatly reduced because Apple was awarded damages on the profit of the entire phone, not just the profits on the parts that infringed Apple's patents. The three patents at issue here are related to the design of the iPhone's front face; the overall appearance of the rectangular design with rounded corners and a bezel; and the sides, back, top, and bottom of the device (the rest of the phone), as well as the circular home button, reports The Verge.   The report further noted that "Justices expressed skepticism with Samsung's argument that because a smartphone is filled with thousands of patented components that a design patent should result in awards amounting to a fraction of the total profits of the phone, though it's hard to read too much into how a Supreme Court decision might turn out from oral arguments alone.   "How do we announce the right test for that?" asked Justice Sotomayor. The design of the phone "might drive the sale." An iconic design for an automobile might come to a designer as "a stroke of genius" in just a few days said Justice Kennedy, while the rest of the car could take hundreds of days to design. "Then it seems to me that it is quite unfair to give three days' profit" to someone whose design was infringed when that design is so significant to the overall product.   From what is covered by The Verge, Samsung wants to basically dumb down patent law to only the single component that's infringed, if anything. Their argument was dumbed down to a scenario of a cup holder in a vehicle. If one holds a patent for a cup holder in a car, why should the car company have to pay a royalty on the whole car?   But Justice Sotomayor didn't but into that narrowly defined argument. Sotomayor's point was that in some cases a design might drive the sale of item be it a phone or a car. How true, especially at a time when smartphones had tons of buttons on the device interface that were ugly. In contrast Apple's iPhone design had clean device interface seeing on the display and a single Home Button that melded into the design so eloquently. Consumers were driven to that physical design and that it supported a GUI that worked completely differently than physical buttons did on smartphones of that period prior to the iPhone. However seemingly simple it is now, it was dramatic in 2007. And that's what Samsung copied. Not just rounded corners but a complete reinvention of the smartphone.   Apple strongly disagreed with Samsung's dumbed down example, suggesting that significant financial damage awards are the best way to discourage copying of patented products. How true   "Everyone at Apple is dedicated to innovation and delivering the very best products for our customers. Our designers and engineers are distinguished by their originality. And they take great pride in their work," said Noreen Krall, Apple's chief litigation officer, in a statement. "We firmly believe that strong design patent protection spurs creativity and innovation. And that's why we've defended ourselves against those who steal our ideas."   A ruling is expected before the end of the Court's term in June.

Chances are that you have heard the now-viral song, “Pen Pineapple Apple Pen” at least one time. Even though you probably would not like to admit it, you have more than likely seen and heard the hilarious video that goes along with the “Pen Pineapple Apple Pen” song a lot more than once. The concept of the short song — simply about a man that has two different fruits and a commonly used writing utensil — may seem like something that is absolutely boring and a waste of time. However, thanks to the wonderful world of viral videos, the “Pen Pineapple Apple Pen” song will continue to live on for many years to come on the internet. “Pen Pineapple Apple Pen” (“PPAP”) was the most viewed video in the world last week https://t.co/L8meu64InA pic.twitter.com/KqtVqQNyCL — ARAMA! JAPAN (@aramajapan) October 12, 2016 What exactly is the story behind “PPAP?” Who is the guy that is singing and dancing about his “Pen Pineapple Apple Pen” situation? That is where things get very interesting. If the song and dance captivated your attention, perhaps you would be even more intrigued by the story behind it — or more importantly, the man behind the song. According to 9gag.com, “Pen Pineapple Apple Pen” was created by a singer-songwriter known as Piko Taro. He is actually the man featured in the hilarious dance video that features a man dancing while showcasing a small collection of invisible/imaginary fruits and writing utensils. The report states that it goes a lot deeper than the singer-songwriter, though. Piko Taro is actually a character who was created by 53-year-old comedian DJ Kosaka Daimaou. Layarians! Ini dia nih si pencipta karakter Piko-taro! Komedian dan DJ asal Jepang, Kosaka Doimau! #BERLAYARIA pic.twitter.com/9L5txZWYva — Layaria (@LayariaNetwork) October 11, 2016 Kosaka started to introduce Piko Taro into his stand-up comedy routines, and the character did not take very long to start making waves within his act. Since Piko began to gain a little popularity, Kosaka apparently decided to take his exposure to the next level — an international level. Last week, Kosaka hosted a Q&A session through 9gag.com. Staying true to Piko Taro, DJ Kosaka apparently did not break character at any point during the session. Based on the photos posted to the website, he even dressed the part – wearing the same outfit that he wears in the “Pen Pineapple Apple Pen” music video. Do you want to ask PPAP any questions? Stay tuned for the next 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/447Ur3qHRf — 9GAG (@9GAG) October 6, 2016 With the help of his assistant Mayumi, who translated his replies into English throughout the session, Piko Taro made it clear that he was wide open to answer questions from his fans and critics. He even jokingly stated that he would talk to the point where he “intestines will come out.” A vast number of questions, comments, commendations and even complaints flooded the website moments after Piko Taro initiated the Q&A session. He apparently did not stay online for very long; the majority of the questions asked were not answered. There was not a lot of serious discussion or responses posted from the online session. When you think about interviewing the man behind “Pen Pineapple Apple Pen,” though, you more than likely would not expect hardly any serious responses. Therefore, with many of his responses, DJ Kosaka delivered once again when it came to giving his fans exactly what they wanted and expected from Mr. PPAP himself. Q: What made you choose pen, apple, and pineapple? A: “There was a pen, apple and pineapple on the table. But just in my head.” Q: What fruit do you prefer? Pineapple or apple? A: “Kiwi is the best.” Q: Can you make a song of a banana and potato? A: “Within 5 years.” Q: Do random people laugh at you when they see you on the street? A: “It happens a lot. Why do you think?” Q: Are you planning to make another catchy song? A: “In my head, there is 2000 ideas… Sorry, maybe 4.” However, he did share his purpose and overall objective for creating “Pen Apple Pineapple Pen” – world peace and happiness. “I wanted to make the people of US, Russia, Malaysia and other countries smile… I wanted to see your smile. I wanted to see the children all of the world smile. World peace.” Based on the reactions and responses that have been posted and shared on social media, it is clear that Kosaka achieved his mission of becoming a global sensation with “Pen Pineapple Apple Pen.” Pen pineapple apple pen is stuck in my head I can’t get rid of it I secretly love it — Mike Jerry (@xitsmike) October 9, 2016 apple pen pic.twitter.com/gzsPbIUrG7 — Bwad????

(@HoodiePanda) October 7, 2016 Yesterday in a gathering of 8 people i mentioned Pen Pineapple Apple Pen and 6 of them had no idea what it was. Aren’t they anti-planet? — वरुण (@varungrover) October 5, 2016 A vast number of remixes of “Pen Pineapple Apple Pen” have also been created and shared on social media, as well — drawing even more attention to the hilarious and somehow ingenious original song created by Piko Taro. One particular fan asked Piko Taro (aka DJ Kosaka) about the popularity of the now-viral memes based on his character and the “Pen Pineapple Apple Pen” song, dance and video. When asked to express how he felt about the memes, Piko shared a statement that was perhaps a little more profound in nature than many people expected to read from him. “I tripped on the street and found a diamond in front of me. It’s something like that.” It does not take very long at all for the lyrics to get stuck in your head — especially since they really do not fit the standard definition of song lyrics. It was as if Kosaka took random sentences about items that he was holding at the time and made a song about combining those items together — combinations that otherwise would never make any sense in real life. “I have a pen. I have an apple. Apple pen. I have a pen. I have pineapple. Pineapple pen. Apple pen…. Pineapple pen. Pen pineapple apple pen.” On one particular YouTube channel, “Pen Pineapple Apple Pen” has generated over 72 million views in less than one month. Whether you like it or not, this means that “Pen Pineapple Apple Pen” (also known as “PPAP”) is well on its way toward joining the ranks of many other simplistic and somewhat ridiculous yet catchy songs that have become viral hits on YouTube — including “Gangnam Style,” “Chocolate Rain,” and “What Does the Fox Say?” [Featured Image by suchinan/Shutterstock.com] Now Watch This: Man Runs 1400 Miles To Standing Rock Now Read This: Andrew Lumish: ‘The Good Cemeterian’ — Freely Restoring Veteran Headstones Share 15 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Glenn Hadley Tags: 9gag.com, Apple Pen, Gangnum Style, Kosaka Comments LATEST HEADLINES ‘Steep’ Beta Opens Up To Everyone November 18 Prior To December 2 Release Date New Flash Episode Spoilers: Barry Finally Tells Everyone About Alternate Reality Wally As Kid Flash L.A.

The eight justices on the top court appeared divided on how to resolve the complex dispute over damages the South Korean smartphone giant owes Apple for copying key design features of the iPhone. The case arguments came as Samsung faces a fresh but unrelated crisis as it halted production of a flagship handset for safety reasons, potentially imperiling the powerhouse South Korean brand. Samsung, which has been ordered to pay $400 million for violating certain iPhone features, is challenging the legal precedent which requires the forfeiture of all profits from a product even if only a single design patent is infringed upon ©Jung Yeon-Je (AFP/File) Samsung, which has been ordered to pay $400 million for violating certain iPhone features, is challenging the legal precedent which requires the forfeiture of all profits from a product even if only a single design patent is infringed upon. This key question on the value of design patents has rallied Samsung supporters in the tech sector, and Apple backers in the creative and design communities. The justices Tuesday offered some support for both sides without providing a hint on the outcome of the case. Justice Anthony Kennedy said Samsung's argument would create confusion for jurors in trying to apportion damages. "If I'm the juror, I just don't know what to do," Kennedy told attorneys during the hearing. "I'd have the iPhone in the jury room; I'd -- I'd look at it. I just wouldn't know." - VW Beetle example - The court debate moved from smartphones to automobiles, and the importance of design to the Volkswagen Beetle, for example. Justice Samuel Alito appeared to lean toward Samsung's position, saying, "Nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks... What if it broke down every 50 miles?" Offering a similar view, Justice Stephen Breyer said a single component cannot account for all profits: "A Rolls Royce thing on the hood? No, no, no. You don't get all the profit from the car." Samsung attorney Kathleen Sullivan said the justices should consider all the components of a smartphone. "A smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work," she said. She said the case could lead to more litigations because patent holders "carve the product up into multiple partial design claims... and find a little sliver of the phone on which infringement can be found." - Design 'not a component' - Apple lawyer Seth Waxman fired back that Samsung made a conscious decision to revive its fortunes by copying the iPhone. "A design is not a component, a design is applied to a thing," Waxman said. Waxman contended that Samsung's own documents showed that the South Korean giant acted to deal with "a crisis of design" and sought to copy the iPhone. He noted that limiting the damages would offer little deterrence and encourage "counterfeiters and copyists." Observers are watching to see how the court -- which has not taken up a design patent case in more than a century -- tips the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. A ruling is expected in several months. The case is one element of the $548 million penalty Samsung was ordered to pay for copying the iPhone's distinctive front screen and graphical touchscreen interface. Matt Levy of the Computer & Communications Industry Association said the debate suggested the justices were open to lowering the jury award. "The damages statute for design patents was written to protect products like rugs, where the design was essentially the entire thing being sold," Levy said in a blog post. "Congress certainly didn't intend to treat complex products as if only the outer appearance is what matters.... Based on what I heard, I think it's very likely that the (justices) will modify the lower court's decision." Samsung has won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard. Apple is supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. An amicus brief filed on behalf of design professionals, researchers and academics said they have no financial interest in the case but argue on the basis of "fundamental principles of visual design." They cite precedents like the Coca-Cola bottle, which is an integral part of the value of the product. The Supreme Court hearing took place hours after Samsung announced it was scrapping the production of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, its new flagship device that has been mired in a disastrous recall over exploding lithium-ion batteries.

It’s an informative yet minimalistic take on an activity and sleep tracker that gets you the right information within just a couple of taps. After granting CardioBot access to the Health app on the iPhone, you’ll get a colored calendar view against a dark background. Each day will be assigned a dot with a designated hue for a heart rate range: gray for low, blue for resting, orange for high resting, and red for elevated. Also present on each day is your average beats per minute. You can dive into each day to see more detailed facts, like a percentage graph of your daily heart rate or the time of your minimum and maximum BPM. Tapping on the summary graph will display every reading your Apple Watch took throughout the day. CardioBot also includes graphs for sleep tracking, which can be done while wearing the Apple Watch in bed, and workouts. Both break out data into different heart rate ranges, so you can get a better idea of how your body is performing. On the Apple Watch, you can get a quick glance at your last heart rate measurement and the minimum, average, and maximum measurements from the day. Press the screen to start a sleep measurement before bed – just don’t forget to stop it in the morning like I tend to do. For the few days that I’ve had CardioBot installed, I’ve enjoyed the amount of information it gives me about my health. Setup is a breeze and it was great to see my data imported into the app without a hitch. Although other apps feel inclined to bombard you with information, CardioBot elects to present you with digestible figures and graphs, making this a tool that anyone can use without struggle. At $1.99, CardioBot is an easy purchase for the quality you’re getting. You can pick it up on the App Store here. Update: Through a combination of emails and tweets, I've been asked the differences between CardioBot and HeartWatch. When I reviewed HeartWatch back in February, it was in version 2 and looked noticeably similar to how CardioBot looks now. However, now that HeartWatch is in version 3, it has gained many features that have grown it from its 2.0 version. While CardioBot does look similar to HeartWatch's previous product, I believe the two serve different markets today: HeartWatch for the pro health tracker and CardioBot for the rest. With that being said, I want to point out that they do look similar. Join Now Like MacStories? Become a Member.

Photo by Dado Ruvic/Reuters Samsung appeared before the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday to defend its smartphone design, which Apple says too closely resembles its own. The court’s task is not to determine whether Samsung infringed on Apple’s patents but to determine how much money Samsung should pay Apple for doing so. It marks the first time in 120 years that the the court has reviewed a design patent case. (The Supreme Court has reviewed patents based on function, but not appearance.) And the last design patent cases reviewed by the high court dealt in saddles, rugs and spoons. In fact, one particular case involving 19th-century spoons, Gorham v. White, was cited multiple times by lawyers before the Supreme Court on Tuesday. In 1862, Gorham & Co. obtained a patent for its spoon handle design. Six years later, a competitor, White, obtained a similar patent. Image provided by smpub.com, SM publications, Silver Salon Forums The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Gorham, the original patent holder. “They are still the same in general appearance and effect, so much alike that in the market and with purchasers they would pass for the same thing — so much alike that even persons in the trade would be in danger of being deceived,” the court wrote. In the Samsung v. Apple case, Apple compares itself to Gorham and likens Samsung to White. Apple said its patents “cover the overall appearance of the device’s distinctive front face, bezel, and graphical user interface.” In addition, Apple argues it should be awarded damages for the profits it lost on its entire phone, not just on the parts of Samsung’s phones that violated the patents. “If people are buying the product because of the appearance, all the profits of the sales should go to the designer,” said Mark Davies, a partner at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe who filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of Apple. Trying to determine how much profit Apple lost on the individual parts of the phone would be like trying to determine the profit lost because of the silver that makes up the spoon versus the handle design, Davies said. Samsung has a different take. “A patented design might be the essential feature of a spoon or rug. But the same is not true of smartphones, which contain countless other features that give them remarkable functionality wholly unrelated to their design,” Samsung’s court filing reads. Samsung’s lawyer Kathleen Sullivan reiterated the argument before the justices, saying the main selling point for spoons are the design. “The patent’s on the handle, but nobody really cares about the sipping cup of the spoon,” she said. In other words, Samsung says smartphones are much more complex than spoons, and, unlike spoons, you can’t say that someone bought a certain phone only because of the way it looked. It remains to be seen whether that argument will convince the Supreme Court, because as one might expect, 100 years on, the patent cases are also more complex.

For the Korean technology giant Samsung, the decision to scrap the manufacture of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone is extraordinary. When the new phone arrived in the summer, it was hailed as a worthy challenger to Apple, whose iPhones lead the high end of the smartphone market. But by last month it was evident that the new Samsung product had a serious problem. The battery was overheating and catching fire. The US Federal Aviation Authority took the unusual step of banning the phone from aircraft after one exploded on an internal flight.  The Korean company recalled no less than 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7s for a battery change. Thus far, the story was not exceptional. An early iPhone had had a similar problem which Apple, embarrassed by its initial denial of the issue, managed to sort out. But Samsung’s battery troubles were not fixed. One of the replacements it sent out also caught fire on another US flight. Until yesterday the firm insisted that it was still working on a solution, but then top management decreed  production of the new Galaxy model would cease altogether. Scrapping the phone will cost Samsung dearly both in financial and reputational terms. And the Korean finance ministry has also warned this will have a significant impact on the country’s export earnings. This technology disaster seems set to become a standard study case for MBA students for years to come. Precisely what went wrong in the research and development that created the Galaxy Note 7 has yet to be revealed, but why this corporate disaster came about is already clear. High technology firms are in a constant competitive battle to sell new products. Sometimes these devices are completely new – the smartphone and the tablet, both pioneered by Apple, are prime examples. But often the new offerings are merely upgrades of existing hardware and software, dressed up with marketing ballyhoo to persuade consumers to buy these new “must-haves”. The reality is that smartphones made even some years ago are still perfectly serviceable. They can allow their owners to check news, email and social media, surf the web, watch films, listen to music, send and receive text messages, tell the time and also, of course, make phone calls. The two new frontiers for smartphone makers are artificial intelligence and battery life. The former is about being able to speak to your phone and have it respond with answers based not only on the split-second scouring of vast data banks but also on a steadily increasing understanding of its owners habits and interests. Such a capacity is ultimately likely to tie customers to a manufacturer because of the highly personalized data that has been amassed about them.  Battery life remains the big challenge. Heavy use of a smartphone means it will need recharging before the day is out. Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 battery was not particularly longer lasting than others, but the phone was selling on its style and features. For effectively “old” battery technology to go haywire and worse, be unfixable, is puzzling. It is also a useful lesson for eager early-adopters who will queue overnight to buy the very latest gizmo. There is little to be lost by waiting a few months to see if the things actually work.

Here's how to install the macOS Sierra 10.12.1 Public Beta We believe that developers already know how to install the Beta versions of the macOS Sierra operating system, but for the regular Jane and Joe, who have never done that before, we've prepared an in-depth tutorial that will help them achieve just that and upgrade from the macOS Sierra 10.12 release to 10.12.1. However, we have to warn you that Beta releases are not the final product, as they may contain unknown issues which will be resolved in future Betas. As such, if you want a stable and reliable macOS Sierra experience, do not install the Public Beta versions. Instead, wait for the final release of macOS 10.12.1 Sierra, which is just weeks away. Later this fall, macOS Sierra 10.12.1 will become the first point release of the macOS Sierra 10.12 operating system, adding various under-the-hood improvements and bug fixes to enhance the usability, stability, and security of your Mac. It is a recommended update for anyone using macOS 10.12 Sierra. #macOS 10.12.1 Sierra#macOS Sierra#macOS 10.12.1 Beta 4#Apple#Mac subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Starts Investigating Exploding iPhones Too After Samsung’s Note 7 Disaster Apple Releases iOS 10.1 Public Beta 3 with Portrait Camera for iPhone 7 Plus Apple Seeds Third Developer Beta of iOS 10.1, tvOS 10.0.1, and Xcode 8.1 - Updated Apple Co-Founder: No Headphone Jack on iPhone 7 Because Few People Used It 5 Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android Ubuntu Touch OTA-14 Slightly Delayed, New Task Manager Gets Fuzzy Background    macOS Sierra 10.12.1 Beta 4 released New Mac Apps Manager: Versatile accounting software solution for Mac OS X that offers you the possibility to manage multiple businesses, to track all transactions, to generate reports, and so on macOS Sierra Patcher: Create a bootable USB drive for macOS Sierra that will work with older Macs that are not officially supported by the operating system Lantern: Get access to sites blocked in your region, or grant access to other users through your internet connection via an easy to use OS X app. QCTools: Analyze video files and detect possible corruption by applying different filters and reviewing the results in a graphical manner Porting Kit: Games management solution that integrates downloading capabilities uses Wineskin to offer you the possibility to play Windows games on your Mac Cryptomator: Keep your files safe yet easily accessible by encrypting them with the AES algorithm, regardless of the cloud storage solution you are using Repetier-Server: Configure your 3D printers via a web interface and access them remotely, manage control permissions for all users, calculate production costs, and more Reader comments iPhone 7 Becomes Best-Selling Smartphone, Pushes Apple Closer to Android more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The Justices won’t be determining if Samsung infringed on Apple’s patents—the company already admitted to that—and instead will rule on how damages in patent design cases should be calculated. Their decision has real implications for other design-related patent cases, and could lead to yet another lower court hearing for Apple and Samsung. Supreme Court hearing Samsung’s patent infringement damages appeal The case going before the Supreme Court today dates back to 2011 where a jury rules Apple wasn’t infringing on Samsung’s mobile device patents, but Samsung was infringing on several of Apple’s. After years of appeals, Samsung agreed to pay Apple US$548 million in damages with the stipulation it gets the money back if the Supreme Court overturns the Appeals Court ruling. Damages in design patent cases are calculated based on total profits earned by the infringing company. The court set that at over $900 million, but Samsung negotiated with Apple to get that number down to $548 million. Samsung is hoping to convince the Supreme Court it should pay even less. The Court can rule one of two ways: Yes, the damages should be recalculated; or no, the lower court’s damages ruling stands. Both have an impact that reaches beyond Apple and Samsung. Yes: Recalculate the damages Should the Supreme Court rule that Samsung is right and the damages value needs to be recalculated, the case goes back to the lower Federal Court. That means more time in front of judges for Apple and Samsung, and Apple will ultimately have to give back at least some of the $548 million it’s already been paid. It also sets a precedent for calculating damages in other design-related patent infringement cases. Damages will likely be much lower compared to cases handled before this ruling. Companies rooting for this outcome say it’ll foster innovation because they won’t face crippling costs from competitors using the patent system to keep them from inventing new ideas. The fear of the patent system being used as a weapon makes them question the value in designing new products if they’ll face oppressively expensive legal action. No: The current damages calculation stands Ruling against Samsung means the lower court’s damages ruling stands, bringing an end to this particular legal battle between Apple and Samsung. The damages Samsung has already paid stay in Apple’s hands, and they redirect their focus to their other patent infringement battles. Shooting down Samsung’s appeal validates the current damages calculation system that led to the $900 million the company was supposed to pay Apple. Companies rooting for this outcome say it protects their intellectual property, and in turn fosters innovation. If their ideas can easily be stolen, they argue, there isn’t much incentive to design new technologies and products. The stakes seem pretty high for more than just Apple and Samsung, and regardless of how the Justices rule will have an impact on future design-related patent cases. The Supreme Court’s ruling won’t come until June 2017, so we still have several months before we know how similar cases will be handled in the future.

The patent system is there to “foster innovation” by preventing others from infringing a company’s intellectual property!!! That is the OPPOSITE of the above statement, and in reality the patent system is there to ENCOURAGE competitors to innovate and invent “new ideas”, rather than stealing the intellectual property that another company has spent years of time, and millions of dollars, developing for their own products!

The hearing is the latest round in the mobile device patent infringement fight the two companies started in 2011, and underscores how confusing it can be to set damages values. Apple and Samsung testified today in Supreme Court patent damages appeal The 2011 case pitted Apple and Samsung against each other over claims they were copying each other’s smartphone patents without proper licensing. A Federal jury ultimately ruled Apple wasn’t infringing on Samsung’s patents, while Samsung infringed on several of Apple’s. Apple was awarded over US$900 million in damages based on profits for the infringing devices. Samsung eventually negotiated that down to $548 million with a big string attached: if the damages ruling is overturned, it gets the money back with interest. Samsung argued today that damges should be calculated only on the component parts directly related to the infringing patents. Apple argued consumers buy their smartphones based on the whole package and not individual components, and as such that’s how damages should be determined. The DOJ took the middle ground saying there should be a sliding scale for courts to use as a guideline. When the overall design is more important, the damages will reflect that; when it’s the components that matter, damages will be based on those parts. The Justices had plenty of questions for both sides, according to Buzzfeed, and tried using the Volkswagon Beatle as an analogy. The question they debated was how important a roll the car’s design plays in consumer’s decision to buy, and is its physical appearance a key factor. Samsung also argued the lower court jury should’ve been instructed to calculate damages based on individual components—something the Justices felt would be very confusing. Justice Anthony Kennedy drove that point home saying, “If I was a juror, I simply wouldn’t know what to do.” And there’s the rub: How do you explain the procedure for calculating design patent damages to a jury without making it overly complicated? Technology companies are following the case closely because the Supreme Court’s decision will have a real impact on how future design patent cases are handled. That ruling will come in June 2017, so we still have several months to wait before we know which side gets to celebrate.

During the third quarter of 2016, Apple shipped an estimated 5 million Macs, down from 5.7 million in the year-ago quarter for a 13.4 percent decline in growth. Apple's 3Q 2016 market share comes in at 6.7 percent, down from 7.3 percent in 3Q 2015, securing the company's position as the number five worldwide PC vendor after Lenovo, HP, Dell, and Asus. While top PC vendor Lenovo saw a small drop in shipments, HP, Dell, and Asus saw growth in the range of two percent. Gartner's Preliminary Worldwide PC Vendor Unit Shipment Estimates for 3Q16 (Thousands of Units) Lenovo shipped an estimated 14.4 million PCs during the quarter, while HP shipped 14 million, Dell shipped 10 million, and Asus shipped 5.4 million. Acer, the number six worldwide PC vendor, was nearly on par with Apple's shipments at 4.6 million units sent out. Shipments from other smaller manufacturers were at 15 million, a 16.2 percent decline from the year-ago quarter. In the United States, Apple shipped an estimated two million Macs, a 10.7 percent decline from the 2.3 million shipped in 3Q 2015. Gartner's Preliminary U.S. Vendor Unit Shipment Estimates for 3Q16 (Thousands of Units) According to Gartner's estimates, overall worldwide PC shipments fell 5.7 percent to 68.9 million units, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of decline, which it said is the "longest duration of decline" in the history of the PC industry. Apple's U.S. Market Share Trend: 1Q06-3Q16 (Gartner) IDC also released its own shipment estimates, noting a 3.9 percent decline in overall worldwide PC shipments. According to IDC's numbers, which are very similar to Gartner's, Apple shipped 5 million Macs during 3Q 2016, a decline of 13 percent from 3Q 2015. Almost all of Apple's Mac line is in desperate need of an update. Aside from the Retina MacBook, no other machines have received updates in 2016, leaving customers to eagerly await new models. According to rumors, Apple is planning to introduce a revamped MacBook Pro as soon as later this month, said to feature a redesigned, thinner body, a flatter keyboard, a wider pressure-sensitive trackpad, and most notably, an OLED display touch panel that replaces the physical function keys. Touch ID may be built into this panel, and it will include updated Intel processors, improved graphics, and USB C/Thunderbolt 3 support. Other Macs, like the Mac Pro, the Mac mini, iMac, and the MacBook Air are due for updates, but it is not yet clear when these machines will receive refreshes.

Samsung paid Apple US$548 million in damages awarded by a lower court for copying designs of the iPhone. In December, Samsung took the case to the highest court, asking it to reconsider the scope of design patents and how damages are calculated, in an effort to get up to $399 million reimbursed. In March, the court agreed to hear the case, which marks the first design patents case the highest U.S. court has taken up in 120 years. The last Supreme Court cases over design patents involved spoon handles in the 1870s and carpets in the 1890s. On Monday, the court held the first and only hearing. Samsung has claimed that it is unfair for a patent violator to hand over all profits from sales of a product using the patent design when that design made only a tiny contribution to sales. At the time of appeals to the Supreme Court, Samsung claimed that "a patented design might be the essential feature of a spoon or rug. But the same is not true of smartphones, which contain countless other features that give them remarkable functionality wholly unrelated to their design."    Kathleen Sullivan, a lawyer for Samsung, speaks to reporters after a Supreme Court hearing in Washington on Oct. 11. (Yonhap) On Monday, Samsung said the "spirit of innovation" the U.S. was built upon is at stake. "As we stand on the steps of the highest court of the United States, we are reminded of the spirit of innovation that this country was built upon. And it is this same spirit that has inspired us to fight for a fair interpretation of a law that will promote creativity and competition in the marketplace," Kathleen Sullivan, a lawyer for Samsung, said after the hearing. "Awarding all of the profits for a single patent devalues the contributions of the hundreds of thousands of other patents in a smartphone. We are hopeful that the Supreme Court will give a sensible and fair reading to the design patent statute. That would be a win for businesses and consumers alike," she said. During the one-hour hearing, U.S. Solicitor General Brian Fletcher, who represented the U.S. government's position, made remarks in favor of Samsung, saying it would be reasonable to limit damages to profits from the parts involving the patent designs, according to those attending the hearing. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito also said that design is not the only feature affecting consumers. "I can't get over the thought that nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks," he was quoted as saying. The court is expected to deliver a verdict early next year. The case is one of the two last-remaining lawsuits between the two smartphone giants. In the other case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington last week reversed an earlier decision and reinstated a lower-court verdict that Samsung should pay Apple US$120 million for violating the iPhone patents on "quick links," "slide-to-unlock" and "auto-correct" technologies. jschang@yna.co.kr (END) Most Viewed Seoul to ban smoking at cultural asset sites (4th LD) Park apologizes over alleged sexual misconduct by ex-spokesman Ssangyong says resumption of overnight shift turning point of normalization (2nd LD) N.

If so, you probably download a bunch of songs to your iOS device so you can listen to your favorite tunes on the go, without an Internet connection. Of course, offline music cache takes up your device’s precious storage and some folks forget that they’ve downloaded songs in the first place. You can, of course, manually remove any offline tracks stored on the device or have iOS limit music storage on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch—just like on the Apple Watch. This tutorial will teach you how to manage music storage on your iOS device, manually delete offline songs, change settings to your liking and more. About downloading music You can download any song, album or playlist for offline listening by tapping the cloud icon next to its name in the Music app, but keep in mind that iCloud Music Library must be enabled in Settings → Music → iCloud Music Library. To see the download progress, tap Library in the tab area alongside the bottom, then choose Downloaded Music → Downloading. If your iPhone or iPad is low on storage space, why not tell iOS to automatically free up some space by removing any downloaded music that you haven’t played in a while? How to optimize music storage on iOS 1) Go to Settings → Music → Optimize Storage. 2) Now choose a minimum amount of storage on your device that you want to dedicate to storing downloaded music files for offline listening. Dedicating a minimum of four gigabytes of storage lets you keep about 800 high-quality offline tracks on the device. By comparison, 32 gigabytes of dedicated music storage lets you keep about 6,400 downloaded songs on the device. The lower minimum storage you choose, the more usable storage space you will have for apps, photos and other things. If you’d rather iOS use whatever amount of storage space is available for keeping offline music, choose None instead. To prevent iOS from automatically managing your music storage and removing downloaded tracks as needed, slide the Optimize Storage switch to the OFF position. With the feature disabled, you’ll need to manually delete any downloaded music when your iPhone or iPad is low on space. Manually deleting music To delete a downloaded song, album, playlist or music video from the device, tap it in the Music app and hit Remove, then select Remove Downloads. On 3D Touch devices, simply press a song or album, then select the Remove option. Any removed offline songs remain in your iCloud Music Library. You can also remove all songs or certain artists from your device in the Settings app: go to Settings → Music → Downloaded Music and tap the Edit button. Now hit the red minus sign next to All Songs to remove all downloaded music or slide the artists whose music you wish to delete, then tap Delete. Tap Done to finish deleting your downloaded music. And now, my final piece of advice to you: to stop your iPhone or iPad from automatically downloading music for offline listening whenever you add songs, albums and playlists to your library, toggle the Automatic Downloads switch in Settings → Music. If you think this tutorial will be useful to others, please pass it along to your friends, family or anyone who you think might find it useful.

Politics 'We're called redneck, ignorant, racist. That's not true': Trump supporters explain why they voted for him NATION Supreme Court justices question big verdict against Samsung for copying Apple's iPhone Supreme Court justices question big verdict against Samsung for copying Apple's iPhone Jung Yeon-Jejung /AFP/Getty Images Apple's iPhone 4s, left, and a Samsung's Galaxy S3, right. Apple's iPhone 4s, left, and a Samsung's Galaxy S3, right. (Jung Yeon-Jejung /AFP/Getty Images) David G. Savage Supreme Court justices on Tuesday appeared to lean in favor of knocking down a $400-million verdict against Samsung for designing smartphones to look like Apple’s iPhone. Some justices questioned whether the award was properly calculated. The design reflects the “exterior case of the phone,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. told an attorney for Apple, so the award should not reflect profits “based on the entire price of the phone.” His comment, midway through the argument, summed up Samsung’s contention that lower courts were wrong to say Apple was entitled to the “total profits” of Samsung’s smartphones because it held patents on their look and shape. “That makes no sense,” Kathleen M. Sullivan, Samsung’s lawyer and a former Stanford Law School dean, told the justices. People buy smartphones because they contain thousands of technological advances, not because of the look of the screen, she said. A federal judge in San Jose and a federal appeals court in Washington last year sided with Apple and said the owner of a design patent is entitled to all of the profits from the sale of the product. “In other words, even if the patented features contributed 1% of the value of Samsung's phones, Apple gets 100% of Samsung’s profits,” Sullivan said in her legal brief. The case of Samsung Electronics Co. vs. Apple Inc. has drawn wide attention because it poses a far-reaching, big-money question involving patents, innovation and technology. Typically, patent disputes turn on whether an invention has proved useful and improved the functioning of a product. Design patents, by contrast, involve the distinctive look of a product. The Supreme Court has not dealt with disputes over design patents since the 1890s. Patent law dating from 1887 says that infringing the design of “any article of manufacture … shall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit.” Most of the justices seemed troubled by the “total profits” rule, but several said they were not certain of what to do. Sullivan advised the justices to decide that the “article of manufacture” in this case was the black rectangular shape of the phone with its rounded edges, not its working parts. She said the case should be sent back to California, where a judge and jury can decide how much Samsung should pay for copying the design features of Apple's iPhone.  The Justice Department largely agreed, saying in its legal brief that “grossly excessive and essentially arbitrary awards” would result if a company holding a design patent can sue and win all the profits of a rival. The argument was filled with examples drawn from automobiles. Samsung’s attorneys said the “total profits” rule would mean that an automaker could sue a rival and take all the profits from a line of new cars by showing the rival’s car infringed on the design of a patented cup holder. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy cited the example of a Volkswagen Beetle, whose unique look made it a worldwide success. But he said it was not clear how a jury could decide what percentage of profits should be taken from a rival firm whose cars looked like the Beetle. “If I were a juror, I wouldn’t know what to do,” Kennedy said. Sullivan conceded that in this example, VW might be entitled to most of the profits from a rival who copies the look of a Beetle or a Corvette. “It may be nobody wants to really pay much for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle,” she said. But Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said he didn’t think much of the Beetle example. “Nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because if its look,” he said. “What if it got two miles to a gallon and broke down every 50 miles?” For its part, Apple’s lawyers argued that the justices should stick with the old law and award the total profits to a company whose patented designs were copied by a rival. Samsung’s own documents in this case show that officials of the South Korean firm sought to create something like the iPhone, Apple attorney Seth Waxman said. Having done that and been caught, they should be forced to turn over their profits, he said. The justices are expected to issue a decision in the case in several months.   Last week, a federal appeals court in Washington upheld a separate $120-million verdict against Samsung for infringing other parts of Apple’s iPhone patents.

"All of Samsung`s competitors are rubbing their hands in glee," said Thomas Husson, an analyst with the Forrester technology research and consultancy firm. "It`s basically a good product, released at the right time, but a slip-up, and we`ve seen in the past with Nokia or Blackberry that these can have disastrous effects," he added. While it is too early to predict a similar disappearance from the phone market of the South Korean company, rivals are nipping at the heels of the market leader. These include not only Apple and Chinese companies like Huawei, but also internet titan Google, which entered the smartphone market last week with its own device -- the Pixel. "There will inevitably be some moderate-to-marginal benefit for Samsung’s handset rivals, more particularly Apple, perhaps faster-growing Huawei can benefit more from Samsung’s Note 7 travails," said analyst Ken Odeluga at the online trading firm City Index. - Apple and Huawei - However Ian Fogg, senior director and head of the mobile and telecoms team at the IHS technology consultancy, said that "Huawei will be the biggest beneficiary from brand damage to Samsung." One of the largest providers of network infrastructure globally, Huawei has been pushing into the smartphone market, including the top-end segment with its P9 model that features a camera with two Leica lenses. "Huawei will look to pick up sales right across its portfolio," said Fogg, noting that Huawei was already the third-largest smartphone maker. "Like Samsung, it uses Android and offers smartphones at a wide range of prices." The blow to Samsung is unlikely to be fatal, however. "Competitors might enjoy a short-term boost to sales as a result of a major player having to withdraw its new model, though overall it is likely to remain a competitive market," said Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown brokerage. Part of the reason is that its competitors have their own challenges to surmount. Huawei, for instance, still needs to build its brand in Europe and North America. Meanwhile Apple needs to recapture the excitement around its products that has disappeared in recent years. - Tip of the iceberg? - Thomas Husson at Forrester believes "it is too early to say what the long-term impact will be" from this incident, although the recall is likely to set it back a considerable amount. Linda Sui, wireless smartphone strategies director at Strategy Analytics, estimated that Samsung could lose "$10 billion or more" over the recall. "The loss of sales from the Galaxy Note is only the tip of the iceberg," warned CMCMarkets analyst Jasper Lawler. "Demand for the flagship Galaxy S8, scheduled for release early next year, could be severely impeded by the loss of consumer confidence in the Samsung brand." But City Index`s Ken Odeluga said that "nobody wants to believe Samsung has ‘lost its touch’ at producing beautiful and advanced consumer technology. "So there is some underlying sentiment that views its problems as the kind of bad luck which could afflict almost any smartphone maker that is pushing boundaries." But ManMohan Sodhi, a professor of operations and supply chain management at Cass Business School in London believes that it wasn`t bad luck as much as bad judgement. "They should have figured out the product but with Google coming out with the Pixel, they did not give it enough time," said Sodhi. While Google has developed the Android operating system that powers the smartphones made by Samsung and other manufacturers, except for Apple, it has generally stayed on the sidelines when it comes to handsets. The release of the Pixel, along with its Google Home virtual assistant, indicates that Google aims to get its artificial intelligence technology into the hands and homes of consumers.   AFP First Published: Wednesday, October 12, 2016 - 02:10 More from zeenews   India Indo-Japan N-deal: Govt says accompanying note on reasons for termination of pact not binding on India Have more projects in mind to end corruption; ready to face consequences, says PM Narendra Modi West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee speaks to President on demonetisation issue More from India World Bulgaria PM quits after pro-Russia candidate wins presidential vote Sorrowful France marks first anniversary of Paris massacre Trump's election leaves American Muslims reeling and scared More from World Sports ATP Tour Finals: Gritty Novak Djokovic avoids Dominic Thiem upset in London Usain Bolt to Borussia Dortmund: World's fastest man to join German giants for training WATCH: How chiseled Cristiano Ronaldo beats even the statue itself in Mannequin Challenge More from Sports Entertainment Kumkum Bhagya - Episode 711: Abhi leaves in quest for Pragya Know the benefits of wearing Rudraksha Movies have become easy target: Farhan Akhtar More from Entertaiment Health Flu shots, access to medication help kids combat asthma Winter special: Get rid of cracked heels with these simple home remedies!

The highest US court began hearing arguments over damages the South Korean smartphone giant owes Apple for copying key design features of the iPhone. The case, coming with Samsung facing a fresh but unrelated crisis as it halted production of a flagship handset for safety reasons. revolves around a $400 million award Samsung was ordered to pay. But more critical to industry observers is whether the justices uphold a legal standard which requires the forfeiture of all profits for violating a patent on a single component or feature. "A smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work," Samsung attorney Kathleen Sullivan argued before the eight justices. "A single design patent on the portion of the appearance of a phone should not entitle the design-patent holder to all the profit on the entire phone." Apple lawyer Seth Waxman fired back that Samsung made a conscious decision to revive its fortunes by copying the iPhone. "A design is not a component, a design is applied to a thing," Waxman said. Waxman contended that Samsung's own documents showed that the South Korean giant acted to deal with "a crisis of design." "And the crisis of design was reflected, the documents show, in the telephone company saying, you have to create something like the iPhone, and a directive came out to create something like the iPhone so we can stop ... losing sales," he argued. - Beetle example - The court debate moved from smartphones to automobiles, and the importance of design to the Volkswagen Beetle, for example. Justice Sonia Sotomayor commented: "It may be that the (Beetle) body accounts for only 10 percent of the cost of the car, but 90 percent of the profits are attributable to the shape of the car." The case is among several in courts around the world between the two smartphone giants, but this case is likely to set an important precedent on design patents. Observers are watching to see how the court -- which has not taken up a design patent case in more than a century -- tips the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. A ruling is expected in several months. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a $400 million verdict -- part of a nearly billion-dollar award in Apple's favor later reduced to $548 million -- that found Samsung had copied the iPhone, including its distinctive front screen and graphical touchscreen interface. The award -- in accordance with a statute first adopted in 1887 and later affirmed by Congress in 1952 -- requires patent violators to hand over their total profits even if the violation covers only one element of a product. Matt Levy of the Computer & Communications Industry Association said the debate suggested the justices were open to lowering the jury award. "The damages statute for design patents was written to protect products like rugs, where the design was essentially the entire thing being sold," Levy said in a blog post. "Congress certainly didn't intend to treat complex products as if only the outer appearance is what matters.... Based on what I heard, I think it's very likely that the (justices) will modify the lower court's decision." - Silicon Valley v. designers - Samsung has won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, as well as a group of law professors. Apple, for its part, got backing from big names in fashion and manufacturing, such as Calvin Klein and Adidas, and the American Intellectual Property Law Association, whose members -- largely lawyers -- represent owners and users of intellectual property. An amicus brief filed on behalf of design professionals, researchers and academics said they have no financial interest in the case but argue on the basis of "fundamental principles of visual design." They cite precedents like the Coca-Cola bottle, which is an integral part of the value of the product, according to the brief Tuesday's hearing was held before a short-handed panel of eight justices, with a ninth still missing since Antonin Scalia's death in February. The hearing takes place at a difficult time for Samsung, as it is struggling to contain a snowballing safety crisis that threatens to derail the powerhouse global brand. It told customers worldwide on Monday to stop using Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, calling a halt to global sales and exchanges following complaints that its lithium-ion battery explodes while charging.

Jimmy Iovine has something to get off his chest. The Apple executive, 63, has spent decades in the music industry as a producer, engineer, label executive and co-founder of Interscope Records, before founding Beats Electronics and Beats Music alongside Dr. Dre and, in 2014, moving to Apple after its purchase of that company in a deal worth some $3 billion. Now, 17 months after the launch of Apple Music -- which has generated plenty of headlines due to its exclusives strategy and aggressive pursuit of original content on its way to 17 million paid subscribers -- Iovine still feels like his mission is misunderstood. "What everyone's writing is the obvious right now," he tells Billboard. "They're writing, 'People in the record business are getting into tech so they can talk to people in the record business.' That's hogwash." [Ed. Note: That topic was the subject of several articles last week, including ones in Billboard and Music Business Worldwide, though Iovine's ire appeared to be aimed at a Rolling Stone article published on Yahoo.com.]  The topic is one that's of particular interest to Iovine, who alongside Dr. Dre donated $70 million to the University of Southern California at Los Angeles in 2013 to create a new institute dedicated to educating students in the arts, technology and business of innovation, which he says means "everything" to him. It's also in the context of the recent migration of former music business players such as Troy Carter, previously manager to Lady Gaga and Meghan Trainor, and Lyor Cohen, the longtime Def Jam and Warner Music Group veteran, who both recently shifted to Spotify and YouTube, respectively. But while that shift has become a trend in recent months, particularly as streaming has overtaken all other areas as the dominant revenue stream in the music industry's digital era, Iovine feels that the 'liaison narrative' being put forward is an oversimplification of a larger issue. "It took 10 years to develop this team," he says of those around him at Apple, including Trent Reznor, Luke Wood and Larry Jackson. "The people from popular culture had to understand how to talk to engineers. It isn't just them talking to record people; [otherwise] the engineer culture doesn't understand what you're talking about, doesn't take you serious, and writes you off." With Apple Music's recent redesign and its continuing foray into exclusives, both in audio streams and now its latest push into video, Jimmy Iovine breaks down the misconceptions of his strategy at Apple, the difficulty of marrying the music world with the tech world and the evolution of the company he's building now. "We are an adjunct to labels and artists," he says. "Yeah, it's a popular culture company, but it's also a tool. And that's what we're building. We're not in the record business." Billboard: Apple Music has accomplished plenty in the past year... Jimmy Iovine: Before we get into that, we have to get into the why. It's a story, it's complex. Because what everyone's writing is the obvious right now. They're writing, "People in the record business are getting into tech so they can talk to people in the record business." That's hogwash. And why it's hogwash is, it takes a certain individual... For example, I met [Apple executives] Steve Jobs and Eddy Cue in 2003. I realized, okay, the future of music is going to be intertwined with distribution through technology companies. It just looked like that to me, and I realized how far behind I personally was. So I set out to really understand. So I worked with those guys for about two years, and I said to Steve, "I'd like to do headphones with Apple with [Dr.] Dre," about two or three years later. He said, "Do it yourself, you can do it." So I tried it myself. So I built a tech company. And we built this whole company and we needed certain types of individuals for the kind of company we wanted to build. We wanted to build a tech company that had a big presence in popular culture, which was what Apple had, but no one claims to be Steve Jobs. But we wanted to have that understanding. So one of the first things I did was to hire Luke Wood, because he understood both languages. Because language is tricky. Then I needed somebody with an artist's point of view who understood the language of technology, and that was Trent Reznor. This new [user interface] that you see at Apple Music, Trent Reznor was really, truly involved on every level of it. Both in design and engineering, every week, to get it to where it was both technically right and culturally right, to do what we want to do with culture. So then I left Interscope, and Larry [Jackson] was a guy who also could speak both languages, so I took him with me. So this was a 10-year process. Then we sold to Apple. Then Apple brought over 250 people from popular culture, from the media business -- not one, 250 people. Right? So that's why all of this is missing the point: it took 10 years to develop this team. We're so committed to this that Dre and I started a school at USC.  So people that hire record executives -- I don't know what these people can or can't do -- but Larry and Trent and Luke were guys that I just knew, instinctively and through working with them, that they could learn this. That's very important. Because every time I read, "Oh, they're hiring music people!" How naïve! You know what's wrong? There are too many journalists, too many articles and not enough time to do the research and the depth of what you need to get a story right. What I read on Yahoo this morning was so f---ing absurd. Anyway, so I had a good morning. [Laughs] What was it about guys like Larry, then, that made you think he was the type of person who would be able to walk that line? A lot of young people have that feel because they were brought up communicating through technology and got their entertainment through technology and dealing with technology. So they really have a feel for it. Some of them go the extra yard to really try to understand -- they're not coders, but at least they understand the language and want to learn about it. Larry had those qualities and had the capacity and the inclination for that. So I believe I was right. And he's been doing very well at Apple, and he's been working with people from the tech world. And that's very, very, very difficult, and it's why I started my school. This isn't something that just happened overnight, this has been going on since 2004. This year, though, those 10 years of prep and build up have manifested themselves in a lot of projects, and that's why I wanted to ask you --  Yeah, and there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes to make this balance work. Robert Kondrk and I work constantly on blending the cultures, and he should be mentioned because he's working very, very hard on blending the cultures with me, of blending Apple and the people from Beats. And Eddy Cue is incredibly natural; he's gifted, because he was Steve's guy, so he learned a lot about this and he's very open and has a great feel for popular culture and media. So you put that team together, and you've got a shot. And what we're going to do, what we're doing now that hasn't been revealed yet, is we're building the right hybrid. And we believe it's the right hybrid, and the combination of these things together, we'll build a music service that is technologically and culturally adept.  Can you share anything about what that might look like? I can't. But I can tell you that we are, you know... Larry, Trent, Luke on the headphones side, Zane Lowe [with Beats 1], we're all working to create something -- and Robert Kondrk -- that we can just blend into correctly and not just say, "Let's just get somebody from a record company to go make the deal we want." That has nothing to do with what it -- capital IT -- is. And, you know, it's been a road. The last three years both sides have had to work to really understand each other. And I have to have people with the capacity and the capability of learning. You guys have taken some risks since the launch of Apple Music, I'd say most recently with Drake's short film, Please Forgive Me. Will you be getting more into video and film projects? We're going to do whatever we believe is great. We are going to make a combination of tech and popular culture that is exciting and adept at both areas. So that's what you're starting to see. It's going to have a voice. It's not going to be just a utility -- "Go here and get your music, good luck," or, "We're going to send you a list" -- that's great, but that's not what this is. That's not what this was, anyway. Do you ever look back at -- I don't have a rear-view mirror. I'm just working so hard, because it's so hard to get right, how to work in the tech world. It's not the same. You're going from one world to another world, and we are starting to succeed. But this has been 10 years of preparation, two companies built -- Beats Electronics and Beats Music -- and then the people were chosen and understood how to work in both worlds. This is not something where you can just pluck somebody out of the air. Larry's been with me for eight years. Trent's been with me for 20 years. Luke's been with me for 15 years. I'm hoping you get the feel for what I'm talking about.  So are you looking at building a future where there is no line between those two industries? No, no, no, no, no. We are an adjunct to labels and artists. We are building something that can help labels and artists and undiscovered artists. Yeah, it's a popular culture company, but it's also a tool. And that's what we're building. We're not in the record business. For some reason, this has to be the case for it to really work. That's why there are so many people out there in media companies that don't understand; they work on the digital side of the record companies, but they don't understand the language of the world of technology companies, what it's like to be in a technology company and how they perceive things. Like I said, we built the number-one headphone company in the world today. We didn't go out and make a headphone company and say we're in the tech business, we built the number one headphone company. And that went to Apple with all the people. So those people are trained, multi-disciplined. And that is important to me. And that's what I hope you get out of this, the understanding. I'm constantly finding and training people that can be in both worlds. And I would like to include them, because it takes a lot. It takes a lot from our side and a lot from their side. Ed.

"All of Samsung's competitors are rubbing their hands in glee," said Thomas Husson, an analyst with the Forrester technology research and consultancy firm. "It's basically a good product, released at the right time, but a slip-up, and we've seen in the past with Nokia or Blackberry that these can have disastrous effects," he added. While it is too early to predict a similar disappearance from the phone market of the South Korean company, rivals are nipping at the heels of the market leader. These include not only Apple and Chinese companies like Huawei, but also internet titan Google, which entered the smartphone market last week with its own device -- the Pixel. "There will inevitably be some moderate-to-marginal benefit for Samsung?s handset rivals, more particularly Apple, perhaps faster-growing Huawei can benefit more from Samsung?s Note 7 travails," said analyst Ken Odeluga at the online trading firm City Index. - Apple and Huawei - However Ian Fogg, senior director and head of the mobile and telecoms team at the IHS technology consultancy, said that "Huawei will be the biggest beneficiary from brand damage to Samsung." One of the largest providers of network infrastructure globally, Huawei has been pushing into the smartphone market, including the top-end segment with its P9 model that features a camera with two Leica lenses. "Huawei will look to pick up sales right across its portfolio," said Fogg, noting that Huawei was already the third-largest smartphone maker. "Like Samsung, it uses Android and offers smartphones at a wide range of prices." The blow to Samsung is unlikely to be fatal, however. "Competitors might enjoy a short-term boost to sales as a result of a major player having to withdraw its new model, though overall it is likely to remain a competitive market," said Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown brokerage. Part of the reason is that its competitors have their own challenges to surmount. Huawei, for instance, still needs to build its brand in Europe and North America. Meanwhile Apple needs to recapture the excitement around its products that has disappeared in recent years. - Tip of the iceberg? - Thomas Husson at Forrester believes "it is too early to say what the long-term impact will be" from this incident, although the recall is likely to set it back a considerable amount. Linda Sui, wireless smartphone strategies director at Strategy Analytics, estimated that Samsung could lose "$10 billion or more" over the recall. "The loss of sales from the Galaxy Note is only the tip of the iceberg," warned CMCMarkets analyst Jasper Lawler. "Demand for the flagship Galaxy S8, scheduled for release early next year, could be severely impeded by the loss of consumer confidence in the Samsung brand." But City Index's Ken Odeluga said that "nobody wants to believe Samsung has ?lost its touch? at producing beautiful and advanced consumer technology. "So there is some underlying sentiment that views its problems as the kind of bad luck which could afflict almost any smartphone maker that is pushing boundaries." But ManMohan Sodhi, a professor of operations and supply chain management at Cass Business School in London believes that it wasn't bad luck as much as bad judgement. "They should have figured out the product but with Google coming out with the Pixel, they did not give it enough time," said Sodhi. While Google has developed the Android operating system that powers the smartphones made by Samsung and other manufacturers, except for Apple, it has generally stayed on the sidelines when it comes to handsets. The release of the Pixel, along with its Google Home virtual assistant, indicates that Google aims to get its artificial intelligence technology into the hands and homes of consumers.

Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Oct 11, 2016 at 2:38PM Image source: Samsung. It looks like it's the end of the line for Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) ill-fated Galaxy Note7. The mobile giant is halting production of the device after a few flame-bursting handsets resulted in a recall. Samsung is now asking wireless carriers and retail partners to cease sales and exchanges, opening the door for rival handset makers. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is being played up as a huge beneficiary here. The stock is shooting higher, and a couple of Wall Street pros see the class act of Cupertino scoring millions of incremental iPhone sales in light of the calamity at Samsung.  Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White feels that Apple stands to score at least 8 million more iPhone units this quarter. That would be more than half of the 10 million to 14 million Galaxy Note7 handsets that White was expecting Samsung to ship this year, though Credit Suisse feels that this will cost Samsung to miss out on 19 million units. S&P analyst Angelo Zino is even more aggressive. He sees Apple picking up 14 million to 15 million iPhone sales as a result of the Note7 fiasco. This would translate into Android relinquishing 1% of the market share to Apple's proprietary iOS, based on the roughly 1.5 billion smartphones that industry trackers expect to ship this year.  Another bite of the Apple Things obviously bode well for Apple in this scenario, and the stock has been shooting higher as Samsung stock takes a hit. Apple stock hit a 10-month high today on the news. However, it's also important to have realistic expectations here. Apple is going to benefit from the blazing death of the Galaxy Note7, but let's not get too ahead of ourselves here. Samsung is going to have a hard time getting back on track. This is just one of the many devices in its wide product line, but the Samsung and Galaxy brands are going to get tarnished. That's clearly good for Apple, but it's probably even better for many other makers of Android devices.  Android remains the mobile operating system of choice, commanding 87.6% of the market during the second quarter according to industry researcher IDC. It's far easier and cheaper to replace an Android device with a rival Android smartphone. If someone deliberately chose Android over iOS in singling out the Note7, it's a fair bet that those reasons are still in play.  We also get to the unfortunate timing of the event. Apple just rolled out the iPhone 7 last month, but there's an inventory shortage of the larger iPhone 7 Plus models. That's going to be a problem. Buyers of the Galaxy Note7 were likely drawn to the 5.7-inch display. This would make the iPhone 7 Plus and its 5.5-inch display a clearer replacement choice than the iPhone 7 with its 4.7-inch display.  Unfortunately for Apple and iPhone 7 Plus seekers, new orders for Apple's largest (and priciest) smartphone won't be filled for another three to four weeks. If you own a Note7, are you really going to risk a fire or go without a smartphone for nearly a month? If you bought the gargantuan-sized Note7, you will probably move to a bigger Android device before opting for the relatively puny iPhone 7.  Apple is going to make out like a bandit here, but it may not be as big a winner as bulls and some Wall Street pros expect it to be. It's great to see Apple stock surging back into market fancy in recent months, but we've seen what unrealistic expectations have done to the stock when things don't play out just right.  Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple.

(Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters) By Robert Barnes October 11 Follow @scotusreporter The Supreme Court seemed prepared Tuesday to allow Samsung to recover at least some of the nearly $400 million it had to pay Apple for incorporating into its smartphones some of the innovative design elements of the iPhone. But the justices did not seem ready to approve lower-court decisions that said Samsung must pay all the profits from 11 phone models for violating several of Apple’s design patents. Samsung’s lawyer Kathleen M. Sullivan reminded the court that smartphones contain more than 200,000 technologies that are not at issue. But in their first examination of design patents in more than a century, the justices seemed vexed about how to devise a test that would allow judges and juries to figure out how to compensate an injured patent holder. “It’s one thing to leave it to the jury,” said Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. “If I were the juror, I wouldn’t know what to do.” The case is one of several legal battles between Samsung and Apple over the lucrative smartphone market. It not only is important for the companies but also could have a significant impact on the high-tech industry, where design and function are key to success. The court is trying to interpret a statute that says that a party that infringes on a design patent may be held “liable . . . to the extent of his total profit.” But it also says that such infringement occurs when the design patent is applied to “any article of manufacture.” In other words, is the patent holder entitled to all of the profits from the sale of a complex product, even if the design applies only one component? Or are the damages confined to the value solely of that design feature? Sullivan argued that it is simpler when the product is something like the design of a carpet or of wallpaper. But Apple’s design patents on a flat rectangular screen with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons are a small part of Samsung’s smartphone. “A single design patent on the portion of the appearance of a phone should not entitle the design patent holder to all the profit on the entire phone,” she argued. But the justices had trouble drawing that line. Referring to examples in amicus briefs, they asked about something as iconic as the design of the Volkswagen Beetle and how one would determine whether the automaker would be able to collect the entire profits of a rival who copied the design. “Nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks,” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said. Sullivan, the Obama administration and even Apple lawyer Seth P. Waxman agreed that the “article of manufacture” could be just part of the product in some cases. But not in this case, Waxman said. “Whatever you determine the right instruction should be, there is no basis to overturn the jury’s damages verdict in this case,” Waxman said. Samsung never identified “any article of manufacture other than the phones themselves.” Waxman said Samsung faced what one executive described as a “crisis of design” and decided to copy the revolutionary look of the iPhone rather than continue to lose sales to its competitor. But Sullivan countered that the company tried to make the argument that it should be liable for only a share of the profits and was stymied by lower-court rulings. Justice Stephen G. Breyer said those disagreements led him to think that more work was needed. “We have a hard-enough question trying to figure out what the standard is,” Breyer told Waxman. “Now, why can’t we just ask the lower courts to listen to your arguments and theirs, and work it out?” The case is Samsung Electronics Co. v.

The high court is set to hear arguments over financial damages the South Korean smartphone giant owes Apple for allegedly violating design patents by producing copycats of its groundbreaking smartphone. Observers are watching the case closely to see how the court — which has not taken up a design patent case in more than a century — tips the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. A ruling is expected in several months. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a $400 million verdict — part of a nearly billion-dollar award in Apple’s favor later reduced to $548 million — that found Samsung had copied the iPhone’s distinctive front screen and graphical touchscreen user interface. California-based Apple had protected those features with US design patents that concern the way items look. They are distinct from utility patents, which protect how articles are used and work, and do not concern copyrights or trademarks. Samsung is challenging the verdict, disputing how damages are calculated in design patent cases. Such awards are currently determined by devices’ “total profit,” in accordance with a statute first adopted in 1887 and re-adopted in 1952. Samsung argues it should be held liable only for some portion of the profit tied to patented design aspects, given the many innovative components that go into the making of smartphones. Apple interprets the statute more narrowly, saying it is entitled to all profits from Samsung’s phones. – How much design protection? – The legal battle, which began more than five years ago, could have major repercussions in a tech industry where design and innovation play key roles in distinguishing one device from another. But a major debate is underway on just how much protection should be granted for visual design. In preparation for its arguments before the Supreme Court, Samsung obtained the support of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, as well as a group of law professors. Apple, for its part, got backing from big names in fashion and manufacturing, such as Calvin Klein and Adidas, and the American Intellectual Property Law Association, whose members — largely lawyers — represent owners and users of intellectual property. – Look-alike smartphones – Apple’s supporters argue that Samsung’s argument would hurt the tech industry by weakening the patent system. “A strong patent system will force technology companies to actually innovate, not mimic. That is how patent systems are designed to work all over the world,” said Matthew Siegal, an intellectual property lawyer with the firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. “The differences in Samsung and Apple smartphones are marginal because of copying, not innovating,” he added. “A strong patent system will lead to the next generation phone based on actual innovation.” Tuesday’s hearing is set to take place in the court’s cavernous marble hall before a short-handed panel of eight justices, with a ninth still missing since Antonin Scalia’s death in February. Republicans in Congress have refused to replace him with President Barack Obama’s nominee before the Democrat leaves office in January. The hearing takes place at a difficult time for Samsung, as it is struggling to contain a snowballing safety crisis that threatens to derail the powerhouse global brand. It told customers worldwide on Monday to stop using Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, calling a halt to global sales and exchanges following complaints that its lithium-ion battery explodes while charging. Apple is also facing challenges from mounting international competition, having lost a critical share of the Chinese market after critics there found its latest iPhone 7 lacks major innovations.

A decision could take months. But the resulting opinion could set a precedent on whether the look and feel of a product — protected by design patents — entitles the designer to the entire profit, regardless of what's inside, legal experts said. This case began in 2011, when Apple sued Samsung for copying design features of its devices, including, among other things, its colorful grid of app icons. Two lower courts ruled in Apple's favor on design-patent infringement. At dispute is $400 million dollars, representing profits from Samsung smartphones, which Samsung was ordered to pay Apple. That penalty is based on a federal law that says that a party copying and applying a patented design to "any article of manufacture" is liable "to the extent of his total profit." "We firmly believe that strong design patent protection spurs creativity and innovation," said Noreen Krall, Apple's Chief Litigation Counsel, after the hearing this morning at the Supreme Court. "And that's why we've defended ourselves against those who steal our ideas." Samsung counters that the $400 million penalty is disproportionate. Specifically, the South Korean giant says Apple is not entitled to total profits from the entire phone, but only the profit from the components that infringe. "When design patent law was created in the 17th century, products were much simpler," Samsung said in a statement. "It pertained to things like the handle of a spoon or a carpet pattern, which may have driven a purchase decision. By comparison, today, there are more than 200,000 patents in a single smartphone." Beyond the $400 million, there is a broader principle at the center of this case that could ripple through the tech industry: What is the appropriate method to assess damages for design patent infringement? Christopher Carani, a professor at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, said that how the Supreme Court rules on that issue could have far-reaching implications. "If we see a strong [decision] in favor of protecting these design rights, I think we're going to see more investment in design," Carani told CNBC. "People will have to push their designs further to make sure that they stay far away from other people's designs. But if we don't, then you might see more similar designs on the marketplace." show chapters <p>Apple vs. Samsung: What you need to know</p> <p>Apple and Samsung will appear before the US Supreme Court to argue why their opponent was wrong when it came to a patent case from 2012.</p> Apple vs. Samsung: What you need to know    Monday, 10 Oct 2016 | 6:50 AM ET | 01:21 "The key here for the Supreme Court is to try and strike a balance that doesn't stifle competition but also spurs innovation," he said. Silicon Valley is weighing in, but not all companies are on the same side. Companies such as Facebook, eBay and Google have come to Samsung's defense. They argue that taking Samsung's total profits would lead to — in their words — "absurd results" and a devastating impact on companies that spend billions of dollars every year on research and development. Modern technological products, so these companies say, "are not purchased primarily based on the design of one or more isolated components." Apple CEO Tim Cook has plenty of powerful allies as well, both in and out of technology. Fashion companies such as Tiffany, Adidas and Jenny Yoo have said the "total profits" rule "helps ensure that designers have the appropriate incentives and rewards to make investments in innovative designs," lamenting the rising costs of hunting down knock-offs and "design pirates." Also, more than 100 well-known designers including Bentley's director of design, Microsoft's creative director and Calvin Klein signed a court brief supporting Apple in this battle. Their argument: Apple is entitled to Samsung's entire profits because it's the design that motivates consumers to buy those products in the first place. "History shows that a product's visual design drives sales and becomes the product itself in the minds of consumers," the designers argued.

With this app, a free download from the App Store, a single tap on your wrist buys a digital bus ticket for services like Frimobil, Passepartout, Libero, STI and Engadin Mobil. Additional public transport fare partnerships will follow later this year. The app made its debut on the iPhone in April of 2016. See how buying a bus ticket from your wrist works in the video embedded below. Now check out a machine-translated excerpt from the report which describes how FAIRTIQ’s Apple Watch app works: The passenger signals the start of his journey with a click before boarding the vehicle and terminates in the same way once arrived. Thanks to the GPS, the system calculates the distance traveled and the corresponding ticket most advantageous. If the user makes several trips in a day and a day pass would have proved a more economical option for him FAIRTIQ not charge him the amount of the daily chart in question. Also, if you forget the part of the user, the application automatically calls to end the trip. And this is the original promotional video for the FAIRTIQ app. The app was created by a company called FAIRTIQ SA in partnership with public transport services Fribourg and Lucerne and the Rhaetian Railway.

Michael Noonan said while delivering the budget on Tuesday that Ireland’s 12.5% rate for companies “will not be changed”. His comments will have been welcomed in Ireland’s second city, Cork. It is home to Apple’s main plant in Europe and, in a visit to the city last week, its citizens were equally supportive of the state’s dealings with the tech giant in a relationship that goes back over 40 years. Set on the northern outskirts of Cork, beside the working class housing estate of Holyhill, Apple’s European headquarters is heavily guarded with employees under strict instructions not to talk to any media at its main entrance. However, public backing for the 12.5% rate is not difficult to find outside the Apple site. Tony Fitzgerald, who has lived on the Holyhill estate for 40 years, said that the majority of people in the city look favourably on the hi-tech giant’s presence. Global criticism of Apple grew in August after the European commission ruled that the company owed Ireland €13bn (£11.85bn) in back taxes.

Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA Fitzgerald, a Cork city councillor for Ireland’s main opposition party, Fianna Fail, recently travelled to Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California. He was part of a cross-party delegation from Cork council that attended an international IT conference as the guest of Apple. While there Fitzgerald and other councillors pressed Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, if the company was still committed to Cork four decades after its founder, Steve Jobs, came to open the plant. “Tim Cook was adamant about Apple’s ongoing commitment to Cork, which of course was what we wanted to hear. What struck me most about being shown around Apple’s HQ was the amount of people from Cork working there. It demonstrated to me the strong bonds between our city and Apple that have been built over 40 years.” Fitzgerald said there were “massive spin-off benefits” for Holyhill and neighbouring areas from Apple’s presence. “Apple has helped the development of the north side of Cork, including infrastructure. The presence of so many workers has resulted in the building of new road links and even a regular new bus service that runs every 10 minutes. “As well as funding apprentice and training programmes, the company has put computers into local schools and colleges. “Regardless of what has been said in the European Union and [of] its ruling, the people of this area want Apple to stay here,” he added. Among those who travelled to Apple’s base in the United States was Conor Healy, the head of Cork’s chamber of commerce.

Our visit was a pre-planned event before the EU’s decision, but it was never raised when we there. He simply repeated Apple’s commitment to Cork,” he said. Asked about concerns over the perceived unfairness of some of Apple’s tax arrangements in Ireland, Healy said that the low corporation taxation regime was “absolutely non-negotiable”. He added: “There are thousands upon thousands of jobs dependent on Apple and other foreign direct investment companies being based here in Cork. The 12.5% rate is a fiscal policy. No Irish government should change that. “The Apple workforce will soon be at 6,000 and since 2009 they have invested €100m in the plant at Holyhill. Their presence, like other multinationals, has created a business ecosystem in Cork that is leading to the creation of more startups in the city. “The message here in Cork is that no one wants that to change. They are a key part of Cork’s economy.” More news Topics Apple Ireland European commission Tax and spending European Union Tim Cook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story Apple tax ruling must be overturned, says US business group Business Roundtable warns of ‘grievous self-inflicted wound’ for EU and its people after Brussels’ ruling that Apple must pay back Ireland €13bn in taxes Published: 16 Sep 2016 Apple tax ruling must be overturned, says US business group 'Political crap': Tim Cook condemns Apple tax ruling Chief executive criticises EU’s imposition of €13bn back tax bill and accuses authorities of ‘picking on’ Ireland Published: 1 Sep 2016 'Political crap': Tim Cook condemns Apple tax ruling Why Apple’s low-tax deal is no blueprint for Brexit Britain The sweetheart tax deals offered by Ireland to the global corporate elite are coming to an end – because they are not sustainable, politically or socially Published: 3 Sep 2016 Why Apple’s low-tax deal is no blueprint for Brexit Britain The Observer view on global reform of corporate tax No significant economy has achieved growth by slashing tax on big business Published: 3 Sep 2016 The Observer view on global reform of corporate tax Europe, Apple, and the money burning a hole in Silicon Valley’s wallet Published: 3 Sep 2016 Europe, Apple, and the money burning a hole in Silicon Valley’s wallet Time for Apple to open up the MacBooks Nils Pratley Published: 1 Sep 2016 Time for Apple to open up the MacBooks Irish government to appeal against Apple's €13bn tax bill Published: 2 Sep 2016 Irish government to appeal against Apple's €13bn tax bill The Apple tax ruling – what this means for Ireland, tax and multinationals Published: 30 Aug 2016 The Apple tax ruling – what this means for Ireland, tax and multinationals More more on this story popular The Guardian back to top home election 2016 US world opinion sports soccer tech selected arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home election 2016 US world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech selected arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Technology › Apple Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2016 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Tech News | 11 Oct 2016 | Print  | Comment (0) Google Event Unveils Smartphones, Wi-Fi, VR, and Streaming Devices by Julio Ojeda-Zapata In what has become a recurring exercise, Google recently staged a product announcement just weeks after Apple’s media event revealed the iPhone 7, Apple Watch Series 2, and AirPods. As with a previous such event (see “Google I/O 2016 Includes Announcements with Apple Appeal,” 23 May 2016), much of what Google showed off has direct parallels with the Apple world. Notably, both companies showed off their next-generation smartphones. But while the Google event might seem like a me-too exercise with an undercurrent of Apple envy, it demonstrated how Google is outpacing its Cupertino competitor in some ways. Google’s new Pixel smartphones don’t blow the new iPhone 7 models out of the water, but they do have characteristics that might inspire some envy. And Google is pulling ahead of Apple in areas such as Wi-Fi and virtual reality. None of Google’s improvements are so significant that Apple users will be enticed to switch, but the competition should keep Apple on its toes. iPhone, Meet Pixel -- Google has jettisoned the Nexus brand that it long used for the smartphones it sells directly to the public, shifting to Pixel — the name it previously used for its Pixel C tablet and the recently discontinued Chromebook Pixel laptop. Google’s new phones bear the monikers Pixel and Pixel XL. Aesthetically, the Pixel devices might strike many as iPhone copycats with roughly comparable contours, though Google has opted to sheathe the aluminum devices front and back in glass — we all know how well that worked out for the iPhone 4 and 4s. Google does earn a few creativity points for the names of its phone colors: Very Silver, Quite Black, and the limited-edition Really Blue. More significantly, Google has added a raft of technical improvements to make the Pixel phones competitive with both the iPhone 7 and high-end phones from other Android-based phone makers. The Pixel’s 12-megapixel camera is one of the biggest shots across Apple’s bow. Google made much of the fact that the camera does not bulge the way the iPhone 7’s camera does, although the Pixel is slightly thicker overall than the iPhone 7. Even so, Google claims the camera is “the highest rated smartphone camera anyone has ever made” with a DxOMark Mobile score of 89, along with exceptional low-light performance (an iPhone 7 bragging point) and a Lens Blur feature to achieve shallow depth of field and bokeh effects (similar to the iPhone’s new Portrait feature). But the Pixels lack one key camera feature: optical image stabilization, that’s found on both iPhone 7 models. For comparison, the iPhone 7 scored 86 on the DxOMark Mobile test. iPhone users may feel pangs of jealousy at Google’s offer of free, unlimited storage of original-quality, full-resolution photos and videos via its Google Photos service. Apple’s iCloud still offers just a measly 5 GB of free storage for use with iCloud Photo Library. Quick-charging technology gives the Pixel phones another edge over the iPhone 7. The Google handsets can go from uncharged to about 7 hours of battery life with only 15 minutes of charging via an 18-watt charger plugged into a USB-C port and a technology called USB-PD (Power Direct). Apple could presumably bring quick-charging technology to the iPhone since the 12.9-inch iPad Pro already has rapid charging (see “iPad Pro Charges Faster with MacBook Adapter and New Cable,” 27 April 2016). Google has kept its fingerprint sensor on the back of its handsets, and not on the front like iPhones. The goal is to allow users to pick up and authenticate in one fell swoop, though that’s easy to do on the iPhone as well. The Pixel phones are, behind the scenes, a significant Google strategy shift since the company had previously partnered with third-party hardware makers for its Nexus phones. Now, it says, it is “bringing hardware and software design under one roof,” although it’s still outsourcing the actual manufacturing. Sound familiar? The 5-inch Pixel starts at $649 and the 5.5-inch XL at $769 — both with 32 GB of storage. The phones max out at 128 GB of storage. Both are slated to ship later this month. Google at Your Service -- The Pixels are also the first Android smartphones to incorporate the intelligent new Google Assistant (see “Google I/O 2016 Includes Announcements with Apple Appeal,” 23 May 2016), which is roughly comparable to Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. As also revealed last May, Google Assistant is also the core of the new Google Home voice-activated hardware that competes directly with Amazon’s Echo device and has — to the dismay of some — no direct Apple equivalent. Google Home will, though, work with both iOS and Android devices. Google had no major new revelations about Google Assistant and Google Home, except to say the latter will ship in November 2016 and start at $129 with a white top and gray fabric-covered base. More color schemes are on the way to match different home decor. Virtual Reality, Step Two -- Google has for several years done a good job promoting the emergent virtual-reality technology via its Cardboard goggles (see “On the iPhone, Virtual Reality Is Unofficially Real,” 17 June 2016). The slew of available Cardboard versions from Google and third-party makers tend to be simple by design in order to remain affordable. But now Google is starting a fresh chapter in its virtual-reality crusade with second-generation goggles called Daydream View. For now, the Daydream View is fully compatible only with the Pixel handsets. Compatibility with other Android phones is coming, but Google didn’t comment on future iPhone compatibility. Physically, a smartphone fits into the Daydream View’s flip-down lid, which you then close to make the phone into the VR brains and viewer once you put the goggles on your head. The Daydream View and Pixel pair automatically — similar to how Apple’s AirPods will pair with Macs and iOS devices. The Daydream View adds a new element: a small handheld controller vaguely reminiscent of Apple’s pre-Siri Apple TV remote that enables a degree of interactivity. Google notes that the new controller “points where you point and is packed with sensors to understand your movements and gestures. You can swing it like a bat, or wave it like a wand. And it’s so precise that you can draw with it.” When not in use, the controller stores on the inside of the Daydream View’s flip-out lid. Now, why didn’t Apple think of something like this for its easy-to-misplace Pencil? Mesh Wi-Fi — Apple’s AirPort Wi-Fi base stations have seen precious few updates in recent years. Meanwhile, other hardware makers have steadily advanced the state of the Wi-Fi art. One popular approach revolves around selling access points in sets of three or more to improve coverage (via what is called a “mesh network” in some cases). Eero has made a name for itself with such a system (see “Eero Provides Good Wi-Fi Coverage in a Handsome Package,” 25 June 2016). Google is now getting into this game with a device called Google Wifi that will be sold in multiples, unlike the company’s older OnHub Wi-Fi router (see “Google OnHub Router Aims to Simplify Wi-Fi for Everyone,” 19 August 2015, and “Google’s OnHub Router Gets Rough Treatment in Early Reviews,” 31 August 2015). The gadgets, which are short, white cylinders with wraparound light rings, create a residence-wide mesh network. According to Google, they are simple to set up, have robust privacy features, and auto-adjust to optimize performance — these are all Eero claims to fame. Google Wifi will be available in November 2016 for $129 for a single device, or $299 for a three-pack. Chromecast, Take Three -- While Apple has taken a sophisticated streaming-box approach with its full-featured Apple TV, Google keeps things simpler with its Chromecast video-streaming and audio-streaming accessories. The Chromecast devices certainly aren’t pretty. The video-streaming version, now in its third generation, is a coin-like gadget with a short HDMI cord that hangs from a TV’s rear or side HDMI port. There is no remote, either. You have to use your phone (it supports both the iPhone and Android phones) to pull up online streaming content that you then send to the TV via the Chromecast. Google’s new Chromecast Ultra features significant improvements, though, like 4K video and High Dynamic Range support, better Wi-Fi performance, and an Ethernet port for situations where Wi-Fi doesn’t work well. The Apple TV notably lacks support for 4K video and HDR, though it has long sported an Ethernet port. Google integrated the Chromecast Ultra with the new Google Home device, so you’ll be able to use Google Home to control a Chromecast Ultra with your voice, much like Siri on the Apple TV. That should get around some of the pain of not having a remote. Chromecast Ultra will become available in November 2016 for $69, a bargain compared to the Apple TV, which starts at $149. Competition Makes the World Go Round -- Nothing Google announced at its this product event is likely to make an Apple user jump ship. Sure, Apple users who followed these Google revelations might be a bit jealous due to the lack of fast charging in the iPhones, the absence of HDR and 4K in the Apple TV, the dearth of innovation in Apple’s AirPort base stations, the lack of an Amazon Echo/Google Home competitor, and Apple’s no-show status in the increasingly active virtual-reality field. But that’s not the point. Apple’s gear has plenty of other advantages for now, and Google’s improvements keep Apple from resting on its product design laurels. And that results in better technology for us all.   READERS LIKE YOU! Support TidBITS by becoming a member today!

Posted 12 Oct 2016 02:39 Updated 12 Oct 2016 02:40 The highest US court began hearing arguments over damages the South Korean smartphone giant owes Apple for copying key design features of the iPhone. (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/files) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A WASHINGTON: The epic patent clash between Apple and Samsung went before the Supreme Court on Tuesday (Oct 11), as the smartphone giants debated the value of design in a case that could set an important legal precedent. The highest US court began hearing arguments over damages the South Korean smartphone giant owes Apple for copying key design features of the iPhone. The case, coming with Samsung facing a fresh but unrelated crisis as it halted production of a flagship handset for safety reasons. revolves around a US$400 million award Samsung was ordered to pay. But more critical to industry observers is whether the justices uphold a legal standard which requires the forfeiture of all profits for violating a patent on a single component or feature. "A smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work," Samsung attorney Kathleen Sullivan argued before the eight justices. "A single design patent on the portion of the appearance of a phone should not entitle the design-patent holder to all the profit on the entire phone." Apple lawyer Seth Waxman fired back that Samsung made a conscious decision to revive its fortunes by copying the iPhone. "A design is not a component, a design is applied to a thing," Waxman said. Waxman contended that Samsung's own documents showed that the South Korean giant acted to deal with "a crisis of design." "And the crisis of design was reflected, the documents show, in the telephone company saying, you have to create something like the iPhone, and a directive came out to create something like the iPhone so we can stop ... losing sales," he argued. BEETLE EXAMPLE The court debate moved from smartphones to automobiles, and the importance of design to the Volkswagen Beetle, for example. Justice Sonia Sotomayor commented: "It may be that the (Beetle) body accounts for only 10 percent of the cost of the car, but 90 per cent of the profits are attributable to the shape of the car." The case is among several in courts around the world between the two smartphone giants, but this case is likely to set an important precedent on design patents. Observers are watching to see how the court - which has not taken up a design patent case in more than a century - tips the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. A ruling is expected in several months. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a US$400 million verdict - part of a nearly billion-dollar award in Apple's favor later reduced to US$548 million - that found Samsung had copied the iPhone, including its distinctive front screen and graphical touchscreen interface. The award - in accordance with a statute first adopted in 1887 and later affirmed by Congress in 1952 - requires patent violators to hand over their total profits even if the violation covers only one element of a product. Matt Levy of the Computer & Communications Industry Association said the debate suggested the justices were open to lowering the jury award. "The damages statute for design patents was written to protect products like rugs, where the design was essentially the entire thing being sold," Levy said in a blog post. "Congress certainly didn't intend to treat complex products as if only the outer appearance is what matters ... Based on what I heard, I think it's very likely that the (justices) will modify the lower court's decision." SILICON VALLEY VS DESIGNERS Samsung has won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, as well as a group of law professors. Apple, for its part, got backing from big names in fashion and manufacturing, such as Calvin Klein and Adidas, and the American Intellectual Property Law Association, whose members - largely lawyers - represent owners and users of intellectual property. An amicus brief filed on behalf of design professionals, researchers and academics said they have no financial interest in the case but argue on the basis of "fundamental principles of visual design." They cite precedents like the Coca-Cola bottle, which is an integral part of the value of the product, according to the brief Tuesday's hearing was held before a short-handed panel of eight justices, with a ninth still missing since Antonin Scalia's death in February. The hearing takes place at a difficult time for Samsung, as it is struggling to contain a snowballing safety crisis that threatens to derail the powerhouse global brand. It told customers worldwide on Monday to stop using Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, calling a halt to global sales and exchanges following complaints that its lithium-ion battery explodes while charging. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

With my minimal ADSL bandwidth, it takes about one to two hours to download to the hard drive the first 30% of a hired movie. Should I stop using it ? What should its replacement be ? Reply Adam Engst   2016-10-11 09:45 It all depends on what your bandwidth really is. Here's what Apple recommends for streaming content: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203422 And what Netflix recommends. https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306 I'd say that if you don't have at least 2.5 Mbps download speed, you should probably stick with your existing setup as long as you can.

Read more about the stories in today's news: U.S. Blames Russia for Hacking Election Systems, DNC More Plaintiffs Join Apple 'Touch Disease' Suit IBM Launches Watson Application Developer Certification Program Yammer Gains New Office Document Creation and Collaboration Tools       Today's topics include the accusations that Russia was responsible for the hacks on the election systems and the DNC, the rising number of plaintiffs in the Apple "Touch Disease" lawsuit, the launch of IBM's new Watson Application Developer Certification program and the addition of Microsoft's Office document creation and collaboration features to the Yammer social platform. The Obama administration has squarely blamed the Russian government for a series of hacks aimed at influencing the 2016 presidential election. Over the past 18 months, online attackers have compromised the networks and computers of the Democratic National Committee, leaked emails and other documents, targeted election systems, and attempted to interfere or undermine trust in the coming U.S. elections. On Oct. 7, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Intelligence Community explicitly called out the Russian government as the perpetrator behind the hacks. New plaintiffs have joined a class action complaint against Apple, claiming the so-called "Touch Disease" has infected their iPhone 6 and 6 Plus smartphones and accusing Apple of violating a long list of consumer protection, deceptive trade loss and warranty acts. The original suit, filed Aug. 27 in a Northern California U.S. District Court, named three plaintiffs, who the document said were also filing "on behalf of others similarly situated." An updated suit, filed Oct. 7, names 12 plaintiffs, plus "others similarly situated," and includes the intentions of "9,539 class members who have experienced the Touchscreen Defect." Their suit arises, the document states, from "Apple's concealment of a material manufacturing defect that ultimately causes iPhone touchscreens to become unresponsive and fail for their essential purpose as smartphones." IBM has launched a new Watson Application Developer Certification program to recognize developers who are qualified to build applications on the Watson cognitive computing platform. Not only will the certification program enable developers to test and validate their expertise in developing artificial intelligence-based cognitive computing applications, but it also will help organizations looking to hire developers to identify those who are qualified to build enterprise- and consumer-ready solutions, IBM said. The certification testing is available through Pearson VUE, which specializes in computer-based testing and certification. In the test, developers are given 105 minutes to answer 64 questions, and a score of 70 percent correct is required to pass. Prerequisite knowledge for the test includes familiarity with provisioning services on IBM Bluemix; employing web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript and CSS; and developing applications with RESTful APIs. Microsoft started rolling out an update to its Yammer business-focused social platform on Oct. 7 that enables teams to create and work together on Office files. "With [the Oct. 7] announcement, users can now create Office documents such as Word, PowerPoint and Excel and co-author them with their team from within a Yammer group," wrote the Yammer group in a blog post. "Additionally, users can easily browse their SharePoint and OneDrive libraries to share files and start discussions with their teams on Yammer." The authoring experience is provided by Office Online, the web-based version of Microsoft's venerable productivity applications, which has featured real-time co-authoring since 2013. Now users can create new Office documents directly from the Yammer UI, obviating the need to leave the app to start work on a new file. Yammer group members can also view the version history of a file and mark important files.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Node.js Is Helping Developers Get the Most Out of JavaScript Microsoft Surface Devices Challenge Apple in Enterprise Strongholds Apple's New MacBook Pros Leave Analysts Wanting More Microsoft Releases Skype for Business Mac Client Microsoft Blasts Google for Early Disclosure of Windows Bug Comparing Microsoft's Surface Studio ...

V Geetanath » B Rishikesh Bahadurdesai » Zahid Rafiq » TOPICS science and technology technology (general) It will be the Supreme Court's first case involving design patents in more than 120 years, when the products at issue were carpets and rugs. After five years of litigation, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on Tuesday in the bitter patent dispute between the world's two top smartphone manufacturers over the amount Samsung should pay Apple for copying the iPhone's distinctive look. The justices' ruling, due by the end of June, could have a long-term impact for designers and product manufacturers going forward because the Supreme Court, if it agrees with Samsung, could limit the penalties for swiping a patented design. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd paid Apple Inc $548.2 million last December, fulfilling part of its liability stemming from a 2012 verdict for infringing Apple's iPhone patents and copying its look. But Samsung will argue before the Supreme Court that it should not have had to make as much as $399 million of that payout for infringement of three patented designs on the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, its bezel and the colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications.Design patents It will be the Supreme Court's first case involving design patents in more than 120 years, when the products at issue were carpets and rugs. Cupertino, California-based Apple sued its South Korean rival in 2011, claiming Samsung stole its technology and the iPhone's trademarked appearance. Samsung has said it should not have had to fork over all of its profits on phones that infringed the patents, which contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features. Apple has said Samsung was properly penalized for ripping off its work. With many years of fighting behind these fierce rivals, this case has become mostly about money, said Michael Risch, a professor at Villanova University Charles Widger School of Law. “The infringement has been affirmed, now it's whether this huge judgment should be affirmed,” Keywords: Apple, Samsung, patent rights, patent feud More In: Industry | Business | Gadgets | Technology | Sci-Tech | Newsletter Tweet Please Wait while comments are loading...

On its own, that number might not be very impressive, but when you consider that iOS 10 has only been available for about a month, Apple’s 54% statistic carries a little more weight. In a graph that shows the breakdown of install bases for iOS releases, we see that 38% of folks are still on iOS 9, while the remaining 8% are running earlier, unspecified versions of the mobile operating system. Those who remain on iOS 9 are likely a combination of hold outs – people who haven’t upgraded yet despite the fact that their phone is compatible with iOS 10 – and people who are using a device older than the iPhone 5. The oldest Apple device compatible with iOS 10 is iPhone 5, which means that iPhone 4s users are stuck on iOS 9 until they upgrade to a newer device. It’s possible that some of those iPhone 4s users have every intention of jumping to a newer phone, but can’t at the moment, since many iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models have experienced some degree of post-launch stock shortages. Apple gathers these statistics by monitoring visits to the App Store, so these are likely a fair bit more accurate than a lot of the third-party estimates we’ll come across. It should also be noted that while 54% adoption in a month’s time is nothing to sneeze at, iOS 9 managed to hit the 50% mark in a little less than a week, so iOS 10 falls short of the top prize as far as adoption rates are concerned.

Home Industry Companies Apple Questioned by Supreme Court on Size of Samsung Award Apple Questioned by Supreme Court on Size of Samsung Award U.S. Supreme Court justices questioned whether Apple Inc. should be allowed to keep all of a $399 million patent award it won in a suit that accused rival Samsung Electronics Co. of copying the design of the iPhone. By: Bloomberg | Published: October 12, 2016 12:05 AM A federal appeals court said Apple could collect Samsung’s entire profit from 11 phones found to have infringed Apple’s patents. (Reuters) U.S. Supreme Court justices questioned whether Apple Inc. should be allowed to keep all of a $399 million patent award it won in a suit that accused rival Samsung Electronics Co. of copying the design of the iPhone. Listening to arguments Tuesday in Washington, the justices suggested they may return the case to a lower court for more hearings. But several of them said they weren’t sure how a jury or judge should decide how much Apple should collect. A federal appeals court said Apple could collect Samsung’s entire profit from 11 phones found to have infringed Apple’s patents. The issue before the justices Tuesday was whether the owners of design patents are entitled to the entire profit from a product. Instead, Apple, Samsung and the U.S. government agreed the patent award should be based on an “article of manufacture,” which could mean just a component of a product. The hard part, the justices said, was how to determine what that means and how to explain it to a jury. “I simply wouldn’t know what to do,” when it came to instructing jurors, Justice Anthony Kennedy said. Ornamental Look Design patents cover the ornamental look of an object rather than any functional aspect. The court hasn’t considered design patents since disputes involving spoon handles in the 1870s and carpets in the 1890s. Those cases, or ones involving the design for a wallpaper, for instance, are easier to analyze, Justice Stephen Breyer said. The question is how to handle a product that has multiple components like the modern smartphone. Apple introduced the iPhone 2007, revolutionizing an industry that before than had received limited interest from consumers. Apple lawyer Seth Waxman said that Samsung, undergoing a “crisis of design,” simply copied the look of the iPhone to avoid a loss of market share. Samsung lawyer Kathleen Sullivan said the entire profit wasn’t attributable just to the looks of the phone, since consumers expect more from their smartphones. It “cannot by definition cover the innards of a phone,” she said. This was the first of two cases that Apple won at trial. Samsung sent Apple $548 million in December 2015, though it hopes to get as much as $399 million of that back if it wins the Supreme Court case, and the rest if it’s successful in invalidating other Apple patents through a process at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In a second case, Apple won $119.6 million over three patents, including the slide-to-unlock feature and technology to detect phone numbers in messages. The appeals court on Fridayreinstated that verdict, which had been thrown out by a three-judge appeals court panel in February. Please Wait while comments are loading...

The hearing – which is the culmination of a five-year legal showdown between two of the world’s most powerful technology rivals – coincided with news that Samsung has had to abandon production of its new flagship Note 7 smartphone due to a safety crisis. Meeting in the low-tech splendour of the highest court in the US, the eight justices seemed to prioritise protecting the design value of Apple’s iPhone, though the test case could have profound implications for intellectual property battles across the technology industry. Galaxy Note 7: what to do with Samsung's potentially exploding phone Read more Samsung concedes the findings of the lower court that it copied the iPhone’s curvaceous case design and colourful graphical user interface for earlier models. But it argues that damages should be calculated as a relevant proportion of lost Apple profits, rather than the total $399m first awarded against it. “A smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of technologies that make it work,” Samsung’s lawyer Kathleen Sullivan told the court. The Korean giant argues only the profitability of the part in question should be assessed for damages. Though the final ruling will not be known for months, the oral argument stage of the case made clear much of the bench was suspicious of the theory on the grounds that it would be almost impossible to ever determine. “The problem is how to instruct the jury,” said Justice Anthony Kennedy. “If I was a juror, I wouldn’t know what to do.” Instead, he suggested that courts apply common sense by throwing out vexatious claims over small items of infringement – such as a lawsuit against a car maker for all its profits in a case of identical cupholders – but allow companies like Apple to argue that exterior design can be a critical factor in its profitability. “The phone could be seen by the consumer as just a rounded-edge outer shell,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor seemed to agree. “That might be what drives the sale.” The ensuing discussion ranged from the original 19th-century statute used to determine the design of stoves and furnaces, to comparisons with other design icons where form was seen as just as valuable as function, such as the Volkswagen Beetle. Justice Stephen Breyer described the issue of separating out the value of design from overall profitability as a matter “of great importance across industries” and warned that Samsung’s approach could lead to “absurd results”. It was an hour of arcane discussion in court. The justices acknowledged the case was often confusing and could yet go either way, but the questioning of Samsung was noticeably more hostile than that of Apple. The secret smartphone war over the struggle for control of the user Read more “You seem to be arguing as a matter of law that you are right,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor told Sullivan at one point. “I don’t see that as a matter of law.” Brian Fletcher, a lawyer appearing for the US government, took neither side and argued for a standardised test to decide future such cases. But he leaned in favour of the arguments made by Apple’s lawyer Seth Waxman that appearance was a vital factor in the company’s success. “We know from Samsung’s own documents they realised they faced a crisis of design,” said Fletcher. Even Samsung does not dispute the principle, but argues that it should be down to the plaintiff to prove damages. “It should be open to the patent holder to prove that the bulk of the profits come from the exterior,” said Sullivan. In a statement, Apple said: “We firmly believe that strong design patent protection spurs creativity and innovation, ... And that’s why we’ve defended ourselves against those who steal our ideas. Eleven times now, Samsung has been found guilty of intentionally and blatantly copying the iPhone. Every court at every level has agreed. We think that’s wrong and that it poses chilling risks to the future of design innovation.” More news Topics Samsung Apple Intellectual property US supreme court Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

WIBBITZ The Supreme Court may strike down Apple's $548 million design patent infringement award against Samsung. (Photo: KAREN BLEIER, AFP/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court appeared likely to rule that Samsung should not have to forfeit the entire profits from smartphones that violated Apple's design patents because the infringement affected only their appearance, not their capabilities. In an hour-long oral argument Tuesday that conjured up examples ranging from wallpaper to Volkswagen Beetles, a majority of justices seemed to buy Samsung's argument that lower courts improperly allowed more expansive — and expensive — interpretations of patent law. The court typically issues decisions three to four months after hearing arguments. "Nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks," Justice Samuel Alito said. Chief Justice John Roberts said Apple's iconic iPhone design applies to the exterior face of the phone — not "all the chips and wires." But several justices said it would be difficult if not impossible for juries to determine the size of a patent infringement award when one part of a product's design is infringed upon. And several said a distinctive design can represent a large percentage of the profit, an indication that Samsung may not be off the hook if the case is returned to a lower court for resolution. In this Sept. 9, 2015, photo, Apple CEO Tim Cook introduces the iPhone 6S during an Apple media event in San Francisco.  (Photo: Josh Edelson, AFP/Getty Images) The legal battle between the two technology giants represents the first design patent case to reach the Supreme Court in more than a century. The dollars at stake are huge: Samsung initially was ordered to pay nearly $1 billion before the penalty was reduced to $548 million. If it wins, it could recoup as much as $399 million more. ​A jury in 2012 ruled that Samsung infringed on three of Apple's iPhone design patents (covering smartphones with a rectangular shape, curved corners and 16 colorful circles on a black screen), based on their look and not function. That was an improper award,  Samsung's lawyer, Kathleen Sullivan, told the justices. "A smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work," she said. Then the discussion devolved into a debate about products whose sales and profits might be based almost totally on design, rather than function. A car's cup holder wouldn't apply to the overall value of the car, they reasoned — but if your wallpaper is copied, "you get the whole thing," Justice Stephen Breyer said. The acrimonious battle between the world's two most successful smartphone makers, which began in April 2011, could redefine a 130-year-old design patent law and upend the tech industry, legal experts say. It's being watched closely by others, many of whom have a stake in the outcome as they compete with Apple for smartphone sales. Facebook, Google, Dell and Lenovo are among those backing Samsung; Apple has the support of more than 100 designers from companies such as Nike and Calvin Klein. Last week, Google announced Pixel, a new smartphone line, aimed squarely at Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy lines. The stakes couldn't be higher for Samsung, which on Tuesday announced the termination of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after recurring instances of it overheating, even catching fire, when its battery is charged. USA TODAY Samsung kills off Galaxy Note 7 over safety fears The 1887 patent law on which the case is based referred to holders of design patents for such items as carpets, wallpapers and oil cloths. If the high court were to rule that a smartphone's design is similarly all-inclusive, it could result in "a race to the courthouse to see who can obtain the first outsized award," Samsung argued in court papers. Apple's lawyer, Seth Waxman, argued that the design patent refers to "the thing to which the design is applied" — in this case, the entire smartphone. "Design is not a component," he said. His argument won at least some support from Justice Elena Kagan, who said a Volkswagen Beetle's design is an example of "the thing that makes the product distinctive," though she acknowledged that "the car has to run, and it has to do all the other things that cars do." Mark McKenna, a law professor at University of Notre Dame Law School, argues a modern-day design patent covers the incremental value of a product so “it’s crazy to say its entire value is due to design.” Mark Davies, the attorney who filed the amicus brief for industrial designers in the case and attended Tuesday’s hearing, cautioned it’s hard to predict the court’s decision based on justices’ questions during oral arguments. But he suggested the court might recommend a multi-factor test in determining the value of design patents. 94 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2e4jb7t

AMS�s founder, attorney and digital marketing expert, John Possumato, said dealers are just beginning to explore the marketing possibilities of mobile wallet technology, which is built into every new iPhone and Android smartphone. �Proximity marketing techniques, such as geo-fencing and using strategically placed beacons, provide the ultimate leverage for acquiring low cost, dealer generated low-in-the-funnel sales leads,� Possumato said. �Long term, relationship building development is nice, but being able to �Reach Out, When they are Ready to Buy!� (the title of our workshop), is critical to actually making the sale, in vehicles sales or service operations� Possumato continues, �Retail is a cutthroat competition these days, and dealers need a new way to cost-effectively gain leverage in the consumer�s �back pocket� with time-sensitive, location-based offers. Flash sales for both variable and fixed operations are now possible through geo-fencing and beacons through mobile wallet and customized apps, and in ways that have never been available before this technology emerged on the scene.� Possumato added that a number of major retailers, including Starbucks, Best Buy and Macy�s, are using mobile wallet to connect with customers and keep them coming back. He plans to discuss the technology in �Reach Out When They Are Ready to Buy!� at 1:30 on Tuesday, Oct 18, at the Digital Dealer Workshops, at the Crowne Plaza in Cherry Hill, NJ.

A highly respected brand, Apple smartphones can still fetch a decent price even if it’s been a couple of years since that particular model was released. If you’re the owner of an iPhone who is considering getting an upgrade, you’re probably thinking about selling your old handset on so that you can make some money from it – perhaps to put towards, or even cover the cost of, your new smartphone. We’ve put together some top tips to help you get the best price possible. Phone Unlocking Most iPhones will lock to the first network that they are used on, so if you’ve never used your handset with any other networks than the one that you bought it from, chances are you won’t be able to use it on any others. Although this may not have affected you so far, when it comes to selling your iPhone, the fact that it’s locked to one network alone will narrow down your list of potential buyers and could even put people off from purchasing it or making an offer. Getting your iPhone unlocked by a professional unlock iPhone service such as Unlock Base is a great way to get more money for it. Physical Condition If you have had your iPhone for quite a while and used it every day, you’ll probably notice that it has a couple of scratches and scuffs. Even if you’ve made sure to keep your phone in excellent condition and had it in a case and with a screen protector on since you purchased it, it’s important to make sure that you look for any marks or blemishes which could potentially put buyers off. When it comes to noticeable damage, such as large scratches or screen cracks, it can often work out more cost-effective to pay to have the handset fixed before putting it up for sale, as you’ll get much more money for a handset which is in perfect condition. Clearing Your Phone Last but not least, it’s crucial that you remember to fully factory reset your iPhone before you sell it on to somebody else. This includes removing all details of your Apple ID from the phone, effectively requiring it to be set up as a brand new iPhone all over again. Accidentally leaving your Apple ID connected with your iPhone in any way could mean that your buyer has problems setting it up, and the handset could end up getting blocked, causing problems for both buyer and seller. To fully reset your iPhone, go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. Don’t forget to remove your handset from Find My iPhone if needed. iPhones are great in that you can still get a decent price for them when selling second hand, even if it’s not the latest model.

Samsung: SCOTUS to hear mother of all tech patent case by AirTalk A Samsung and Apple smartphone are displayed on August 6, 2014 in London, England. Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images Listen to this story 14 min 58 sec Share Share via Emailemail Share on Twitter Share on Facebook The country’s high court hears arguably the biggest tech patent case in modern history today, involving two of the biggest names in consumer technology. The “Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple” case stems from a long-running lawsuit between the two tech giants in which Apple sued Samsung for copying the design of the iPhone. That case had already been decided, and Samsung was found guilty for infringing on Apple’s intellectual property. What the Supreme Court is going to determine is the monetary punishment of such a violation -- how much should Samsung pay for plagiarizing the design of a tech product. If the Supreme Court sides with Apple, then it gets to keep the $400 million it has collected on the judgement. The case deals with a very specific piece of intellectual property law that applies to the design -- the artistic rendition and conception -- of a tech product, and has far-reaching ramifications for the tech world.

V Geetanath » B Rishikesh Bahadurdesai » Zahid Rafiq » TOPICS science and technology technology (general) It will be the Supreme Court's first case involving design patents in more than 120 years, when the products at issue were carpets and rugs. After five years of litigation, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on Tuesday in the bitter patent dispute between the world's two top smartphone manufacturers over the amount Samsung should pay Apple for copying the iPhone's distinctive look. The justices' ruling, due by the end of June, could have a long-term impact for designers and product manufacturers going forward because the Supreme Court, if it agrees with Samsung, could limit the penalties for swiping a patented design. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd paid Apple Inc $548.2 million last December, fulfilling part of its liability stemming from a 2012 verdict for infringing Apple's iPhone patents and copying its look. But Samsung will argue before the Supreme Court that it should not have had to make as much as $399 million of that payout for infringement of three patented designs on the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, its bezel and the colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications.Design patents It will be the Supreme Court's first case involving design patents in more than 120 years, when the products at issue were carpets and rugs. Cupertino, California-based Apple sued its South Korean rival in 2011, claiming Samsung stole its technology and the iPhone's trademarked appearance. Samsung has said it should not have had to fork over all of its profits on phones that infringed the patents, which contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features. Apple has said Samsung was properly penalized for ripping off its work. With many years of fighting behind these fierce rivals, this case has become mostly about money, said Michael Risch, a professor at Villanova University Charles Widger School of Law. “The infringement has been affirmed, now it's whether this huge judgment should be affirmed,” Keywords: Apple, Samsung, patent rights, patent feud More In: Industry | Business | Gadgets | Technology | Sci-Tech | Newsletter Tweet Please Wait while comments are loading...

Instead, it was a series of expensive lawsuits that spanned nearly 30 years and involved some of the biggest names in entertainment and technology: namely, the Beatles and Steve Jobs. The story goes that George Harrison was the one who first heard of Apple Computer, just after the company was founded in 1977. He alerted the staff of Apple Corps, the company the four Beatles had created in 1968 as a boutique/movie studio/electronics tinkerer/tax shelter that also served as a record label. That last division of Apple was the only one that really survived, mostly through releasing (and re-releasing) continually popular Beatles music. In 1978, Apple Corps sued Apple Computer for violating its trademark. The two reached a settlement in ’81, agreeing that they could co-exist by functioning in separate spheres. Corps would stick to entertainment while Computer would stick to, well, computers. Jobs’ technology company also paid $80,000 for the rights to keep the Apple name. But that wouldn’t be the last time the two Apples would try to take a bite out of each other. As the ’80s continued, computers became more complicated, increasing the range of tasks a typical Apple machine could achieve. Multiple products in Apple’s Macintosh line were engineered for music creation and playback, something the folks at Apple Corps thought violated the two corporations’ 1981 settlement. Not long after Apple Computer announced the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI), which allowed computers to interact with musical instruments, the Beatles’ record label sued again. Apple Computer “agreed that they would not use or register their marks for any equipment which had been … ‘specifically adapted for use in the recording or reproduction of music,’” Beatles attorney Nicholas Valner told the Los Angeles Times in 1991, after the trial had already dragged on for more than nine months. “In other words, if they made a computer that could do that, they couldn’t call it an Apple. They’d have to call it an Orange or something like that.” Christopher Escher, a spokesman for the technology company, meanwhile suggested that the computers were capable of all sorts of functions and that music was a tiny slice of that pie. Apple computers are “general purpose productivity tools,” he explained. They can do “lots of different things. They’re computers with sound capabilities.” The litigation halted production on multiple products for Apple Computer, which feared a loss in this lawsuit would stop it from ever releasing another machine capable of doing anything music-related. Many employees were bitter about the courtroom fight. It is not a coincidence that an alert sound in the Macintosh’s 1991 operating system was titled Sosumi (“so sue me”). Finally landing somewhere between bitterness and business, the two Apples were able to come to an agreement, resulting in another settlement that was reached on Oct. 9, 1991. Computer agreed to pay Corps $26.5 million in damages, along with legal costs. The settlement further delineated the separate worlds the two companies could occupy. Apple Corps held the rights to “creative works whose principal content is music” while Apple Computer was now allowed to build and market products that would “reproduce, run, play or otherwise deliver such content.” Basically, Corps agreed that Computer could play music on their products. However, the computer manufacturer was prohibited from using its trademark “in connection with physical media delivering pre-recorded content … (such as a compact disc of Rolling Stones music).” Yes, the Stones. Even in their own settlement, the Beatles didn’t want to be associated with the computer company. Of course, the iTunes music store was 12 years away. Apple Corps and Apple Computer would meet one more time in a court of law. Computer won that case in 2006, and the two companies reached yet another settlement in 2007. A few years later, after decades of legal clashes, the Beatles’ music would finally debut on iTunes. How about them apples?

A Smartphone Battle In The Highest Court By Nina Totenberg & An-Li Herring • Oct 11, 2016 TweetShareGoogle+Email Samsung and Apple, two smartphone giants, have been battling each other — not just in the marketplace, but in the courts — since 2011. Peter Macdiarmid / Getty Images Originally published on October 11, 2016 4:58 am In oral arguments on Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court enters the smartphone wars. The case, which pits Samsung against Apple, could have major repercussions for tech products across the board. The two smartphone giants have been battling each other — not just in the marketplace but also in the courts — since 2011, a year after Samsung unveiled a new set of smartphones, including the Galaxy. Like iPhones, the Samsung products, for the first time, had rounded corners and square icons on a touchscreen. Apple alleged, in part, that its South Korean rival had infringed three design patents for discrete components of the iPhone — the front face of the device, the rounded edges framing the face, and the device's distinctive matrix of colorful square icons. In 2012, a jury ruled in Apple's favor and Samsung was ordered to pay $399 million in damages — all the profits it had made on 11 infringing phone models. Samsung appealed, arguing that it should not have to fork over its total profits; rather, it should only be liable for the specific design elements it infringed. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent law, rejected that argument, agreeing with Apple that Samsung had to cough up all of its profits on an infringed "article of manufacture." "The game then becomes, what's the article of manufacture?" says Daryl Joseffer, who formerly served as principal deputy U.S. solicitor general. "Is it the cover of the phone which is the design? Or is it the entire phone?" Apple contends it's the entire phone and claims that Samsung infringed patents that cover the "iconic look and feel" of the iPhone. When the iPhone first entered the market in 2007, its "innovative" design distinguished it from competitors, Apple says. The iPhone maker also argues that a smartphone's design and its underlying technology form a single, unitary product. Samsung counters that design features account for a small portion of a smartphone's value. The more important factors, Samsung says, are "functional, non-design features," such as larger screens, GPS navigation and app availability. The company points to market research, conducted by its rival, that shows that no more than five percent of consumers gave "design in general" as the reason they purchased a particular smartphone. It adds that more than 200,000 patents make up a single smartphone. "It's hard to come up with an argument that passes the straight-face test that says the only value of the iPhone is that it's a rectangle with rounded corners," says Mark Lemley, author of a brief supporting Samsung filed by 50 intellectual property professors. Apple points out, however, that Samsung's share of the smartphone market quadrupled from five to 20 percent during the two years following the release of its first infringing phone. Samsung's lawyers declined to discuss the case on the record. But the company warns that a victory for Apple will unleash a torrent of litigation, as design patent holders seek outsized awards for infringement of elementary design components. Leading tech companies, including Google, Dell and Facebook, echo that concern. In a brief supporting Samsung, they claim a win for Apple would have "a devastating impact" on investment in complex technological products. Apple counters that extra design protections encourage investment in innovation. The company's chief litigation officer, Noreen Krall, notes that, unlike Samsung, Apple spent billions of dollars on developing its smartphone at a time when the project was viewed with great skepticism. "What we're fighting for, here, is innovation and restoring the integrity of the design process," Krall says. Apple's supporters, including retail designers like Tiffany & Company and Adidas, argue that strong design protections deter design piracy at a time when technology makes it easier to produce knockoff goods. In a separate brief, more than 100 industrial design experts add that consumers are often misled by complex technological products that look the same but are not. The case has a variety of complications, including challenges to the original jury instructions and other legal tangles. Indeed, the Federal Circuit, in siding with Apple, said it was doing so because of the express command of the patent statute, even if that "makes no sense in the modern world." Given all these twists and turns, the Supreme Court, which hasn't heard a design patent case in more than 120 years, could dodge the dicey design dilemma and send the case back to the lower courts for further consideration. Or it could tackle the design question head-on. A decision is expected later in the term. Copyright 2016 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.

The Sonos Listening Lab at West Elm in New York City [Photos: Landon Vonderschmidt, courtesy of West Elm] John Paul Titlow 10.11.16 1:00 PM Walking into the Rough Trade record shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, you might not even notice the store’s newest addition. Just above the entrance of the 1,500-square-foot music emporium is something that, at first glance, wouldn’t seem unusual in a record store: a listening room. But more than just a walled-off sanctuary for listening to music in a record shop, the room is part of a multifaceted new strategy by its creators, designed to expose more consumers to a new way of listening to music. Sonos, the wireless home audio company, worked with Rough Trade to set up the room and outfit it with company’s high-fidelity speakers and components. As you might guess, these same products are now available for sale downstairs at Rough Trade, alongside turntables and other audio hardware. But for Sonos, which is in the process of expanding its retail efforts with partnerships like this one, these boxed-up products would be nearly useless without the listening room. Related: How West Elm Became An Unlikely Incubator Of Independent Design Sonos Designed Its New Store To Feel—And Sound—Like Your Home WeWork Brings A New Business Model To Detroit "The best way for somebody to learn about Sonos is to experience it firsthand," says Joy Howard, Sonos’s chief marketing officer. That’s because, as enthusiastic as many Sonos customers may be, the geeked-out ramblings of a fanboy or -gal just can’t do descriptive justice to what Sonos is: an extensible, multi-room (if you so desire) system of speakers that piggyback off your home or office’s Wi-Fi connection to deliver music—from just about any streaming service or your own collection—in remarkably fine detail and superior audio quality. See? Even that last sentence, as thorough and marvelously eloquent as it may have been, doesn’t quite get it across. You just need to hear Sonos. You need to play around with it. So instead of just dropping a few boxes of speakers on a shelf at one of Brooklyn’s most beloved record shops and calling it a day, the company decided to build a hands-on listening experience inside the store. They’ve been doing this sort of thing a lot lately. In July, Sonos opened its first store in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, a unique retail space that’s centered around seven hiply designed and acoustically perfected listening rooms. But after cutting the ribbon on its flagship store (with the help of noise-rock pioneer and extremely tall dude Thurston Moore from Sonic Youth), Sonos wasted no time extending its retail strategy through new partnerships designed to get its products in front of as many people as possible. In just the last few weeks, Sonos has teamed up with Rough Trade, Airbnb, West Elm, and Apple. And from the sound of it, they’re just getting started with these types of deals. Go behind the scenes of Sonos's brand-new experiential retail store in NYC with CMO Joy Howard at the Fast Company Innovation Festival, Nov. 1-4. In early October, Sonos speakers will go on sale at 468 Apple retail stores, many of which will have an in-store demo of the wireless speaker system paired with Apple Music (a wise maneuver for Apple as it tries to grow its music subscriber base to compete with Spotify). And while the Apple retail partnership won’t be as immersive or acoustically fine-tuned as Sonos’s own listening rooms, it’s still clearly, as Howard puts it, "a huge moment for us." As busy as the SoHo store can get on a Saturday afternoon, it’s just one store. To keep growing—and stave off an increasingly lengthy list of competitors—Sonos needs to spread its experiential tentacles as far and as wide as possible. Historically, Howard says, the best way to learn about Sonos was by experiencing it in action at a friend's house. As lovely as that may sound, it's not the most scalable sales strategy. So as its retail efforts grow, the company is deliberately trying to inject a more home-like feel where ever it can. This was a central principle behind the company's Soho store, and like those listening rooms, the one in Rough Trade is designed like a living room. The Rough Trade installation even includes a separate sleeping area for whoever wins a recently announced contest that will let winners rent out the entire record store on Airbnb. The Sonos Listening Room at Rough Trade in Brooklyn, New York To further tighten its emphasis on at-home listening, Sonos recently teamed up with West Elm to bring its products and carefully crafted experience into the home retailer’s stores. "We’ve recognized opportunities to harness the power of design and human connection to create rich and relevant experiences for customers," says Jim Brett, West Elm’s president. "We’ve become sensitive to what comforts them." West Elm has traditionally focused heavily on aesthetic details like color, fragrance, lighting, and texture, thoughtfully outfitting each store with its own localized, unique vibe. Since 2013, the company has partnered with local makers to source millions of dollars in handmade goods that help further this mission. The company even offers services like design consultation and hands-on, in-home help with setting up products and getting every detail just right. Now, West Elm is adding a new design detail to its Swiss army knife of expertise: Sound. "We’ve been thinking about how people use sound to lift their mood, be more productive, or go to sleep," says Brett. Starting with its Broadway location in Manhattan, West Elm stores will be getting their own unique listening environments. The Sonos Listening Lab at West Elm in New York City "We can sell this product in a very different way than others can," says Brett. "It’s not going to be a Sonos speaker on a shelf next to a Sony speaker. This is about the way that we see ourselves being involved in people’s lives. We’re taking quite seriously the role of sound and music." To that end, West Elm will not only integrate Sonos sound systems into its stores, but will also train its staff on the role that sound and acoustics play in the design of people’s personal spaces. To Sonos, West Elm felt like a natural retail partner because of its holistic and immersive focus on design and experiential approach to selling products. West Elm’s customers are exactly the type of people whose attention Sonos is dying to grab. And the context of a West Elm store could hardly be a more perfect place to do it. "We want to get to get in front of people when they’re in the mindset of thinking about how they can transform their homes," says Howard. "That’s why you go to a place like West Elm. You’re deliberately in that mindset. It’s such an ideal moment for us to open up a conversation with people and ask, Have you thought about how your home sounds?" To many customers, the mere concept of having high-fidelity, multi-room sound throughout their homes may be a foreign, even potentially unattainable concept. That’s another reason Sonos is trying to get its unique sonic experience set up in as many physical spaces as possible: To educate consumers. The Sonos Listening Lab at West Elm in New York City "I don’t think people are even aware that they can have a home sound system like this," Howard says. "I think it’s not even in the realm of people’s everyday thinking. It seems like such an expensive, complicated thing to have." Having more of a presence inside big-name retail outlets not only helps clue new customers in to the simplicity and audio fidelity of Sonos speakers, but it may also help existing customers see (and hear) new possibilities. A large number of people who own Sonos products only have one speaker, according to Howard. Many are unaware, for instance, that two Play:1 speakers can be linked together to make a stereo pair or that a new Play:5 could easily be used to extend an existing Sonos audio experience from the living room to the kitchen. Sonos' partnership with Airbnb further advances the at-home approach by offering discounted sound systems to new Airbnb hosts. If the program works as intended, it stands to expose a whole new set of consumers to the experience of using Sonos in a very home-like environment. Like its own listening rooms and the West Elm installations, the idea here is to cut right to the chase, skip the wordy explanations, and just let people use and hear these speakers for themselves. Will it work? That remains to be seen, of course, but it's clear that Sonos isn't content with a singularly focused retail strategy. Instead, it's planting as many seeds as possible to see what works. As the company grows up and its competition proliferates, it can't hurt to try. related video: Flirting with sound design: crafting the sounds of Tinder Never miss a story.

South Korean tech giant Samsung has permanently ceased production of its high-end Galaxy Note 7 smartphones after reports of devices it had deemed safe catching fire.

X US Supreme Court grapples with Apple-Samsung copyright feud Court indicates it could reduce huge penalties for ripping off a patented design Tue, Oct 11, 2016, 18:18 Samsung is challenging to the $399 million it was forced to pay Apple for violating three patents regarding the iPhone’s rounded-corner front face, bezel and colourful grid of icons. Photograph: Getty Images         The US Supreme Court on Tuesday signalled a willingness to reduce the potentially huge penalties imposed for ripping off a patented design as it heard arguments in the legal fight over the amount Samsung should pay Apple for copying the iPhone’s distinctive appearance. The eight justices heard arguments by lawyers for the world’s two top smartphone manufacturers, as well as the US government, in Samsung’s challenge to the $399 million it was forced to pay Apple for violating three patents regarding the iPhone’s rounded-corner front face, bezel and colourful grid of icons. Some of the justices expressed deep scepticism over how, in practice, juries could figure out which part of a product a design applies to, in order to calculate damages for patent infringement. “If I were a juror, I wouldn’t know what to do,” Justice Anthony Kennedy said. A ruling is due by the end of June. Bitter rivals Smartphones such as Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy have become an indispensable part of everyday life for many people worldwide, as well as huge business for their makers. As such, the two companies have become increasingly bitter rivals as Samsung seizes an enviable share of the market. The case came before the Supreme Court on same day Samsung scrapped its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone following reports of the phones catching fire in one of the costliest product safety failures in tech history. The device, launched in August, was supposed to have competed with Apple’s latest iPhone for supremacy in the smartphone market. Several justices struggled with how they would devise a test for lower courts and juries to use to figure out design patent damages. Using the example of a Volkswagen Beetle automobile, with its unique shape, Justice Elena Kagan suggested it might be difficult for a jury to decide how much damages to award based on the shape, when that trait might be the primary factor driving consumers to buy it. ADVERTISEMENT Samsung paid Apple $548.2 million last December, fulfilling part of its liability stemming from a 2012 verdict for infringing Apple’s iPhone patents and copying its appearance in making the Galaxy and other devices. Samsung has contended it should not have had to turn over all its profits on phones that infringed the iPhone design patents, which the company said contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features. Samsung argues that it should not have had to pay as much as $399 million of that $548.2 million payout for infringement of the three patented designs at issue. Apple has said Samsung was properly penalised for pilfering its work. Curtail damages Apple sued Samsung in 2011, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone’s trademarked appearance. The ruling by the justices could have a lasting impact on designers and product manufacturers if they decide to curtail damages for swiping a patented design. Design patent fights only very rarely reach the Supreme Court, which had not heard such a case in more than 120 years, when the products involved were considerably less high-tech: carpets and a spoon handle. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington last year upheld the 2012 patent infringement verdict for Apple. The court, however, said the iPhone’s appearance could not be protected through trademarks.

Home Industry Tech Apple watch banned from UK Cabinet meetings over hacking fears Apple watch banned from UK Cabinet meetings over hacking fears Britain's ministers have been reportedly banned from wearing Apple watches to Cabinet meetings over fears of Russian hackers. By: PTI | London | Published: October 11, 2016 11:00 PM The smart watches are the new items to be included in the list of banned possessions. (Reuters) Britain’s ministers have been reportedly banned from wearing Apple watches to Cabinet meetings over fears of Russian hackers. The smart watches are the new items to be included in the list of banned possessions. Mobile phones were already barred from the Cabinet under former British Prime Minister David Cameron owing to similar concerns. Soon after Cameron entered Downing Street in 2010, mobile phones were banned in the Cabinet and under his successor, Theresa May, smart watches have joined the items to be left outside the meeting room. “The Russians are trying to hack everything,” a source was quoted as saying to ‘The Daily Telegraph’. It is understood that similar protocols are in place in Australia. Fears of potential hacking have intensified in the West since the US government accused Russia last week of hacking into the Democratic Party’s computer networks in an effort to influence the outcome of the presidential election. Russian hackers have also obtained the medical files of some of the world’s most famous athletes. Please Wait while comments are loading...

The latest build is available as an over-the-air update via the Mac App Store and the Software Update mechanism on Macs that run a prior beta of macOS Sierra 10.12.1. macOS 10.12.1 beta 4 arrived eight days following macOS 10.12.1 beta 3, which released for beta testing on October 3. It focuses on bug fixes and performance improvements and does not include any new outward-facing user features. When it releases for public consumption, macOS Sierra 10.12.1 will bring support for Portrait albums in the Photos app. The new built-in album was created to hold photos taken using the iPhone 7 Plus’s depth of field photography mode. If you have a developer account with Apple, you can also grab macOS Sierra 10.12.1 beta 4 from Apple Developer Center.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Oct 11, 2016 at 11:18AM As one of the most successful companies in history, if not the most successful, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has lifted the fortunes of many of its suppliers over the years.That's why investing in Apple's suppliers has been a successful strategy. However, given the iPhone maker's tendency to squeeze its vendors, succeeding in this strategy requires a detailed analysis of the companies that help create the innards for the Mac maker's products. Here are a few of the best-positioned Apple suppliers today. Company Name Market Capitalization Broadcom Limited (NASDAQ:AVGO) $69.2 billion Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) $152.6 billion Data source: Yahoo! Finance. This data provides only a superficial snapshot of these Apple suppliers, so let's investigate the investment thesis driving each of these names today. Image source: Broadcom. Broadcom: Apple's diversified chip vendor It's hard to look at the newly combined Broadcom and not love what you see. Today's company is the result of last year's megamerger between semiconductor giants Broadcom and Avago. An active pick in at least one of the Fool's premium services, the new, post-merger Broadcom has emerged stronger and better positioned to thrive in our increasingly mobile and connected world. Apple contributes over 10% of Broadcom's sales -- before the merger, 14% of Broadcom's and 10% of Avago's sales came from Apple. But Broadcom is by no means reliant on its Apple vendor business to drive its financial results. Its diversified chipset lineup includes radio frequency, wireless combo chips, broadband, and storage and networking chips, each catering to long-term secular growth markets in tech. That's why analysts expect Broadcom's sales to increase 91% this year and 22.8% next year. (The number is especially big this year because of the merger.) From a longer-term view, the company is expected to grow its EPS at an average annual rate of 14.5% over the next five years, making it one of the most appealing Apple suppliers to own for the near future. Image source: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. Taiwan Semiconductor: the A10's sole chip supplier It's been a great time to be a Taiwan Semiconductor shareholder. The company now serves as Apple's exclusive fabrication partner for the powerhouse A10 chip in the iPhone 7, and the chip fabrication house's shares have surged in reaction to the news. TSM data by YCharts The reaction is understandable. As my Foolish colleague Ashraf Eassa notes, not only does TSM figure to see revenue rise by virtue of winning a greater percentage of Apple's business, but it should also enjoy an additional revenue tailwind by virtue of the A10's larger silicon footprint. What's more, TSM has also reportedly won the fabrication contract for the A11 chip that will power next year's reportedly radically redesigned 10th-anniversary iPhone. These developments should give TSM a continued boost to sales, though an increased reliance on Apple deserves some caution as well. However, although Apple wants to keep its chip foundry business out the hands of rival Samsung, it's also shown a willingness to reward its South Korean frenemy with its chip-vendor deals if it believes Samsung can produce better results than TSM. Case in point: After TSM produced the majority of A8 chips, Apple reportedly contracted with it for only an estimated 30% of its A9 chips. Reports say that Apple comprised only 8.2% of TSM's sales as of last year, so that number figures to increase dramatically as a result of winning all of Apple's A10 business. Not that TSM can rest on its laurels, especially with mention of Intel's interest in further scaling out its own third-party chip foundry services. An Apple-Intel alliance has already been mentioned as a distinct possibility in either 2018 or 2019, though they remain just rumors for now. Apple has a deserved reputation as a tough customer for its suppliers. Just ask the now-defunct GT Advanced. The billions in sales Apple can offer a potential vendor have historically come with their own costs, and anyone looking to invest in the companies within Apple's massive supply chain need to understand the risks. So while investing in Apple suppliers can be a winning strategy, as it has been for Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor, it isn't a one-size-fits-all strategy, either.

Few outward-facing changes were discovered in the first three betas, but it does include Photos support for the new iPhone 7 Plus Portrait feature introduced with iOS 10.1. New features discovered in the fourth 10.12.1 beta will be listed below. macOS Sierra is a significant update that brings features like Siri support, a new storage optimization option, cross device copy paste, auto unlocking with the Apple Watch, and more.

Been waiting a year for an updated MBP and will probably have to give up and buy a PC instead. Sad tears. I mean, just wait a couple weeks. How bad do you need one? And why does it seem like everyone here needs a new Mac every 3 years? My 2007 MBP lasted all the way until 2013. I'm now using a 2013 rMBP, everything maxed out and I don't see myself buying a new Mac until at least 2020. What else could I possibly need?

Oh, so you know exactly what it's like to be sitting here with an awesome much-loved 2008 MacBook, with its outdated and degraded screen, replacement battery barely able to hold an hour charge, refreshing the MacRumors feed because there's no way we're paying full price on an already-outdated upgrade a month before the launch of something better, and because after 8 years we really do deserve an improved machine in exchange for our frugality and patience. You know what it's like to be in this position. How badly do I need one? I can wait a few weeks. I can wait a few months if I have to. But I don't feel like I'm being pathetic in wanting a replacement. Rating: 7 Votes peterh988 5 weeks ago Any hints towards the new macs?

Been waiting a year for an updated MBP and will probably have to give up and buy a PC instead. Sad tears. Be careful what you wish for....new Mac's probably won't have Magsafe, USB 3.0 legacy support, SD card slot, or HDMI port. In other words, it might just turn out to be a slightly more powerful MacBook with extra USB-C ports and maybe the gimmick bar that won't 'just work.' My next Mac will come from the refub store because I don't want to be forced to drag dongles around just to get my new machine to work as well as my old machine. Rating: 5 Votes strukt 5 weeks ago I looked through some of the .plist files and found references to mobile GeForce GTX 10-Series GPUs with Pascal architecture. I also saw some references to Half Life 3 in there. HL3 is going to be released exclusively to macOS. Rating: 4 Votes schrodinger_cat 5 weeks ago Haven't yet made the leap to Sierra on my main machine (2013 MacBook Air). It's my production machine and I don't want to face the downtime of having to install all of my development tools again (MacPorts requires re-installation for each new major version of the OS because it has a different architecture signature). Am I missing anything useful? Have you noticed a performance improvement over El Capitan? You're not missing anything, believe me. I have top-end iMac with SSD, and Sierra so far is nothing but slowing down, freezings on sleep/wake and 3rd party software compatibility issues.

Samsung paid Apple US$548 million in damages awarded by a lower court for copying designs of the iPhone. In December, Samsung took the case to the highest court, asking it to reconsider the scope of design patents and how damages are calculated, in an effort to get up to $399 million reimbursed. In March, the court agreed to hear the case, which marks the first design patents case the highest U.S. court has taken up in 120 years. The last Supreme Court cases over design patents involved spoon handles in the 1870s and carpets in the 1890s. On Monday, the court held the first and only hearing. Samsung has claimed that it is unfair for a patent violator to hand over all profits from sales of a product using the patent design when that design made only a tiny contribution to sales. At the time of appeals to the Supreme Court, Samsung claimed that "a patented design might be the essential feature of a spoon or rug. But the same is not true of smartphones, which contain countless other features that give them remarkable functionality wholly unrelated to their design."    On Monday, Samsung said the "spirit of innovation" the U.S. was built upon is at stake. "As we stand on the steps of the highest court of the United States, we are reminded of the spirit of innovation that this country was built upon. And it is this same spirit that has inspired us to fight for a fair interpretation of a law that will promote creativity and competition in the marketplace," Kathleen Sullivan, a lawyer for Samsung, said after the hearing. "Awarding all of the profits for a single patent devalues the contributions of the hundreds of thousands of other patents in a smartphone. We are hopeful that the Supreme Court will give a sensible and fair reading to the design patent statute. That would be a win for businesses and consumers alike," she said. The case is one of the two last-remaining lawsuits between the two smartphone giants. In the other case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington last week reversed an earlier decision and reinstated a lower-court verdict that Samsung should pay Apple US$120 million for violating the iPhone patents on "quick links," "slide-to-unlock" and "auto-correct" technologies. jschang@yna.co.kr (END) Most Viewed Seoul to ban smoking at cultural asset sites (4th LD) Park apologizes over alleged sexual misconduct by ex-spokesman Ssangyong says resumption of overnight shift turning point of normalization (2nd LD) N.

Supreme Court grills Apple, Samsung over value of design patents 0 Share: Mobile by Shara Tibken October 11, 2016 11:30 AM PDT @sharatibken Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech Even the US Supreme Court justices were a little befuddled over what to do with the legal saga between Apple and Samsung. The two largest phone makers in the world squared off in the highest court in the land Tuesday over the value of design patents, marking the likely conclusion to a long-running battle that goes back to a 2012 case. One nuance of the case -- how jurors were supposed to break out the value of a design from the overall product -- was a source of most of the questions. The justices wanted to know what instructions the jury would be given when looking at damages. For more on Apple v. Samsung CNET's full Apple v. Samsung coverage Apple v. Samsung heads to Supreme Court: What you need to know Supreme Court steps into Apple v. Samsung fray "If I were the juror, I simply wouldn't know what to do," Justice Anthony Kennedy said several times during the hour-long hearing here in Washington, DC. The justices used the analogy of a Volkswagen Beetle in their questioning to understand the positions of Apple, Samsung and the Justice Department. Some justices pointed out that the VW Beetle's design is what makes that car different from all the others, but Justice Samuel Alito remarked that some people don't care what a car looks like but instead want good gas mileage or other features. A decision by the court, which is hearing its first design case since the 1800s, could have a ripple effect across the technology industry and ultimately affect the gadgets you buy. What's at question is how much money one company has to pay for copying the designs of another. Current law says an award can be collected on the entire profits of an infringing device. In this case, that's the $399 million Samsung paid Apple late last year. The Supreme Court will likely rule on this case in the first quarter. Samsung and its supporters are trying to limit the damages patent infringers have to pay. Samsung says an Apple victory would stifle innovation. Apple argues a Samsung win would weaken the protections afforded to new creations. Notably, the devices in question haven't been on the market in years. "The justices certainly seemed to be thinking about establishing a new legal standard for how Section 289 [of the Patent Act of 1952] should be applied, and asked a lot of questions dealing with details like jury instructions and the kinds of evidence that would be needed," said Steve Chang, an intellectual property law attorney at firm Banner & Witcoff. He attended the hearing Tuesday. Chang said while it was tough to tell which way all of the justices were leaning, at least one, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, seemed ready to send the case back to a lower court for further proceedings. Long-running battle The original Apple v. Samsung trial in 2012 captivated Silicon Valley and the tech industry because it exposed the inner workings of two notoriously secretive companies. It was just one of many cases around the world as the rivals sparred both in the marketplace and in the courtroom. And yes, it's still going on now. At issue in the original case were design patents for a black, rectangular, round-cornered front face; a similar rectangular round-cornered front face plus the surrounding rim, known as the bezel; and a colorful grid of 16 icons. Those icons were a particular point of contention because many of the images used by Samsung shared distinct similarities with their Apple counterpart (the phone, messages and contact icons, for instance, looked identical aside from minor superficial changes). Those three patents are being considered in the Supreme Court case. Kathleen Sullivan, Samsung's attorney who spoke before the Supreme Court, tells reporters after the hearing she's hopeful about the outcome.Photo by Shara Tibken/CNET "We firmly believe that strong design patent protection spurs creativity and innovation," Noreen Krall, Apple's chief litigation officer, said in a statement. "And that's why we've defended ourselves against those who steal our ideas. Eleven times now, Samsung has been found guilty of intentionally and blatantly copying the iPhone. Every court at every level has agreed. We think that's wrong and that it poses chilling risks to the future of design innovation." Samsung attorney Kathleen Sullivan, a partner at law firm Quinn Emanuel, told reporters after the hearing that the precedent of court decisions awarding full profits for design patent infringement "devalues all of the [other] important patents that comprise a smartphone." She noted that a typical device has 250,000 patented features necessary for making it work, and design is a part of that. Sullivan also said she's "hopeful" about the outcome of the case. "We're hopeful the Supreme Court will give a sensible and fair reading of the design patent damages statute, and we believe that will be a win for business and consumers alike," Sullivan said. Highest court in the land Sullivan kicked off Tuesday's argument by saying it makes "no sense" to give a patent holder the entire profits from a device for infringing narrow design patents. She was given 25 minutes to make Samsung's argument and answer questions, as well as four minutes at the end for a rebuttal. She didn't get more than two or three minutes into her remarks before Kennedy stopped her with the first question. What he wanted to know was how juries would figure out the value a patented design has. "I'd have the iPhone in the jury room. I'd look at it [and] I just wouldn't know." Jury awards Apple far less than it wanted in Apple v. Samsung Unlike Apple's clear victory in the first Apple v. Samsung trial over patent infringement, this time around the jury returned a mixed verdict. CNET's Kara Tsuboi and Shara Tibken explain why the case was about more than money. by Kara Tsuboi 1:42 Close Drag Sullivan said Samsung has proposed jurors consider two factors when determining what a "relevant article of manufacture" is (in other words, what the infringing part of the device actually is): What does the design patent claim and what is the product to which it has been applied? The Justice Department, meanwhile, has proposed four questions for juries to identify what a "relevant article of manufacture is." They must consider the scope of the claimed design, the extent to which that design determines the appearance of the product as a whole, whether the design is conceptually distinct from the product as a whole and the extent to which the various components can be physically separated. Seth Waxman, a partner at law firm WilmerHale who spoke for Apple at the Supreme Court hearing Tuesday, said that Samsung in previous trials never tried to show the design applied to only a part of the device, not the entire phone. "What's so easy about this case is that they never identified, to the jury, in either case, any article of manufacture other than the phone," Waxman said. And all of Samsung's "evidence was calculated based on the total profits to the phone." All that's left is to wait for the justices to deliberate.

Photo: Reuters The epic legal battle pitting Apple Inc against its bitter rival Samsung Electronics Co over the design of the iPhone was due to reach a new level yesterday when it headed to the US Supreme Court. The high court was set to hear arguments over financial damages the South Korean smartphone giant owes Apple for allegedly violating design patents by producing copycats of its groundbreaking smartphone. Observers are watching the case closely to see how the court — which has not taken up a design patent case in more than a century — tips the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. A ruling is expected in several months. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a US$400 million verdict — part of a nearly billion-dollar award in Apple’s favor later reduced to US$548 million — that found Samsung had copied the iPhone’s distinctive front screen and graphical touchscreen user interface. California-based Apple had protected those features with US design patents that concern the way items look. Samsung is challenging the verdict, disputing how damages are calculated in design patent cases. Such awards are currently determined by devices’ “total profit,” in accordance with a statute first adopted in 1887 and readopted in 1952. Samsung argues it should be held liable only for some portion of the profit tied to patented design aspects, given the many innovative components that go into the making of smartphones. Apple interprets the statute more narrowly, saying it is entitled to all profits from Samsung’s phones. The legal battle, which began more than five years ago, could have major repercussions in a tech industry where design and innovation play key roles in distinguishing one device from another. However, a major debate is underway on just how much protection should be granted for visual design. In preparation for its arguments before the Supreme Court, Samsung obtained the support of major Silicon Valley and other information-technology giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, as well as a group of law professors. Apple got backing from big names in fashion and manufacturing, such as Calvin Klein and Adidas and the American Intellectual Property Law Association, whose members — largely lawyers — represent owners and users of intellectual property. Apple’s supporters argue that Samsung’s argument would hurt the tech industry by weakening the patent system. “A strong patent system will force technology companies to actually innovate, not mimic. That is how patent systems are designed to work all over the world,” said Matthew Siegal, an intellectual property lawyer from the New-York based firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP. “The differences in Samsung and Apple smartphones are marginal because of copying, not innovating,” he added. “A strong patent system will lead to the next-generation phone based on actual innovation.” This story has been viewed 1150 times.

Photo: Tyrone Siu / Reuters Samsung Electronics Co yesterday dropped its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone less than two months after its launch, halting sales and exchanges worldwide following reports that replacements for combustible models were also catching fire. The development boosted share prices of local smartphone maker HTC Corp (宏達電) and other firms in Apple Inc’s supply chain. “[We] have decided to halt production and sales of the Galaxy Note 7 in order to consider our consumers’ safety first and foremost,” the South Korean firm said in a filing to the Seoul stock exchange. HTC shares surged 5.69 percent to close at NT$94.8 after the announcement. Market analysts said the decision might lift the sales of Google’s newly launched Pixel smartphone, which is solely manufactured by HTC. Apple might also gain sales momentum for its iPhone 7, therefore benefiting local assemblers Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (鴻海) and Pegatron Corp (和碩). Hon Hai’s stock price rose 1.38 percent to NT$81.1, but Pegatron fell 0.12 percent to close at NT$80.7, Taiwan Stock Exchange data showed. Samsung’s decision hurt its share price, which closed down 8 percent at 1.54 million won in Seoul trading, following a 1.5 percent drop on Monday. Samsung’s announcement came a little more than a month after it announced a recall of 2.5 million Note 7s in 10 markets following complaints that its lithium-ion batteries exploded while charging. The unprecedented move has turned into a public relations disaster and the situation only worsened when reports emerged a week ago of replacement devices also catching fire. “The reason consumers prefer brands like Samsung and Apple is because of product reliability... So in this case, brand damage is inevitable and it will be costly for Samsung to turn that around again,” HMC Investment Securities’ Greg Roh said. A number of major distributors, including AT&T Inc in the US and Germany’s T-Mobile International AG had unilaterally suspended sales and exchanges of the model on Sunday. Samsung had already advised all customers with an original or replacement Galaxy Note 7 to “power down and stop using the device” immediately — a warning echoed by US Consumer Product Safety Commission Chairman Elliot Kaye. “No one should have to be concerned their phone will endanger them, their family or their property,” Kaye said in a news release. The US Federal Aviation Administration also issued a guidance update, urging all passengers to power off and not use, charge, or stow in checked baggage, any Samsung Galaxy Note 7 device.

VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY In the weeks since Apple released iOS 10, the next-gen operating system has been installed on 54 percent of active iDevices, according to Cupertino. Those numbers, however, are lower than recent data from analytics firm Fisku, which this week counted 67.7 percent adoption; Mixpanel reported a similar 67.27 percent on Monday. Cupertino's latest mobile update, released to the public on Sept. 13, features improvements to 3D Touch, the lock screen, Messages, Maps, HomeKit, Photos, Siri, and more. But iOS 10 suffered some early installation issues (including an iMessage GIF search glitch that surfaced hard-core porn), which may have discouraged some users from immediately updating. Last month, T-Mobile warned iPhone 6, 6 Plus, and SE owners against downloading the new OS, following reports of lost network connections. Apple later patched the issue. VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY Now, the upgrade has beaten iOS 9—which in 2015 became the company's fastest-adopted operating system ever, topping 50 percent in only five days. But, based on Fiksu data, it counted only 61.9 percent of usage in the same 28 days after launch. //Related Articles 30 Hidden Tips for Mastering iOS 10 "If this uptick is more than just a temporary change, it indicates good news for Apple going into the crucial holiday season," Fiksu Director of Marketing Jeremy Sacco wrote in a blog post. "It probably means the public reaction to iOS 10 is going to stay strong." Consumers should, however, remain alert when using the new operating system. A Russian company that sells iPhone hacking software last month warned of weak encryption that makes it easier to access a password-protected backup. Cupertino promised a fix in an upcoming update.

News Stocks Technology Healthcare Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsAAPL Stock: Apple Product Banned by Britain’s Political Brass AAPL Stock: Apple Product Banned by Britain’s Political Brass UK politicians issued an edict not to wear Apple Watches as rising concerns about the threat of device hacking by foreign intelligence agencies intensify. October 11, 2016 Ari Haruni According to a recent report from ‘The Telegraph‘, it has been revealed that Apple Watches have been banned from use during Theresa May’s government official cabinet meetings over concerns that Russian hackers could hijack Cupertino’s smartwatch used by British politicians and use it as a listening device to access sensitive information. The new policy of UK’s prime minister appears to be an extension of the already existing government policy of banning smartphones from high-level policy meetings. Based on the publication’s report, at least some of the worries surrounding the line of smartwatches developed by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stem from concerns that Russian hackers might somehow use the gadget’s microphone to listen in on PM’s cabinet meetings. Obviously, this is not just paranoia, but rather a justified one, especially following a recent official announcement from the U.S. administration stating that they were confident that the Russian government was behind recent hacks of the Democratic National Committee. Similar accusations have also been made against China and North Korea. According to the statement, US intelligence officials said that “only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these [hacking] activities”. A source in the UK told The Telegraph : “The Russians are trying to hack everything.” Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied however, any involvement in hacks of US targets. Meanwhile, in related news IBTimes explains that the Apple Watch has also been banned from Australian cabinet meetings. Alistair Macgibbon, special advisor on cyber security to the Australian prime minister, told Fairfax Media that “In a world in which it is necessary for government to have conversations that truly have no electronics in the room, there are going to be more and more items that will have to be locked away in cabinets.” Macgibbon noted that greater attention needed to be paid to communications security as an increasing number of devices — from glasses to running shoes — would offer internet connectivity in future. Apple Stock Action Apple shares closed Monday at $116.05, up 1.74%, on a volume of more than 40 million shares on the Nasdaq. In pre-market hours, the stock is up $2.45, or 2.11%, to trade at $118.40, a price-per-share that values the tech giant at about $627 billion.

It’s just one of the ways it’s looking to advance the capabilities of Apple Pay. The service currently works for commuters in New York City who can use Apple Pay with the MTA eTix app. It enables them to purchase scannable e-tickets and passes without having to enter their payment details manually. However, Apple is reportedly interested in a system that’s similar to what it has announced for Japan. Japanese railway JR East will launch Apple Pay later this month via the Suica payment system. Devices that support this include the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus as well as the Apple Watch Series 2. Commuters just need to swipe their device at turnstiles and they will be good to go. Transport for London was the earliest public transit backer for Apple Pay. TfL operates the London Underground and other mass transit systems in the UK’s capital. Those who use Apple Pay with TfL don’t have to buy scannable passes or tickets, they simply swipe their devices at turnstiles as well. It’s unclear which public transport systems will gain advanced support for Apple Pay next, the company obviously has an interest in making that happen. Public transit is all about volume, and the sheer volume of commuters using mass transit systems in some of the busiest cities on the planet will generate millions of Apple Pay transactions all of which will earn Apple a small fee. Add that up and you can imagine why Apple is so interested in making this happen. Filed in Apple. Read more about apple pay.

Reprints Reprints Most Popular Five months after shaking hands with Apple, retailer Kohl's is starting to compete with the tech giant's mobile-payment service Apple Pay. For Apple, the market leader of in-store mobile payments, moves like Kohl's are becoming increasingly familiar. Over the summer, Walmart rolled out its own mobile-payment service nationwide and pharmacy chain CVS introduced CVS Pay. Apple Pay, which turns two years old this month, is facing stiffer competition and needs to find ways to stand out in a crowded field. In the next year, most retailers and fast-food restaurants will start their own mobile-payment services, and some of them will also offer Apple Pay. The service, which expanded into Russia earlier this month, is looking to absorb more functions of people's traditional wallets, such as transit cards and retail loyalty cards. "You want to get into as many use cases as possible," said Greg Weed, director of card performance research at Phoenix Marketing International. "The wallet app is ideally suited to self-service types of terminals: gas pumps, vending machines, transit. All of this stuff builds transactions. All of these things build up utility." Related Stories Apple Pay Expands to U.K. as First Market Outside U.S. Samsung Prepares for Olympics With Mobile Payments Rollout in Brazil How the Shift from Swiping to Inserting Cards Will Accelerate Mobile Payments Can Apple Make Mobile Payments Pay in the U.S.? Apple hasn't disclosed terms it's reached for Apple Pay or broken out sales it gets from the service. Assuming it gets a small percentage of every transaction, the revenue is still negligible for the company, which posted total sales of almost $234 billion in its most recent fiscal year. That revenue included $19.9 billion in services, of which transaction fees are a part. The value of in-store transactions by people paying with their mobile phones, known as proximity payments, is expected to reach $210 billion by 2019 in the U.S., according to researcher eMarketer. While that may produce a small but growing stream of revenue for the the technology giant, the Apple Pay feature may also make the company's phones more attractive, boosting loyalty among users and helping Apple compete with rivals like Samsung. Apple has spent much of the past two years raising awareness of its payment feature and getting consumers to use it in stores, apps and, most recently, online. Services such as Apple Pay accounted for 9% of in-store credit-card transactions and about 5% of credit-card dollars spent, according to a May survey by Phoenix, which asked some 5,100 adults about their spending over one month. While it's made headway, Apple Pay has a way to go to gain mass adoption, partly because some people don't see it as an improvement over the current way of doing things. To boost usage, Apple needs to show its product is superior than a credit card. According to Pymnts.com and InfoScout, 58% of people in a June survey said Apple Pay is just as easy as a card, while 56% of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users said both methods take about the same time. "They haven't proven their mobile-wallet applications are better than existing payment mechanisms," said Jordan McKee, a senior analyst for payments at 451 Research. Adding value is "the next frontier for this whole space." The company declined to comment for this story. Banks and retailers see a big part of that value addressed by integrating payments more deeply with rewards, coupons and loyalty programs. Capital One Financial has added more transaction analysis and control features, said Tom Poole, a managing vice president at the bank. It lets customers activate and disable their bank-issued cards via its app. Samsung Pay lets users earn gift cards from Dunkin' Donuts as well as earn money with its own rewards prepaid card. Alphabet, the parent of Google, tested its own loyalty program, the Tap 10, earlier this year. Last week, Kohl's unveiled its mobile-payment option, Kohl's Pay, which will integrate its private-label credit card into its mobile app. That will let the more than 25 million Kohl's Charge users to pay for purchases with their mobile phones. The service was announced five months after Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based Kohl's added Apple Pay to its mobile app. "We are interested in supporting payments -- whatever payments our customers feel like are important to them," Ratnakar Lavu, Kohl's chief technology officer, said in an interview. Kohl's Pay users will be able to redeem Kohl's Cash, apply a coupon and pay for a transaction with one click -- something they can't do with Apple Pay. Apple is also ramping up its services. This month, commuters in Japan will be able to use Apple Pay to buy railway tickets, which could prove to be a huge opportunity for Apple. Operator East Japan Railway Co. alone served 17.4 million passengers a day in the year that ended in March, and Apple has added special chips to its iPhones to support the service. Apple Pay already works on the London Underground, buses and other forms of transit there. "We've taken away the whole step of people having to buy a ticket," said Shashi Verma, director of customer experience at Transport for London. Apple is looking to serve more transit systems as cities like New York and Boston move toward tap-based mobile payments as an option. Some commuter rail lines servicing both cities currently let customers buy tickets from within an app. While Apple doesn't have its own loyalty program, it is making it easier for consumers to take advantage of merchant reward plans. In June, it began working with Orange Cash, a mobile-payment app for customers of French telecom giant Orange SA. Orange Cash uses geo-location to personalize offers sent to users' phones and rewards them for loyalty to particular brands. Apple Pay is also integrated into the app of Walgreens Boots Alliance. -- Bloomberg News In this article: CMO Strategy Digital Financial Services Restaurants Retail Shopper Marketing Technology The CMO Guide Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

Reprints Reprints Most Popular Google just debuted a digital assistant, which it hopes to place inside smartphones, watches, cars and every other imaginable internet-connected device. It's already hit a snag. The Alphabet division launched new smartphones last week with the artificially intelligent assistant deeply embedded. It also rolled out a speaker with the feature at its core and announced plans to let other companies tie their apps and services to the assistant. A day later, Samsung, which just announced it was ending production of its problematic Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, said it was acquiring Viv Labs, a startup building its own AI voice-based assistant. At first, the deal looked like a counter-punch to Samsung rival Apple -- Viv is run by the creators of Apple's Siri assistant. But buying Viv may be more of a problem for Google, because Samsung is the biggest maker of phones running Google's Android mobile operating system. Related Stories Watch Out, Siri and Alexa: Google's New Digital Assistant Is Here Google Goes After Apple, Amazon With New Pixel Phone, Smart Home Device Samsung to Kill Off Note 7 After Second Round of Battery Fires Samsung's Profits Continue to Grow Despite Note 7 Recall Amazon Rolls Out Alexa-Based Connectivity in Hyundai's Genesis Google strategy is now centered on the assistant, rather than its search engine, because it's a more natural way for people to interact with smartphones and other connected devices. Getting all Android phone makers to put the Google assistant on their devices would get the technology into millions of hands quickly. But Samsung's Viv deal suggests assistants are too important for phone makers to let other companies supply this feature. Last week, despite the Note 7 crisis, Samsung executive Injong Rhee said the company plans to put Viv's technology in its smartphones next year and then embed it into other electronics and home appliances. A Samsung representative and a Google spokeswoman declined to comment. That's a necessity for Samsung, according to some analysts and industry insiders. "As AI is becoming more sophisticated and valuable to the consumer, there's no question it will be important for hardware companies," said Kirt McMaster, executive chairman of Cyanogen, a startup that makes Android software. Mr. McMaster, a frequent Google critic, said other Android handset makers will likely follow Samsung's move. "If you don't have an AI asset, you're not going to have a brain," he added. Google may already have known that some Android phone makers -- known as original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs -- were reluctant to embrace its assistant. "Other OEMs may want to differentiate" Google's Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer told Bloomberg before it released its own smartphones. "They may want to do their own thing -- their own assistant, for example." Samsung and Google have sparred in the past over distribution. Google requires Android handset makers to pre-install 11 apps, yet Samsung often puts its own services on its phones. And the South Korean company has released devices that run on its own operating system, called Tizen, not Android. Viv was frequently on the short-list of startups that could help larger tech companies build assistant technology. Founded four-years ago by Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham, the startup was working on voice technology to handle more complex queries than existing offerings. While it drummed up considerable attention and investment, Viv has not yet released its product to the public. And some analysts are skeptical of Samsung's ability to convert the technology into a credible service, given its mixed record with software applications. "It will be very hard to compete with Google's strength in data and their AI acquisitions," said Jitendra Waral, senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. "Samsung would need to prove that its AI solutions are superior to that of Google's. They are handicapped in this race." Samsung is also focused on handling the fallout from its exploding Galaxy Note 7 phones, potentially taking management time away from its Viv integration. But it's a race Samsung has to join. In recent years, Samsung acquired mobile-payments and connected-device startups to keep up with Apple, Google and Amazon. Digital voice-based assistants may be more important, if they become the main way people interact with devices. Silicon Valley titans are rushing into the space because of this potential. Amazon is trying to sign up developers for its Alexa voice technology. Apple has recently touted more Siri capabilities and opened the technology to other developers. And now Google, considered the leader in artificial intelligence, is making its own push. "I don't ever remember a time when every single major consumer tech company -- and even enterprise companies -- have been singularly focused on an identical strategy," said Tim Tuttle, chief executive officer of MindMeld Inc., a startup working on voice interaction software. "They're all following the exact same playbook." -- Bloomberg News In this article: Consumer Electronics Digital Mobile Technology Telecommunications Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

By Staff Reporter October 11, 2016 17:13 BST Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 isn't the only gadget prone to catching fire - this used to be a hoverboardWest Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, Facebook Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 debacle has quickly become one of the biggest tech fails in recent history, resulting in a $17bn blow the company will be recovering from for years. So serious and so dire has the situation become that Samsung has announced it is discontinuing the Note 7, putting the future of the highly popular smartphone range on the ropes. While Samsung's might be the most high-profile product recall in recent memory, it is by no means the only company to have sold products unfit for human use. Here are a few more embarrassing tech fails that companies would rather you forget. The infamous Xbox 360 'Red Ring of Death'Reuters Red Ring of Death PlayStation fans landed the first blow in the 7th Gen console wars when the infamous 'Red Ring of Death' hit Xbox 360 gamers. The problem saw consoles suddenly dying for no apparent reason, with the three flashing red lights indicating a "general hardware failure". Microsoft was forced to issue replacement units to hundreds of customers as well as extend all Xbox 360 warranties to three years, costing it millions. Apple took the classy approach and deflected the blameReuters Antennagate At its most fundamental level, a phone should be able to make calls. Yet when Apple launched the iPhone 4 in 2010, users reported that the device struggled at this most basic task. The problem, as it turned out, was the placement of the antenna on the phone, which had been moved for the phone's redesign. Incredulously, Apple's first response was to suggest that customers were holding the phone the wrong way, before admitting it was at fault and resolved to look into the problem properly. Even then, the eventual "fix" came in the form of a free bumper case that Apple said would alleviate the problem. The Nest Protect smoke detector was pretty useless in actual emergenciesNest False alarm Nest left customers heated after pulling some 440,000 of its 'smart' smoke detectors from sale after it became apparent that the device could be inadvertently disabled during a fire. This was thanks to its Wave feature, which allowed customers to disable the alarm with a gesture if triggered accidentally – say, by burning toast. Unfortunately, the device struggled to differentiate between this and people simply moving around beneath it, making it quite useless in emergencies. Amazon hoverboards – just don'tWest Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, Facbook Amazon's Hoverboard Hell Not only are these two wheeled monstrosities not even real hoverboards, but they're also prone to burning down homes. The problem was traced to faulty batteries and charging components that were not compliant with normal safety standards, and as such, Amazon completely banned sales of the devices pending further investigation. Since then we've seen fewer of them menacing the high street, which can only be a good thing. McDonald's Step-iT fitness trackerConsumer Product Safety Commission Unhappy Meal A McDonald's fitness tracker – what could possibly go wrong? As well as being a front runner for the most ironic gadget of the year award, McDonald's' Step-iT health monitor turned out to be good at burning more than just calories. The fast food chain recalled millions of the devices after dishing them out in Happy Meals in the US, after customers complained of being left with skin irritation and blisters.

The solar array is expected to cover approximately 90% of the company’s annual electricity use. New England Apple has been grinding and squeezing apples in the area since before the advent of modern electricity, adapting over the years in a variety of ways. Aware of the environmental benefits, and with key partners successfully going solar, the company opted to invest in a system for their own operations. New England Apple Products is projected to save $40,000 annually on its electricity bill, and is able to take advantage of state and federal tax and financial incentives, including SRECs (Solar Renewable Energy Certificates), which are financial incentives based on the amount of solar energy the system generates. NE Apple’s new solar installation joins an array of other green efforts that the company has been dedicated to for some time. These include programs that range from donating their left-over apple solids to local cattle farmers to augment their feed, to comprehensive recycling practices in place for waste plastic, cardboard, and mixed grade paper.

This latest patent spotted by Apple Insider described a method for embedding a light sensor into a display, both LCD or OLED. In a typical device, a light sensor is laterally displaced from an active display region of the display along a front face of the device. Additional space is therefore provided in common devices at the top, bottom, or side of the active display area to accommodate the light sensor. This can result in an undesirable increase in the size and weight of the device, if care is not taken, displays may be bulky or may be surrounded by overly large borders […] The [described] light sensor is a display-integrated light sensor that is integrated into the layers of the display. The light, sensor may be interposed between the cover layer and another layer of the display such as the touch-sensitive layer, the light-generating layers, or another display layer. This approach doesn’t put the sensor into the display itself, rather just outside of the active part of the display, which would make it nearly impossible to see.

Apple shares posted their highest close of 2016, just as Samsung announced today that it is permanently halting sales of the Galaxy Note 7. Apple stock was up more than 1 percent, trading above $117 midmorning Tuesday, while Samsung was down more than 8 percent. Apple shares ended the day slightly higher at $116.35. Samsung said it would halt production of the Note 7 after several reports said that the phones would suddenly catch fire. Major smartphone carriers, including AT&T and Verizon, are allowing customers to exchange Galaxy Note 7s for another device, including Apple's iPhone. Some investors think Samsung's woes could potentially boost sales of Apple's iPhone. Apple's stock is already reportedly up 20 percent over the last three months, which includes the time of the iPhone 7 debut. In addition to market movement, Samsung and Apple will also be giving final arguments in a long-running design patent dispute today in front of the Supreme Court. The justices will be considering how much Samsung owes Apple for infringing design patents on Apple's iPhone with a final decision expected by late June.

On July 28th of 2016, NPD Group’s Retail Tracking Service reported that, for the first time in the history of headphones, Bluetooth headphone revenue overtook non-Bluetooth. To see this coming many, many moons ahead of time, Apple may only have had to purchase the biggest brand in headphones. Back when Jimmy Iovine (of Beats) and Eddy Cue (of Apple) appeared at Recode’s Code Conference in 2014, Iovine suggested that the two companies had been working with one another – or at least in contact through these two leaders – for the past 10 years. That doesn’t really add up if we check back to the founding of the company “Beats Electronics,” AKA “Beats by Dr. Dre,” back in 2006. ABOVE: Jimmy Iovine and Eddy Cue explain the Beats deal. “This is just about [Apple] continuing to invest in music,” said Cue. Before Beats’ deal with Apple, Iovine co-founded Interscope Records and signed Tupac Shakur and became involved with Death Row Records (a subsidiary of Interscope) by providing initial funding, co-produced 8 Mile, More Than A Game, and Get Rich or Die Tryin. SEE THIS: Apple’s Beats deal for Dre, streaming, everything else He made crazy amounts of successful moves in multiple industries over many decades, then teamed up with Dr. Dre to make Beats By Dr. Dre, subsequently capturing 27% of the headphones market (according to NPD Group in 2013 of the market in 2012) and 57% of the “Premium” headphones market (units that cost $99 USD or more). Apple does not make major changes to their top-selling product, the iPhone, without making absolutely certain that they’re going to be able to have a solid product to sell. As such, Apple took the idea that the headphone jack might not be necessary in the future, and ran with it. By “ran with it” I mean they researched it. To such a degree that they included analysis of this subject specifically in their negotiations with Beats before the deal was made. We, Apple, they probably said, want to own the company that foresaw the rise of the headphones market in 2008, then became a big part of that rise in not only unit sales, but average acceptable price paid by the consumer. We want to see when Bluetooth headphone sales will likely overtake wired headphone sales well before a company like NPD is able to report it. In July of 2016, NPD reported that for the first time ever, Bluetooth headphones picked up more revenue than non-Bluetooth headphones. At the top of the dollar sales chart: Beats (as owned by Apple). On September 7th, 2016, the iPhone 7 was revealed as the first iPhone without a headphone jack. Apple’s music industry and headphones market insight, professional of the highest order thanks to the Beats crew, made it possible for Apple’s headphone jack-less iPhone to appear at just the right moment in history – just as Bluetooth headphones began making more money than their wired counterparts. Apple’s major influence on perception in both smartphone and headphone markets will further push the trend, and the brand can ride the wave in to massive profit.

The eight justices heard arguments in Samsung's bid to pare back $399 million of $548 million it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict finding that it infringed Apple's iPhone patents and copied its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices. The $399 million penalty stemmed specifically from Samsung's violation of three Apple patents on the design of the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, bezel and colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications. While the justices signaled a willingness to reduce the potentially huge penalties imposed for ripping off someone else's patented design, some expressed skepticism over how, in practice, juries could figure out the importance of a specific design trait in a product in order to calculate damages. "If I were a juror, I wouldn't know what to do," Justice Anthony Kennedy said. Several justices struggled with how they would devise a test for lower courts and juries to use to determine design patent damages. BEETLE COMPARISON Using as an example the Volkswagen Beetle's unique automobile body contour, Justice Elena Kagan suggested it might be difficult for a jury to decide how much damages to award based on a theoretical patent infringement of its shape, when that trait might be the main factor driving consumers to buy it. Smartphones like Cupertino, California-based Apple's iPhone and South Korea-based Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Galaxy have become an indispensable part of everyday life for many people worldwide, as well as huge business for their makers. Samsung is the world's No. 1 smartphone manufacturer. Apple is its fiercest rival. The case was heard on same day Samsung scrapped its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone following reports of the phones catching fire. It was supposed to have competed with Apple's latest iPhone for smartphone market supremacy. Samsung has contended it should not have had to turn over all its profits on phones that infringed the iPhone design patents, which the company said contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features. Chief Justice John Roberts said that since the patented designs involve the outer case of a smartphone and not "all the chips and wires" inside, the profits awarded should not be based on the entire price of the phone. After the argument, Samsung's attorney, Kathleen Sullivan, said, "We are hopeful that the Supreme Court will give a sensible and fair reading to the design patent statute. That would be a win for businesses and consumers alike." Apple's chief litigation officer, Noreen Krall, said courts at every level have found that Samsung intentionally and blatantly copied the iPhone, adding: "We think that's wrong and that it poses chilling risks to the future of design innovation." A ruling is due by the end of June. Apple sued Samsung in 2011, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone's trademarked appearance. After a trial in 2012, Apple was awarded nearly $930 million in damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington last year upheld the patent infringement verdict, but said the iPhone's appearance could not be protected through trademarks. That cut Samsung's damages back to $548.2 million. Design patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court, which had not heard such a case in more than 120 years. The case is Samsung Electronics Co Ltd v. Apple Inc, in the Supreme Court of the United States, No. 15-777.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Bloomberg: Apple working on getting Apple Pay into more public transit systems By Christian Zibreg, Oct 11, 2016 Tweet 2 Comments Apple has been working on getting its mobile payments system, which expanded into Russia earlier this month, into more public transit systems, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Thanks to FeliCa-compatible NFC chips inside iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2 models sold in Japan, Apple Pay will be gaining support for Japanese railway JR East later this month through its dedicated Suica payment system. From the article: This month, commuters in Japan will be able to use Apple Pay to buy railway tickets, which could prove to be a huge opportunity for Apple. Operator East Japan Railway Co. alone served 17.4 million passengers a day in the year that ended in March, and Apple has added special chips to its iPhones to support the service. Apple Pay already works on the London Underground, buses and other forms of transit there. Transport for London, which operates the London Underground and other systems in the city, lets people use Apple Pay to pay for their commute. In October 2016, North America’s busiest commuter trains have implemented support for Apple Pay in the MTA eTix app for iPhone, letting commuters purchase e-tickets and passes for New York City’s Long Island Railroad and Metro-North Railroad trains. Apple’s mobile payments service is now looking to “absorb more functions of people’s traditional wallets”, such as transit cards and retail loyalty cards. “You want to get into as many use cases as possible,” said Greg Weed, director of card performance research at Phoenix Marketing International. “The wallet app is ideally suited to self-service types of terminals: gas pumps, vending machines, transit. All of this stuff builds transactions. All of these things build up utility.” eMarketer estimated that the value of in-store transactions in the United States by people paying with their mobile phones will reach $210 billion by 2019. A May survey by Phoenix, which asked some 5,100 adults about their spending over one month, found that mobile wallets like Apple Pay accounted for nine percent of in-store credit card transactions. According to Pymnts.com and InfoScout, 58 percent of people in a June survey said Apple Pay was just as easy as a credit card, while 56 percent of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users said both methods take about the same time. The survey’s findings suggest that Apple Pay still has work to do if it’s to become better than existing payment mechanisms. Apple currently operates the service in the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Hong Kong, France, Singapore and Russia. Apple Pay, which turns two years old this month, is accepted in stores, on the web and in compatible apps. Top image: Lionel via The New York Times.

Posted 11 Oct 2016 23:00 Woman use their smartphones as they stand near a Samsung store in London on Oct 11, 2016. (Photo: AFP/Daniel Leal-Olivas) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A WASHINGTON: The Supreme Court took up the blockbuster legal battle between Apple and Samsung on Tuesday (Oct 11) in a case likely to result in a landmark decision on the importance of design in technology patents. The highest US court began hearing arguments over damages the South Korean smartphone giant owes Apple for allegedly violating design patents by producing copycats of its groundbreaking iPhone. Observers are watching to see how the court - which has not taken up a design patent case in more than a century - tips the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. A ruling is expected in several months. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a US$400 million verdict - part of a nearly billion-dollar award in Apple's favor later reduced to US$548 million - that found Samsung had copied the iPhone, including its distinctive front screen and graphical touchscreen interface. The case is among several in courts around the world between the two smartphone giants, but this case is likely to set an important precedent over the importance of design patents. California-based Apple had protected those features with US design patents that concern the way items look. They are distinct from utility patents, which protect how articles are used and work, and do not concern copyrights or trademarks. Samsung is challenging the verdict, disputing how damages are calculated in design patent cases. The award - in accordance with a statute first adopted in 1887 and later affirmed by Congress in 1952 - requires patent violators to hand over their total profits even if the violation covers only one element of a product. Samsung argues it should be held liable only for some portion of the profit tied to patented design aspects, given the many innovative components that go into the making of smartphones. Apple interprets the statute more narrowly, saying it is entitled to all profits from Samsung's phones. HOW MUCH DESIGN PROTECTION? The legal battle which began more than five years ago could have major repercussions in a tech industry where design and innovation play key roles in distinguishing one device from another. But a major debate is underway on just how much protection should be granted for visual design. In preparation for its arguments before the Supreme Court, Samsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, as well as a group of law professors. Apple, for its part, got backing from big names in fashion and manufacturing, such as Calvin Klein and Adidas, and the American Intellectual Property Law Association, whose members - largely lawyers - represent owners and users of intellectual property. An amicus brief filed on behalf of design professionals, researchers and academics said they have no financial interest in the case but argue on the basis of "fundamental principles of visual design." They cite precedents like the Coca-Cola bottle, which is an integral part of the value of the product, according to the brief. LOOK-ALIKE SMARTPHONES Apple's supporters argue that Samsung's argument would hurt the tech industry by weakening the patent system. "A strong patent system will force technology companies to actually innovate, not mimic. That is how patent systems are designed to work all over the world," said Matthew Siegal, an intellectual property lawyer with the firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. "A strong patent system will lead to the next generation phone based on actual innovation." Tuesday's hearing is set to take place before a short-handed panel of eight justices, with a ninth still missing since Antonin Scalia's death in February. Republicans in Congress have refused to replace him with President Barack Obama's nominee before the Democrat leaves office in January. The hearing takes place at a difficult time for Samsung, as it is struggling to contain a snowballing safety crisis that threatens to derail the powerhouse global brand. It told customers worldwide on Monday to stop using Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, calling a halt to global sales and exchanges following complaints that its lithium-ion battery explodes while charging. Apple is also facing challenges from mounting international competition, having lost a critical share of the Chinese market after critics there found its latest iPhone 7 lacks major innovations. - AFP/ec Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

By Jing CaoBloomberg Tues., Oct. 11, 2016 Samsung Electronics Co.’s mounting crisis with its flagship Galaxy Note 7 has left millions of premium smartphone buyers looking for an alternative. The obvious candidate is Apple’s iPhone 7, but Google’s slick new Pixel device could get a lift, too. Samsung recalled and pledged to replace millions of Note 7 phones in early September after reports that their batteries were bursting into flame. But over the past week, new reports have emerged that some replacement phones are catching on fire, too. Samsung has now asked retailers to stop selling all Note 7 phones while the company and U.S. officials investigate why the new batch of devices seem to be afflicted with the same problem. Many people upgrade their phones during the Christmas shopping season, giving Apple and Google an opportunity to fill the Samsung vacuum — and making it even harder for the South Korean company to bounce back. The Pixel may be especially appealing to Samsung users looking for another device that runs the Android operating system. “There’s been a shift toward bigger screen devices, and there’s less competition there given the Note 7 issue, so there’s definitely more opportunities for the iPhone 7 Plus,” said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP. As for Google, “the Pixel suddenly has got very limited competition at the high end of the market.” Samsung on Tuesday asked wireless carriers to stop selling its most expensive phone and instructed consumers to stop using them. The move came as carriers including AT&T Inc., T-Mobile US Inc., Sprint Corp., Verizon Communications Inc. and Australia’s Telstra Corp. halted Note 7 sales following reports of problems with devices thought to be safe. Article Continued Below Before the exploding batteries, Samsung had defied a slowing smartphone market with better-than expected Galaxy sales and successfully capitalized on a lull in demand for new iPhones. In recent months, Samsung had expanded its already considerable market share. The company shipped 77 million smartphones in the second quarter for a market share of 22 per cent, that’s up from 73 million, or 21 per cent share a year ago, according to IDC. Apple’s shipments dropped 15 per cent to leave it with market share of 12 per cent.   Samsung on Tuesday asked wireless carriers to stop selling its most expensive phone and instructed consumers to stop using them due to the fire risk.  (DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS / AFP/GETTY IMAGES)   Now the South Korean company enters the crucial holiday shopping season with no large-screen smartphone. Because Samsung and Apple have basically split the market for $700-plus smartphones between them, the latter is a natural beneficiary of Samsung’s woes. Investors seem to expect that to happen and pushed Apple shares up 1.7 per cent to $116.05 Monday in New York, the highest level since December 2015. In the long-term, Apple could attract Android users to its “sticky iOS ecosystem, which boasts a ~95 per cent loyalty rate,” Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Kulbinder Garcha wrote in a note. Still, Google’s Pixel, which debuts in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada and Germany on Oct. 20, could appeal to those who are immune to Apple’s charms. The Pixel is the first phone the search giant has conceptualized, designed, engineered and tested in-house. It has a number of features that will be broadly appealing, including a Siri-like virtual assistant, a flashy camera and speedy apps. Of course, the Pixel is untested, Google’s previous forays into hardware have floundered, and the company lacks its own retail stores. How much Apple and Google benefit depends on what Samsung does next. Already pressure is mounting for the company to kill its troubled phone altogether. Said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co. in Seoul: “It’s meaningless to continue producing the Note 7.” Read more about: Apple, Google, Samsung The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) TOKYO - Asian markets fell Wednesday, following pessimism on Wall Street, amid disappointing earnings news from the U.S. and lingering doubts about the direction of oil prices. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 0.5 per cent to 16,932.77 in morning trading, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.4 per cent to 5,460.10.

The Nasdaq composite index slid 81.89 points, or 1.5 per cent, to 5,246.79. THE QUOTE: "Equities meanwhile were hit with a double whammy. Fed hike expectations coupled with softer oil prices brought the S&P 500 index to a loss," says Jingyi Pan, markets strategist at IG in Singapore. "The oil story is still developing with traders now casting doubts over the Russia's commitment." ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 7 cents to $50.86 a barrel in New York.

The eight justices on the top court appeared divided on how to resolve the complex dispute over damages the South Korean smartphone giant owes Apple for copying key design features of the iPhone. The case arguments came as Samsung faces a fresh but unrelated crisis as it halted production of a flagship handset for safety reasons, potentially imperiling the powerhouse South Korean brand. Samsung, which has been ordered to pay $400 million for violating certain iPhone features, is challenging the legal precedent which requires the forfeiture of all profits from a product even if only a single design patent is infringed upon. This key question on the value of design patents has rallied Samsung supporters in the tech sector, and Apple backers in the creative and design communities. The justices Tuesday offered some support for both sides without providing a hint on the outcome of the case. Justice Anthony Kennedy said Samsung's argument would create confusion for jurors in trying to apportion damages. "If I'm the juror, I just don't know what to do," Kennedy told attorneys during the hearing. "I'd have the iPhone in the jury room; I'd -- I'd look at it. I just wouldn't know." - VW Beetle example - The court debate moved from smartphones to automobiles, and the importance of design to the Volkswagen Beetle, for example. Justice Samuel Alito appeared to lean toward Samsung's position, saying, "Nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks... What if it broke down every 50 miles?" Offering a similar view, Justice Stephen Breyer said a single component cannot account for all profits: "A Rolls Royce thing on the hood? No, no, no. You don't get all the profit from the car." Samsung attorney Kathleen Sullivan said the justices should consider all the components of a smartphone. "A smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work," she said. She said the case could lead to more litigations because patent holders "carve the product up into multiple partial design claims... and find a little sliver of the phone on which infringement can be found." - Design 'not a component' - Apple lawyer Seth Waxman fired back that Samsung made a conscious decision to revive its fortunes by copying the iPhone. "A design is not a component, a design is applied to a thing," Waxman said. Waxman contended that Samsung's own documents showed that the South Korean giant acted to deal with "a crisis of design" and sought to copy the iPhone. He noted that limiting the damages would offer little deterrence and encourage "counterfeiters and copyists." Observers are watching to see how the court -- which has not taken up a design patent case in more than a century -- tips the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. A ruling is expected in several months. The case is one element of the $548 million penalty Samsung was ordered to pay for copying the iPhone's distinctive front screen and graphical touchscreen interface. Matt Levy of the Computer & Communications Industry Association said the debate suggested the justices were open to lowering the jury award. "The damages statute for design patents was written to protect products like rugs, where the design was essentially the entire thing being sold," Levy said in a blog post. "Congress certainly didn't intend to treat complex products as if only the outer appearance is what matters.... Based on what I heard, I think it's very likely that the (justices) will modify the lower court's decision." Samsung has won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard. Apple is supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. An amicus brief filed on behalf of design professionals, researchers and academics said they have no financial interest in the case but argue on the basis of "fundamental principles of visual design." They cite precedents like the Coca-Cola bottle, which is an integral part of the value of the product. The Supreme Court hearing took place hours after Samsung announced it was scrapping the production of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, its new flagship device that has been mired in a disastrous recall over exploding lithium-ion batteries.

This is the iPhone even the FBI can’t hack Apple and Samsung — after five years of litigation — finally get their say in front of the US Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Tuesday in the bitter patent dispute between the world’s two top smartphone manufacturers. What’s at stake is the amount Samsung should pay Apple for copying the iPhone’s distinctive look. The justices’ ruling, due by the end of June, could have a long-term impact for designers and product manufacturers going forward because the Supreme Court, if it agrees with Samsung, could limit the penalties for swiping a patented design. Samsung paid Apple Inc. $548.2 million last December, fulfilling part of its liability stemming from a 2012 verdict for infringing Apple’s iPhone patents and copying its look. But Samsung will argue before the high court that it should not have had to make as much as $399 million of that payout for infringement of three patented designs on the iPhone’s rounded-corner front face, its bezel and the colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications. It will be the Supreme Court’s first case involving design patents in more than 120 years, when the products at issue were carpets and rugs. Apple sued its South Korean rival in 2011, claiming Samsung stole its technology and the iPhone’s trademarked appearance.

Apple, Google, LG and Chinese handset makers could be among the winners as Note owners look to exchange their phones, experts told CNBC. Apple Neil Shah, research director of devices and ecosystems at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC he believes that most Note 7 owners will go to Apple, which just released its iPhone 7 model. Indeed, Apple's stock, rising 2 percent, contributed the most gains to the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday morning. "Those are premium customers who prefer a premium brand," Shah said. Angelo Zino, equity analyst at CFRA Research, also predicted higher switching rates from Android to Apple over the next 12 to 18 months as Samsung's issues weigh. Tim Long, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, concurred. "Part of our thesis on Apple all along has been, they are taking a good amount of market share from Samsung at the high end, and even from some other brands that are moving upmarket," Long told CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Monday. Brian White, a Drexel Hamilton analyst, estimated in a research note that Apple could pick up at least 8 million extra unit sales this calendar year, out of the 10 million to 14 million Galaxy Note 7 phones he expected to be sold in the second half of the year. Google The maker of the Android platform used by Samsung, Alphabet's Google recently stepped up its smartphone offerings with the Pixel phone. Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said Monday in an interview with CNBC that most customers using the Android operating system are very loyal, and so Samsung's other phone, the Galaxy S7, and Google's Pixel, are both selling. Vivek Wadhwa, professor at Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering, also sees the Pixel as Samsung's real threat. Other Android makers High-end smartphone makers are increasingly seeing competition among midtier offerings from companies such as LG, and Chinese brands like Huawei, Oppo and others. While Samsung and Apple shipped the highest volume of smartphones worldwide in the second quarter, by IDC estimates, companies like Oppo and Vivo are seeing big growth. "Outside of Samsung's Galaxy S7 flagship, a majority of vendors, including Apple, have found success with more affordable models compared to their flagship handsets," Anthony Scarsella, research manager of mobile phones at IDC, said when the data was released in July. But fellow IDC analyst Ramon Llamas estimates that the Note 7 is only about 10 percent of Samsung's phone shipments — and at more than 77 million shipments in the second quarter, the company is still set to be the world leader as far as number of smartphones shipped. Apple is a far second at 40 million units, Llamas said in an interview. Plus, most of Samsung's sales are between $150 and $650 in price, and that's a totally different market than anyone else, Llamas said. Apple and Google play at the high end of the market, and other smartphone players are either lower-priced or regional, he said. Tweet: "List of #Android competitors after Samsung: Xiaomi, Huawei, ZTE, Alcatel/TCL, LG, OPPO, vivo. No one in striking distance to upend Sansung" Llamas said he doesn't think that Samsung's issues will necessarily push people to shift to iPhone because of the costs of switching operating systems. "There's transferring all of your content or data. Repurchasing apps you may have already bought in the past. There's another cost there." Still, as an owner of the Note 7 phone himself, Llamas said he's looking for assurances from the company that there won't be a repeat instance in Samsung's future phones. "The takeaway is, turn in your Note 7 — period," Llamas said. — Reporting by CNBC's Arjun Kharpal. Julia Boorstin and Saheli Roy Choudhury contributed.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 0.5 per cent to 16,932.77 in morning trading, and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.4 per cent to 5,460.10.

The Nasdaq composite index slid 81.89 points, or 1.5 per cent, to 5,246.79. THE QUOTE: “Equities meanwhile were hit with a double whammy.

Can you really survive and go on living for one full day with the knowledge that there is newer iOS software out there than the version you're currently running on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch? No, you can't and that's why we're going to show you just how easy it is to install iOS 10 beta 3, or any other developer beta of iOS, without the need for a $99-per-year developer account. DON'T MISS: Does the iPhone 7 have any competition now that the Note 7 is dead? In the old days, Apple used to keep tight wraps on its developer beta software and take steps to prevent users without developer accounts from installing the software. Since everyone would just find workarounds and install iOS betas anyway, Apple gave up and simplified the process. Now, instead of having to register your device's IMEI in your developer account, any device with access to the developer beta profile can install iOS betas. Only developers are supposed to have access to the aforementioned beta profile, but the video below from YouTube user iCrackUriDevice explains just how easy it is for anyone and everyone to find and install the beta profile. If you want iOS 10.1 beta 3 on your device right now — complete with Portrait Mode for the iPhone 7 Plus — check out the video and follow the instructions. We won't link to the developer beta profile here, but you'll find simple instructions in that video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouywZtgIY2c Trending right now: Pokemon Go sneakily adds new feature that makes it easier to fill up your Pokedex This is the in-depth technical iPhone 7 review you’ve been waiting for Apple launches investigation as another iPhone goes up in flames See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Watch Saturday Night Live’s emotional and highly unusual cold open BGR News iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech This supermoon will be extra-super GeekWire New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     New Apple patent would embed light sensors into the display, hints at iPhone 8 technology By Christian Zibreg, Oct 11, 2016 Tweet 8 Comments The United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) today awarded Apple a patent describing a process for embedding light-sensing sensors into a mobile display. The invention, titled “Electronic devices with display-integrated light sensors,” potentially paves the way for next year’s iPhone. Apple’s new patent specifically mentions the ambient light and proximity sensors, which are found on the front face of the device, as being integrated into the display assembly. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and pundits in the know, like Daring Fireball’s John Gruber, the iPhone 8—or whatever a 2017 iPhone (or Tenth Anniversary iPhone) ends up being called—should be a major design departure from prior models as it would supposedly get rid of the chin and forehead bezels by integrating Touch ID and the front-camera along with other sensors directly into the display. The invention outlines a mobile device with a display-integrated light sensor that includes a transparent cover layer, light-generating layers and a touch-sensitive layer. An ambient light sensor or a proximity sensor is interposed between the transparent cover layer and a display layer, whether it be OLED or LCD. Currently, these sensors are found above the display of current iPhone, iPad and Mac models. “The display-integrated light sensor may be a packaged light sensor that is integrated into the display layers of the display or may be formed from light-sensor components formed directly on a display circuitry layer such as the touch-sensitive layer or the thin-film transistor layer,” reads the patent abstract. AppleInsider explains: Certain embodiments dispose an ambient light sensor or a proximity sensor at the extreme edge of an OLED display abutting a touch-sensitive layer, for example. Alternatively, a handset could include a dedicated TFT layer onto which a variety of sensors are embedded. In each case, all display and sensor circuitry is protected by a transparent encapsulation layer made from glass or plastic. In other embodiments, one or more light sensors are integrated at the periphery of a display beyond the edge of touch sensitive traces to avoid touch sensitivity issues. The invention was first filed for in June 2015 and credits Apple engineers Erik G. de Jong, Anna-Katrina Shedletsky and Prashanth S. Holenarsipur as its inventors. USPTO last week granted Apple a patent for a Touch ID sensor that could work through an iPhone display.

(not the tablet, that massive table) That screen was capable of “seeing” via a combination of proximity sensory equipment and ambient light sensors embedded in the screen. So perhaps this is more Apple’s unique take on the process?

It's also a company recognised for its marketing smarts and engineering savvy worldwide, so much so that consulting firm Interbrand ranked it as the world’s seventh most valuable in its 2016 survey, ahead of Amazon and Mercedes-Benz. So how is it that the pride of South Korea has so botched the recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones after complaints of exploding batteries - and a ton of negative publicity by the media in the US, Europe, and China, not to mention the vast echo chamber of social media? (Also see: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Recall: The Name That Wasn't Meant to Be) When it recalled its phones last month, it assured consumers it had diagnosed the problem and that its replacements were safe. Not so it turns out: Customers reported the lithium batteries in new phones went up in flames too, in some instances. On Tuesday, Samsung took the dramatic step of killing off the Note 7 for good.“This is a calamity,” said Srinivas Reddy, director at the Center for Marketing Excellence at Singapore Management University. “The threat for Samsung is how soon they can get back. If they don’t get back soon, it provides a vacuum for others to creep in.” The company has not said how many new or replacement phones will be affected. Analysts estimated that the original recall would cost between $1 billion and $2 billion, but that figure will now certainly rise. The move sent Samsung shares down 8 percent on Tuesday, vaporising $17 billion in market value. Samsung’s sterling brand image built up over decades is at risk unless the management team led by Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee, 48, doesn’t get out in front of the crisis soon. (Also see: Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 Crisis Is an Opportunity for Apple, Google) "It’s a very critical moment for Samsung," said Martin Roll, a brand strategist and author of Asian Brand Strategy. "How Samsung is handling this crisis is kind of a way for Samsung to step into the modern era because Asian firms have only started to emerge as very iconic, contemporary consumer brands like Apple. The history of Samsung as a brand is still being written.” So the Phone You Bought Might Explode? What to Do With a Note 7 Some six weeks after the first reports of exploding phones surfaced, Samsung engineers, as well as U.S. and South Korean government investigators, have yet to discover why lithium batteries in the company’s new smartphone product overheat and in some cases explode. The Korean Agency for Technology and Standards (KATS) said in an e-mailed statement Tuesday, it is investigating the possibility the Note 7 smartphones may have a new defect. An official at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy didn’t rule out the possibility that the problem may be tied to the overall product design or production. Samsung has said it’s working with investigators and still trying to identify the source of the battery problem. (Also see: Galaxy Note 7 Fiasco Could Burn a $17 Billion Hole in Samsung Accounts) Whether the Samsung brand takes a lasting hit will depend, in part, on how long the mystery of the Note 7 batteries continues and whether the company is perceived by consumers as stonewalling. "Samsung must come clean with a thorough explanation as the previous explanations don’t completely add up now," said Mark Newman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong. The company needs to find out the exact cause and communicate it clearly to consumers, according to Yoo Jong Woo, an analyst at Korean Investment & Securities Co. "I think the company will be able to recover from the blow to its image over time, if the problem does not spread to other phones," he said. Brand strategist Roll agreed that consumers will be forgiving if this is viewed as an aberration at an otherwise reliable company. "Consumers need to be kept in the loop here because they’ve put trust in Samsung’s brand," Roll said. "It’s a partnership." Until Samsung can come up with some answers, it faces thorny challenges. Six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had originally estimates that Samsung would ship 13 million Note 7s this year. Now it has a hole in its product lineup, just as Apple begins selling its iPhone 7 and high-end devices from Google hit the market. There’s also the risk that the Note 7 troubles spill over to other smartphones in the Galaxy lineup, dampening overall sales momentum against key rivals such as Apple and Huawei Technologies Co. Samsung faces a serious image problem in China, where customers and government-owned media have railed about Samsung’s handling of its recall. "They’re done in China," said Shaun Rein, managing director of Shanghai-based China Market Research Group. "For the Chinese, they don’t differentiate between the Note 7 and all Samsung phones. So they’re not willing to buy any Samsung phones right now." Back in South Korea, some consumers are more forgiving. Several customers shopping at a smartphone retail store in Seoul’s Jonggak neighbourhood shrugged off suggestions the latest crisis could hurt Samsung’s image. They said they would still consider Samsung phone as an option despite reports of Note 7 catching on fire. One customer said it was a matter of national pride. “As a South Korean we should purchase Samsung phones because we should think about the country,” said Shin Young-su, 50, who is self-employed. He said he was encouraging more young Koreans to buy Samsung phones to help the company. Another customer who prefers Apple’s iPhone because of functionality with his other Apple devices said he didn’t think the latest crisis would hurt the Samsung brand. “The igniting issue is a problem for only few phones," Kim Sung-min, 38, who would only say he works in the service industry. “Even if a phone ignites in my hands, I believe Samsung will take care of everything for me. I believe in the brand.” Samsung will almost certainly take a meaningful financial hit in the fourth quarter from the Note 7, according to Bernstein’s Newman. That said, he estimates the entire Note line only accounts for 8.5 percent of his 2017 net profit forecast and thinks Tuesday’s market reaction was overdone. Dan Baker, an analyst at Morningstar in Hong Kong, pegs the direct cost from the initial Note 7 recall at as much as 1 trillion won ($892 million). "But the damage to reputation and future sales is probably going to be bigger," he said. "It’s not just the phone: their whole ecosystem is behind this -- displays, memory chips. If their phone sales drop, then their sales of other parts of the business will be impacted. It’s a spiral." Baker expects Samsung to try to shift the focus to the next version of the smartphone. "They’re probably going to double the testing on it," he said. “They don’t want this to happen again. There will be people’s jobs on the line."

The display panel is said to be composed of a transparent cover layer, light-generating layers and a touch-sensitive layer.  To make the design tweak work, the display-integrated light sensor is going to be inserted between the transparent cover layer and the touch-sensitive layer. Another setup pertains to the light sensor being interposed between the transparent cover layer and a thin-film transistor layer that’s part of the light-generating layers.  AppleInsider says that with the design tweak, the “chin and forehead” bezels of the next-generation iPhone could be removed because the light sensor will be functioning from within the display itself. The Apple-centric website also claims that this advancement could ensure the presence of a true full-screen display on the upcoming devices.  Rumor has it that Apple is planning to ditch the bezels of its famous smartphone for its 10th year anniversary release. This redesign is said to make use of OLED display that would cover the entire face of the handset.  Related Stories Supreme Court To Give Final Word On Apple-Samsung Feud Apple Releases Third iOS 10.1 Beta Appeals Court Reinstates $120 Million Award For Apple Since the front of the iPhone 8 is going to be primarily made of glass, it was previously rumored that the fingerprint scanner would be embedded into the screen. However, the rumor is now backed by a patent that was awarded to the Cupertino giant last week. Late last month, an Apple employee revealed that the tech giant is working on its iPhone 7 successor in its Herzliya offices in Israel. The employee also shared at the time that the next-generation iPhone is being called internally as the "iPhone 8" and not the "iPhone 7s," which is the expected moniker if Apple’s iPhone nomenclature is to be followed.  Following the employee’s confirmation, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo shared his prediction for the 2017 iPhone lineup, saying that the new Apple handsets will sport glass casing up front and on the back with stainless steel surrounding the edges for a “reinforced structure design.”   Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Industry More News 11 Oct 16 | Luke Richards Facebook0 Linkedin10 Google+5 Twitter 15 The big story in streaming this past week is the anticipated arrival of Amazon’s new on-demand music service. Rumours have been floating around for a while now but sites such as The Verge are guessing that the online retailer could jump into the ring with Spotify and Apple Music etc. over the next few weeks; with a service for customers already using the Echo device. It is expected they will launch an additional $10-per-month ‘open to all’ cross-device service in early 2017. Amazon certainly have a weighty legacy to leverage from, as well as a wealth of recorded media they already offer through their Prime service which they can now bring to the table. But I thought it would be interesting to look at the streaming market as it stands to see just how much of a fight they are going to have on their hands. Sizing up the competition Recent data from GlobalWebIndex finds that 2 in 3 internet users across the US and UK say they are using music streaming services each month. Spotify and Apple Music are dominant, with 20% of internet users using the former and around 10% using the latter. Spotify’s proliferation among younger internet users is significant. It better reflects the lay of the land more generally for the overall market, with 77% of millennials globally using such services according to the same research (GlobalWebIndex’s Entertainment Summary for Q3 2016). Young people are certainly the keenest music streamers. What Amazon can bring to the fight The initial Amazon streaming service aimed at Echo users certainly looks to add value to the brand’s latest audio device. The option for users to be able to search a bigger catalogue of music than is currently available to Prime subscribers will be a big asset for the device alongside it’s voice-activated functionality, its ability to search the web and its quick connection to make orders from the Amazon website. So we can see Amazon may already be aiming for a different demographic than Spotify, at least initially. Of course, the brand also has in excess of 300 registered users they can quickly target to try out the service – a factor which is especially important with their proposed cross-device service tipped to be launched by early 2017. As an indication of the hill they need to climb, however, Spotify surpassed 100m users this year and there will no doubt be many Amazon-using music fans already wedded to one of many streaming services available currently. Share this article Facebook0 Linkedin10 Google+5 Twitter 15 Related articles Five most important search marketing news stories of the week ​How young marketers can impact digital strategies Insurers starting to get to grips with online conversion and complex forms How Google Symptom Search will affect the healthcare industry Distractions and disruptions that might be thrown in the ring Amazon will certainly be eyeing up Spotify and Apple Music as key competitors, but US internet radio giant Pandora also looks set to jump into the streaming market with a $10 a month service coming off the back of its acquisition of several assets from Rdio late last year. There could be further significant changes to the landscape too. The Financial Times reported last month that Spotify was in talks with Soundcloud in a move which could see the Swedish company acquire the web platform which is much beloved among independent bands and producers. If the deal between Spotify and Soundcloud comes off, we can expect a massive jump in the size of the Spotify library (which already boasts more than 30m tracks) and an interesting development in the increasingly democratised landscape of independent music publishing. Outcomes? It’s an interesting time for music consumers. We can see that Amazon is seeking to give users a number of options for purchasing and listening to new music and their Echo device will be the place in which these are consolidated – at least, for users who want a home-based system. By next year, we can expect that Amazon’s more universal streaming service will be aiming to entice users who may not want the Echo device, but who know the brand and are keen to try streaming out. It’s not too far-fetched to guess that certain demographics may well be more trusting of the Amazon name than they are of Spotify. And we can expect the brand to tap into its vast (and diverse) existing membership to promote its new services. Spotify and Apple Music will not be easy to compete with, however. Both services are still seeing significant membership growth and we can expect additions to their respective assets in 2017 which will likely prove positive for the platforms and for the consumers who use them.

By James Billington October 11, 2016 14:11 BST Close Embed Feed Samsung Galaxy Note 7 discontinues in the wake of fire reports IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/21098" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Samsung's tech rivals have already begun to feast from the carcass of the exploding Note 7 debacle as Apple posted its highest share price in almost a year. In the wake of the painfully drawn-out Note 7 battery issue which started when consumers began complaining of their handsets going up in smoke, which then lead to a mass recall and replacement operation, only to see those replacement units also suffer from the exploding issue, Apple's share price has risen by 2.3%. This rise is the highest since December 2015, up $2.66 and ending at $116.72 as of Monday 10 October, no doubt putting a schadenfreude smile on the face of the Apple board. Despite Apple seeing its first revenue wobble in 13 years in early 2016 and analysts predicting a continuing decline of iPhone sales throughout 2016 the unfortunate demise of its fierce rival's flagship phablet has seen it profit from the fail. The Note 7 was launched just weeks before Apple unveiled its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (with the latter being a direct competitor) and received rave reviews, including a thumbs up from us at IBTimes UK. Millions of pre-orders were taken following its unveiling as Samsung, it seemed, was nudging Apple from its perch, but the wind was swiftly taken from Samsung's sails when reports of exploding handsets came flooding in. Despite trying to stamp out the issue, the company has officially decided to discontinue the product, leaving Samsung with an estimated $17bn bill. With customers no longer being able to purchase or replace the Note 7 it will leave consumers shopping around for an alternative, making the iPhone 7 Plus a very appealing option. According to one analyst quoted by MarketWatch "Apple could potentially sell an additional 15 million units during the September quarter" as fallout from killing off the Note 7 continues.

NB: This is a viewpoint by Brendan Bourke, digital consultant at MTT, part of Travelport Digital. We now have mobile-only companies such as Uber, Hailo and HotelTonight; mobile-only communication platforms such as Whatsapp and Snapchat, a constant flow of new technologies – the Apple Watch, Samsung Gear, mobile payments (Apple Pay, Android Pay), virtual reality, augmented reality, bots, artificial intelligence – all of which are shaping new “mobile only” ways for airlines and TMCs to interact with the end-traveller. These changing technologies and pervasive behaviours are creating a myriad of new opportunities for airlines and TMCs to support, engage and empower their customers via sophisticated apps and mobile services. With mobile at the center of how we communicate and interact, it also must be at the center of the digital travel strategies of airlines and TMCs. But, with demanding, hyper-mobile customers and advances in mobile travel at every turn, keeping pace with this changing landscape and maintaining a sophisticated mobile experience is not an easy feat. To help airlines and TMCs to prioritize their strategy investments, MTT of Travelport Digital has devised The Evolution of Mobile (EVOM) framework. This framework enables airlines and TMCs to understand how they can manage and roll out their mobile investments more effectively and how to prioritize what they want to do on mobile, based on their key objectives for customer engagement and revenue generation. It also enables them to benchmark where they are at in their own strategy, and how they compare to that of their competitors. We have identified five pillars which create a structure for the evolution of mobile travel: 1) Foundation Getting the basics right. Focus on simplicity delivered beautifully. 2) Revenue- generating ROI from your app How to increase the value of every interaction with every customer via mobile. 3) Acquisition and engagement – ensure your customers find the app and keep coming back Build it and they will come? If only it was that easy! Getting a great app to market is the first step, making sure that your customers find and download your app needs investment and effort to ensure you get the engagement level that you want. 4) Owning the traveller – engagement at every step of the journey with personalized and timely mobile services Providing an end-to-end travel experience with great mobile travel services, on every device, across all touchpoints of the travel lifecycle is the key to maintaining ownership of the traveller. 5) Mobile first – staying above the paradigm shift The final pillar is about refining the mobile experience by constantly iterating and demonstrating a mobile-first mindset as well as introducing mobile firsts. To find out more about each of the five pillars of the Evolution of Mobile Travel, examples of how to succeed in each pillar, a look at what leading airlines and TMCs worldwide are doing at each stage, how to prioritize investments in each pillar and to hear about some of the next big trends impacting mobile travel – register now to join MTT’s webinar on October 27th,  The evolution of mobile travel: Where to invest next?

That 2016 variant is set to introduce the biggest set of changes yet to the MacBook Pro, but details are still largely thin on the ground. In this article, we’ll round up all the rumors and speculation about the MacBook Pro 2016. OLED Touchbar As aforementioned, the new MacBook Pro is set to bring with it a number of big changes, including most notably in the design department. According to the Week, there’s been one consistent feature rumored to be heading to the new MacBook Pro; an OLED touch bar. The MacBook Pro is widely perceived as having one of the best laptop keyboards on the market, but Apple could be about to improve on that even further. Recent leaks suggest that Apple plans to place a touch-sensitive strip above the keyboard, which would completely replace the function keys. The laptop will then be able to change that OLED display depending on what the user is doing. For instance, the bar could be used to track downloads or control music playback. The rumor is a pretty concrete one too, with Ming-Chi Kuo, one of the most accurate Apple analysts, saying the new OLED touch bar will represent one of the most significant and ambitious upgrades made by Apple. MacBook Pro 2016 Will Be The Most Colorful And Thinnest Apple Laptop Ever Madehttps://t.co/Msk4JK8yXD pic.twitter.com/tHhumg1pxS — iTechPost (@iTechPost) October 10, 2016 Thinner Design According to Gotta Be Mobile, the design of the MacBook Pro 2016 will generally be improved upon over recent models, which have followed a fairly similar design pattern. Ming-Chi Kuo has already said that he expects to see a thinner and more compact design with the new MacBook Pro, closer to that of the current standard MacBook and MacBook Air models. However, that could also mean replacing the MagSafe 2 charging port and other ports with standard USB connectivity — which Apple appears to be picking up with their laptops of late. That said, Apple is expected to keep their display variants the same. The new 2016 MacBook Pro is expected to be available in both a 13-inch and 15-inch variant, just as with previous models. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0kMsWkq6hc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> RELATED STORIES ON INQUISITR: New iMac 2016 Update Rumors: Release Date And Specs For Apple’s Latest All-In-One No Apple Watch 2 For U.K. Politicians: British PM Theresa May Bans Smartwatches From Cabinet Meetings New MacBook Air: What’s Next For Apple’s 13 Inch Laptop? 2017 Model Release Date, Specs And More More Power and Battery Life Whilst Apple appears to be placing a large emphasis on the external design of its upcoming MacBook Pro, that doesn’t mean they plan on neglecting what’s on the inside. Analysts are optimistic that Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro will provide more power and better battery life. It’s now pretty much a given that Apple will take advantage of Intel’s new sixth-generation Skylake processors with the 2016 MacBook Pro, which should provide a significant power boost. Those new Skylake processors would also allow for much better battery life. It’s also worth noting that Intel’s latest processors also allow for wireless charging, but Apple isn’t likely to take advantage of this. https://t.co/LjP669CKgP : #MacBookPro #Laptop – Macbook Pro 2016 Release Date, News & Update: Apple Looking to D … pic.twitter.com/uCT9a3jQbl — TREND GIZMO (@TrendGizmo) October 4, 2016 Announcement and Release So when will we know more about the new MacBook Pro? Apple is expected to hold its final keynote event of the year in the coming weeks. The company typically dedicates its third keynote to the Mac line of products, with this year’s event expected to feature a new MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac and Mac Mini. As it stands, the company is expected to have MacOS ready to utilize that aforementioned OLED touch bar by the end of October, suggesting that the company plans to have the new laptop on shelves by next month.

Why a third of Clinton supporters say Trump's victory is illegitimate Can Trump's children serve both his transition team and his business? The hardest part about making an apple cobbler is peeling the apples. Served with vanilla ice cream it's a winner every time. By Carol Ramos, The Pastry Chef's Baking October 11, 2016 Save for later Saved A simple apple cobbler. The Pastry Chef's Baking View Caption About video ads View Caption of Another great dessert for fall when apples are at their peak season. Apple cobbler is one of the easiest desserts to make – ever. Truly. The “hard” part is peeling and slicing the apples and that’s not very hard at all. Depending on your skill with a peeler and a knife, that might be the most time-consuming part of this recipe but after that, the rest is easy. This is my favorite cobbler recipe and technically, it wasn’t even supposed to be a cobbler. I just called it that for simplicity. The original name was Apple Crumble Bars and you were supposed to serve it as a bar cookie. But it works even better as a cobbler.  I’ve made this countless times since I first discovered the recipe but I haven’t posted about it every time I make it. It’s hard for me to take a good picture of cobbler. I don’t know why. I’ve tried and I’m not a good enough food photographer to stage the dish or a serving of it so that you can appreciate the perfect blend of tart apples (they don’t come out clearly enough under the streusel topping) supported by the crust (can’t see it clearly under the apple filling) and complemented by the sweet streusel. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream and you have a winner. Recommended: 15 apple dessert recipes Easy apple cobbler From Fearless Baking 15 apple dessert recipes Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend Crust and Topping: 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 cup powdered sugar 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar 6 ounces (1-1/2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces Apple Filling: 3 cups peeled and cored apples chopping into 1/2-inch pieces (about 3 large apples) (I ended up using 4 apples just to make sure there was enough) 1 tablespoon granulated sugar (I used 1-1/2 tablespoons) 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (I used 1-1/2 tablespoons) 1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.  Line a 9- x 9- x 2-inch baking pan with heavy aluminum foil that extends over two ends of the pan. Butter the foil that will touch the bars. (If you're not going to cut as bars, bake in a nice serving dish and omit the foil but lightly spray the bottom with nonstick cooking spray.) 2. Mix the flour, powdered sugar and brown sugar together in a medium bowl. Add the butter pieces, cutting them into the dry ingredients until they’re the size of peas and well-coated in the flour mixture. Remove 2 cups of the mixture and set aside.  Transfer the remaining mixture to the prepared pan and press it evenly over the bottom. 3. Mix the filling: Stir the apples, sugar, and lemon juice together in a large bowl. Stir in the raisins, if using. Spoon the filling over the prepared crust, distributing it evenly. Sprinkle the reserved crumbs evenly over the apple filling.4. Bake until the crumb topping is golden and the apples are soft when tested with a toothpick, about 55 minutes. Carefully lift the aluminum foil and bars from the baking pan.  Loosen the foil from the sides of the bars. Cut into 12 to 16 pieces. Serve warm, with vanilla ice cream, if desired.

Follow TechnoBuffalo iOS 10 has already been installed on more than half of all iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches, according to Apple’s latest adoption figures. The release was made available to the public less than a month ago, and it’s already at 54 percent. iOS 10 adoption is slightly slower than that of iOS 9 — which had been installed on 57 percent of devices by this time last year — but it’s still being picked up at an impressive rate, especially when you compare the figures to Google’s latest Android release. It’s also worth noting that iOS 10 is compatible with fewer devices, what with support for older products like the iPhone 4s and the iPad 2 bring dropped this year. Apple also seems to have been a little less aggressive about reminding users to upgrade this time around. The speedy adoption of new iOS upgrades is made possible by the fact that Apple provides its software directly to customers. Carriers and other partners don’t have any input in iOS, so each upgrade reaches all users worldwide at the same time. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Android, which is iOS’ biggest competitor. Thanks to so many hardware makers and input from carriers, Google’s latest upgrades are notoriously slow at making their way to users — unless you have a Nexus or Pixel device. For instance, Android 7.0 Nougat, which made its public debut back in August, is yet to appear in Google’s official Android adoption chart. Marshmallow, which was release last fall, has been installed on just 18.7 percent of devices so far. There’s no reason why you wouldn’t want to upgrade to iOS 10 if it’s available for your device. The upgrade brings big improvements and new features, including a revamped lock screen, redesigned Apple News and Music apps, and a terrific new Messages experience.

That 2016 variant is set to introduce the biggest set of changes yet to the MacBook Pro, but details are still largely thin on the ground. In this article, we’ll round up all the rumors and speculation about the MacBook Pro 2016. OLED Touchbar As aforementioned, the new MacBook Pro is set to bring with it a number of big changes, including most notably in the design department. According to the Week, there’s been one consistent feature rumored to be heading to the new MacBook Pro; an OLED touch bar. The MacBook Pro is widely perceived as having one of the best laptop keyboards on the market, but Apple could be about to improve on that even further. Recent leaks suggest that Apple plans to place a touch-sensitive strip above the keyboard, which would completely replace the function keys. The laptop will then be able to change that OLED display depending on what the user is doing. For instance, the bar could be used to track downloads or control music playback. The rumor is a pretty concrete one too, with Ming-Chi Kuo, one of the most accurate Apple analysts, saying the new OLED touch bar will represent one of the most significant and ambitious upgrades made by Apple. MacBook Pro 2016 Will Be The Most Colorful And Thinnest Apple Laptop Ever Madehttps://t.co/Msk4JK8yXD pic.twitter.com/tHhumg1pxS — iTechPost (@iTechPost) October 10, 2016 Thinner Design According to Gotta Be Mobile, the design of the MacBook Pro 2016 will generally be improved upon over recent models, which have followed a fairly similar design pattern. Ming-Chi Kuo has already said that he expects to see a thinner and more compact design with the new MacBook Pro, closer to that of the current standard MacBook and MacBook Air models. However, that could also mean replacing the MagSafe 2 charging port and other ports with standard USB connectivity — which Apple appears to be picking up with their laptops of late. That said, Apple is expected to keep their display variants the same. The new 2016 MacBook Pro is expected to be available in both a 13-inch and 15-inch variant, just as with previous models. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0kMsWkq6hc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> RELATED STORIES ON INQUISITR: New iMac 2016 Update Rumors: Release Date And Specs For Apple’s Latest All-In-One No Apple Watch 2 For U.K. Politicians: British PM Theresa May Bans Smartwatches From Cabinet Meetings New MacBook Air: What’s Next For Apple’s 13 Inch Laptop? 2017 Model Release Date, Specs And More More Power and Battery Life Whilst Apple appears to be placing a large emphasis on the external design of its upcoming MacBook Pro, that doesn’t mean they plan on neglecting what’s on the inside. Analysts are optimistic that Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro will provide more power and better battery life. It’s now pretty much a given that Apple will take advantage of Intel’s new sixth-generation Skylake processors with the 2016 MacBook Pro, which should provide a significant power boost. Those new Skylake processors would also allow for much better battery life. It’s also worth noting that Intel’s latest processors also allow for wireless charging, but Apple isn’t likely to take advantage of this. https://t.co/LjP669CKgP : #MacBookPro #Laptop – Macbook Pro 2016 Release Date, News & Update: Apple Looking to D … pic.twitter.com/uCT9a3jQbl — TREND GIZMO (@TrendGizmo) October 4, 2016 Announcement and Release So when will we know more about the new MacBook Pro? Apple is expected to hold its final keynote event of the year in the coming weeks. The company typically dedicates its third keynote to the Mac line of products, with this year’s event expected to feature a new MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac and Mac Mini. As it stands, the company is expected to have MacOS ready to utilize that aforementioned OLED touch bar by the end of October, suggesting that the company plans to have the new laptop on shelves by next month.

The Supreme Court Patent Infringement Case Explained By Lydia O'Neal @LydsONeal On 10/11/16 AT 8:00 AM Close Apple and Samsung, the two gadget makers who represented more than a third of the smartphone market as of the second quarter of FY 2016, have been locked in patent battles since the spring of 2011. The Supreme Court will decide, starting Tuesday whether Samsung Electronics copied a patent design component of the iPhone—and, by extension, whether Samsung will pay Apple all $400 million for doing so. As the case nears completion, here's what you need to know: SpecOut | Graphiq What did Samsung do? In April 2011, Apple first filed a patent infringement complaint against Samsung in a California district court, alleging the South Korean company’s Galaxy phones copied the iPhone’s “rectangular shape, the rounded corners, the silver edges, the black face and the display of 16 colorful icons,” as well as the design of its basic icons, its touch interface and even the product’s packaging. The complaint included similar claims that Samsung’s Galaxy Tab design and packaging followed the iPad’s footsteps a bit too closely. Samsung quickly fired back with a countersuit that Apple had imitated two of its software patents, igniting a war of two of tech’s biggest giants. Nearly five years later—after a trial, an appeal, a retrial, a $548.2 million fine paid by Samsung and a second Apple lawsuit, dubbed a “Pyrrhic victory” by The Guardian—the Supreme Court will decide whether Samsung can be further fined for using components similar to Apple’s in its Galaxy phones. What’s significant about the case, aside from the parties involved? Aside from the fact that the Supreme Court hasn’t heard an argument on a design patent case in more than 120 years, this case is important because of its long-term impact, Reuters reported. Related Stories Samsung Blocking Galaxy Note 7 Complaints? Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Leak Ahead Of Release Anyone who’s seen the two gadgets knows Samsung didn’t make an exact clone of the iPhone when it produced its line of Galaxy phones. The question is whether it copied certain parts of the iPhone, such as the icon grid and the bezel, or frame, which holds the glass in place. As Samsung put it, “Under this rule, an infringer of a patented cup holder design must pay its entire profits on a car, an infringer of a patented marine-windshield design must pay its entire profits on a computer, and so on.” If the Supreme Court decides in Apple’s favor, it could severely limit the tech industry’s ability to share innovations of portions of its products—and would likely give Apple further domination of the market. When will the saga be over? While the Supreme Court will begin hearing arguments Tuesday, a definitive ruling won’t come until June, more than six years after the start of the conflict.

Its own customers are unaware of its features, and even Steve Wozniak, Apple’s biggest booster, has called the company out over how it’s been executed. But now Apple’s got a bigger problem on its hands: Russian hackers might be breaching the watch’s security to spy on government officials. The Telegraph is reporting that, just like smartphones have been banned from UK cabinet meetings, the Apple Watch and other smartwatches have been given the heave-ho. The concern is that Russian hackers might spy on meetings using the Apple Watch’s microphone. (Although a Cabinet minister checking his email on the watch and accidentally serenading his colleagues with Beyoncé a few months back may also be a factor.) The UK government hasn’t reported any sort of vulnerability issue, but is taking a better safe than sorry approach. As goofy as it might sound, there’s genuine reason for concern. In recent months, Russia has been repeatedly accused of attempting to touch off a state-sponsored Cold War online, whether they’re breaching the DNC’s email servers in an attempt to find dirt, or leaking the confidential medical files of athletes as retribution for being banned from the Olympics. This may be in part due to the fact that hacking targets remotely has been much easier and less politically risky for Russia, though this may shift. It’s unlikely world governments will remain in a defensive posture if Russia keeps trying to breach their systems.

Samsung, it's high time to close the Galaxy Note 7 chapter Livemint 11-10-2016 Vishal Mathur Post the launch of the Apple iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus last month, one thing that has remained conspicuous by its absence is the usual debate between the Apple fans and those of an Android disposition—how the latest version of the Galaxy Note smartphone is perhaps better than the new iPhone. Well, mostly because the Galaxy Note 7 isn’t—it has the bad habit of spontaneously combusting, though some loyal Samsung fans, God bless them, insist it is more of an impromptu disintegration than an actual explosion involving fire and smoke and potential danger to life and property. Whether that pedantic explanation is meant to calm frayed nerves or not, an explosive smartphone is perhaps never a good idea. The point is very simple—do not buy a Galaxy Note 7, and if you have one, immediately turn it off and not use it for the time being. As per an official Samsung statement released earlier on Tuesday, the company suggests, “We remain committed to working diligently with appropriate regulatory authorities to take all necessary steps to resolve the situation. Consumers with either an original Galaxy Note7 or device should power down and stop using the device and take advantage of the remedies available.” It all started when, allegedly because of a faulty battery, the original Note 7 devices shipped globally started to catch fire without much convincing. There are as many as 70 documented cases of users reporting that their Note 7 smartphone decided to catch fire—this included a car being damaged by fire, because one of the offending Note 7 devices was being charged inside the vehicle at the time. This is when Samsung started a recall of the smartphone globally, though if we go by user accounts on social media, the device replacement process was anything but smooth—particularly if you had purchased your cherished Note 7 in another country. Samsung recalled 2.5 million phones in September, and then proceeded to assume that the replacement devices were perfectly safe. According financial data company Factset’s data released on 13 September, Samsung had already lost an estimated $26 billion in value since the explosive news about the Note 7’s bad habit of spontaneously combusting emerged. All through, it is Samsung’s severely lacking response, almost seemingly bordering on arrogance, is what is the most worrying. On 2 September, Samsung UK’s vague assessment is all that consumers have. It emerged that around 70% of the Galaxy Note 7’s original shipment’s battery packs are made by Samsung’s own SDI subsidiary. The rest of Note 7’s batteries are made by a Chinese manufacturer called ATL, and that only SDI batteries have the issues. And the Korean company hoped, amidst all the financial gloom, that it had solved the problem. But as it turns out, things became worse. The replacement units are also, as Samsung fans would like to say, suffering from a minor case of fire induced disintegration. One such case was reported on 09 October when a man living in the US city of Kentucky woke up to find his smartphone spewing smoke—this was a second replacement unit. A few days earlier, on 05 October, another replaced Note 7 smartphone started to introduce smoke and some flames into the immediate vicinity, on a Southwest Airlines aircraft. Shockingly, Samsung kept reiterating that it “cannot confirm” whether the replacement units were to blame, and while that is acceptable for a couple of days to let the company investigate the issue, it surely must have confirmed things by now. We would assume Samsung isn’t replacing the first batch of phones with newer phones that also pack in the offending battery packs, which are claimed to be the problem. Which means there is something else wrong with the Note 7, and not just battery troubles. And Samsung clearly doesn’t have a clue yet, else it would have been fixed. Can Samsung muster up a working Note 7 army in the third try? Might very much be possible, but it unlikely the consumers would trust the device enough to splurge money on it. The bigger fallout is on the brand value. Even more so if you also include the reported incidents of washing machines ‘disintegrating’—it is surely not easy to make a machine that is otherwise full of water, to explode! With airlines around the world treating almost all Samsung phones as equally guilty, that is just adding to Samsung’s woes. We tend to get a lot of queries from friends and family, a lot of which revolve around buying smartphones, and the mention of any Samsung phone elicits the same response at most times – “Samsung phones catch fire, I’ll not buy one”. Perhaps, the only real course of action now is for Samsung to refund every single Note 7 owner, irrespective of whether their phone has exploded or not (yet) and hope that it does the brand some good in terms of consumer sentiment. In the meantime, you can consider the Apple iPhone 7 Plus or the Google Pixel XL or even the super value OnePlus 3 for your big-screen smartphone requirements—none of them explode when they are in a bad mood.

How quickly times change. This time last year, the entire smartwatch ecosystem was still all about its potential as a genuine productivity, fitness, even style, gadget. Now that potential has been realized, and there is a purpose to having a smartwatch on your wrist. But no two smartwatches are the same, and the choice has just increased with the arrival of the new Apple Watch Series 2. We identify the best watches and the user demographic each is ideal for. Fossil Q Marshal Fossil Q Marshal Rs21,995 Who it works for: Those who want Fossil’s renowned quality in a smartwatch Popular watch-maker Fossil’s newest Q Marshal smartwatch runs Google’s Android Wear software. It has call and message notifications, apps and the ability to control music playback on your phone, for instance. The 45mm watch is water-resistant as well. The display size is 1.5 inches. The Q Marshal also has a variety of fitness-tracking features—something we know Fossil products do well, including the Misfit Shine 2 band. As with most Android Wear watches, expect one day of battery life on a single charge. The Fossil Q Marshal is challenging the Huawei Watch (Rs17,999). Asus ZenWatch 2 Asus ZenWatch 2 Rs13,990 Who it works for: First-time buyers Compared to the first ZenWatch in 2014, the ZenWatch 2 is truly a generational improvement. The square-ish dial with rounded edges looks classy. The stainless-steel ZenWatch 2 is lightweight, and the 1.63-inch display offers excellent visibility even in bright sunlight. The overall performance and experience of using a smartwatch is smooth, since there is enough power under the hood. If you want the first taste of smart wearables, this is one smartwatch to consider. Pebble Time Steel Pebble Time Steel  Rs12,799 Who it works for: For those who want the simplest smartwatch The Pebble Time Steel is much less complicated than Android Wear, and that is perhaps its biggest strength. Marine-grade stainless steel has been used with an oxidization-preventing physical vapour deposition coating, also used in aviation and automobile designs. The 1.25-inch, full-colour e-paper display has a Gorilla Glass layer to guard against scratches. It is not a touch screen; you will need to use the buttons on the sides to navigate the apps and menus. The latest software looks much more intuitive. It has all the smart features too—phone notifications, music playback control, fitness-tracking, and apps. The other big strength is the battery life—it lasts about three days on a single charge. Apple Watch Series 2 Apple Watch Series 2 Rs32,900 onwards Who it works for: Professionals, fitness enthusiasts, and the style conscious The latest arrival on the scene, the Apple Watch Series 2 runs a powerful S2 chip. It has a brighter OLED display, built-in GPS, smarter fitness tracking, and is now waterproof as well. The improved battery life makes getting through a day a lot easier. Depending on your activity levels, Watch sends you a notification to take a couple of minutes to relax, and monitors your breath and heart rate. The new dock makes access to apps easier and there is a significant performance improvement too. Like its predecessor, the Apple Watch Series 2 comes in the 38mm and 42mm sizes. Those who are upgrading from the first-generation Apple watch will be happy to note that all the straps will be compatible with the Series 2 as well. Fitbit Blaze Fitbit Blaze Rs15,999 Who it works for: Fitness enthusiasts The Blaze’s design blends a retro look with minimalist modernism and it weighs just 41g despite the solid metal frame. Fitness functions are the reason you would invest in the Blaze—the latest software update has made them even better and more accurate. The PurePulse heart-rate sensor allows it to monitor calories burnt more accurately than other smartwatches. The Blaze can also remind you regularly to get up and walk around. It has all the smartwatch notification functionality as well. The only niggle is that you need to take the watch module out of the frame every time you need to recharge it (battery life is about two days on a single charge). Buy this if fitness tracking is your primary motive. *Prices may vary Vishal Mathur Topics: Apple Watch Series 2Apple WatchFitbit BlazeAndroid WearFossil Q Marshal More from this Section Book extract: The Success Code Sudhir Shenoy: Running is a great equalizer Finding the fairy Godfather Film review: Before the Flood Review: Goa’s Thalassa comes to Mumbai Editor's Picks Dear prime minister, the buck stops with you Donald Trump’s brave new world in four charts Centre raises limits for cash withdrawals, currency exchange The growing breed of pet parents Cyrus Mistry sought to formalize Tata trusts’ say in group firms First Published: Tue, Oct 11 2016. 04 27 PM IST Latest News Asian shares mostly lower, Nikkei gets boost from weak yen India, China still have the best growth stories in Asia Indian markets closed on Monday for Guru Nanak Jayanti Editor's Picks Dear prime minister, the buck stops with you Donald Trump’s brave new world in four charts Centre raises limits for cash withdrawals, currency exchange Latest News Asian shares mostly lower, Nikkei gets boost from weak yen India, China still have the best growth stories in Asia Indian markets closed on Monday for Guru Nanak Jayanti Donald Trump hires Reince Priebus, Stephen Bannon for White House Narendra Modi holds meet to resolve demonetization woes Mint On Sunday The priceless legacy of P.L.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple wins an iPhone Camera Patent that Relates to Advancing its Zoom Functionality | Main | Apple Granted 43 Patents Today Covering a Next-Gen OLED Display, a Director's Digital Slate & More » October 11, 2016 Samsung Caves: Production of the Note 7 has been Permanently Discontinued   On August 31, 2016 Patently Apple posted our first report about the Note 7 problems surfacing in a report titled "New Samsung Note 7 Explodes During Charging." In total Patently Apple covered the Samsung Note 7 crisis in over twenty reports since that time. Today Samsung made it official in a brief sentence sent to the BBC: "Samsung permanently discontinues the production of the Galaxy Note7," as noted in our cover graphic. As the BBC phrased it, the note was "Short and not so sweet."   A second source confirming this is the Korea Herald who reports today that "Samsung Electronics on Tuesday said it would officially discontinue the sale and the production of Galaxy Note 7, hours after it halted all sales and replacements of the smartphones amid successive reports of overheating.   In a regulatory filing posted on 6 p.m., the tech giant said it has made a final decision to put the sales as well as the production of the smartphone to an end to ensure consumer safety.   Samsung is expected to suffer a significant blow from ditching its flagship phablet. Analysts offered bleak prospects for the firm's third-quarter earnings, stressing that the recent events could leave a big impact, such as damage to the Galaxy's brand value."   The Korea Times reports today that "Samsung Electronics said Tuesday that it will stop production, sales and replacements of its Galaxy Note 7 handsets, permanently ending production of the device amid persistent safety concerns over reported battery fires   Samsung said it will give a refund for the Note 7 devices until Dec. 31 on the Korean market. Those who exchange the smartphone with different Samsung models will receive a mobile gift certificate worth 30,000 won ($26.73).   "We decided to halt sales and production of the Note 7 devices over safety concerns regarding our customers," the company said in a regulatory filing.   The company and mobile carriers here and abroad will officially halt sales and distribution of replacement Note 7 devices. Samsung and regulatory bodies ― including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) ― are investigating the exact reasons for the fires.   Samsung said it will give a refund for the Note 7 devices until Dec. 31 on the Korean market. Those who exchange the smartphone with different Samsung models will receive a mobile gift certificate worth 30,000 won ($26.73).   "Samsung Electronics is still conducting an in-depth investigation into a series of reports that replacement Note 7 devices are also catching fire, but we made the decision due to concerns over customer safety," the company said in a statement. "Consumers with either an original or replacement Galaxy Note 7 device should power down and stop using the device.   The announcement came a day after the company temporarily suspended Note 7 production at its manufacturing facility in Vietnam that is responsible for its global shipments.   Korean Telecom Industry Braces for Impact of the End of Sales of Galaxy Note 7   In a secondary Korea Herald report posted today they noted that "Korea's three network carriers SK Telecom, KT and LG Uplus on Tuesday said that they have "stopped the sales of the Note 7, with plans to swiftly announce the subsequent procedures for full refunds or exchanges to different models.'   The refund and exchange procedures are expected to involve many complications as well, due to the sheer scale of the affected devices and the diverse domestic sales channels involved.   Considering that Samsung is the most-favored smartphone model among Koreans — Samsung accounts for around 70 percent of the Korean smartphone market — local carriers are likely to see a major plunge in sales in the latter half of this year and beyond.   'We had already experienced more than a 30 percent on-year drop in sales in August and September of this year largely due to the Note 7 recall. But it looks like it won't get any better,' one owner of a local cell phone retailer in southern Seoul told The Korea Herald.   While Samsung pulls its latest premium smartphone from the market and struggles to salvage its tarnished brand image, rival smartphone makers Apple and LG Electronics are expected to enjoy heightened interest from customers looking for alternatives to the Galaxy Note 7.   Meanwhile, US electronics giant Apple is slated to release the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in Korea on Oct. 21. Prices have yet to be made public. Expectations are high that local customers would choose to purchase a new iPhone in the absence of Samsung's latest smartphone.'"

Robin Murray News 11 · 10 · 2016 Robin Murray / / 11 · 10 · 2016 0 ANOHNI has expressed her regret at involving Apple in the making of the video for 'Drone Bomb Me'. The striking clip aired earlier this year, and featured a starring role from British supermodel Naomi Campbell. The production was completed in cooperation with Apple, but ANOHNI has now expressed a certain degree of unease at this aspect of the project. During an interview with the Creative Independent the artist explains: "Musicians have been stripped of the ability to effectively sell our music as an object. Now we are being herded into all these shady situations." Later, she says "I’m as guilty as the next person in having signed up for this" before focussing on the video for 'Drone Bomb Me'. "It was an experiment and a challenge for me. The record companies can’t afford to advance the whole cost for making the record anymore, let alone pay for an ambitious video. So after a lot of hemming and hawing I agreed to work with Apple on the video. I wanted the video to have a wider reach, and only Apple could offer me the resources to do so." "No one got paid to do that video except the hairdresser. The whole thing was done basically for free, just to make a product that we were then obliged to rent exclusively to Apple for a fraction of what they would had to have paid for it if they had framed it as an advertisement, which is of course what it was, though I didn’t want to admit it at the time." "My being bought as a politically outspoken artist is a more potent advertising tool for Apple than a 100 more explicit ads. It creates the false aura for Apple of being cutting edge, of being artist advocates, of being innovative mavericks, of being environmentally friendly, of caring about people and communities, instead of being the McDonalds of consumer high tech whose wealth was largely pilfered from what was once a biodiverse music industry." Closing her argument, ANOHNI says: "How brilliant is that? All of us pitching in as if we were working for a charity, and Apple, one of the biggest companies in the world, walks with an ad. I felt like a house cat that had been declawed. Those are the terms of engagement now in the music industry. We really get what we deserve. I am sure we are already at a point where we are forfeiting important artistic voices as a consequence of this." Check out the full interview HERE.

Business Market report: Bid war for chip designer piques City's Imagination Jamie Nimmo Tuesday 11 October 2016 11:22 BST Name in the frame: Samsung was named as a potential buyer of Imagination Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images Amid Samsung’s firefighting, Liberum analysts were fuelling speculation that smartphone chip designer Imagination Technologies might be a takeover target. Tech behemoth Apple, for which Imagination designs graphics chips, walked away from talks with Imagination in March. But the Takeover Panel’s rule which prevents companies from coming back to the table for six months has expired, leaving Apple free to reopen talks. The £24 billion takeover of chip-designer ARM Holdings by Japan’s SoftBank suggests Apple could face a scrap for Imagination, according to Liberum’s Janardan Menon. “We believe Imagination is an attractive and desirable acquisition target for a variety of companies in the broader technology sector,” the analyst said. He added that potential buyers include web giant Google, smartphone heavyweights Samsung and Huawei, and chip-makers Intel, Qualcomm, Spreadtrum, CEVA and  MediaTek. Tsinghua, which bought a stake in the company this year, was also named as a potential suitor. Menon suggested SoftBank’s pricey deal for ARM could be pave the way for more expensive takeovers. The speculation, along with higher forecasts on the back of stronger demand for the iPhone7 and a weaker sterling, boosted the shares by 16.75p, or 6.6%, to 271.75p — their highest level since 2013. The FTSE 100 flirted with record highs, up 11.29 points at 7108.79 — above its highest closing price by around five points, but just below the intra-day record. The market became more confident that struggling Pearson, up 8p at 820.5p, can avoid a profit warning when it reports on third-quarter trading next week. Investment bank Jefferies lent its support to the textbook publisher today, arguing that the shares look “cheap”. Victrex surged 129p, or 8%, to 1751p after a “good finish to 2016” for the high-performance plastics manufacturer’s car and plane parts business and a robust trading performance from its oil and gas division. Though the company said it was in line with expectations, JPMorgan said it was surprised Victrex managed to meet its targets. In a further sign that mining majors are turning their attentions back to junior explorers, Savannah Resources struck a new deal with Rio Tinto that will allow the pair to start work on their heavy minerals sands projects in Mozambique. Savannah rose 0.18p, or 4%, to 4.25p. Audioboom, which hosts a podcast show by comedian Romesh Ranganathan called Hip Hop Saved My Life, dipped 0.09p to 2.41p despite revealing that revenues in the third-quarter exceeded the total generated in the entire first six months of the year.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's iOS Adoption Rate Rockets to 67% in Under a Month | Main | Samsung Caves: Production of the Note 7 has been Permanently Discontinued » October 11, 2016 Apple wins an iPhone Camera Patent that Relates to Advancing its Zoom Functionality   Apple notes in one of their latest granted patents that the one camera feature in particular that is highly desirable in a portable camera is an optical zoom that will allow the user to frame and photograph high quality images of objects further from the camera. A zoom lens is a lens where the lens elements can be moved relative to one another to change the focal length of the lens. In doing so, this changes the field of view of the lens. Such lenses are typically much bigger than the space currently available for miniature cameras in mobile devices and Apple's invention addresses this issue. While it might not be the telephoto lens technology that perfected the iPhone 7 Plus's advanced zoom feature, today's granted patent may have played in role in the evolution of advancing this important camera feature for the iPhone.   Apple's newly granted patent covers their invention relating to a high quality zoom camera that fits in a competitive size.   Some embodiments reduce the size of the zoom lens by reducing the size of the image sensor illuminated by the lens. The optical quality is maintained by using three such smaller image sensors or sensor arrays, where the size of the light sensitive arrays of the three image sensors in aggregate is comparable to solutions with a single larger image sensor.   Some embodiments include a super-resolution resampling algorithm for use in miniature cameras that combines the information from three digital image sensor arrays, each substantially receiving different portions of the incoming visible light based on wavelength (i.e. receiving different colors).   In some embodiments, the method makes use of the natural small misalignments in the relative positions of the arrays that image the scene (appropriately measured and calibrated) in order to sample the scene at a higher spatial resolution than the native spatial resolution of each sensor array.   Apple's patent FIG. 7 noted above illustrates articulation of a set of image sensor devices with a light splitting prism for use in a camera for use in a portable multifunctional device; FIG. 9 depicts a ray trace of light through a light-splitting component of camera for use in a portable multifunctional device.   Apple's granted patent 9,467,666 was originally filed in Q3 2015 and published today by the US Patent and Trademark Office.   Patently Apple presents only a brief summary of granted patents with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each Granted Patent is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any Granted Patent should be read in its entirety for full details.
